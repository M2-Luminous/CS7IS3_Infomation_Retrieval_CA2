FR940930-0-00261 FR940930-0-00031 (5) In determining the eligibility of a mortgagor to participate in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure, the mortgagee shall arrange for the valuation of the property according to instructions issued by the Secretary, to assist in determining whether the property's as-is appraised value is at least 70% of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness (principal and accrued interest only) at the time application is made to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale. In cases where the appraised value is less than 70% of the outstanding debt, the mortgagee must obtain local HUD Office approval for a ``variance'' from this criterion before the mortgagor can be permitted to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure. (6) The offer to purchase the property should net HUD at least 87% of the appraised value of the property. However, the mortgagee may exercise discretion in cases where the net proceeds would be less than 87%, if the mortgagee believes that it would still be in HUD's best interest to permit the sale to occur. In such cases, the mortgagee must refer the matter to the Chief of Loan Management at the local HUD Office with the recommendation that the sale be approved by granting a ``variance'' in that case from the ``net proceeds'' criterion. Consideration Mortgagors who qualify for the pre-foreclosure sale procedure and who close an approved sale shall be able to retain from the sales proceeds before disbursement to the mortgagee, the base amount of $750 (seven hundred fifty dollars). In addition to the base amount, the mortgagor will be able to retain an additional amount of $250 (two hundred fifty dollars) from the proceeds of sale if the closing of an approved pre-foreclosure sale occurs within three (3) months of the commencement of the mortgagor's participation in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure (i.e., from the time the mortgagor is advised in writing that he may participate in the procedure), If, despite a good faith effort_as determined by the mortgagee_a property does not sell during the mortgagor's period of participation in the PFS procedure, the mortgagee will authorize a title search of the participant's mortgage for title problems and encumbrances (if one was not already performed during the period of participation). If any obstacles to obtaining clear and marketable title are resolved pursuant to instructions from the Secretary, the mortgagee will process a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure from the mortgagor. The mortgagee shall follow prescribed methods of processing the deed-in-lieu and will disburse consideration in the amount of $500 to the mortgagor upon completion of the deed-in-lieu transaction. This consideration is 100% reimbursable to the mortgagee through the FHA claims process. Other Provisions (1) All sales contracts submitted for consideration under the pre-foreclosure sale procedure shall contain a clause which provides that HUD approval (directly or through the mortgagee, as prescribed by the Secretary) is a pre-condition of the sale. (2) Purchasers in approved pre-foreclosure sales may qualify for FHA mortgage insurance. The Closing of the Pre-Foreclosure Sale; Payment of Claims Prior to closing the sale: (1) The mortgagee will provide to the Closing Agent a list of those parties entitled to receive financial consideration and the amounts payable out of sale proceeds. (2) The Closing Agent will calculate the net sale proceeds and communicate this data to the mortgagee, so that the mortgagee can ascertain that the actual terms of the transaction are in accordance with the proposed sale that the mortgagee had approved earlier. If the mortgagee approves the transaction, and closing occurs, the Closing Agent will pay the consideration set forth in the list previously provided by the mortgagee, and will send the net proceeds of sale and a form HUD&hyph;1 to the mortgagee. Upon receipt of the payoff funds, the mortgagee will file a claim for the balance due to it under the terms of the contract for insurance. In addition, an administrative fee of $1,000 will be payable, as part of the claim, to the mortgagee for each approved pre-foreclosure sale that goes to closing. Payment of this fee, which is not subject to debenture interest, will be made under the provisions of Section 204(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(a)), as amended by Section 1064 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100&hyph;628).
