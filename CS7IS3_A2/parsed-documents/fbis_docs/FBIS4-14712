It is clearly stated in them that, if politicians are unable to agree, the healthy part of the Abkhazian nation will deal with Ardzinba's hateful regime by force of arms for all the suffering caused and the tears and blood shed by its people. Unfortunately, there is, as yet, no reliable information regarding the authors of these statements and to what extent they represent an influential force. In any case, Vice Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili said, in his response to these statements, that he pins great hopes on the new movement, believing that a serious opposition to Ardzinba and his henchmen has appeared. Member of Parliament Boris Kakubava, leader of the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, holds a different view. In an exclusive interview to our paper, he stated that, in actual fact, no movement exists and, at best, it is represented by one person and he even knows who this is. Boris Kakubava called the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" a one-man show run by someone preoccupied with immediate interests. [Kakubava] One can hardly find a dozen Abkhazians today who do not feel intense hostility toward Georgians and Georgia. This hatred has been nurtured in them for decades and, moreover, not without help from the policies being conducted by Shevardnadze. From where could such an entire movement appear? I believe this movement was not created in Sukhumi, but here in Tbilisi with the aim of misleading the people and passing off desire for reality. It is possible this has been done with good intentions in order to pacify the hundreds of thousands of refugees: According to him, a split has already been noticed in Abkhazia and, along with this, the chance has appeared for the refugees to return to their native villages. I believe that the return of Georgians to Abkhazia is in the hands of the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, that is to say in our hands. No other forces will help us in this. [Kakabadze] Do you think that the Geneva negotiations hold any prospects or have they already lost their meaning? [Kakubava] All Georgia already knows my views regarding these negotiations. I still believe that the series of talks that has already taken place will harm Georgia's interests. It has come about that the peaceful community has learnt that there is an enslaved Georgian country called Abkhazia and that 1 percent of its population has won a war against the remaining 99 percent. We are so impotent that we ourselves cannot stand up for the integrity of our state and are asking anyone for help. We need neither UN troops nor the help of the world community, especially Russia, to get Abkhazia back. We need the world community and the United Nations for one thing only -- to protect us from Russia's interference in our internal affairs. This is our main problem; the rest we can do ourselves.
