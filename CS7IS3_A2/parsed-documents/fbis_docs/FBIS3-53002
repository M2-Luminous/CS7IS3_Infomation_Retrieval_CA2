They set up five subcommittees [as heard]: The Constants Committee; one to study and prepare a response to the president's speech; and one to propose solutions to the crisis. The subcommittees began their work as soon as they were named. The Yemeni news agency, SABA', has learned that contacts have been made with the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the Political Forces Dialouge Committee, and the Fact-Finding Committee. They were informed of the ulema's decision that each party and committee must send a representative to the ulema's meeting in al-Janad in order for them to air their views on the political crisis and its underlying causes and to propose solutions. The ulema are now waiting for the representatives to arrive, now that agreement of the parties and committees was obtained. SABA' has also learned that the ulema have promised to remain in the Mu'az Bin-Jabal Mosque until 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice chairman of the Presidential Council, shows up there. At today's ulema's meeting, many of their number voiced their opinions and made observations on the crisis.
