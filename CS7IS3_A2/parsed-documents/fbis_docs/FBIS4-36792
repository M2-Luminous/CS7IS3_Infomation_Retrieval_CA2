The following is the text of the press statement: On 6 June 1994, the BBC, British papers, and AFP carried my statement in which I call for placing Iraqi Kurdistan under UN trusteeship or making it a protectorate under the canopy of international peacekeeping forces. It is important for us to explain the following to the Iraqi people, the national opposition forces, and the governments involved: 1. The statement was interpreted by some people as a call to partition and divide Iraq. We deny this in part and parcel. The statement came as an attempt to find a description for the anomalous situation of Iraqi Kurdistan. Though the Western countries alliance provide protection and there is a local Kurdish administration, this administration suffers from the weak support of the foreign humanitarian organizations operating in the region and from the countries which are offering humanitarian aid, and also from the weak cooperation between it and these organizations and countries. This makes it less capable of tackling economic and security issues. 2. We are grateful for and highly value the protection the alliance countries afford through Provide Comfort and the efforts that UN agencies and foreign nongovernmental organizations exert. Had it not been for this protection and assistance, another humanitarian tragedy would have befallen the besieged and isolated Kurdish people. 3. Thanks to the peace efforts that were exerted by all good people, particularly the practical steps made by the Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC] center of operations, the Kurdish crisis was contained by the Kurdish leadership itself and the help of the UINC, and the cease-fire was entrenched. The process of normalizing the state of affairs continues. The dialogue and reconciliation between the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the other parties are in full swing to achieve comprehensive peace and to seek practical formulas for joint cooperation between the two sides in the future. 4. We support Iraq's unity, and our policy is constant in this respect and has not changed. We also carry out activities as part of the Iraqi opposition, represented by the UINC, and abide by its program and objectives of establishing a democratic and multiparty replacement that would achieve federalism within the framework of a unified Iraq. We firmly believe that the Kurdish problem should be solved within the context of the broader Iraqi problem. To avoid any ambiguities and obscurity we deemed it necessary to issue this press statement. Signed: Mas'ud Barzani, 9 June 1994
