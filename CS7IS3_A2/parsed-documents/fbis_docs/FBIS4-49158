Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo, made the remark during an inspection of the agricultural situation in east China's Zhejiang Province from April 26 to May 2. The vice-premier further explained that this grain price not only can help bring into full play the initiative of farmers in growing grain, but also can help lessen the difference between industrial products and farm produce, and urban residents can also bear it. Judging from the overall national economic situation, Zhu said, it is quite necessary for coastal areas to promote agricultural production, and there are brights prospects for doing so. During his inspection tour in Zhejiang, Zhu inspected grain purchasing centers, grain depots, grain shops, farmers' markets and the Grand Dike of Taihu Lake in the Hangjiahu area, visited several successful households specializing in growing grain, and listened to work reports of local officials, obtaining first-hand information about agricultural production, especially about the grain production situation and grain purchasing and selling system. The vice-premier also toured factories to see workers who were on duty on May 1 -- usually a day of leave -- and chatted with some factory leaders. Since Zhejiang province is one of China's important grain producers, especially the key grain production center of Hangjiahu plain, so grain production here can never be slackened, said Zhu. "From the perspective of China's land resources, total grain output and foreign exchange balance, the coastal areas should never neglect agriculture after they become economically prosperous. They cannot become dependent for food supplies on grain purchased at high prices from inland areas or on grain imports," he said. Active efforts should be made to probe into methods for carrying out agricultural management on a fairly large scale, said the vice- premier, expressing the belief that depending only on raising grain prices could hardly solve the problem of comparatively lower efficiency which grain growers face in these areas. He spoke highly of Zhejiang Province's practices in helping local specialized grain production households in their contracted management. The vice-premier visited several such households, each managing 10 hectares or more farmland and earning more than those working in the local township enterprises. He stressed that encouraging households to carry out grain production by contracting large stretches of farmland and developing agricultural management on a fairly large scale is in accordance with the household responsibility system and has proved to be quite effective. Therefore, it should be persisted in for a long term, he said. However, concentrating land use rights in the hands of large grain growing households should be conducted on a voluntary basis, said Zhu, while urging the vigorous development of socialized services for agricultural production and giving aid to such households in the forms of agricultural machinery, pesticides, seeds, technology and loans. The vice-premier focused his tour on the inspection of the grain purchasing and selling system. He stressed that reasonable grain prices should based on the supply and demand in the market but the market should be under the supervision of the government. He also stressed that state-owned grain departments should keep necessary grain so as to play the role of balancing grain prices. "Governments at various levels should adopt flexible measures to exercise management and control over the grain market, in a bid to maintain a basic stability of grain prices at the market," he said. He said that grain deals and allocation between different regions should be conducted through market under government control. Unqualified wholesalers must not be allowed to enter the villages and fields to force up grain prices, he added. The vice-premier also urged the arrangement of enough funds to ensure a smooth purchase of farm produce in the upcoming summer harvest. Talking about the shortage of circulating funds many industrial enterprises now face, Zhu said that the State Council had made some adjustment of credit policies concerning circulating funds of industrial enterprises so as to alleviate the difficulty of some state-owned enterprises and promote the transformation of enterprise management mechanisms in these enterprises. He believed that the problem of fund shortages would gradually be alleviated through concerted efforts of governments at various levels and enterprises themselves.
