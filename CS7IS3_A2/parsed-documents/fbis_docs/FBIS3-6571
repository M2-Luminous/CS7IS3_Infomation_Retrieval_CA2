The ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum also agreed to review progress of their work in another joint APEC conference to be held next year in Indonesia. "I have made numerous new friends this weekend (and) we have established new relationships that each of us can build on," U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in announcing the conclusion of the first APEC finance ministers conference. Bentsen, who hosted the two-day event, sounded upbeat about what he called a "congenial" meeting of the minds among the 18 Pacific Rim ministers who attended the conference at a scenic beachside hotel on this resort island. Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also echoed Bentsen's sentiment. It is most gratifying that we are able to conclude the meeting in this manner, Fujii told reporters. Growing tension in the U.S. trade relations with China and Japan did not appear to dilute the jovial, informal atmosphere of an outdoor joint news conference. "I am optimistic to work this type of concern out," Bentsen said when asked about China's threatened "most-favored-nation" (MFN) trade status with the United States. Bentsen also said the U.S. is likewise "hopeful" of working out its trade disputes with Japan. [passage omitted]
