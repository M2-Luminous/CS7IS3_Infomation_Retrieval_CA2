President Husni Mubarak and his aide Usamah al-Baz are the good guys who steer the peace process, mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, and dispatch messages of friendship to the other side of the border. In this relationship, the role of the bad guys is played by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and his assistant Nabil Fahmi, who heads the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks. These two lead the Egyptian effort to disarm Israel of its nuclear capability, waging a relentless battle against Israel in every possible international forum: the multilateral talks, the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency committees. The Egyptians want Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to divest itself of its strategic assets. If not at once, it should at least occur in agreed-on stages as part of an open political dialogue on nuclear issues. Cairo rejects the Israeli stand that the process should start with confidence-building steps by countries in the region, such as the creation of circles of communication and the laying open of military activities, and that the nuclear debate should be postponed until "due time," after peace arrangements mature and stabilize. [passage omitted] Musa's and Fahmi's inexorable stance is explained by personal and political motives: Both had worked for the United Nations in the past, during which time they embraced regional nuclear disarmament as a policy line -- which also happened to contribute to their personal promotion. The battle against Israel is explained also by Egypt's aspirations to lead the Arab world and its desire to show that even after the peace agreement, it remains the leading factor in the Arab quest for balance with Israel. Arab countries do not fully subscribe to the Egyptian line. The Palestinians do not fear Israel's nuclear potential, and neither does Jordan. The Syrians believe that territorial restitution and the solution of the Palestinian problem come before the nuclear disarmament of Israel, as Syrian expert Zuhayr Di'ab has recently written. The Gulf states are more concerned about Iran and Iraq. Egypt has thus failed to form an Arab bloc united in its refusal to sign the chemical nonproliferation treaty until Israel joins the NPT. The Gulf and Maghreb states adopted the U.S. line and joined the chemical treaty. Israel is not particularly worried about the confrontation with Egypt in the arms control talks. Israel is not interested in accelerating the arms control debates, and it adheres to its timeframe: first peace, and then the nuclear issue. Various Israeli elements reacted to the Egyptian stand saying that "they can say it 10 times a day," or that "they say they will go on talking, so we will listen and do whatever we deem appropriate." Yet the introduction of the nuclear waste issue into the environmental talks and at the steering committee talks infuriated Jerusalem, because it contravened an earlier Israeli consent to explain the problem at the bilateral talks. Some believe, however, that the battle for the deactivation of the Israeli deterrent power has a detrimental long-term impact on the peace process, because this attempt to divest Israel of strategic assets vital for its sense of security in an era of political concessions is forcing Israel to assume a self-defensive attitude. People who embrace this view find it difficult to buy the appeasing messages conveyed to Jerusalem by Usamah al-Baz. They point to the fact that Mubarak has given Musa full freedom of action in his nuclear war on Israel. In the meantime, the relationship with Egypt is going to be conducted with smiles on the peace tracks -- as if there was no nuclear issue, and with harsh confrontations on the arms control tracks, as if there was no peace process.
