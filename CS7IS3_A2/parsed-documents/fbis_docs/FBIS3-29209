On the morning of 14 February, the prime minister told reporters "I will think about (the cabinet reshuffle) after the formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget comes to an end." He then went into his office without confirming or denying the reports on the reshuffle, and has since continued behind-the-scenes coordination with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and other parties. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, contrary to what the prime minister said, expressed a negative view on an early reshuffle at a news conference. The issue of the reshuffle inadvertently revealed the differences between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary. While the reshuffle, originally planned by the prime minister for 15 February, has been postponed due to the SDPJ's opposition, sources close to the prime minister claim that "this will create serious ill feeling in the cabinet." At a news conference on the evening of 14 February, Takemura said "there is no indication at all" that a cabinet reshuffle "is forthcoming," denying the reports. However, he also stated, "(Whether or not to reshuffle the cabinet) is the prime minster's problem. Please ask him directly." Such a comment at the chief cabinet secretary's news conference was very unusual. It seems that Takemura's attitude was due to the fact that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito's attempt to "remove Takemura" was allegedly behind the talk of reshuffle, and he was irritated with the fact that the prime minister had not conveyed his thinking directly. Meanwhile, the prime minister stayed in his office all day on 14 February, although he attended a meeting of leaders of the government and the ruling parties at noon. Queries from reporters were met with the same reply over and over again: "I am not thinking about it before the budget is finished." However, he nodded to the question "are you thinking about a reshuffle at all?" He even stressed that he was "giving consideration" to a reshuffle on 15 February, all along taking an ambiguous attitude in public. The prevailing view among sources close to the prime minister is that "the prime minister himself strongly desires to reshuffle the cabinet at an early period; he has floated a `trial balloon' to see the reaction of members of the administration and the ruling parties."
