Many politicians and sociologists believe this region to be the domain of Leonid Kuchma, that is why Leonid Kravchuk and his team are going to face strenuous work with the Kharkov electorate. One cannot rule out that the visit to the former Ukrainian capital was to some extent prompted by the need to talk to local administration head Oleksandr Maselskyy whose name was included in the "secret lists of presidential candidates." In the course of his visit to one of the largest Ukrainian oblasts, Leonid Kravchuk met with the managers' corps of agricultural machine-building enterprises, agrarians, and workers of the gas complex. It is quite natural that under the extraordinary circumstances -- it is not every day that the head of state comes on a visit -- complaints, requests, and suggestions were received and, in some cases, passed for consideration to the National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, Minister of Agriculture Yuriy Karasyk, Minister of Economy Anatoliy Holubchenko, and other accompanying members of the president's apparatus. The state leader did not omit political issues. He paid lip service to the new Supreme Council adding that the latter would be unable to resolve any serious issues: "All they can do is squabble." He hinted that deputies, absorbed in political battles, have no time to think of the people. He said that he was sorry to see the few good things that have been created, turning to dust: "We introduced the post of presidential envoys in the provinces. Hardly have these people managed to gain weight when a hue and cry was raised: `That post is a hindrance, let us go back to the past.' Meanwhile, they mean a worse version of this `past'." He criticized those political forces that make profits on speculations about people's hardships: "So far, I have not seen people in Ukraine who either starve or wear rags." Mr. Kravchuk called on the Kharkov residents to go to the ballot and elect professionals with statesmanlike mentality. Leonid Kravchuk rejected the claims that he is blocking the process of restoring economic ties with Russia, saying that Ukraine has acceded to all the appropriate CIS documents and signed all the necessary agreements with Russia. Those agreements do not yield results simply because mechanisms for their implementation do not exist and "everybody is upholding their own interests." Those "ardent internationalists" that accuse Leonid Kravchuk of being a nationalist, do this just to win cheap prestige. The president pointed out: "With regard to the economic union with Russia, I have no powers to sign it for there exists an appropriate Supreme Council resolution. I should not be blamed for this. Once the legislature rescinds its reservation I will sign an agreement." Leonid Kravchuk bitterly criticized the idea of a Slavic union and deemed the plans to form this kind of structure a provocation and an attempt to change the borders and thus, cause a war.
