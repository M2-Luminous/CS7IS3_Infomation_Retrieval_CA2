Over the past few years China has contracted various projects in industry, agriculture and the service industries, including oil refineries and textile factories. China's overseas services industry began almost at the same time as the reform and open policies were initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before this, China used to render free labor services abroad, the official said.
