The bill would be paid at the end of the embargo decreed by the United Nations after the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. "For the moment, importing Spanish medical supplies in the amount of 1.45 billion pesetas would be sufficient to meet our needs," said Iraqi Minister of Health Umid Midhat Mubarak in an interview with this newspaper. "We are optimistic with respect to Iraq's future, but now we need our friends. As the Orientals that we are, we never forget those who are with us in difficult moments," Mubarak added. Although the UN embargo allows Iraq to import medicines and other civil goods essential for the population, the prohibition against oil exports leaves Iraq without the hard currency needed to pay for such imports. The funds that were frozen in several Western countries under the embargo--with the exception of those related to oil and its derivatives, which were transferred into a UN account--have been slowly unfrozen to pay for exports of goods of humanitarian nature, and in many cases these funds have been exhausted. According to Mubarak, there are more than 1.5 billion pesetas still frozen in Spain. The Iraqi Embassy in Spain reduces that figure to "some 300 million pesetas," belonging to two Iraqi banks. And Jose Ramon Baranano, assistant director of the Spanish Foreign Ministry's International Economic Relations Section, asserts that Iraq "now has not a single frozen peseta left in Spain." Searching for Formulas With or without funds, what the Iraqi government suggests is that Spain "find formulas, because they do exist, to prevent suffering by the Iraqi population." "We do not want to manufacture weapons, we want to keep people from dying," asserts the minister of health. Data compiled by UNICEF are hair-raising: Infant mortality has tripled; 80 percent of the children are born with less than normal weight because of the mother's malnutrition. Hospital occupancy has dropped to approximately 30 percent. "Without medical supplies, people do better remaining home." And of the 200 ambulances existing in 1990, only 37 throughout the country are in operation. "We have run out of tires and batteries, and as one breaks down, we use its parts to fix another." The Spanish Government says that it "understands" Iraq's problems, but argues that the Security Council allows no margin of maneuver whatever, forbidding any type of credit, even if it is for humanitarian reasons. Diplomatic sources assert: "We are complying with UN regulations, and we hope that Iraq continues to show its willingness to cooperate, as it has been doing lately, so that the embargo may be lifted the soonest possible." Fearing that the United States may veto the lifting of the embargo even though it may be fulfilling the requirements of UN resolution 687 (forbidding Iraq to sell oil until the UN ascertains the dismantling of its mass-destruction arsenal, and to install an anti-arms warning system), Baghdad meanwhile is seeking alternatives and is offering "large future compensations" to those enterprises that may take the chance of "delivering today and collecting tomorrow." "We have already signed some substantial agreements with several European enterprises. Spanish companies should not lose this opportunity to cash in on lucrative profits in a not too distant future," says Umid Midhat Mubarak.
