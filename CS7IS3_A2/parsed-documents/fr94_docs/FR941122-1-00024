FR941122-1-00024 FR941122-1-00002 This rule proposes to include the provisions of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) regarding the household option to use a standard or actual costs in revised ยง273.9(d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also adds a provision requiring State agencies to give households that move the option of actual expenses or a standard utility allowance based on circumstances at the new address. When a household reports a move, it would be the State agency's responsibility to redetermine the household's entitlement to a standard and give the household the opportunity to choose between actual costs and the standard, if the household is entitled to the standard. Households that report a move would be granted the standard on the same basis as applicants. If the household anticipates that it will receive LIHEA or incur out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses during the next heating or cooling season at the new address, it would be allowed use of the standard. The household's choice of a standard or actual costs when it moves would not be considered a switch. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(iii)(C) provide that the State agency may mandate use of the telephone allowance even if actual telephone costs are higher. This provision was included in the regulations because of the concern of State agencies that use of actual telephone costs would be extremely error-prone. We believe that use of an adequate telephone standard increases the administrative efficiency of determining a household's excess shelter expense without any significant adverse effect on households. Therefore, we are proposing to retain the provision of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(v)(C) concerning the telephone allowance and incorporate it in revised ยง273.9(d)(6)(iii). d. Prorating standard utility allowances. Under section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act, State agencies are required to prorate a heating or cooling standard among households that live together and share the heating or cooling expense. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(viii) require State agencies to prorate a standard allowance among households that live together and share utility expenses. It is not clear in the regulations whether proration is limited to the heating or cooling standard or whether other standards, such as a telephone standard, must also be prorated among the households contributing to the payment of the utility cost. Questions have arisen concerning proration of a heating or cooling standard when one household pays for heat, for example, and another household pays for the water. We believe it is equitable to prorate any standard among the households sharing the expense included in the standard. The current provision indicates that if the State agency is unable to accurately determine the pro rata share of utility costs paid by the parties, the State agency may use the actual utility costs paid by each household. The regulations provide that under no circumstances shall the total amount of utility costs used to determine the amount of the deduction exceed the total amount of actual utility costs for the residence. Under this proposed rule, households would be able to share a standard or claim actual verified costs. They would not be allowed to use a combination of these methods in claiming a deduction for utility expenses. That is, State agencies could not allow one household to claim a share of the utility standard and allow another household sharing the expense to claim actual costs. We believe that allowing a combination of actual expenses and a share of the standard is burdensome on State agencies.
