This is due to the fact that the lives of the Israeli occupiers in the Strip turned has into a nightmare as a result of extensive and effective Palestinian resistance operations, and the Palestinian people's confrontation of the occupation troops as one rank. All of a sudden, the situation changed completely, for the secret Oslo talks have produced an agreement called the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Then, as a result of the Palestinian side's commitment to halting struggle, the Palestinian people found themselves chased by the same Israeli troops they used to pursue. Thus, the number of Palestinians either killed or wounded begun to increase rapidly. Israel has declared openly that its troops have the right to end terrorism and destroy terrorists. By this, it means the intifadah and its people. It implemented this on the ground by having its regular forces and the underground units began to fire indiscriminately on everyone. In fact, Israel claimed that it was helping the Palestinian side, which was involved in signing the Oslo agreement, to restore security and stability to the occupied territories. The settlers also moved and conducted patrols. The killings escalated in a manner that raised the concern of the Palestinian people both inside and outside the occupied territories. Later, Israel perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook the world. It repeated this action by perpetrating the Jabaliya camp massacre in the Gaza Strip yesterday when the underground units, or the death squads, fired at a number of intifadah youths, killing six and wounding many others. Even the Fatah Hawks themselves have not escaped the Israeli escalation, for several of them were either killed or wounded. It is clear to every Palestinian and Arab citizens, as well as to any international observer, that Israel used the Oslo agreement as a pretext to settle accounts with the Palestinian people. It has exploited the grave imbalance this agreement has created in the Palestinian and Arab arenas as a result of the Palestinian side's deviation from Arab consensus and the bases of the peace process, and its involvement in a distorted partial settlement. This has opened an endless labyrinth of darkness. The Gaza-Jericho accord has not led to Israel's withdrawal from Gaza or from Jericho, but to the tightening of the Zionist grip around the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. Moreover, the negotiations stumbled and the Israeli withdrawal seemed to be a very complicated and difficult process. After Gaza and Jericho, where the situation is becoming intensely volatile and the suffering is growing, the Israelis dragged the Palestinian side into discussions on the security of the city of Hebron. The security of Ramallah, Tulkarm, Janin, or Nabulus will also rise in the future. Amid these divided talks, which are very far from the crux of the peace process and its bases and objectives, the Israelis have succeeded in distracting the world's attention from the true nature and contents of the conflict. The issue has changed from one of a people whose land was occupied and rights were usurped, into an issue of security, which Israel proposes to tackle by conducting patrols, of course under its officers command, by the Israeli Army and the proposed Palestinian police. UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which were adopted as a basis for the peace process, are clear and call for Israel's full withdrawal, and not for the establishment of a limited autonomy. The Madrid conference was held on clear bases and on the land-for-peace formula in order to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement on all the fronts of the conflict. Syria, supported by the Arabs, has always abided by the demand of a just and comprehensive solution and a full Israeli withdrawal. However, the Palestinian side's deviation from the bases of the meetings of Damascus, Beirut, and Amman, and from the agreed conditions of peace, has not only weakened the Arab position, but it has also brought catastrophes to the Palestinian people, increased Israeli intransigence, and involved the Palestine question in endless labyrinths. Certainly, Israel's massacres will not end with the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre or yesterday's massacre in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian people will be exposed to further catastrophes and setbacks under the cover of futile negotiations that will bring nothing to the Palestinians, regardless of the names they take, other than entrenching occupation and usurpation. Getting rid of this Israeli labyrinth cannot take place by going deeper into it, but by returning to the pillars of the just and comprehensive Arab peace, Arab unanimity, and to full coordination with the brothers, by abiding by the UN Security Council resolutions and the agreed-upon bases of the peace process, and by uniting the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories.
