[passage omitted] "We also discussed the situation in Sarajevo and agreed on the need for the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] neutrality and restraint, and the warring sides' self-control. We included this in the discussion on a global cease-fire which the Serb side underlined as being in its interest -- something I also discussed with Haris Silajdzic," Akashi said. The UN secretary general's special envoy assessed today's talks as "a good basis for making progress in the peace process," adding that he thought "progress might be achieved in the near future." In reply to a reporter's remark that the Muslim side is complaining about the presence of the Serbian militia in the Gorazde exclusion zone, Karadzic said that the United Nations will be controlling the militia and that UNPROFOR has already assumed responsibility for the job. This was confirmed by Yasushi Akashi. We agreed that the police will be performing its tasks under the supervision of UNPROFOR and our civilian police, Akashi explained. Replying to questions about a recent armed clash between UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska army near Tuzla, Akashi said that this incident was discussed in great detail. "We presented our version of the event and heard the Serbian version, agreeing that similar situations should be avoided in the future and that things should be resolved at the local level," Akashi said. It was also agreed at the Pale meeting that members of UNPROFOR's British battalion -- who have been stranded in Rogatica for several days now -- should be allowed through to Gorazde under conditions acceptable to both sides.
