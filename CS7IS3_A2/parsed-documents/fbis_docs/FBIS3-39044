Others call them "the middle ground" because their profile reflects the image of the average voters. However, almost all admit that these are the voters who give the victory to the party they choose. This is why they are the "prize to win" among parties. What makes them attractive is mainly the fact that they are increasingly in evidence. The last poll conducted by the ALKO organization after the elections (from 5 to 12 December among 1,200 voters over age 18 residing in the Attiki basin) shows that about one in four voters (24 percent) are on the same wave length. Moreover, they are the voters on whom the final outcome usually depends. Poll results are characteristic: some 77 percent of this group of voters chose the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. A total of 12.1 percent voted for Political Spring and only 8 percent went with the New Democracy [ND]. The ALKO research also confirmed the "move" by showing that among ND voters who went over to PASOK in the last elections, 59.5 percent belong to the group that calls itself "centrist." The corresponding number who went over to Political Spring is 10.8 percent. The "success story" of this type of voters within the parties' political strategy offices is therefore not at all strange. What They Believe They call themselves "centrists," but also distance themselves from ideologies. They want "lower tones" in politics, consider quality-of-life issues very important, do not reach early political conclusions and ask for an economic policy as realistic as possible. According to ND deputy Y. Karatzaferis, "they are the voters who elect a government." "In the last elections, they gave the victory to PASOK," agrees K. Karamanlis, responsible for political planning in the ND, who emphasizes that the importance of this group of voters as far as political strategy is concerned rests on the fact that it is loose and more easily movable. PASOK deputy D. Beis even calls them "snipers," since "they first criticize the government and the opposition and then decide for whom they will vote." [passage omitted] "Middle Ground" Karamanlis chooses a different terminology. "We are not talking about the center. This is a term selected by pollsters to facilitate their task. We could talk about a `middle ground,' even if this is an oversimplification." According to K. Skandhalidhis, minister of the Aegean and member of the PASOK executive bureau, "this is a combination of social groups coming from different starting points: the new technological and economic strata, groups who choose their position strictly on the basis of their economic situation and are constantly becoming larger in recent years, a segment of the undecided voters, and large strata of the new generation who are not inspired by the general situation of the political system." Karamanlis separates them into two basic subcategories: "Older persons from 35 to 45, who in the past belonged, to a great extent, to the wider leftist space, but are presently maintaining a critical stance, and younger persons unrelated to parties who are generally apolitical." The Majority The "middle ground" is also the result of the demographic profile of this group, which apparently resembles the profile of the general population: a few more women than men (53 percent compared with 47 percent), a few more people 55 to 64 than in the general population, a few more individuals with an elementary education (31 percent compared to 24 percent). However, if we add the percentages for all ages under 55, there are more younger individuals. Meanwhile, what do these voters say about the group? Despite considering themselves "centrists," when asked what the nature of economic policy ought to be, they answer that it should be "far from ideologies." However, if pressed to choose an economic policy, they opt for a socialist system (33 percent), with only 5 percent choosing a market system. With Maturity This guarded stance is also apparent when they are asked what they think of the government's economic measures. Some 43 percent answer that it is still too early to judge, while 42 percent say that they trust it. However, their opinion becomes even more apparent when they are asked to prioritize the country's problems. Even if they list them in the same order as the general population, differences in the degree of interest are telling. The so-called middle ground seems to be more interested in issues of health, insurance, education, and quality of life. Respondents who see themselves as "centrists" selected the economy as the most important problem (79 percent), followed by foreign policy (57 percent), health/insurance (52 percent), education (45 percent), quality of life (29 percent), public administrtion (10 percent), institutions (8 percent), culture (5 percent), and decentralization (4 percent).
