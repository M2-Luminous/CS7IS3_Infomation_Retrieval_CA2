Thus, Moscow branch directors of a leading Novosibirsk bank -- the Siberian Trade Bank -- on 5 June signed an agreement with the Russian Paratroopers Command effectively establishing the bank's "sponsorship" of the paratroopers. The agreement between the Siberian Trade Bank and the paratroopers envisions, in particular, preferential bank servicing and crediting of the paratroopers subdivisions and individuals as well as the provision of financial assistance to officers' families. The agreement establishes among the basic targeted programs "financing by the bank of house and apartment construction for officers transferred from neighboring states, civilian training courses for retired military, and also assistance to military servicemen, and their facilities, who have found themselves in extreme conditions." For their part, the paratroopers undertake to train personnel for the bank's security service. This agreement with the paratroopers is the first action by the Siberian Trade Bank Moscow branch. Such an unusual beginning of the branch's activity is quite explicable. With tough competition on the Moscow financial market, regional banks are hard put to make a name for themselves here by confining themselves to providing "common" banking services to their clients.
