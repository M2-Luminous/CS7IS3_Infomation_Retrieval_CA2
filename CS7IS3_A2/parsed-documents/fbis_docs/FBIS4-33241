They also found out that Brazil has become one of the largest Latin American fiscal havens. Subdivisions of the PC scheme could be identified in nearly 200 large companies. To get an idea of the mountain of money that circulates in the arteries of this suspicious system, it is enough to cite three foreign financial and exchange companies being investigated: America, Guarani, and Amambai. These three companies conducted operations in Brazil in 1991 and 1992 totalling more than $7 billion. Bank Secrecy The Cambio America S.A. company, which is headquartered in Panama, operated through its 0673-35-000069/3 account with the Foz de Iguacu branch of the Sao Paulo State Bank [Banespa] and moved more than $2 billion from February 1992 to December 1993. The only explanation the police have so far about the origin and destination of this money is contained in the bank balance sheets obtained after bank secrecy on the account was lifted. The Guarani Cambio S.A. company, from Paraguay, used account number 0237-02-018-05 of the Ponta Pora (Mato Grosso do Sul State) branch of Bamerindus and has operated with as much as $4 billion. The Amambai Cambio S.A. company, which police suspect is linked to Guarani Cambio S.A., has deposited more than $1 billion in its account number 0237-17-731-10, also at the Bamerindus Ponta Pora branch. The three companies were created outside the country to purchase and sell foreign currency, gold, silver, and any kind of exchange operation. In the Central Bank [BC], however, there is no request for operations in their name. The only data on them is the bank register. "There is strong evidence that they supplied funds to ghost accounts and `oranges' (people who lent their names for illicit transactions). These details were unveiled during investigations into the PC case," a PF source reported. The first inquest on the Alagoas State-born businessman was opened two years ago. Currently, this number has increased to 40. Police now want to identify what other operations these enterprises have conducted in Brazil. Pursuit The three financial companies were identified during the banking investigation of Cross Financial Corporation and Accent Financial Corporation, which are headquartered in the Virgin Islands' fiscal haven. The Cross and Accent companies operated with an estimated $150 million. Also included among the PC scheme companies is Kenaco Finance from Panama. According to the BC investigation, this company operated through an account in the Sao Paulo branch of Lloyds Bank and sent $1 billion abroad in 14 months. The account trustee was Uruguayan Salomao Sapov Kaplan, whose preventive arrest has been decreed in Brazil as a result of his involvement in the PC scheme. Kaplan has been missing and the PF believe he is a "professional orange" who operated in several countries. Two other trustees of CC-5 (Circular Letter No. 5, which was created by the BC to allow foreigners to receive and send dollars abroad) accounts, from the Cross and Accent companies -- Ezequiel Amaranto Camerini and Roberto Carlos Dias Sosa -- are also being sought in Brazil. A few days ago, they asked the courts to revoke their arrest warrants so they could return to the country, but Judge Pedro Paulo Castello Branco of the Brasilia 10th Federal Court denied the request. According to the PF, evidence indicates that the flow of suspicious money between Brazil and foreign countries may total 20 percent of the volume of foreign trade operations. Of this total, the PC scheme operations were a minority. Nearly 700 companies registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission are using the legal instrument represented by the CC-5 in the country. So far, most of them have not created problems for the government. Although police have barely begun uncovering a portion of the network, there is strong evidence that the origin and destination of these dollars may clash with several articles of the Penal Code. Genealogy The 270,000-page pile of the so-called mother inquest into the PC case has resulted in the opening of 81 more PF inquests -- 40 are related to the PC scheme and the rest to suspicious activities by other enterprises. As a result of the new investigation, 255 people have been indicted. They range from former President Fernando Collor to the so-called "oranges." The federal courts have suspended bank secrecy on more than 300 cash accounts, 70 of them fictitious and opened in the name of 50 ghosts. Another policemen remarked: "We do not know where the investigation will lead us, but we are certain we have uncovered the activities of a network that has operated for years without being controlled." The network's discovery also has allowed the PF to investigate CC-5 accounts in more detail. These accounts feed the parallel dollar market and practically the overall clandestine system, which is directly linked to the fiscal havens. In these havens, a delicate method is used to make identification as difficult as possible. One of the operations detected by police shows that a $1.2 million remittance by a company named RAS Holding left Luxembourg on 26 May 1993, passed by the Indo-Suez Bank in Switzerland, an account in the Virgin Islands, and two days later already had been made hidden and distributed among the accounts of two Brazilian companies, the names of which are being kept secret.
