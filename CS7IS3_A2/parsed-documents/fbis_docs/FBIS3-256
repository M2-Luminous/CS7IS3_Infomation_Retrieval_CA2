Speaking in Roodepoort last night, Dr. Hartzenberg said the latest concessions by the ANC [African National Congress] and the government still were not enough. [Begin Hartzenberg recording, in Afrikaans] We say up till tonight nothing has happened, nothing at all, to make it possible or necessary for us to change our decision not to take part in their election. Nothing has happened, nothing at all. Mr. Chairman, by participating in the election, we will only be helping to give it legitimacy. We will be helping to give it credibility. What's more, we will become party to subjecting our people to a communist government. And as I said, Mr. Chairman, that constitution and that South Africa will not be tenable. Let us not be party to keeping it artificially alive. We must do everything possible to bring about its collapse as soon as possible. [end recording]
