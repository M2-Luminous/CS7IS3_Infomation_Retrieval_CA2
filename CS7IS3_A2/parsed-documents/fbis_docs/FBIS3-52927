Iraqi National Turkman Party leader Muzafer Arslan, who held a press conference Tuesday, said an "autonomous region for the Kurds of northern Iraq" was not acceptable. "If such a right is given to Kurds, it should also be given to Turkmans," he said. Responding to press allegations that "the establishment of an internationally guaranteed Kurdish autonomous region was under consideration," Arslan signalled his opposition, saying: "We do not support any solution that is for the Kurds alone. If autonomy is to be given to Kurds, it should also be given to Turkmans. If a federation is to be established for Kurds, why not for the Turkmans? The autonomous system has been practised in Iran before -- it did not work. Why should it be tried again?" Emphasizing that his party's goal was "to ensure that the Turkmans should benefit from the same rights as the Kurds," Arslan said he would stress this once more to Turkish Foreign Ministry officials before the tripartite summit. "All interested parties, from Turkey to Iraq's neighbors and to Western powers, including the United States, support the territorial integrity of Iraq," Arslan said. Asked about the upcoming Turco-Iraqi meeting, which is expected to take place shortly as the "highest level meeting between the foreign ministries of the two countries," Arslan said: "Turkey is a sovereign state and can choose to hold a meeting with any country it likes. But what is important is that the rights of the Turkmans should be discussed. The Foreign Ministry officials, with whom we are in constant touch, say they are doing just that. But we have heard no declaration to that effect." Arslan suggested that observers, under the U.N. supervision and with the contribution of Turkey, should be placed in the Turkman zones. "We are subjected to the inhuman treatment of the Iraqi government," Arslan said. "Iraqi soldiers enter Turkman homes. Eight Turkmans were recently executed in Karkuk three weeks ago." Embargo Should Be Lifted Arslan said the embargo should be lifted as Turkmans were the ones who most suffered as a result of it. "It is clear that the embargo has not been particularly successful in weakening the Saddam regime," he noted. "We have continuously pushed for the lifting of the embargo, but it is not up to us. So all we say is the humanitarian needs of the people should be met." Despite various allegations that the aid sent to northern Iraq did not benefit the Iraqi Turkmans, Arslan maintained that this was not the case. "There is a Turkman in the aid delivery teams. The aid is not enough, but it reaches us," he said. Ankara has allocated 13.5 million dollars worth of humanitarian aid to northern Iraq.
