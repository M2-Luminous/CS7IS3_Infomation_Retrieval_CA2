National Police sources provided this information. They indicated that antinarcotics operations in the Upper Huallaga as well as in the mountain ranges of the central jungle have been temporarily suspended because of a lack of these helicopters. Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said the helicopters are a great help in transporting police personnel, as land transportation is very difficult in the jungle due to ambushes by narcoterrorists. A spokesman for the National Police said that despite this inconvenience, operations are carried out, but not as many.
