The following did not sign the Treaty: N.Ye. Vinogradov -- chairman of Vladimir Oblast Legislative Assembly; A.M. Tuleyev -- chairman of Kemerovo Oblast Legislative Assembly; G.A. Zyuganov -- chairman of the "Communist Party of the Russian Federation" faction. The following signed the Treaty with reservations: M.Sh. Shaymiyev -- president of the Republic of Tatarstan; A.Kh. Galazov -- president of the Republic of North Ossetia; Yu.G. Biragov -- chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia Supreme Soviet; F.Kh. Mukhametshin -- chairman of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet; V.Ye. Veshnyakov -- chairman of Chita Oblast Duma; N.M. Semenenko -- chairman of the Medical Workers Trade Union; M.A. Voroshilov -- cochairman of the Russian Metal Workers Trade Union; V.V. Shulga -- cochairman of the Russian Trade Union of Drivers and Urban Transport Personnel. The republic leaders' reservations generally relate to the Treaty's taking into consideration agreements concluded previously as well as official amendments to the draft Treaty submitted previously (Republic of Tatarstan). The leadership of North Ossetia objects to the inclusion in the Treaty of a clause regarding the creation of mechanisms to implement the Law on the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples. The trade union leaders' reservations mainly boil down to objections at the inclusion in the text of the Treaty of a reference to the General Agreement for 1994.
