The Democratic Party's (DP) attempts this week to hold public meetings on western Cape tertiary campuses "were disrupted by ANC [African National Congress] supporters, echoing the disruptions last year of DP meetings in Khayelitsha and Gugulethu as well as the more recent disruptions of NP [National Party] road shows." "Natal, in which Africans constitute 81 percent of the population (including kwaZulu) is another area where the traditionally white parties have to contend with `no-go' areas." "Amidst all the attention being focused on events in Bophuthatswana, East Rand violence, and constitutional negotiations, we could lose sight of the predicaments of the Democratic and National parties. These two traditionally white parties are, in some of South Africa's most populous areas, being denied a hearing." Only `Reasonably' Free, Fair Election Expected -- In the "One in Your Eye" column on the same page, Kaizer Nyatsumba, asks: "Will the election be free and fair? I don't think so. Given the very high degree of political intolerance in our society, it is impossible that we can have a free and fair election. Instead, we should now hope for a reasonably free and fair election -- and we would be lucky to have even that. But, realistically, that is what is within the realm of possibility at the moment. Although ANC members have been the guiltiest, not many parties have clean hands in this regard." BUSINESS DAY De Klerk `Dereliction of Duty' in Third Force Claims -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 March in a page-14 editorial says ANC President Nelson Mandela and his colleagues "accuse De Klerk of personal and direct responsibility for the deaths of black people" by an alleged "third force". However, BUSINESS DAY disagrees, saying "De Klerk's refusal over the years to give sufficient attention to the possible existence of a third force does not add up to that kind of culpability." However, the De Klerk government appears guilty of "a gross dereliction of duty." Despite the available evidence "it failed to recognise the potential dangers posed by its secret police force which, after all, was trained to see opponents of apartheid as enemies to be fought ruthlessly." De Klerk has also "ignored numerous calls" for the replacement of General Johan van der Merwe as commissioner of police "because of doubts about his commitment to the political process. The President has put in political charge of the police force first Adriaan Vlok and then Hernus Kriel -- two hawks unwilling to attempt to seek out the rote which now threatens the creadibilit of the entire force." ANC's `Selective Conscience' on Controls, Discipline -- A second editorial on the same page finds its "encouraging" that the ANC "is taking such a tough stance on financial discipline. The party has joined in the lambasting of self-governing territories for overspending and is pushing for a fiscal control mechanism that will apply to central government too." ANC deputy head of economics, Tito Mboweni, "wants to make sure `the family silver is still there when the new administration takes over'." "Let us hope the family silver is treated with the same respect once the new administration has taken over," remarks BUSINESS DAY. "The ANC has already shown that it has a selective conscience on controls and discipline. It had no qualms in asking that import duties on election materials be waived, and to use finrands to buy a building. Those playing watchdog now should be watched in future with equal vigilance." SOWETAN Enough Evidence of `Third Force' -- "The Goldstone Commission has uncovered massive SAP [South African Police] and kwaZulu police involvement in the arming and training of large numbers of men on the Reef and Natal," states a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 21 March. "Even State President F.W. de Klerk admitted that there was enough evidence of a Third Force being instrumental in the taking of thousands of lives during the past four years. It is fortunate that these revelations come a few weeks before the elections. Heads must roll and De Klerk's previous timid attempts to clean the deadly mess must be given teeth."
