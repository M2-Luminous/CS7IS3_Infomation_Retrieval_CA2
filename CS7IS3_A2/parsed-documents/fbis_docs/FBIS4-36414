[Al-Dali] We have in our hands the constitutional and legal right to defend ourselves against any attack or invasion by the Sanaa authorities. And we -- the victims of aggression -- are internationally entitled to seek assistance from any friendly or fraternal state. So in accordance with international law, we are entitled to seek foreign assistance. [Al-Badri] Will the confrontation escalate if Sanaa does not comply fully with international law? And we ask: Why have you not over the past two weeks used Scud missiles, as you have a stockpile of them? Is it because you have been subjected to pressures urging you to comply with the diplomatic efforts seeking to achieve the aim of securing recognition for the south? [Al-Dali] I would like to stress that we support the policy of nonescalation. Because we indeed wish to end this conflict. But our adherence to the policy of nonescalation does not at all mean that we are unable to retaliate. If the situation escalates today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow, we will reply powerfully. As for the use of the Scud batteries, our military commanders should be asked about it. They know what should be done in these conditions. At any rate, we can, of course, resort to using this type of missiles to protect civilians from air raids. [Al-Badri] But what about the recognition issue, which is one of the most important issues Sanaa is concerned about? [Al-Dali] I believe that international recognition of Aden is proceeding unhindered. It will most certainly take place. And we feel that the Sanaa rulers have begun to lose control of the situation and express -- in word and deed -- the state of alarm and confusion they are experiencing. [Al-Badri] We heard that you have obtained strong promises from the permanent member states of the Security Council of their move toward granting recognition. [Al-Dali] As I said, recognition of Aden is most certainly on the way. Very soon fraternal states and then friendly states, first and foremost the permanent member states of the Security Council, will announce their recognition of Aden as an independent political entity, as was the situation in the past. [Al-Badri] Did you raise with the Americans and the United Nations the issue of sending international forces to protect civilians in the south and observe the cease-fire? [Al-Dali] I personally did not raise that matter, nor was I assigned to do so. But if the situation becomes critical, we will demand that. We rely in an action like that on the foundations of international legitimacy and the UN Charter. [passage omitted]
