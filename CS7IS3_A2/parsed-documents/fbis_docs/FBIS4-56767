It is a very special moment for me, Castro told PRENSA LATINA. From the very beginning, when this trip was planned, I decided to come here and make this offering to the martyrs of Barbados, Castro added. Visibly moved, Fidel Castro walked along the shore for a few minutes and overlooked the horizon where 18 years ago the flaming plane fell with its 73 passengers. Eleven Guyanese, six Koreans, and 56 Cubans, including the entire Cuban National Youth Fencing Team, which had just won the Central American and Caribbean championship in Caracas, were on that Cubana de Aviacion flight. After his visit to Cross Bay, President Castro told PRENSA LATINA that he was very pleased with his first visit to this English-speaking Caribbean country. They are a warm, friendly, and very educated people, Castro said. Regarding his meetings in the past few days with other Caribbean leaders who also attended the recently concluded World Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, Fidel Castro said he received numerous expressions of solidarity from the Caribbean heads of state. The entire Caribbean is in favor of Cuba's integration to the region, Castro said. Today, the Cuban president met with Governor General Nita Barrow, sister of the late Barbadian Prime Minister Erroll Barrow. Just before his meeting with Nita Barrow, Castro told PRENSA LATINA: It is my duty to meet with her because the governor general is Barrow's sister, and he maintained excellent relations with Cuba. Castro's Saturday agenda includes meetings with correspondents from CANA and the Caribbean Broadcasting Union who report and broadcast to the region. Fidel Castro will also visit the "Rainbow Warrior," a Greenpeace ship that docked at the port in Bridgetown with an exhibit on board on environmental protection technology. Cuban President Fidel Castro arrived in Barbados on 4 May to attend the conference. He is accompanied by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly of the People's Government; and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of environment, science, and technology.
