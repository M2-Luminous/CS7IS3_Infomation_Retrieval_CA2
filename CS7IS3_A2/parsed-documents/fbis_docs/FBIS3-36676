According to him, in the present circumstances to launch air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be "the least appropriate solution." With reference to the recent letter addressed by the UN Secretary General to NATO, Demurin said that it concerned primarily actions that lie beyond resolutions issued by the UN Security Council. "NATO's readiness to launch air strikes is one thing, and the taking of a political decision is another. This is a prerogative of the UN Secretary General in consultations with the Security Council, where Russia will necessarily have its say," he pointed out.
