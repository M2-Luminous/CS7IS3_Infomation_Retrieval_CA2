The signatories of the GATT have begun a new round of negotiations on this single issue. An agreement should be reached by the end of 1996. Between now and that time, the status of most favored nation will not apply to this sector. Europe had proposed opening up maritime transportation (with the exception of coastal shipping between two ports in a given country) to competition. But while the European nations have almost entirely opened up their markets, they have not been able to obtain reciprocal treatment from the Americans, who have a very protectionist policy in this sector. For a long time, the Americans in this sector have benefited from federal legislative protection of their activities, which gives them priority on the domestic market. The negotiators submitted minimal offers with regard to the opening up of their markets. Countries like Japan, Mexico, and Korea followed suit. Without result. The European shipowners reject the institutionalization of the current situation, wherein they come up against protectionism in numerous countries, while at the same time competitors can attack them on their own home ground. Therefore no offer was included in the global accord, and new negotiations will be launched. Between now and the end of 1996, none of the parties should be able to strengthen their protectionist arsenals, except by means of retaliatory measures. But the Central Committee of French Shipowners (CCAF) would have preferred a freeze, followed by the dismantling of the protectionist regulations. According to one market analyst, the heaviest losers as a consequence of this accord are likely to be the Asian countries, Taiwan in particular (Evergreen is the largest international shipowner), and the countries of northern Europe, such as Denmark, for example. Greece will also be affected.
