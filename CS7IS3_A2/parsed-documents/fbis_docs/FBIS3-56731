The source maintains that differences between Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin on a number of candidacies for key Cabinet posts presented to the prime minister have somewhat delayed a decision on the Cabinet's personal composition. The source offered the following rough forecast: Chernomyrdin as the prime minister, Oleg Soskovets as the first deputy prime minister, Chubays, Fedorov, Yarov, Zaveryukha as deputy prime ministers, Grachev, Yerin, and Kozyrev as ministers in charge of decision-making ministries, and Gerashchenko, as chairman of the Central Bank.
