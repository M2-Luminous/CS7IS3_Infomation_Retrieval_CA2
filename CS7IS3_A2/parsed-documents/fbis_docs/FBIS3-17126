After all, the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of Gali rayon, fearing atrocities and robberies by Abkhazian and north Caucasian fighters, have been forced to leave their birthplaces and find temporary shelter in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, and other rayons in western Georgia. A certain number of their relatives still remain in Gali rayon. The Abkhazian authorities have now virtually forbidden such movement. The formal reason given for this is the introduction of a quarantine on the territory of Gali rayon. Its period of duration is from 10 until 20 March. In addition, during the last few days, Abkhazian and North Caucasian fighters stationed at the Inguri River have been sporadically opening fire with automatic weapons; they have been firing either into the air or in the direction of those villages in Zugdidi rayon that are located on the Inguri River. These acts of provocation, apart from anything else, are probably aimed at exerting psychological pressure on the inhabitants of the villages in Zugdidi rayon and the refugees there from the Abkhazian region.
