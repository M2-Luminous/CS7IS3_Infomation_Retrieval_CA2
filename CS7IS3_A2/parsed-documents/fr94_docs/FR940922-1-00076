FR940922-1-00076 FR940922-1-00009 Under this proposal, the agency would refuse to file any application or abbreviated antibiotic application, and refuse to receive any abbreviated new drug application that does not contain a certification or disclosure statement. Current regulations allow FDA to refuse to file or receive incomplete applications. Proposed amendments to §§314.50 and 314.94 would require certification or disclosure to accompany applications and abbreviated applications, therefore, any application or abbreviated application not containing a certification or disclosure statement would be incomplete and would not be filed or received. If FDA refuses to file or receive an application or abbreviated application, FDA will not review the application because the agency has determined that the application is not sufficiently complete to allow substantive review. FDA is proposing to amend §314.60 to allow the agency to refuse to accept amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement. The agency would amend §§314.200 and 314.300 to require any person who submits clinical data as part of the hearing process for refusals to approve and for withdrawals of approvals for NDA's, abbreviated antibiotic drug applications (AADA's), or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's) or the hearing process for issuing, amending, and withdrawing antibiotic regulations to submit a certification or disclosure statement. Proposed amendments to §320.36 (21 CFR 320.36) would require similar reporting and recordkeeping for certification and disclosure statements accompanying bioequivalence studies as would be required under part 312. Proposed amendments to §330.10 (21 CFR 330.10) would require certification or disclosure statements to accompany clinical data submitted as a part of the over-the-counter (OTC) monograph process. FDA believes that the clinical data submitted for OTC drug products are no less important than data submitted as part of the NDA or ANDA processes and should be treated similarly. In the case of OTC monographs, because all data are publicly available, this disclosure should also be part of the public record even if it is not made public for NDA's and ANDA's. B. Amendments to Regulations for Biologicals FDA is proposing to amend the regulations at §601.2(a) (21 CFR 601.2(a)) governing the filing of applications for product licenses by adding a sentence to require the inclusion of a financial certification or disclosure statement as follows: ``The applicant shall also include a financial certification or disclosure statement as required by part 54 of this chapter.'' C. Amendments to Regulations for Medical Devices The agency realizes that not all 510(k) premarket notification submissions contain clinical data. Because current regulations do not authorize FDA to require certification or disclosure statements, the agency proposes to specifically require such statements by adding a new paragraph to §807.87 (21 CFR 807.87). After review of a 510(k), FDA does not ``file the application'' but has other options, depending upon the information contained in the submission. Therefore, the agency proposes to withhold the decision on the 510(k) submission until a certification or disclosure statement is submitted. The agency recognizes that the historical file relating to a device may be retained in more than one location. FDA believes however, that a copy of the certification or disclosure statement should be accessible pursuant to §807.31 (21 CFR 807.31) and proposes to amend the regulation to accommodate accessibility. A proposed amendment to §812.110 would require clinical investigators to provide to sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow sponsors to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. Therefore, FDA is also proposing to amend §814.20 to require sponsors to include in premarket approval applications a financial certification or disclosure statement as required by part 54, and to amend §814.42 (21 CFR 814.42) to allow the agency to refuse to file an application or amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement. Because supporting data are needed in a reclassification petition to satisfy the requirements of a determination of safety and effectiveness of a device, FDA is proposing to amend §860.123 to require any sponsor who submits clinical data as part of a reclassification petition to include a certification or disclosure statement.
