Van Den Broek and Abou made their accusations while briefing the EU Council of Ministers in Luxembourg. According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] correspondent Dhespina Kaloyeropoulou, most ministers agreed that the Turkish Cypriot side is causing the most difficulties in negotiations for a Cyprus solution. In an interjection, Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou stressed that the Cyprus issue has lasted for a long time and is causing instability in the region. He suggested that the facts presented by the observer at the briefing be put on the record. The Greek deputy foreign minister asked that the procedure for beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU be speeded up. According to CyBC's information, some ministers objected vehemently at this point, saying that it is not the right time to mention a new expansion when the Council of Europe has not yet ratified the upcoming EU expansion by another four countries and since the Maastricht Treaty will be reconsidered in 1996.
