What guides us? 1. How do you see Ukraine from the heights of your position at the start of the new year of 1994? 2. Very little time is left for you to work as part of the current government before the new elections in 1994. What concrete steps do you intend to take so as to halt the further fall of Ukraine into the abyss of economic crisis? 1. Ukraine is experiencing extraordinarily difficult times. A precipitous destruction and pollution of the natural environment is occurring simultaneously with the economic disarray. The threat to the health of people and the genetic stock of the nation has become real. The quantity of birth defects among infants is increasing every year, and a natural decline in the population--or, more precisely speaking, its extinction--has been occurring since 1991. The crisis state of the environment in Ukraine is conditioned mainly by the ecologically unsafe functioning of the senseless economic system that we inherited from the times of totalitarianism. Twice as much iron ore was extracted in Ukraine as in the United States at the end of the 1980s, as well as somewhat less coal than in Great Britain, France and the FRG taken together; as much steel as the FRG and France taken together was smelted every year. We have all always taken pride in that, and few gave any thought to the harm being done to nature. But here are even ``better'' data. The imperfect technologies for the production and processing of raw minerals that are used in Ukraine lead to losses of up to 70 percent for oil, 50 percent for salts, 40 percent for coal, and 2--5--with some even 10--13 times--more than is required by contemporary technologies for metals. Close to 1.5 billion tonnes a year of natural substances are involved in the process of social production across Ukraine as a whole. More than half are them returned to the natural environment in the form of wastes that poison the surroundings. But even that is not all. We are continuing to augment power capacity, in particular nuclear, forgetting both the lessons of Chornobyl and the fact that the share of this sector is reaching 30 percent of the total emissions of harmful substances today. At the very same time, the overconsumption of energy at the enterprises of ferrous metallurgy alone in Ukraine, owing to their technical backwardness, is equivalent to the quantity of electric power generated by all the AESs [nuclear electric-power plants] of the former USSR. The energy-intensiveness of our output as a whole is six to eight times greater than the analogous measures for the leading Western countries. The list of this economic self-cannibalism could be continued a great deal longer. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, understanding of the fact that the non-ecological development of the national economy, with sweeping and profound negative effects on the environment, could surpass the consequences of any aggression is still lacking in our society. Backward ecological thinking is unfortunately being demonstrated at all levels of the power structures. A review that was conducted recently has shown that the specially created extra-budgetary environmental-protection funds of the Soviets of People's Deputies, which are responsible under prevailing legislation for the state of the environment within the bounds of their territories, are not being used primarily for their intended purposes. A whole series of cities in the Donetsk-Dnieper region, where only 20--30 percent of the fund is being used for environmental-protection measures, could be a negative example of this. The rest goes for ``patching holes'' in the local budgets. All of this is occurring in a region where the extent of contamination of the environment is the greatest in Ukraine. Our republic budget, however, is the most instructive example of the lack of a statewide approach to the resolution of ecological problems. Just 0.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) was envisaged for all environmental-protection measures in 1993. And that is in the face of the fact that economic losses are reaching far beyond 10 percent of the GNP as a consequence of the worsening state of the natural environment. By way of comparison, most of the ecologically clean countries of the West spend 2--4 percent of their GNPs on measures to protect the environment. The Minpryrody [Ministry of Environmental Protection] monitors just 10 percent of that symbolic amount, with the rest of the budget appropriations, without regard for ecological priorities, being monitored under the old sector principle by Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics] and Minfin [Ministry of Finance]. The state of affairs is no better in the system to monitor the upholding of environment-protection legislation. The Minpryrody of Ukraine only recently obtained the right to subject violators to administrative liability. As for ecological crimes--which are being committed everywhere--some bodies of the procuracy have taken a crazy stance. Instead of fighting against these crimes, they have made the object of their vigilant attention... Minpryrody itself. It is, of course, far easier to ``point out shortcomings'' than it is to bring people to criminal liability, as recently happened, for example, with the bringing of toxic substances into the city of Rivne. But perhaps now is not the time to just ``point out,'' we need, as we are fond of saying, to ``pull the plow'' together so as to survive. The terrible ecological situation in which Ukraine finds itself today has thus been conditioned by the inability of the post-communist system to act effectively. So we will never ourselves get out of this abyss without radical economic and ecological reform. 2. The principal efforts over the time that remains will be directed toward completing the work on ecological reform that we started last year. That is, the creation of the legal, organizational and financial conditions for the pursuit of an effective ecological policy in Ukraine. The essence of the problems lies in the necessity of resolving them as soon as possible, in the creation of mechanisms that would stimulate the ecologization of production and energy conservation. We are planning, for that purpose, to institute fees for the utilization of natural resources, introduce tax concessions for resource-conserving and ecologically clean technologies, and employ economic sanctions for the utilization of natural resources above and beyond standards for or their contamination. All of these measures, which have to be the basic guidelines for a new state policy in the realm of protecting the environment and utilizing natural resources, will lead to the fact that it will become unprofitable for an enterprise to pollute the environment and consume resources excessively. More than twenty legal-standards documents have already been adopted in order to realize the socio-economic reform. Also to be completed, aside from that, in the first half of 1994 are: --the development of a National Program for the protection of the natural environment; --the development of a mechanism to compensate for ecological losses as a consequence of the functioning of trunk oil and gas pipelines, electrical-transmission lines and the transport of freights across the territory of Ukraine; --the institution of a system of ecological certification and licensing; --the development of regional ecological programs for the Dnieper, Donbass and Polissya, along with other documents. The completion of that work would make it possible to launch the realization of a policy resulting in the gradual reproduction of a clean natural environment, a halt to the extinction of the Ukrainian people and economic prosperity as early as 1994. But that is a task for the next government.
