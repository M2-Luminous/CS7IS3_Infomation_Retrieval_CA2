Reflections on the Results of the Agrarian Party of Russia Central Council's Latest Plenum"] [Text] The most pressing question at the plenum was the cadre question. Yes, the elections to the State Duma were a success, as were the elections to the local organs of self-government. But everyone understands perfectly that success, like lightning, never strikes in the same place twice. Thus Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR], stated bluntly that without mass support the party would not get far. The time for rejoicing is over; it is time to get down to the routine donkeywork of creating primary party organizations. And the APR, alas, so far does not have a great number of them. In 20 of the 88 federation components the party has not yet been registered at all. "Work -- there is heaps of it. But what is the mood like?" "We need the Ministry of Agriculture structures to help us to create primary party organizations. Let there be a vertical chain of command, so that the chiefs of rayon agricultural administrations join the APR themselves and give orders to their subordinates..." "It is very difficult to act on a voluntary basis. We need full-time organizers, funding... It is very difficult to work in this area. In nine years many rural leaders of subdepartments and farms have been infected with greed. Without them it is difficult to create primary organizations on the spot." I deliberately do not give the names of these people who proved themselves so helpless in the most important party task -- organization. This weakness is nowadays characteristic of all Russian parties. And the one which manages to cast aside ambitions and reliance on instructions from above the most quickly will win at the next elections and will continue to win thereafter. It is no accident that Aleksandr Zaveryukha, member of the APR Central Council, having heard his fill of the "valuable" conclusions cited above, said bluntly and angrily: "Our strength lies within ourselves." You could not put it more accurately. One after another the Central Council members ascend the rostrum and say: "An agrarian party without its own press organ is unthinkable. All its decisions, decrees, and ideas fail to reach rnak-and-file members. We must have our own news organ and seek links with the agrarian press." As if this press is hiding from the agrarians. During the recess I tried to find out by degrees which Central Council member subscribes to which agrarian newspaper. I did not manage to find out. However much I searched while on assignments on the bare notice boards of agro-industrial complex trade union committees and rayon agricultural administrations and in offices -- I have nowhere seen an agrarian newspaper. The agrarian press is nowhere to be seen either in villages or in rayon centers, let alone oblast cities. So what is the sense in newspapers publishing information about the work of the APR, if no members of the party subscribe to them or read them?! Of course, the distribution of a newspaper once again requires effort and the loss of free time, and, when it comes down to it, money. But after all, there is no other way. Party members, for example, must engage in propaganda. Like, shall we say, explaining to rural laborers the essence of the law on bankruptcy. At the plenum this law was rubbished by all but those who could not be bothered. But in his speech Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha objected: "We should know this law; after all, it says that a farm which declares itself bankrupt is to be given financial injections for two years in order for it to try to get back on its feet. Then it is given the right to voluntary flotation, and much else. It would be no bad thing for some farms to seize upon this law, rather than damn it...." Boris Chernov from Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, speaking of the experience of land redistribution in his area, defined its results as a hopeless failure. But he said: "To survive, we must work creatively." But how can you work creatively, if many people do not read even the laws?! Of course, to reject them is far more simple. Yes, the reforms are punishingly difficult, but it is hight time to release that not everything in them is without rhyme or reason. Experienced rayon agricultural production leaders say that the time has come to study every farm individually, and if necessary, break them up into smaller units. Formerly it was possible to drive a tractor 20 kilometers to a field from the central farmstead for a few kopeks. Today this trip costs thousands. It was correctly observed (unfortunately, off the record) that we have not managed to forge an agrarian complex, and that, although being apparently of the same mind, each of us is in fact plowing his own furrow. All this should not only be known, but brought to the attention of the party rank and file, of the ordinary rural laborers. How is this to be done without funds, offices, or direct telephone links? It is the simplest thing in the world to dress up like a man of the people, as respectable Western congressmen do on the eve of the elections, and set off for remote villages and farms in order to help people, and your own party at the same time, in word and deed. Politics, like any other art, requires sacrifices. Incidentally, about big-time politics. A party which has in its ranks such cadres as State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, vice premier of the Russian Federation Government, APR Chairman Mikhail Lapshin, a highly experienced manager; Aleksandr Davydov, chairman of the Agro-Industrial Complex Employees Trade Union Central Committee, an able tactician and organizer; and many others, can only be envied. After all, it was only thanks to them that the party's Central Council did not in their majority commit a fateful mistake, and did after all give their consent to the signing of the well-known "Agreement on Accord and Peace," putting forward a number of very important prior conditions which would prevent the president and the government from implementing the previous policy of the virtual destruction of the agrarian sector of the Russian economy. "We should not try to smash through walls where there are doors," Ivan Rybkin objected to his party comrades. "The agrarian faction is one of the most respected in the Duma. And we should do everything to bequeath to agrarians a firm legislative basis. We should learn the art of compromise." The APR Central Council's plenum was a stormy affair, characterized by disputes and searches for the truth. One would like to hope that all the conclusions drawn during the discussions will serve as a reliable foundation for the construction of a true champion of agricultural workers -- the Agrarian Party of Russia.
