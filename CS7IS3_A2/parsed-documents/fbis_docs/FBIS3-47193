FBIS3-47193 "dreas005__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-005-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 January 1994 ANNEX Japan No `New' Measures for U.S. in Cellular Market OW0701050794 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 7 Jan 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0701050794 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 Jan 94 Morning Edition] [Text] Regarding the question of liberalizing the cellular phone market -- an issue of concern to Japan and the United States -- the government has confirmed the position that it will not take any new administrative measures to promote participation of U.S.-model products in the Japanese market. The government is expected to formally notify the United States of this position in an urgent vice-ministerial-level meeting it has called to hold in Washington early next week. The United States has called on Japan to open up its cellular market further, by setting 15 February as the date by which it will decide whether to take retaliatory measures, but Japan is poised to maintain the position of insisting "this is an issue which should be resolved by the private sector." With the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks going into full- scale negotiations soon, the government hopes the confirmation of this basic stance can remind the United States on the principle of the economic talks that "measures should be limited to those which the hands of government can reach." Meanwhile, most likely, the United States will insist that measures should be instituted at the government level. The issue of cellular phones is not a topic of discussion at the economic framework talks. However, this issue is likely to loom large when trying to predict what will happen to the framework talks henceforth. A Japan-U.S. vice-ministerial-level meeting on cellular phones has been requested by Japan, and negotiations are now underway toward holding it on 10 or 11 January. Masahito Tani, deputy vice-minister of posts and telecommunications, and Charlene Barshevsky, vice U.S. trade representative, are expected to attend the meeting, representing Japan and the United States, respectively. In December, the U.S. Government announced that it was moving up the deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures from the end of March to 15 February 1994, on the grounds that the adoption of Motorola systems in the Japanese market is lagging as compared to that of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) systems. The United States appears to be wanting to extract concessions from Japan by associating this issue with the economic framework talks which Japan and the United States want to conclude in a summit on 11 February. Japan insists, "The Motorola systems have been used in the metropolitan area and the central region since 1989. Enough frequencies have been assigned to them already." A source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "There is nothing more that can be done at the government level." In the vice-ministerial-level meeting expected to be held early next week, Japan will ask the United States why it has moved up the deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures, and will make clear its position that "whether or not the Motorola systems should be adopted is a question to be dealt with at the private-sector level."
