The survey includes information on more than 75,000 people employed between 1946 and 1982 by the UK Atomic Energy Authority, the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield. Workers fell into two groups -- those likely to be exposed to radiation who were monitored, and those who were not. The second group included office workers and caterers. Researchers found deaths from all causes in monitored workers were 19 per cent lower than average, while overall deaths from cancer were 18 per cent lower. By 1989 there were 40,761 workers in the monitored group, of whom 1,884 had died of cancer. Dr Valerie Beral, of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, said: "The fact that the number of deaths was lower than average was not unexpected. This is common in high-skill industries which tend to employ healthy people." The cancers most commonly linked with radiation exposure in previous studies were those of the prostate, uterus, lung, and multiple myeloma and leukemia. The new analysis showed that only leukemia was clearly linked with external radiation. Dr Lucy Carpenter, of Oxford University, said: "The 49 leukemia deaths observed in monitored workers were similar to the number predicted by general rates but the risk of the disease rose with the radiation dose in these workers. "The dose-related risk was confined to those last employed at Sellafield, where radiation doses were higher." Deaths from thyroid cancer were also higher than average -- for every 100 cases expected, 181 were observed. Dr Beral said: "The increase was found in groups but there was some weak evidence that the increased risk in monitored workers was linked to radiation dose. This is being investigated further."
