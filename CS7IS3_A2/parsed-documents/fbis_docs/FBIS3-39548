Claes and van den Broek arrived in Athens a short time ago together with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev to attend tomorrow's meeting between the European troika and Russia. Claes said he does not hide his concern and will continue to insist that the Athens-Skopje dialogue resume at the United Nations, something, as he put it, that everybody in Europe considers as the best way to safeguard the good neighborliness between the two countries and, primarily, something that ensures the smooth functioning of the European Union as a whole and toward its neighbors. Van den Broek said he will seek clarification on the measures from the Greek Government and will also examine their compatibility with the legal framework of the European Union. Their disagreement over the Bosnian issue is clear. Kozyrev expressed his clear opposition to the NATO threat of bombings and implied that any bombing would also affect Russia's participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace plan concerning the accession of Eastern countries. Kozyrev left open the possibility of Russian blue helmet [United Nations] troops going to Sarajevo to safeguard peace as early as the weekend. Claes and van den Broek expressed their optimism that bombings will be averted but also stated the conviction that the strict NATO ultimatum was decoded correctly and both Europe and the Atlantic Alliance should insist on it.
