FR940525-1-00017 FR940525-1-00007 Under the proposal, ``standard representations and warranties'' are those that refer to an existing state of facts that the seller or servicer can either control or verify with reasonable due diligence at the time the assets are sold or the servicing rights are transferred. These representations and warranties will not be considered recourse or direct credit substitutes, provided that the seller or servicer performs due diligence prior to the transfer of the assets or servicing rights to ensure that it has a reasonable basis for making the representation or warranty. The term ``standard representations and warranties'' would also cover contractual provisions that permit the return of transferred assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies, (i.e., if the assets are not what the seller represented them to be), consistent with the current Call Report instructions governing the reporting of asset transfers. After a final definition of ``standard representations and warranties'' is adopted for the risk-based capital standards, the Banking Agencies would recommend to the FFIEC that the Call Report instructions be changed to conform to the capital guidelines and the OTS would similarly amend the instructions for the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Examples of ``standard representations and warranties'' include seller representations that the transferred assets are current (i.e., not past due) at the time of sale; that the assets meet specific, agreed-upon credit standards at the time of sale; or that the assets are free and clear of any liens (provided that the seller has exercised due diligence to verify these facts). An example of a nonstandard representation and warranty would be a contractual provision stating that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages are free of environmental hazards. This representation is not verifiable by the seller or servicer with reasonable due diligence because it is not possible to absolutely verify that a property is, in fact, free of all environmental hazards. Such an open-ended guarantee against the risk that unknown but currently existing hazards might be discovered in the future would be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute. However, a seller's representation that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages have undergone environmental studies and that the studies revealed no known environmental hazards would be a ``standard representation and warranty'' (assuming that the seller performed the requisite due diligence). This is a verifiable statement of facts that would not be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute. 8. Loan Servicing Arrangements The definitions cover loan servicing arrangements if the servicer is responsible for credit losses associated with the loans being serviced. However, cash advances made by servicers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of the loans would be specifically excluded from the definitions of recourse and direct credit substitute, provided that the servicer is entitled to reimbursement for any significant advances. 13 Such advances are assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the cash advance, and are assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the party that is obligated to reimburse the servicer. 13 Servicer cash advances would include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan in order to facilitate its timely collection (but not to protect investors from incurring these expenses). If the servicer is not entitled to full reimbursement, then the maximum possible amount of any nonreimbursed advances on any one loan must be contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan in order for the cash advance to be excluded from the definitions of recourse and direct credit substitute. This treatment reflects the Agencies' traditional view that servicer cash advances meeting these criteria are part of the normal servicing function and do not constitute credit enhancements. B. Low-level recourse rule The Banking Agencies are proposing to reduce the capital requirement for all recourse transactions in which a banking organization contractually limits its exposure to less than the full, effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred (referred to as ``low-level recourse transactions''). 14 This proposal would apply to low-level recourse transactions involving all types of assets, including small business loans, commercial loans and residential mortgages. 14 The ``full effective risk-based capital charge'' is 8% for 100% risk-weighted assets and 4% for 50% risk-weighted assets. 1. ``Dollar-for-dollar'' Capital Requirement Up to the Amount of the Recourse Obligation for Low-Level Recourse Under the proposed low-level recourse rule, a banking organization that contractually limits its maximum recourse obligation to less than the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the transferred assets would be required to hold risk-based capital equal to the contractual maximum amount of its recourse obligation. This would be a ``dollar-for-dollar'' capital requirement for the low-level recourse exposure. For example, the risk-based capital requirement for a 100% risk-weighted asset transferred with 3% recourse would be only 3% of the value of the transferred assets rather than the currently required 8%. This would prevent a banking organization's capital requirement from exceeding the contractual maximum amount that it could lose under a recourse obligation. 15 In addition, adoption of this proposal would bring the Banking Agencies into conformity with the OTS, which already applies the low-level recourse rule to thrifts. 15 The proposed low-level recourse rule would supersede the Banking Agencies' current risk-based capital treatment of mortgage transfers with ``insignificant'' recourse. Under that treatment, the sale of a residential mortgage with recourse is excluded from risk-weighted assets if the institution does not retain significant risk of loss, i.e., the institution's maximum contractual recourse exposure does not exceed its reasonably estimated probable losses on the transferred mortgages, and the institution establishes and maintains a recourse liability account equal to the amount of its recourse obligation. The Agencies will continue to evaluate the need for full capital support for low-level recourse transactions and will consider, in connection with development of the multi-level approaches that are discussed in Section III, whether even greater reductions in the capital requirement for low-level recourse transactions should be proposed. 2. Low-level Recourse Arrangements for Mortgage-Related Securities or Participation Certificates Retained in a Mortgage Loan Swap When an institution swaps mortgage loans for mortgage-related securities or participation certificates and retains low-level recourse, the Banking Agencies currently base the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if the loans were held as on-balance sheet assets. The OTS bases the capital requirement for these arrangements on its existing low-level recourse rule, with a minimum capital level of 1.6% of the mortgage-related securities or participation certificates. (These certificates would include only high-quality mortgage related securities.)
