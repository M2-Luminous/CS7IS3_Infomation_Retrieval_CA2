They discussed a number of security issues and the role of the security agencies in bolstering security and providing peace of mind in society, especially in the current delicate circumstances experienced by our country as a result of the war fueled by the rebellious secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. Speaking at the meeting, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council praised the security men's recent efforts to maintain security and citizens' lives and property. In his speech, the brother chairman reviewed the crimes of the rebellious secessionist elements in the YSP against the homeland and the people since the crisis began on 19 August 1993. He said those elements have dealt with the children of the homeland mercilessly and irresponsibly. He noted that the latest of these practices was last night's heinous crime in which the cowardly criminals indiscriminately fired a missile against innocent, secure citizens, striking one of Sanaa's densely populated districts, resulting in 53 [number as received] casualties. He said: This cowardly, treacherous act will not go unpunished. In war, it would be acceptable to hit military or strategic targets. But when peaceful citizens' homes and civilian targets are hit, verily this is a disgraceful, treacherous act and an odious crime that is contrary to all morals, norms, values, and laws. This crime is evidence of the state of complete bankruptcy and despair that has gripped that criminal secessionist clique in the YSP command. This clique has acted mercilessly towards its own members. How can it have mercy on the homeland and the people? The brother chairman: I would have preferred that the elements of the al-Bid-led secessionist gang turn themselves in for trial. We will give them a fair trial. Let them choose whoever lawyers they want in order to preserve the lives of the remaining Armed Forces personnel under their control, as well as the innocent citizens. This is the required nationalist stand. We are not against the YSP. We are against the apostate secessionist elements in the YSP command. The brother chairman added: I call on all officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the Armed and Security Forces who are under the control of the secessionist clique to reject orders in their camps and to pledge loyalty to unity and constitutional legitimacy. I am ready to issue instructions to the Defense Ministry to stop the process of confronting them to give those elements the chance to leave the Port of Aden for Djibouti or anywhere else. This is better and more honorable than continuing a losing war and shedding more innocent blood. Those who are doing this now will pay a high price and will lose the people. The unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party should clearly define their position on that criminal gang, rally around unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and reject the decisions of the secessionist gang that decided to launch the war, in order to curb chaos and the shedding of more Yemeni blood, to maintain public security, and to let their behavior set an example. I urge tribal chiefs, social figures, and all citizens to deal with local and internal organizations to maintain security in society. It is time to end the problems of four years of security chaos and financial and administrative corruption and to start building a modern Yemeni state, a state of law and order, and to impose the state's prestige. It is not a Sanaa, Hadhramaut, Aden, or Abyan republic, but a Yemeni Republic, which we all accept. We take pride in its development within the framework of constant principles, namely, unity and the republican system based on our tolerant Islamic doctrine. Salih urged the employees of the Interior Ministry and all security organizations to make every effort to maintain public security and punish those who cause chaos or harm. All these elements should be deterred, at a time when we highly appreciate the security mens' activity over the past days. At the beginning of the meeting, Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil welcomed the brother president and said: We pledge to you that we will stand by you and by legitimacy against all those who have departed from legitimacy and against all acts violating security. Since the very beginning, we, in the Interior Ministry, have been in a state of alert to confront those who tamper with security and exploit the circumstances. The security men are standing in one rank along with their brothers in the Armed Forces, and feel that the security battle completes the true battle. We are responsible before you for citizens' security and safety. We promise you that we will continue to epitomize the spirit of unity and national responsibility represented by legitimacy. We beseech God to grant us success in our work and to allow our people to achieve victory and to continue construction and development. The meeting was attended by Colonel (?Muhsin al-Muski), head of the general authority of meteorology and civil aviation.
