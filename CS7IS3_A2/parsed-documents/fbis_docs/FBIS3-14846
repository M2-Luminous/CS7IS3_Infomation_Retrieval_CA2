This Was Theme of Routine Session of CIS Defense Ministers Council"] [Text] As we have already reported, the session was held 24-25 February. Delegations from the military departments of 11 countries, the general secretary of the Collective Security Council of the CIS member states, and representatives of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the legislature, and the Border Troops Command participated in it. A number of organizational questions concerning the structure of the Defense Ministers Council, the manning of the Staff for the Coordination of Military Cooperation, and the preparations to celebrate the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War were examined, as well as problems of the use of the collective peacemaking forces and of military-technical cooperation. It was pointed out at the session that the countries which signed the Collective Security Treaty have at last gotten a real opportunity to commence its practical implementation. As is known, since Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Georgia subscribed to the treaty, the composition of the Defense Ministers Council virtually corresponds to the composition of the Collective Security Council, which includes, in addition to the heads of the states which signed the treaty and the foreign ministers, the leaders of these states' military departments. The two-day gathering of the military departments' leaders, held under the chairmanship of Colonel General Boris Gromov, Russian deputy minister of defense, ended with the signing of a number of documents. They include the Statute on the Defense Ministers Council of the CIS Member States, which defines its functions, structure, and composition and the organization of its activity under the new conditions. A decision was adopted on the composition of the Military Cooperation Coordination Staff and on the principles of its manning. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported (the issue for 23 February), the staff will be manned on a coalition basis, and it will have a top limit of 250 members. At the same time the Russian contingent will be the largest -- 120 people. The session participants' balanced approach to problems of collective security enabled them to reach agreement on additional measures to stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the border. A decision was also adopted on measures to prepare to celebrate the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.
