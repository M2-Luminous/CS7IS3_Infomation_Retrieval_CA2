Members of the delegation offered their condolences on the nation's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil al-Asad. The president thanked the members of the delegation for their noble sentiments and sincere condolences. The president welcomed the members of the delegation. He said: Syria is your country. The more brothers are away from each other the more they miss each other. When I say that Syria is your country, it is not that this is a favor from me, or that I expect anything in return, it is a reality. These are our feelings regardless of the political and geographical reality. You all know about history and the sentiments of the Syrians and their pan-Arab view. All the Arab boundaries we are living under are fabricated boundaries and this is a fact. Life itself shows the continuation of pan-Arab ties are stronger than any other ties. I believe that whoever says otherwise will be contradicting history's course and facts, and the development of human life. If there are people who claim that this is an exaggeration, then they do not at all express the Arab citizens' sentiments and logic. There are many nations, not just one, with different histories and language that are trying to come closer to each other. There has been a great deal of talk about interests during this historical stage and in light of international changes. This word became a popular term, as if it is everything. We say that when we talk about interests, we mean all interests. We do not only mean economic interests. We mean economic interests as well as mutual sentiments and culture and tradition. The president also spoke about the history of, and developments in, the Arab-Israeli conflict. He said that the media in Israel always says that Syria is threatening Israel's security. He added that even during the peace talks, the Israelis talked about this. Some foreigners who visit us talk about the Golan and how it is a threat to Israel's security. We refer them to the UN Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization dealing with clashes on the Syrian-Israeli front since 1948. With the exception of one or two resolutions, on which there are differences, there are more than one hundred resolutions that condemn Israel. The president talked about the Middle East peace process. He said: We hope to God that peace, which we and the world are talking about, will be achieved. In fact, Syria is the one that opened the door to peace. After the 1973 war, we accepted Resolution 338 and its main pillar, Resolution 242. In our written interpretation of this resolution to the United Nations we said that we accept the resolution on the basis that it means withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and securing the rights of the Palestinian Arab people. Meanwhile, Israel did not accept Resolution 338 under the pretext that Syria read in it something that was not there. In the end, however, they agreed to a cease-fire on this basis. We have a strong stand in terms of arguments, resolutions, and logic. Our stand does not leave much room for the logic of others. You all know that many initiatives have been launched since 1973. Finally, there was the U.S. peace initiative, which in our opinion was the best initiative -- one that is clear and based on the principles that have always been reiterated by the Arab side. These principles call for the exchange of land for peace, based on Resolutions 242 and 338. We always said that we wanted a peace based on the UN Security Council resolutions, which stipulate a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and the rights of the Palestinian Arab people. All of this was stressed during our talks with the delegations that have visited us from the countries that have contacted us. The U.S. initiative came in response to this issue. You recall that before Syria replied to the U.S. initiative, Shamir gave his rejection and sent a letter to the U.S. President at the time making the rejection clear. As for us, after we saw positive points in the initiative, we said that we agreed to it. It goes without saying that Shamir was not in a good position when we accepted it. At the beginning, Shamir believed that by rejecting the initiative, he would be obstructing the peace process. But, the reply of Syria and the Arab side embarrassed him a great deal and the peace process was launched. Shamir and his government stepped down without him ever saying to the Americans that he agreed to their initiative. All the attempts and efforts of the Americans succeeded only in making him agree to participate in the Madrid conference, without agreeing to the initiative as a whole. During all the time that Shamir's government remained in power, no progress was achieved and not one step was made in the peace talks. Then came the present Israeli government under Yitzhaq Rabin with the slogan of peace that it raised. We said: This augurs well. The truth is that the atmosphere of the talks improved with its advent, but the talks themselves did not improve or progress. The Israeli side continued to evade discussing any topic dealing with substance. They started to get closer to essential issues. However, no progress was achieved. They said they would submit new ideas. But, actually, they were new demands submitted to the Arab side. So long as the matter did not deal with substance, we used to give and take and to make initiatives. But on substance, there is no possibility for compromise or placation. Substance remains substance. Syria has offered a great deal since the beginning of the peace process. On the opposite side, the Israeli government has not offered anything to push the peace process ahead. Syria used to take initiatives, make proposals, and submit steps the Israelis themselves said were positive. Sometimes they even described them as important, but they always used to say that more is needed. After the talks started, Syria submitted the first written paper. It was a document the Americans described as a historic document. The Israeli side described it as very important. However, in the next session with the Syrian delegation, they said: This is good but not sufficient. After some time we offered peace in exchange for land. They said: This is good, but not good enough. Our foreign minister then proposed complete peace for complete withdrawal. They said: This too is good, but unclear. They continued to submit other things that have nothing to do with the peace process. Thus, matters used to go backward. Israel's stands in all the discussions on the peace process are stands that say: Give and keep giving. Recently, the European Union chairman visited us. I told him that Israel tries to carry out blackmail. It gives nothing, and wants to discuss security and all issues in which it alone is interested, saying the others have to wait. These are impossible demands. The Israelis have submitted matters that are very far from the peace process. That's why no progress was achieved. I believe that several Western countries consider Israel an element hampering the peace process. As for our stand, it has become clear to the Americans, the Russians, and all the people that we want a complete and comprehensive peace. If peace is not comprehensive, one cannot describe it as peace. We, the Arabs are one nation even if there is enmity between us. The Americans are now really talking about a comprehensive peace and they have convictions about this. Our relations with the United States now are much better than before. Had the issue merely been Syrian-American relations, there would have not been any problems. We have great doubts that Israeli officials do not seek peace. We have doubts, but we have not reached any final conviction. Such a matter will be either proven or disproven by time. We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know this. We really want peace, while they only speak about peace. In light of what they are proposing, it seems that their vision of peace is not the same as ours. Therefore, we will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our peace. Our position is very strong because we are the owners of rights. International changes will not force us to retreat. Peace means rights. In other words, each party has its rights and each party is the master of itself and its interests. This is our understanding of peace. When we said the peace of the brave, we meant that each party will achieve full peace with all its rights, and that each party will not humiliate the other. Addressing the delegation, the president said: I warmly thank you for your visit to offer condolences on the death of my son. As I said a few days ago, my son is like the rest of the citizens. He might have had skills that do not exist in one of his colleagues, as happens in every place and in every family. Except for the human feelings placed by God in people, all my sons in Syria are equal to me. When my sons were still children living with me at home, I always pushed them to the front to be ready, like all Syrians, to defend the homeland, the Arabs' rights, and the interests of the Arab nation. The loss of any skilled person whether here, in the Gulf, or in the Maghreb is a loss for everyone and for the homeland. I, as well as the citizens, viewed the tragedy from this angle. If you saw the Syrian citizens during the past days you saw the emotional participation of our people. I know our people and their stands in all events and circumstances -- it is the same stand in the face of all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of aggression, and all that take place in accordance God's will. If the deceased can know what happens after his death -- and this means knowing unseen things -- our son will be happy for meeting his brothers who came from Palestine [which was occupied in] 1948. [Text] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah spoke for the delegation, saying: We are pleased to hear this pan-Arab position you have just expressed. We have always been eager to meet with your excellency to hear these positions, which we have followed closely. We strongly support this position because it expresses the Arab nation's dignity, the Arab conscience, and the cause of freedom which cannot be divided anywhere. On this occasion, please allow me to deliver a brief speech in the name of the delegation's members to offer our warm condolences to our brother His Excellency Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, to his honorable family, to the Syrian Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people on the death of Staff Major Basil, whose death is a loss for the whole Arab nation. O Your Excellency the President: We share with you this disaster with our feelings, minds, and hearts because we are the sons of this nation and we are an indivisible part of the Palestinian people and the Arab nation. We came to express our sincere feelings and to offer condolences to your excellency. At the same time, we are pound of Syria's positions under your wise, rational, and brave leadership. We also appreciate these positions and realize that this sound, nationalist, and sincere pan-Arab position that you adopt may be the key to a just and comprehensive solution to the dispute in the region -- a solution you have called the peace of the brave. We also adopt the formula you have been proposing -- the peace of the courageous that which will guarantee rights to every nation. Otherwise, peace cannot be achieved. We know that there is an essential contradiction between the occupation and the cause of peace. Therefore, we urge the Israeli Government persistently and strongly through the Knesset and the political map inside Israel to carry out a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories; namely, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the occupied Syrian Golan, southern Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories, and to recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent state. We say this knowing that there is an Arab will that Your Excellency expressed during your meeting with President Clinton in Geneva. There, you represented the Arab nation. Our hearts were with you, and when you met with President Clinton, you, O Your Excellency the President, were representing the whole Arab nation and not just Syria's position. We value the position of militant Syria, the bastion of Arabism, which is striving to achieve the unity of this nation. We are for inter-Arab coordination. We would like to say, with all honesty, that inter-Arab coordination can help our Arab nation restore its rights and ensure a just and comprehensive solution, because a fragmented Arab position cannot help us achieve the accomplishments we seek. It is possible to achieve peace when Israel faces a well-coordinated and harmonious Arab stand. We are well aware that there are conflicting forces operating within the Israeli political spectrum. There are pro-peace forces that have recently staged demonstrations to protest the heinous Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Tens of thousands of people, including us, took part in these demonstrations. They demonstrated against the killings, and also to call for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace. The Israeli Government, however, has thus far failed to provide any cogent proof or evidence, in terms of practices, as you have just said, to show the entire world community, the Arab nation, and us, as citizens, that its position is sound. That is why we have demanded that the Israeli Government declare a willingness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. With regard to the issue of peace between Syria and Israel, the formula raised by President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', namely, the formula of full withdrawal in return for full peace, we would like to say that we are attempting to promote this formula within the Israeli political spectrum so that Israeli political forces may support this formula, and so that they may express full support for complete withdrawal from the Golan in return for a peace agreement. Of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands supportive of this formula. The number of people supporting this formula is increasing. Likewise, the Israeli Government is required to take practical measures toward the sons of our Palestinian people in the occupied territories, who are suffering from repression, torture, and heinous massacres. Thousands of martyrs have fallen, not to mention tens of thousands of wounded and detainees. Almost, each and every Palestinian house in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has lost a martyr, has had a wounded person, or has had a prisoner held in Israeli jails. Hence, we call upon Israeli rulers to change their policy toward our Palestinian people. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate again that we, the Palestinians who have continued to live in Israel proper since 1948, are committed to our Arab nationalism, to our true Arabism, to our Palestinian identity; and that we have neither succumbed, nor accepted humiliation. We have not been brought to our knees. With regard to Syria's position, which you have just explained, we share the same position with you. To us, you are a good example. How can the struggle battle be waged, except with heads held high with dignity and pride? Hence, I, on behalf of our people, who are represented by this delegation, salute you. This delegation came to Syria to extend to you our fraternal condolences on our people's behalf, and also to clasp your hand in your persistent march, and in your constant struggle to achieve the Arab nation's objectives. We are well aware that Syria, under your leadership, is working to promote the Arab nation's interests, to serve the Palestine question, and to protect the dignity of this nation, and not only to promote the Golan issue, which is confined to Syrian territory. Rather, you seek the restoration of all Arab rights. Given all this, we clasp your hands and beseech God Almighty to protect you, to grant you continued good health, and to render the march you are leading for the sake of Syria, which we deem our second home, a success. We take pride in Syria, in its president, in its leader, in its symbol, in its people, and in its government. Similarly, we hope that the Syrian people, our Palestinian people, and our Arab nation will achieve prosperity and progress. Concluding my talk, I would like to ask all brothers to read the opening chapter of the Koran to invoke God's mercy on the souls of the martyrs of the entire Arab nation, the Syrian martyrs, the Palestinian martyrs, and the martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque, and also on the soul of the valiant youth Basil al-Asad, whose death was a loss to all of us. A delegation member posed the following question to his excellency the president: When will the Syrian-Israeli negotiations be resumed? And what are Syria's conditions for a resumption of the negotiations? Yitzhaq Rabin has repeatedly said that he wants a summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad to accelerate the peace process? How would you respond to this request? His excellency the president answered this question, saying: We have an authorized negotiating team that holds negotiations with the Israeli delegation. This team is very reliable. When they make progress, we will discuss any requirements or prerequisites of the peace process. Nonetheless, the delegations have continued to mark time. Once they make headway, we will discuss any additional requirements, if there are any. Another delegation member addressed the following question: Mr. Rabin always reacts to your statements. The idea you are promoting concerns the attainment of comprehensive and true peace in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories. In reply to this, Rabin says that the extent of withdrawal must be commensurate with the scope of peace offered. My question is the following: What is the scope of the peace you are speaking of? His excellency the president answered this question, saying: Why have you not asked him about the extent of withdrawal he is speaking of. We have explained the kind of peace we are offering; that is, full peace. As for Rabin, he has not mentioned full withdrawal. There must be equilibrium. Were I in your shoes, I would pose this question to him. He has not mentioned full withdrawal. A third delegation member asked the following question: The Syrian-Israeli dialogue is a political dialogue. It is moving slowly at present. For how long will Syria remain engaged in this dialogue if it deems it a waste of time? His excellency the president answered this question, saying: Until we reach the conviction that there is no room for a just peace.
