FBIS4-55385 "dreeu093__a94030" FBIS-EEU-94-093-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Controversy Over Newspaper's New Name Controversy Over Newspaper's New Name AU1305103594 Prague CTK in English 0929 GMT 13 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1305103594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava May 13 (CTK) -- "Hardly have we started to appear and already problems are upon us," the revamped SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA (SLOVAK REPUBLIC) complains on its front page today. The daily, close to the former premier, Vladimir Meciar, used to be published as REPUBLIKA by the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA SR) but came out on Thursday [12 May] with a new name and the old layout. It is published now by the Salus limited company, which is co-owned by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The paper reports that Pavol Weiss, a leader of the Liberal Party, has lodged a complaint with the General Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether the paper has committed the criminal act of public defamation of the republic by its new name. At the same time, the culture minister has asked the publisher to change the name, although the abuse of the state name is only theoretical. On May 12, TA SR Director General Ivan Melichercik said that REPUBLIKA was originally intended to be purely a news agency paper but owing to its marked political bias it became "incompatible with the fundamental principles of a news agency". From the beginning of its existence REPUBLIKA "dragged a boulder of debts behind it"; this contradicted TA SR's legally defined status as a public corporation, which is not permitted any loss-making entrepreneurial activity. "TA SR's divorce from REPUBLIKA proceeds solely from these premises," Melichercik stated.
