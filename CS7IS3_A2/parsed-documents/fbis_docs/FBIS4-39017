Committee Chairman Mikhail Zadornov thinks the budget calls for serious correction, but it should be accepted precisely in the shape submitted by the government. He pointed out that the main indicators of the level of expenditures, revenues, as well as the budget deficit were already approved in the first reading and cannot be changed, whereas an item-by-item redistribution of expenditures is not ruled out.
