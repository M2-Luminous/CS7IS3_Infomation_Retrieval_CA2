This goal has been set out in a document jointly issued by the State Science and Technology Commission and the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. China will first introduce a set of personnel, employment, medicare and old-age social security systems in high-tech development zones, pioneer cities singled out to experiment with new economic and scientific and technological reform measures, as well as in regions that have a large number of scientists and technicians. A public housing fund for the benefit of young scientists and technicians will be initiated in scientifically and technologically- advanced areas so as to tackle worsening housing shortages. According to the document, the central government will increase scientific and technological input in central and western China in a bid to narrow the widening economic gaps between those regions and the coastal areas. China will also reinforce the scientific and technological muscle of small and medium-sized enterprises, rural and township undertakings and poverty-stricken rural areas, the document stressed. It said that the central government is encouraging scientific research institutions to become technology-intensive modern enterprises. Well-positioned high-tech enterprises will be allowed to issue and list stocks in and outside the country, with shares in the form of technology allowed to account for as much as 30 percent of the total registered capital. Meanwhile, foreign trade enterprises and scientific and technological bodies will be given the green light to organize multi-functional international commercial firms and foreign trade enterprise groups, according to the document. It notes that China encourages scientific and technological departments to increase overseas capital and set up equity and cooperative ventures, scientific and technological businesses, as well as development funds for other industries. According to the document, another development priority will be given to non-governmental scientific and technological undertakings. The government will choose some non-governmental high-tech enterprises to raise funds and invest abroad so as to help translate them into transnational companies. To promote international cooperation, China will allow research institutes, institutions of higher education and enterprises with foreign trade rights to invest, run branches and engage in other activities abroad, such as research and development, production and marketing. They are also allowed to jointly set up research institutes and laboratories with foreign partners. At the same time, the document said, China allows and encourages overseas enterprises, organizations and individuals to set up technology-intensive enterprises and solely or jointly run, with their Chinese counterparts, research institutes, labs, experimental centres and other development projects. Starting from this year, China will set up a new national award for research achievements in the agricultural sector. China will also raise the salary standards for scientists and technicians to an internationally comparable level by the end of this century, without ceiling. To make the bold reform measures a success, China will raise the national scientific and technological development and research fund to above 1.5 percent of the gross national product by the year 2000. Meanwhile, China will promulgate a complete set of laws and regulations to guide the country's scientific and technological development.
