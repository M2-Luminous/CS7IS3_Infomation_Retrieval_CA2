In 1993, when the Shanghai securities market developed at its fastest pace, the number of stock listing leaped by 2.2 times, and the total shares on the market surged some 4.5 times, and when it came to companies listed on the market, they went from only two earlier in the year and expanded to 36, and there was 2.8 fold increase in the number of member securities traders, while in particular, the market's annual transaction total reached a volume of 500 billion yuan, making up half of the total volume of Shanghai market transactions. Shanghai's planned development target for this century is to again ascend to the position of being one of the country's, and even the Far Eastern region's, economic, financial, and trade centers. Shanghai's securities transaction market has in a period of just over three years, been the first to take the lead in tracing out a market domain that extends to the entire country. The Shanghai Stock Market has already broken through regional barriers, and extended over national borders, converging into the systemic circulation of the international capital market. More than three years ago, on December 19, 1990, in the Shanghai city government's tall gray building, the Shanghai Stock Exchange opened for business. This was the new China's first Stock Exchange, and from this emerged China's first new and developing capital market. What history must tell later generations includes: on that day, within the 477 square meter exchange hall, 46 dual broker seats, the hall's main wall contained a 4.7 meter long, 2.7 meter high electronic screen, which immediately displayed the transaction situation of 8 stocks and 22 bonds, while the transaction center computer network linked up more than 100 terminals. The first batch of member stock brokers amounted to only 25 people, while the first market volume of business totalled 10.3 million yuan. Today, looking at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, at this location there are 6 transaction halls in use, with 2600 seats, and the number of stocks on the market has increased to 119, while there are now 481 members. In the space of three years, the Shanghai stock market overall volume of business has exploded from 280 million yuan to reach 20.1 billion yuan, and the market price total value has also gone from 1.3 billion yuan to 250 billion yuan. At the same time, the number of securities investors has expanded from 30 thousand to over 4.6 million people. The volume of trade on the Shanghai Stock Market, from the early day totals of 20 million yuan has grown to the present greatest volume of business close to 4 billion yuan. According to an analysis by experts, this is comparable to the 1992 level of the 100-year old "world class" Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This means that the "three year old child" Shanghai Stock Exchange is comparable to the "one hundred year-old man " Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and it's "appetite" is only different by a year's level. At present, more than 90 percent of the members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange are securities traders from various locales throughout the country; more than 70 percent of the investors are from provinces and cities outside Shanghai, spread over cities and towns and even reaching the border regions; in the Shanghai securities market, there are already more than 1100 securities business sites. The Shanghai Stock Exchange at present has already established links with the Fuzhou Securities Trading Center and succeeded in operating for 3 months, and also plans to complete major links with 10 securities trading centers including those in Guangzhou, Haikou, Chengdu, and Shenyang. What this series of numbers represents is the fact that there is no doubt that Shangai has already started down the road to becoming the radiation center for China's securities market. In addition, its rapid development has also gotten the attention of securities circles in New York, London, and Tokyo, and they are saying "this is a fastest new and development capital market in history." There are some foreigners in the business who predict that between 2010 and 2020, the Shanghai Stock Market will become one of the largest stock markets in the world. Since the emergence of Holland's Amsterdam Stock Market in 1613, in stock trading activity there have been 380 years of development in world economic history, and in the three year period since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, through the use of modern high technology methods, the operational methods and market efficiency of the Shanghai securities market stand in the front ranks of current world stock markets. At the moment, the Shanghai Stock Exchange possesses an electronic computer system that handles 1800 transactions per second, and securities transactions are comprehensively implemented by computer automatic competitive price transactions, while a special purpose space satellite and earth laser fiber optic data transmission stereo communications network has been established; there has been a comprehensive implementation of a no-paper system for securities transactions, and an automatic ownership transfer system has been implemented, along with same day accounts settling, and a central registration accounts closing system comparable to international standards has been formed. Taking the emergence two years ago of new China's first RMB special stocks on the Shanghai securities market as an indication, the Chinese mainland's securities markets in reality are already moving towards international capital markets, and last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange's B shares listings went from 9 to 22, while the market overall volume increased from 800 million yuan to more than 1.8 billion yuan; in addition, at present 50 overseas securities trading house representatives have seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and this means for foreign circles that the door to China's securities market is wide open. Last year, the mainland directly entered overseas capital markets with six large enterprises including Qingdao Beer, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangdong Boat International, Magang Shares, and Kunming Machine Tools, and at the same time on the Hong Kong market H shares, their A shares also started to trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Media circles will view this as the erection of bridges between the Chinese mainland and overseas capital markets. As China's first capital market launched during reforn and opening, the Shanghai securities market is already having an ever greater deepening effect on China's economic activity. Last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange ignited the "Baoyan Disturbance," following on the heels of this was the "Wanshen Incident," which was a precedent for new Chinese enterprises to use market methods for transferring property rights. It indicated that China's securities market, in the same way as the international securities market, is striding towards the function of becoming a multifaceted capital market. Stock markets not only serve as vehicles for enterprises to raise funds, but also provides a concrete method for thousands and thousands of investors to directly participate in financial investment, and participate in share enterprise management; they also serve as a mechanism for enteprises to transform management, and better allocate property rights and resources. Shanghai Stock Exchange General Manager Wei Wenyuan [1414 2429 3220], describes prospects for the development of the stock market in Shanghai over the next two or three years as follows: acceleration of the process of market internationalization, and the attraction of international capital; the promotion of the opening of the government bond market to the outside; the struggle to have large, well-known foreign corporations list stock on the Shanghai market. When it comes to development of the bond market, taking government bonds as primary, we need to create new types of trading products, and not only have a futures buy back business, but also there is a need for having option dealing, to supply services for reform of the financial system, and coordinate central bank regulation of the currency supply. In Shanghai's most glamorous Pudong New Zone, the "Shanghai Securities Tower" has invested US$120 million and is each day "adding brick, adding tile." In 1995, this 3000 trading seat integrated securities services tower will use the world's most advanced information handling and transmission system in dealing with the market.
