The publication, STOKHOS, hailed an attack launched Sunday by a nationalist commando on an Albanian Army barracks in which two people were killed, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Tirana and Athens. It dismissed as a forgery a leaflet claiming the attack by a Greek group calling itself the Northern Ipirus Liberation Front. Northern Ipirus is the traditional name for southern Albania, which has a substantial Greek-speaking minority. "We are going to take Sarande from them whatever they do because we are stronger than they are and we have the law on our side," the publication said. STOKHOS, which has a 10,000 print run, also called on the Greek Army to attack Skopje, capital of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with whom Athens is in dispute over the name of the country which is also that of its northern province. Last month STOKHOS said that "self-defence groups" had been formed in eight villages in southern Albania with large Greek-speaking populations. On Tuesday Albania asked the United Nations Security Council to condemn the attack, which it said was launched by a "Greek terrorist commando of six to seven persons" wearing Greek Army uniforms. The commando attacked a barracks for new recruits about four kilometers (2.5 miles) inside Albanian territory. A sentry and captain were killed. Albania recalled its ambassador to Athens for consultations and expelled the Greek consul general from southern Gjirokaster following the attack, sparking a tit-for-tat expulsion of an Albanian diplomat from Athens.
