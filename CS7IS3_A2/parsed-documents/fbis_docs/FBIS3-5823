The author of the article says: Today our socialism is giving full play to its advantages and vitality as socialism with a strong chuche character, which was chosen by our people themselves and has been built by them with their own efforts, because it fully embodies the chuche idea. The chuche character of our socialism finds clear expression, above all, in that all the lines and policies, strategies and tactics are worked out from the stand of chuche and they are carried into practice to the letter. In our country today all the lines and policies of the party and the state are shaped in conformity with the aspirations and demand of our people and the specific conditions of the country on the basis of the chuche idea. The dear leader who regards the people as his teacher and respects their will to the maximum makes it a rule always to find himself among them and work out all the lines and policies in conformity with their aspirations and demand. All the lines and policies of the party and the state in our country serve for the creative life of the popular masses and contribute to the increase of the chuche character of our-style socialism. The chuche character of our socialism also finds manifestation in regarding the popular masses as the driving force of socialist construction and resolving everything by enhancing their role. The question of bringing up the popular masses to be the driving force of socialist construction has been successfully solved in our country under the wise guidance of the dear leader. He gives scientific answers to the questions raised by the times and revolution with his extraordinary intelligence and energetic ideological and theoretical activities and guides the popular masses to keep the socialist idea as their creed. He has brought up our people to be a people strong in independence by guiding them to break through difficulties and trials in their way by their own efforts in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance with high consciousness of being the driving force of socialist construction. The strong chuche character of our socialism is powerfully demonstrated in that it is confidently advancing along its path, not wavering under any circumstances. Ours is a people who have keenly realized in the course of building socialism under the leadership of the party that only socialism provides them with genuine freedom and happiness and the cause of socialism is invincible. The imperialists' moves to blockade and stifle our socialist system politically, economically and militarily, hating it as a thorn in the flesh, have been intensified as never before. But our people are taking great strides in socialist construction, united around the dear leader in one mind.
