Denuclearization in Northeast Asia cannot be realized if the Korean peninsula does not become a nuclear-free zone, and if Northeast Asia does not realize denuclearization, we cannot expect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. Therefore, realizing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a grave task of the times. Nevertheless, while running counter to the intention and demand of the times, the South Korean puppets today are conspiring with outside forces to all the more heatedly develop nuclear weapons. A concrete example of this is the fact that the South Korean puppets are promoting to develop a fast-breeding reactor. A fast-breeding reactor is an atomic reactor that produces high-purity plutonium, which is raw material for producing nuclear weapons. The South Korean puppets have promoted the development of the fast-breeding reactor for a long time. Since the 1980's the South Korean puppets had started the development of the fast-breeding reactor and it has currently reached a very grave stage. In 1984, the South Korean puppets concluded an agreement with a European country, which possesses the most advanced technology in the world in developing the fast-breeding reactor, to introduce the high-breeding reactor. It thus started to introduce its core technology, design, and experimental reactor facilities. In the late 1980's, it completed various technological preparations and experiments necessary to develop positive reactors. Also in the 1990's, after going through the experimental stage, it started to develop it on a full-scale. According to nuclear experts, the conceptional and budgetary design of the positive reactors has already been completed in South Korea, and the overall amount that has been invested is 118.3 billion won. Currently, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is receiving support and recognition from the world's social circles on developing the fast-breeder reactor, and is carrying out diplomatic activities by bustling about here and there to demonstrate a legitimate justification. The puppets are not only all the more producing plutonium within South Korea, but they are also bringing more of it in from other countries and are appropriately maintaining the production process itself to reprocess it. The so-called chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the South Korea National Assembly said that we cannot transfer other countries' nuclear fuel. This clearly shows how much the South Korean puppets are persistently clinging to nuclear development. Regardless of all the facts, in an interview with THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that they do not have any intention at all to independently develop nuclear weapons. This is a poor excuse to avoid criticism from the world community, which is leaning toward them. This shows how much he is filled with falsehood and hypocrisy. Papers of various countries, including the United States and Great Britain, view that plutonium already stored by South Korea amounts to 10 tonnes and that it will increase to 24 tonnes in the year 2000. As such, even though the South Korean puppets are acting as the shock brigade for their nuclear development, they are trying to mislead the world as if we have some kind of a nuclear problem. On 4 May, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that during the past one year we have continued nuclear development and that North Korean nuclear development must be restrained in whatever way. Such a remark by traitor Kim Yong-sam is aimed at completing their goal of being armed with nuclear weapons by accelerating the development of their nuclear weapons under the protection of the U.S. nuclear umbrella by making it so that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cannot reach a package settlement at the DPRK-U.S. talks in whatever way. Nevertheless, nothing will be gained regardless of how the South Korean puppets plot to harm us with the nuclear issue. The world's people who treasure justice and truth and love peace have a clear insight of the true nature of the scheme being carried out by the South Korean puppets. The more the Kim Yong-sam ring accelerates their nuclear development by finding fault with our so-called nuclear suspicions, the more their true nature will be revealed before the world's people. The South Korean puppets must correctly know that their reckless maneuver to develop nuclear weapons will only bring about a result of digging their own graves. They must immediately stop the play of putting the calamity of a nuclear disaster on the heads of the fellow countrymen.
