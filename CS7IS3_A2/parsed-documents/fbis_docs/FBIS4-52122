In response, the Bundesbank in Germany and central banks in European nations have made clear their postures to keep the dollar from further falling in its value by launching their coordinated intervention in foreign exchange markets to buy dollars. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen has issued an emergency statement asserting that a further slide in the dollar's value would serve no purpose. In reaction, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] has assigned the London Bank to intervene in currency markets. In the wake of the most massive coordinated intervention by the currency authorities of Japan, the United States, and European nations in the currency markets to buy dollars, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar, which had been approaching a historic high, has plummeted to 102 yen per $1. Commenting on the coordinated intervention by major industrialized nations in currency markets to buy dollars, a BOJ source made it clear on 4 May that Japan will aggressively intervene in currency markets to keep the yen from rising steeply in its value against the dollar, saying, "We will do everything we can to keep the yen's exchange against the dollar stable in the future." The BOJ source welcomed the coordinated effort by the United States and European nations to buy greenbacks and said, "The BOJ strongly supports a statement issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen." The the Ministry of Finance [MOF] has said: "It cannot be said that recent fluctuation on foreign exchange markets reflects economic fundamentals. Japan, too, is concerned about that fluctuation" (according to the International Finance Bureau of the MOF). The MOF also has made it clear that Japan will make the coordinated intervention in the currency markets in concert with the currency authorities of other major industrialized nations. A source well versed in the currency markets has said, "With the coordinated intervention in currency markets to buy dollars, it has become difficult for Japan to continue selling dollars." There is a view that despite the massive coordinated intervention, the dollar's rise in its value has been relatively minor. The same source also has said that Japan will watch whether the currency authorities of other industrialized nations will continue their intervention in the foreign exchange markets to buy greenbacks. In response to the coordinated intervention by the United States and major European nations in currency markets to buy dollars and the statement issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on the evening of 4 May issued an statement saying, "Japan shares the common perception that recent drastic fluctuation in the currency markets cannot be justified from the standpoint of economic fundamentals." In the statement, the finance minister pointed out the U.S. intervention in the currency markets as an "evidence of cooperative relations between Japan and the United States" and expressed the hope that the speculative selling of the dollar and purchase of the yen will be stopped. He also indicted that the Japanese Government intends to aggressively intervened in foreign exchange markets in the future.
