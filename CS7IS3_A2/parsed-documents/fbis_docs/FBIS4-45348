Its purpose was to trap the members of the Arellano Felix family and its accomplices, according to the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) first commander in the state, Javier Norona Guerrero. He added that the operation was conducted on the export lanes by 100 Federal Judicial agents who, besides seeking "escapees," were also looking for possible drug shipments on those bridges. Norona Guerrero claimed that the instructions from the PJF director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, who visited Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, today, are to continue the search for the Arellano Felix brothers and Juan Garcia Abrego. The latter apparently was here a few days ago. He noted that the thorough inspections of departing vehicles were made strategically. The sides of the lanes were blocked by a group of Judicial Police agents armed with "banana clip" weapons, while others requested identifications and searched automobile trunks. Although Carrera Fuentes left this town today, a PGR group led by Commander Jose Luis Patino is reinforcing the search for Garcia Abrego and the Arellano Felix group in the Casas Grandes region. As for a possible "tipoff" to the fugitives, Norona Guerrero explained that there was none, because the measure is part of the permanent campaign to find the aforementioned drug traffickers. Before leaving Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera announced that a security corridor had been formed from Tijuana to Matamoros, to prevent the Arellano Felix group and Garcia Abrego from leaving Mexico.
