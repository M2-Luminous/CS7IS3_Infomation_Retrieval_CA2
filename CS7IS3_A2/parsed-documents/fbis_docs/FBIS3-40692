Serious public misconception is another. And in no case is the information gap more severe and the reaction more spontaneous than in pharmaceuticals. The popular horror story is of product patents in the pharmaceutical sector engendering monopolies and, thus, higher prices. Such an outcome, if possible, is obviously undesirable for a country as poor as India. The story, however, is rather fanciful. Roughly eight drugs are relevant in this context--Rifampicin, Bromhexine, Captropril, Salbutamol, Norfloxacin, Mebendazole, Ranitidine and Naproxen. Patents for only three, Captropril, Ranitidine and Norfloxacin, have not expired yet. The other five, due to expiry of their patents, are now classified as generic products. The three drugs for which patents are still valid will become generic products before the ten year adjustment period in the Dunkel draft for changing patent legislation is over. Of course, this does not cover the new products that will inevitably make their appearance. Product patents will apply to them. But to automatically conclude this would lead to higher prices is erroneous. Substitutes for the therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs are available, without any great difficulty and not at extraordinary prices. These drugs presently constitute the essentials in pharmaceutical markets. It is extremely unlikely that this position will be radically changed. In that case new products, being new therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs will be patented no doubt, but by virtue of the existence of substitutes will not be produced as monopolistic commodities. The spectre of unaffordable prices, foreign companies making hay while the majority of Indians suffer under the new patent regime is thus at best overimaginative. And of course the government is to be blamed squarely for not making that clear. This is not merely a public relations disaster. It is unpardonable callousness given the multilateral trade treaty impinges on several fronts. That Parliament and the people were so ill informed about the nation's most important international economic agreement is however not surprising. A similar combination of ignorance of the norms of public debate in a democracy and inability or unwillingness to put forward its case when it has an excellent one is evident in the case of economic reforms. India's brave attempt to change its economic course is being conducted amidst ridiculous official taciturnity. Parliamentary debate as a result, as in the case of the Dunkel draft discussions, has rarely risen above partisan rhetoric. And even in that, the Congress members have been uncomfortable cheerleaders for reform, all the talk about ushering in change lacking the solidity that comes from a forthcoming and confidently articulate government. The Opposition, naturally, has had considerable success in tarring reform with virtually any brush it has chosen to--anti-poor, pro-exploitative international capital, means to selling the nation's economic sovereignty. Part of the problem is in the fact the Congress lacks a "great communicator." The prime minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has comfortably proved his disadvantage in this field, and other senior party leaders are, when economically literate, not charismatic and when charismatic not capable of explaining "the new economic policies." But governments can get messages across even without persuasive communicators. The vast propaganda machine at their command doing the job. A number of Latin American nations have done exactly that. That India has not simply reflects how shoddy its standards and visions of governance are.
