Hosokawa's decision was triggered by further revelations yesterday of his earlier financial deals and delays in the Diet (parliament) debate over the country's 1994 fiscal policy, which has been stalled for over a month. It could also speed up the polarization of the seven-party ruling coalition, already on the verge of division. Public attention is now focused on who will be named to succeed Hosokawa, who took office last August, whether his coalition can retain its clamp on power and whether his action will prompt a major political regrouping. The coalition is fast polarizing into two groups -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and their supporters in Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) on the one hand, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the United Socialist Democratic Party (USDP) and their JNP backers on the other. Observers say if the division becomes permanent, Hosokawa, still JNP leader, and Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito co-leader, may abandon the latter group and seek out opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members who are critical of the ability of their party leadership to form a new government. If this forecast materializes, Japan's political reorganization would sweep into act 2 of a drama which began last summer with the ending of the LDP's 38-year-long grip on power. The Diet was sent into a spin by Hosokawa's alleged shady financial deals, which go back to the early 1980's when he was a House of Councillors member. Suspicions have grown largely because Hosokawa's own account of the events have kept changing. In 1982, he borrowed 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. He claimed the cash was for repairs to his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and has insisted that the loan was repaid in full. But the opposition camp has pointed to irregularities in the papers Hosokawa presented to the Diet, such as entries in Sagawa account books that list transactions on days when the firm was closed or on dates that do not show up on the calendar, such as Sept. 31. In addition, a document Hosokawa claims is a receipt for repayment has no company seal or signatures. Such discrepancies have critics doubting the authenticity of the papers. Hosokawa has admitted some of the documents are "not in order", but said they were papers given to him by Sagawa after his own records of the transaction could not be found. Hosokawa is also plagued by allegations that he, and not his late father-in-law as he maintains, purchased 300 shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986. Of the 300 NTT shares officially registered with the father-in-law, 199 shares were sold after the stock was listed in early 1987, while the remaining 101 were passed on to Hosokawa's wife after her father's death. Announcing his resignation at a press conference, Hosokawa said he made the decision after new allegations were revealed about financial dealings involving his private office. He said he should take moral and political "responsibility" for the dealings, even though he was not aware of them. However, observers say Hosokawa's resignation came after the former Kumamoto governor failed to dismiss the mounting doubts over his own financial affairs. As one senior LDP official has said: "I find it hard to believe that the prime minister refuses to actively take the necessary steps to dispel the suspicions surrounding him." Hosokawa's resignation has ended the continuing rift between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over the premier's dubious deals, thus paving the way for the Diet to start, at last, deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which began on April 1. The row has delayed the start of the budget debate and the government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap budget. Analysts says that the Diet faces a number of pressing issues that need addressing, including stimulation of the sluggish economy, reconciliation of the strained Japan-U.S. relationship caused by the impasse in the bilateral trade framework talks and handling of growing tension over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsular. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was scheduled to leave for Marrakech, Morocco, next Tuesday for the signing ceremony of the new global trade agreement concluded last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is, however, not known whether Hata, the most powerful candidate for the premiership, can now actually go to Morocco amid such political turmoil at home, observers say. They say the domestic political unrest will in turn affect Japan's ties with the United States, over which a shadow has already been cast by the breakdown of the trade talks in February.
