[passage omitted] The Republic of Tanzania too has expressed its serious concern over the situation in Rwanda and indicated that it is planning to convene a meeting between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and Rwanda Government forces in Arusha this coming weekend. [passage omitted] For the record, the response of the Rwandese Government Forces to the above [cease-fire] conditions has been negative. Much has [word indistinct] in the outside world may hope from negotiations between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and the Rwandese Government Forces, it is doubtful that the negotiations between the two forces under the current circumstances would be of any use, if at all possible. What is the point, some ask, of such dialogue with the Rwandese Government Forces when large parts of that army have joined hands with the Presidential Guard and other murderers in committing acts of genocide. Of what use are negotiations with the Rwandese Government forces as long as the Rwandese Government Forces still obstinately refuse to agree to the disbanding and punishment of the Presidential Guard, after all the carnage and destruction which the Presidential Guard has caused. Is there any hope of an [word indistinct] agreement with the Rwandese Government Forces when they still refuse to disassociate themselves and deny legitimacy to the self-styled provisional government extremists which (?usurped) political power and is masterminding the ongoing atrocities. And what moral rights or legal rights does the 40,000-plus-strong army have to demand negotiations to determine the future of this country while they have stood by and still stand by on the fence, after two weeks, while hundreds of thousands of defenseless (?people) are slaughtered? Is there any hope of (?resolving) this conflict with the Rwandese Government Forces while they allow free rein to the clique of extremist murders who have [words indistinct] power, who use government resources, including arms and weapons [words indistinct], in exterminating whole sections of the population and boast about it in public as Mbonampeka Stanislas, (Donate Murego), Justin Mugenzi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse were doing the whole of yesterday on state radio.
