The decision comes after a barrage of public criticism over recent rate hike plans in the midst of a sluggish economy. Officials said the cabinet decision is intended to stem the rate increases in domestic telephone charges, rent for public housing, taxi fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance premiums. The cabinet will ask local autonomous bodies not to raise fees charged for their bus and subway services, they said. On Tuesday, Hata instructed chief cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa to move quickly in putting a freeze on public utility rates. Many political analysts said the freeze is Hata's apparent bid to rally public support for his minority government in the face of attacks from the opposition on his weak political standing.
