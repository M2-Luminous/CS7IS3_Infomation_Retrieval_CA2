As of 31 December, the Bank of Mexico's international reserves were $24.537 billion, a $6-billion increase at the close of 1992. These figures appear in the Bank of Mexico's 1993 annual report, 172 pages of Mexico's primary economic indicators. The Bank of Mexico cites economic trends following noteworthy achievements in Mexican economic development, like significant progress in structural changes and the control of inflation, which was reduced one digit to 8 percent, and increased work productivity and in midlevel salaries. Nevertheless, an economic slowdown may result from uncertainty regarding NAFTA ratification. Other factors that discouraged private spending in investment as well as consumption negatively impacted on employment. The gross domestic product grew 4 percent in 1993 and the surplus in the balance of payments was higher than in 1992, accompanied by a high level of enthusiasm in nonpetroleum exports and lower deficits in the trade balance and the current account. The trade balance deficit was $13.81 billion, a $2.5-billion reduction compared to last year's deficit. Crude exports were reduced while petroleum byproducts increased. The average price of Mexican petroleum on the international market went down from $14.83 to $13.20 per barrel. In its 1993 report, the Bank of Mexico forecasts an upturn in the Mexican economy for 1994, with benefits for all the nation's sectors.
