NRP officials were surprised by the larger than expected turnout. According to NRP estimates, the number of registrants was expected to be far lower due to the campaign's low public profile. NRP officials expressed the assessment that the relatively high turnout, which includes many new names, may lead to serious changes in the composition of the delegates to the NRP convention and in the party's list of candidates to the Knesset. The census was carried out prior to the internal elections for the party's convention and for the councils of the various branches, which will be held on 26 April 1994. [passage omitted] The last NRP census was conducted seven years ago. That was also the last time the party held internal elections. Since then, the NRP has twice postponed the census with the approval of the movement's tribunal. Once, because the date of national elections was brought forward, and a second time due to the local council elections. [passage omitted]
