Let me remind you that the previous session was just one vote short of the number needed to ratify the edict. But this time, after hearing a report from Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister and the president's representative at the session, the deputies voted by a majority for the introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces (with seven votes against and seven abstentions). Answering journalists' questions, Army Gen Pavel Grachev expressed satisfaction at the Federation Council's decision but stated that the troops will not go into the conflict zone "at breakneck speed." Around 3,000 men will be transferred to the deployment area only after the locality has been cleared of mines. According to Army Gen. Pavel Grachev's estimates, it will take three to five days to occupy the bridges and carry out engineering operations. The first to be moved up will be two battalions from the 145th Motorized Rifle Division (Batumi) and one parachute regiment from the 345th Airborne Troops (Gudauta). As soon as these three battalions "take control of the sector" a further two reinforced motorized rifle battalions will be flown in. Control centers have already been prepared, communications have been organized, and all the material and technical support is in place for the peacekeeping action for which, as Army Gen Pavel Grachev announced, "we have requested 10-11 billion rubles before the end of the year." One is bound to recall here that the federal budget has not been approved yet.... At the last moment the question of the federal budget was deleted from the Federal Council session agenda. When one of the deputies asked for the budget to be "heard" on 23 June anyway, Vladimir Shumeyko stated that this was impossible for purely formal reasons: The State Duma has not officially presented the draft law on the federal budget for the Federation Council's approval. In so saying he noted that, when the Duma adopted it on second reading, it did not take into account the Federation Council's 252 amendments to the budget and the budget was adopted by a "political consensus." After declaring that the budget is an especially political document, Vladimir Shumeyko made the following comment: "There is a version to satisfy everyone." At the same time he implied that if the Duma delayed in handing on the draft budget law to the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, the Federation Council would not have time to discuss it, "and then everyone will begin saying that the budget has not been adopted because of the Federation Council's arrogance. I must ask the Duma to speed up the adoption of a decision. At the very least it must be ready to adopt a good law for the government, where spending will be decided." Nevertheless, on the evening of 21 June and not without pressure from the pickets (around 100 placard-wielding representatives of defense sector enterprises had gathered by the entrance to the building),the Federation Council deputies did discuss the problems of the military-industrial complex and the draft federal budget and did adopt a request to the State Duma to submit the draft in good time.
