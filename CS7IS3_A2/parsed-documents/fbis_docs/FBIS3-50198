A total of 126 people live in the village. Some of them have sent two petitions asking the governments to allow the village to join Slovakia. "The first blow was dealt to a Slovak who accepted Czech citizenship, which the other side did not like. A smashed window and a destroyed new railway waiting room in Javornik are also nothing usual here," the mayor of the village said. Representatives of the local Civic Democratic Party (ODS) from the neighboring village of Velka nad Velickou handed over a protest against the transfer of the Czech territory. "It cannot be determined by the petitions how many Slovaks really want to join Slovakia. Some signatures can be questioned. We have owned some properties there since 19th century," an ODS official said.
