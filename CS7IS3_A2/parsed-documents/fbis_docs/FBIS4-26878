NPC Standing Committee spokesman Zhou Chengkui yesterday made public the draft Law on the People's Bank of China (PBC), which took 15 years to put together. Its principal goals are to legalize the bank's responsibilities, intensify its supervision and management over the financial industry, and ensure sound monetary policies. Two other draft laws to be considered by the NPC cover arbitration and auditing. The PBC said that major international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and World Bank had been consulted about the bank law. "The law will specify the role of the central bank in the country's financial affairs and benefit China's overall financial reform," Zhou said. China will have a banking system administered by the PBC, with State commercial banks forming the backbone and other financial institutions playing a part. The draft central bank law contains 46 articles in eight chapters. It spells out the organizational setup of the central bank, its business scope, relations with other departments and its supervision over financial bodies. One chapter covers issuing, circulating and protecting renminbi. A PBC official said that other financial laws, including a commercial bank law and an invoice law, are in the draft stage. Legal Moves Meanwhile, Zhou Chengkui said that the Standing Committee would continue to deliberate over a Labour Law, an Urban Real Estate Management Law and measures to introduce tough penalties against copyright violations. The arbitration law aims at improving the system for solving economic disputes and maintaining social economic order, he said. During its eight-day session, the legislature will for the third time review a draft securities law. Zhou said that major changes were made to the first version of the draft law, which now contains more than 200 articles. Also on the agenda are the examination of the final report on 1993 State finance, a review of the State Council reports on China's forestry industry and NPC special committee reports on the implementation of a Statistics Law and a Teachers Law, according to Zhou.
