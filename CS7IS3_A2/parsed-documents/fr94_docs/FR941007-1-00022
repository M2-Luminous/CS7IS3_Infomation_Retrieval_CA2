FR941007-1-00022 FR941007-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;119&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. This proposal is prompted by reports of chafing of the fire extinguishing tubes in a certain inboard strut to wing area. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing of the fire extinguishing tube; such chafing could cause cracking of the tube and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube, which could prevent the proper distribution of the fire extinguisher agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire. DATES: Comments must be received by December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;119&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
