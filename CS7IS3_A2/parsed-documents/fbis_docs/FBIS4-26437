The main tasks of the meeting are to study and arrange the work of deepening the enterprise reform, readjusting the product mix, promoting technological progress, strengthening the setup of the entrepreneur contingent, and ensuring the realization of the targets of "registering increases in three aspects and a decrease in one aspect and making improvement in one aspect"; to study and resolve the deep-layered contradictions and problems of fundamental and far-reaching nature in the industrial economic operation; and to discuss and revise several important documents on accelerating the province's industrial economic reform and development. This was an important meeting cosponsored by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. The meeting was chaired by Chen Liyou, executive vice governor of the provincial government. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial government, made speeches at the meeting. Guo Shichang, vice governor of the provincial government, made arrangements for the acceleration of the province's industrial economic reform and development and for the current industrial production. Provincial leaders Chen Yujie, Zhang Zhenhuai, Yu Zhenzhong, and Song Shuhua were present at the meeting. Present at the meeting were mayors, prefectural commissioners, vice mayors and deputy commissioners in charge of industrial work, city and prefectural organizational department directors, city and prefectural planning committee chairmen, city and prefectural economic and trade committee chairmen, and city and prefectural restructural commission chairmen, responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments concerned, and plant directors and managers of 50 key enterprises. Since the beginning of this year, our province has maintained an appropriate industrial economic growth trend based on the rapid development in 1993. The general situation has been good but, affected by the malpractice of the planned economic system accumulated for several years, many new situations in industrial economic reform and development have emerged in the province. Simultaneously, some prominent contradictions and problems still exist in the industrial economic operation. The industrial production growth rate has slowed down. The industrial enterprises' economic results are not ideal enough, and their products do not have a ready market. The amounts of products kept in stock have increased. The capital utilization rate is low. Due to the insufficient input of floating funds, enterprises are extremely short of capital so that the production development has been affected. Enterprises' production cost and deficits have increased. In particular, money-losing state-owned enterprises account for a large proportion. The investment in fixed assets has dropped by a big margin. Particularly, the localities seriously lag behind in terms of technological transformation. After analyzing the industrial economic situation in the first five months of the year, Cheng Weigao said: The slow pace of structural readjustment, the stagnation in mechanism reforms, and enterprise managers' shortage of motivation and pressure are the essential reasons for the province's slow industrial growth rate and low industrial quality. Fundamentally speaking, such a situation resulted from the facts that the leaders at various levels have paid more attention to the input to fixed assets and the increase in new production capacity but failed to shift the focus of the work on deepening reform, changing mechanisms, readjusting structures, and improving efficiency. The leaders at various levels should conscientiously think a lot about this and further straighten out their work ideologies. We must no longer pay attention to capital construction to the neglect of technological transformation, to the increase in input to the neglect of sciences and technologies, and to short-term interests to the neglect of long-term ones alone. We should be determined and adopt powerful measures to accelerate the reform of the enterprise managerial mechanisms, accelerate the pace of structural readjustment, promote enterprises' technological progress, promote the contacts between domestic and foreign markets, and ensure a ceaseless increase in enterprises' economic results. How can we promote industrial production? Cheng Weigao said: The key to promoting industrial production hinges on grasping good products, setting up good mechanisms, and selecting good plant directors. Good products are the essential conditions for enterprises' existence, good mechanisms are the sources of enterprises' vitality, and good plant directors are the soul of enterprises. Grasping good products means grasping projects with powerful competition, producing famous brands, creating products with competitiveness, and striving to produce first-class products. By so doing Hebei will be able to have a large number of famous-brand products occupy domestic and foreign markets. By improving mechanism, we mean making enterprises have full authority for management, assume full responsibility for their own profits and losses, and develop and regulate themselves. By successfully choosing plant directors, we mean boldly reforming the existing personnel system of enterprises to train and bring up a large number of modern entrepreneurs in line with the principle of making the party manage cadres and with the demand of the market economic system. On training and bringing up a mighty contingent of entrepreneurs, Cheng Weigao said that entrepreneurs constitute a decisive factor for the existence and development of enterprises amid market competition and are the representatives of advanced productive forces. The prosperity or decline of enterprises depends to a large extent on entrepreneurs. Thus, training and bringing up a mighty contingent of entrepreneurs constitutes an urgent task for accelerating the province's industrial and economic development and for improving the province's industrial and economic quality. What are entrepreneurs? Socialist modern professional entrepreneurs working for state-owned enterprises should at least have the following qualifications: First, they should have the virtue entitled to socialist entrepreneurs. That is, they should firmly follow the path of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics, persist in the purpose of depending on workers, staff, and the masses to run enterprises, be honest and impartial in performing official duties, abide by discipline and laws, pay attention to reputation, and refuse to pursue money worship and infringe upon the interests of customers. Second, they should have the courage, that is entitled to entrepreneurs, of being brave in competing with others, making innovations, running risks, and pioneering the road of advance. Third, they should have the knowledge entitled to entrepreneurs. That is, they should be familiar with the market situation, understand the persons of the same trades, understand the law of the economy and the practice of the international trade, and understand how to operate and manage enterprises. Fourth, they should have the ability entitled to entrepreneurs. That is, they should be able to make scientific policy decisions and to meet an emergency, be good at management, know their subordinates well enough to assign them jobs commensurate with their abilities, and be able to lead their enterprises develop continuously. Fifth, they should shoulder the duties, that are entitled to entrepreneurs, of ensuring the constant increase in the value of state-owned assets, the constant improvement in economic efficiency and labor productivity, and the continuous increase in income of enterprise workers and staff. All localities should rapidly establish the mechanisms of giving incentive and restriction to plant directors and managers and resolve the problem of there being no differences between good and bad performers. In line with the characteristics of market economy, all localities should make bold explorations for reforming the system on management of enterprise cadres. Various units at various levels should support enterprise leaders to exercise powers, shoulder duties, and run risks. Press and propaganda departments should give a wide publicity to the advanced and exemplary deeds of enterprise managers and dealers and should use correct public opinions to guide and help the people understand the position and role played by entrepreneurs in carrying out the modernization drive and overcome all kinds of prejudice against enterprise managers with a view to forming a fine practice of respecting, supporting, and cherishing entrepreneurs. Ye Liansong dwelt on some important opinions on the province's industrial reform and development. He said: To fulfill the goal of building Hebei into an economically strong province, we must pay attention to the following several tasks, viewing from the long-term interest and from the endeavor of resolving immediate difficulties: We should further deepen enterprise reform with focus on transforming mechanisms and establishing new systems. The focus of enterprise reform must be shifted from reducing taxes for and conceding profits to enterprises and readjusting policies in the past several years to transforming mechanisms and establishing new systems. With the clarifying of the relations of property rights, the strengthening of the incentive mechanism, and the perfecting of the restriction mechanism as the key contents, all localities and all departments should make overall planning and arrangements by proceeding from realities, should give different guidances based on different situations, and should formulate specific programs for transforming mechanisms and establishing systems for respective enterprises in line with their respective conditions. Through the ways of establishing modern enterprise system, reforming the corporate system, accelerating technological progress, and developing enterprise groups, we should help the large and medium-sized key enterprises with good economic efficiency, great competitiveness, and great potential of development to enhance their scale, grades, efficiency, and competitiveness. The small-sized enterprises with small amounts of profits or with deficits should closely combine the enlivening of themselves with the enlivening of their assets. By adopting the forms of contract, leasing, state ownership and civilian management, management on a commissioned basis, shareholding cooperation, property right reorganization, and estate transfer, the small-sized enterprises should promote the vitality of the whole and the part and make appropriate use of their existing assets. We should accelerate the pace of structural readjustment and promote the updating and upgrading of products. Markets should be taken as an orientation for readjusting the product mix. This is conducive to giving full scope to the strong points, avoiding weaknesses, and bringing their functions into full play. According to the basic ideology of "high-efficient heavy industry and intensive and precision light industry" and the "high, quality, large-scale, and export-oriented" orientation, we should unswervingly grasp structural readjustment. We should comprehensively implement the "dragon and tiger" plan and the plan for development by six groups to readjust the product mix of large and medium-sized key enterprises. We should vigorously cultivate and develop new high-tech industrial development zones and new high-tech industrial park zones to promote the rapid development of new industries. According to the spirit of "emulating rich and famous families, grasping projects with strong points, creating famous brands, and striving to be the first class," we should grasp the production of famous-brand products of strategic nature and with vast prospects. In the forms of amalgamation, bankruptcy, capital cooperation, stripping, and reorganization, the enterprises whose products are not readily marketable, that suffer serious losses, and that are hopeless in halting deficits should transfer their existing assets to the industries and enterprises with high efficiency. According to the industrial policies, we should accelerate the formulation of the provincial program for readjusting the industrial product mix and effectively guide enterprises to accelerate the updating and upgrading of products according to the macroeconomic goal. State-owned industrial enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized enterprises, should exert efforts to grasp the input in technological transformation. First, state-owned industrial enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized enterprises, should concentrate the input on technological transformation. Second, enterprises should emphatically grasp the development of new products, and the setup of advanced and high-efficient enterprises should be grasped. The governments at various levels and all financial departments should pay firm attention to collecting funds to ensure the supply of funds for promoting technological progress and to increase the returns on use of capital. To promote the development of new products, scientific research units, universities, and colleges are allowed to convert the products that they have manufactured into stocks, sell them to enterprises in the name of units or individuals, and then draw extra dividends according to the number of stocks. All large and medium-sized enterprises should set up technological development organizations. Simultaneously, the existing technological development organizations under enterprises should bring their functions into better play. Alleviating enterprises' strain on working funds should be regarded as a task of the most urgent importance and be firmly attended to. We should make good and full use of loans and strive to expand the scale of loans. We should fully support the enterprises whose products are readily marketable and of good efficiency, that are able to create foreign exchange through exports, and whose loans can be withdrawn; and grant loans to them for use as working funds. Loans should also be granted to the enterprises that suffer losses but are hopeful to halt losses and whose products are readily marketable and of good efficiency. We should organize forces to clear up the debt chains between enterprises, intensify sales, reduce the amounts of products kept in stock, enliven the existing capital, and upgrade the returns on use of capital. All banks should cooperate with economic and trade committees, try every possible means to enliven the existing loans, and tap the potential for use of existing capital. We should realistically grasp the current industrial production. First, we should expand the production of readily marketable products. Second, we should exert efforts to pioneer markets and intensify sales. Third, we should realistically grasp production management and strive to alleviate the restrictions by bottlenecks. Fourth, we should continue to launch the "grasping, helping, and halting" campaign.
