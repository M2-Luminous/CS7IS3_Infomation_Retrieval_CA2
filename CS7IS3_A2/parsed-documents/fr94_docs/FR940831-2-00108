FR940831-2-00108 FR940831-2-00082 Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due to LOCA Generated Debris (DRAFT); Availability The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published a FOR COMMENT draft of NUREG/CR&hyph;6224 ``Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due to LOCA Generated Debris,'' August 1994. This report presents a draft of the methodology developed to assess the potential blockage of BWR emergency core cooling system (ECCS) strainers by a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) generated debris. The report describes the analysis approach, models developed and summarizes initial calculated results of the loss of ECCS recirculation capability. A free single copy of draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6224, ``Parametric Study of the Potential for BWR ECCS Strainer Blockage Due to LOCA Generated Debris,'' may be requested by those considering public comment by writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. A copy is also available for inspection and/or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC.
