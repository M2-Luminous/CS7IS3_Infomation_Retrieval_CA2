He said that 25 to 30 soldiers and officers died daily. According to the Defense Ministry, over 2500 people died in the Russian Army but the committee believed that the real figure was at least twice that. A 19,000 rubles, about 9.5 dollars, pension is paid for a soldier who died in the line of duty but only to parents who are older than 50. No pension is paid to the family of an officer. Alexeyev said that the military prosecution office had not opened a single case against commanding officers of the units where soldiers were killed. No investigation of a death of servicemen in the times of peace has been brought to a conclusion. He also said that the human rights of servicemen and draftees were continuously infringed on. In particular, numerous youths whose weight was below the norm and who could not therefore be legally drafted were forcibly held in recruiting offices and fed until their weight was brought up to the norm and then sent to the Army.
