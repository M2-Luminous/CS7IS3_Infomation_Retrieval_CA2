Specifically, such materials were collected for the site of the South Ural nuclear power plant (NPP). The scope of this research program and the procedures used in the collection of pertinent materials are described in detail. The research program revealed that the Ural plant, which is under construction, is located in an area with favorable geological conditions and there are no contraindications with respect to recent tectonic movements against continuing construction because its site is situated within the limits of a unified morphostructural block. Moreover, the fault structures intersecting this construction site and the foundations beneath the reactors have not been rejuvenated during about the last 30 million years by local ruptures and zones of increased fracturing. The research program carried for this site is particularly important because it can serve as a model for other NPP sites where dangerous conditions may exist which should be detected before construction is initiated. It represents a considerable improvement over previous engineering programs used during study of NPP construction sites. Figures 6; references 24: 23 Russian, 1 Western.
