Answering a question put by the MBC on the evening of March 3, he made it clear that, although the repeal of the controversial "National Security Law" of South Korea was a sensitive matter, the U.S. Government would persuade South Korea to repeal it. He added that this demand of the United States to South Korea was motivated by its fear that the "National Security Law" might be abused. This final confirmation of the U.S. State secretary came shortly after the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry announced on March 3 that the remarks of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard urging the repeal of the "National Security Law" in South Korea had "turned out" to be an "expression of his personal hope", not the official position of the United States.
