Recruiters from the Caucasian republics are particularly active in this business, he noted. The Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a vigorous protest against illegal actions by persons recruiting mercenaries on the Russian territory, Grigoriy Karasin stressed. The Russian diplomat noted that "in accordance with international law, recruiting, deploying, financing and training of mercenaries is a grave crime. Such actions run counter to a friendly character of relations among states and cannot be regarded otherwise than doing them a serious damage. In accordance with international commitments and the existing legislation the Russian side is reserving the right to take all necessary measures to put an end to such actions by the law enforcement bodies". The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Russian citizens who have already become or intend to become "soldiers of fortune" to think better of it and give up such plans, and return to peaceful life. The Russian Foreign Office also appealed to all countries, first of all to members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, to take efficient measures to eliminate recruiting activities, including recruiting Russian citizens as mercenaries. "Taking into account the fact that the problem of recruitment goes beyond national borders and can be resolved only on the basis of consolidation of efforts of all states, we are expressing our readiness to hold consultations on practical aspects of the struggle against this dangerous phenomenon both within the framework of the Commonwealth and at a bilateral level," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out.
