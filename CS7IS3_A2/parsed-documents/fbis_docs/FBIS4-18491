FBIS4-18491 "drweu066_i_94008" FBIS-WEU-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 FRANCE Delors, Rocard Presidential Chances Analyzed Delors, Rocard Presidential Chances Analyzed 94P20593A 94P20593A CSO [Editorial Report] Following a statement by President Francois Mitterrand, who "exclaimed" that if he were 20 years younger, he would run again for president and "beat everybody," Francois Bazin comments in the 3-9 March Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR that "subtle" observers "decoded" the president's message as follows: 1) the Right is weakened by its internal divisions 2) the Left can win the 1995 presidential elections 3) it must have a candidate who can "seize the opportunity" 4) with Mitterrand unable to run "because of his arteries" and Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard out of the running "due to poll results," EC Commission President Jacques Delors is the only remaining candidate. According to Bazin, Delors "is benefitting from extraterritoriality." While he possesses experience, he is seen as a "new man" and has not been affected by the disenchantment of the French with Europe. Were the presidential candidate to be designated by opinion polls, Delors would be nominated, Bazin comments. However, Mitterrand has taught the Socialists that the laws of public opinion are unlike those that rule parties, and that "faith in one's destiny can modify the most delicate situation." Therein lies the difficulty of "operation Delors," Bazin contends. Delors himself has long wavered and his statements have contributed to confusing the issue. Meanwhile, only a Rocard "faux-pas" could deny him the nomination and the June European Parliament elections may in fact settle the situation. If the Rocard list receives less than 20 percent of the vote, many in the PS would abandon the first secretary, switching their support to Delors, Bazin contends. On the other hand, if a "window of opportunity" opens this summer for Delors, no one believes the EC Commission president would reveal his intentions before the end of 1994, when his presidency comes to an end. This leaves Rocard a valuable six months to overcome a possible defeat in the June elections. Bazin notes that in this case, the only solution for Delors partisans would be a strategy aimed at the progressive attrition of Rocard's positions, to let the PS leader understand that the preservation of his work demands his voluntary "self-effacement to the benefit of Delors, Bazin concludes. According to a brief article in the 24 March Paris weekly PARIS MATCH entitled "Will There Be a Rocard-Delors War?", Rocard acknowledges he is dropping in the polls at a time when the Left itself is on the rise. The article cites a close Rocard aide as saying that the PS first secretary must no longer confine himself to "beating on Balladur, but ought to widen his audience" by addressing people's problems and their solutions. The article also notes that Rocard is "lucky," because Delors has no intention of interfering with his plans in the belief that the PS leader has a right to run for the presidency. At the same time, a Delors confidante is quoted as pointing out that while the EC Commission president will "do nothing against Rocard," it does not mean he would not be a candidate if a "stagnating" Rocard decides not to run.
