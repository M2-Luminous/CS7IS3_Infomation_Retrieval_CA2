FR940524-0-00047 FR940524-0-00011 A number of operators that plan to retire their Stage 2 aircraft over the next 5 years have not taken advantage of the previously granted exemption from the upgraded DFDR requirement. Those operators of aircraft that plan to remove from service some airplanes by the December 31, 1994, noise transition compliance deadline and that are not using the exemption could also benefit from this rule change. Extension of the DFDR deadline will allow operators to forego installing upgraded DFDR equipment on some aircraft that would otherwise be retired within 7 months of the installation. The rule change will impose only minimal costs on society in the form of a reduction in safety because of the extremely low probability that one of the 740 airplanes potentially affected by this rule will have an accident during the additional 1 year. Moreover, if there were an accident involving one of these Stage 2 airplanes, the causes of such an accident would have to be determinable only with the additional data provided by an upgraded DFDR. For a safety benefit to be realized, this information would have to be used in rulemaking or some other agency action that would prevent a second future accident with a chain of causation closely resembling that of the first accident. The resulting probability of these two hypothetical accidents actually occurring once the rule change goes into effect is considerably less than the already remote possibility that one of the 740 affected aircraft would have a serious accident over this time period. The rule change will also require that each air carrier submit to the FAA documentation listing those Stage 2 aircraft scheduled for DFDR retrofit as well as evidence that it has ordered a sufficient number of flight data recorders to meet the May 26, 1995, compliance date for all aircraft on the list. The FAA has estimated that this paperwork information requirement will cost each affected air carrier about $25. The total cost of this provision will therefore not appreciably alter the overall balance between the costs and benefits of the rule change. Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The rule change is of a cost relieving nature and will therefore afford cost savings to individual part 121 operators. Under FAA Order 2100.14A, the criterion for a ``substantial impact'' is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one third of the small entities subject to the rule. For operators of aircraft for hire, a small operator is one that owns, but not necessarily operates, nine or fewer aircraft. This rule change will mainly affect part 121 scheduled operators, although some unscheduled operators could be affected as well. The FAA's criterion for a ``significant impact'' is $116,300 or more per year for a scheduled operator whose entire fleet has a seating capacity of 60 seats or more, $65,000 for a scheduled operator with a fleet including smaller aircraft, and $4,600 or more for an unscheduled operator. The extent of the annualized cost savings per aircraft resulting from the opportunity cost of capital that would be saved (i.e., what could be earned on alternative investments) would be $2,100 per aircraft, based on the assumptions used in calculating the potential total cost-savings resulting from this factor in the previous section (.07Ã—$30,000). A scheduled carrier with a fleet of smaller aircraft would therefore need to convert more than nine aircraft to exceed its threshold value of $65,000, in which case it would not be regarded as a small entity. A scheduled carrier with a fleet of larger aircraft would have to convert even more aircraft to exceed its threshold of $116,300. The threshold value for an unscheduled operator is only $4,600, however, as noted above. A carrier would therefore only have to convert three airplanes to exceed this threshold, using the estimate of cost savings derived above. No unscheduled operators responded to the request in the NPRM for information pertaining to the number of Stage 2 aircraft that they are planning to retrofit with noise abatement equipment. The FAA therefore concludes that a determination of no ``significant economic impact'' is warranted in the absence of contrary information. International Trade Impact Statement OMB directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The rule change will affect only U.S. air carriers because foreign carriers are not subject to part 121. The economic analysis of the final rule mandating that aircraft receiving an original type certificate before September 30, 1969, install DFDR's capable of recording the required number of parameters by May 1994 concluded that there would not be any trade impact. Therefore, the provision of relief from the original rule in the form of a deadline extension is not expected to have any impact on international trade. Federalism Implications The amendment would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, it is determined that this amendment will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federal Assessment. International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply with the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA is not aware of any differences that this amendment will present.
