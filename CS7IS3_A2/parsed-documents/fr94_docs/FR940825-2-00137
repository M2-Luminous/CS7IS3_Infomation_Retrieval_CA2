FR940825-2-00137 FR940825-2-00093 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34549; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;46] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 6 to a Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity Linked Term Notes August 18, 1994. On December 29, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change relating to Equity Linked Term Notes (``ELNs''). Notice of the proposal and Amendment No. 1 3 appeared in the Federal Register on January 26, 1994. 4 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change on January 31, 1994, Amendment No. 3 on March 9, 1944, Amendment No. 4 on April 28, 1994, Amendment No. 5 on June 27, 1994, and Amendment No. 6 on July 18, 1994. 5 This order approved the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 The amended rule language contained in Amendment No. 1 to the proposal was subsequently withdrawn by the Amex. See Amendment No. 6, infra note 5. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33483 (January 14, 1994), 59 FR 3745 (January 26, 1994). 5 Amendment No. 6 withdraws and supersedes the rule language originally proposed for section 107B of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''), as subsequently amended by Amendment Nos. 1 through 5. The changes proposed in Amendment No. 6 are fully described herein. See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office, Division, Commission, dated July 18, 1994 (``Amendment No. 6''). The Amex proposes to amend Section 107B of the Guide with respect to the listing criteria for ELNs. 6 ELNs are intermediate term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid securities, the value of which is linked to the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded common stock. ELNs may provide for periodic interest payments to holders based on fixed or floating rates, or they may be structured as ``zero coupon'' instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity. 7 ELNs may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity. 6 The Commission approved the listing and trading of ELNs on May 20, 1993. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32343 (May 20, 1993), 58 FR 30833 (``Exchange Act Release No. 32343''). The Commission subsequently approved an amendment to the listing standards for ELNs to provide for alternative capitalization and trading volume requirements for the underlying security. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993). 7 The Exchange has agreed to notify the Commission if an issuer of ELNs intends to provide for periodic interest payments to holders based on a floating interest rate. See Exchange Act Release No. 32343, supra note 6, at note 6. The Commission, at that time, may require the Amex to submit a rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act prior to permitting the Exchange to list an ELN with such terms. In addition to the general listing criteria contained in Section 107A of the Guide, 8 ELNs must also conform to the special listing criteria of Section 107B of the Guide which provide that: (1) Each issuer must have a tangible net worth of at least $150 million; (2) the total original issue price of the particular issue of ELNs combined with all of the issuer's other ELNs listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ'') may not be greater than 25% of the issuer's tangible net worth at the time of issuance; (3) each underlying linked stock must have either (i) a market capitalization of at least $3 billion and a trading volume in the 12-month period preceding listing (in all markets in which the underlying security is traded) of at least 2.5 million shares, or (ii) a market capitalization of at least $1.5 billion and a trading volume in the 12-month period preceding listing (in all markets in which the underlying security is traded) of at least 20 million shares; (4) the issuer of the underlying linked stock must be a U.S. reporting company under the Act; (5) the issuance of ELNs relating to an underlying linked stock may not exceed 5% of the total outstanding shares of such stock; (6) the linked security must either be listed on a national securities exchange or traded through NASDAQ; and (7) the linked security must be subject to last sale reporting. 8 Under Section 107A of the Guide, an issue of ELNs must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units and a minimum of 400 unit holders; (2) an aggregate market value of at least $20 million; (3) where cash settled, the settlement must be in U.S. dollars; and (4) where redeemable, a redemption price of at least three dollars. In addition, Section 107A provides that issuers of hybrid securities must have assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years. Issues not meeting these financial criteria must have assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $10 million, or alternatively, assets in excess of $100 million and stockholders' equity of at least $20 million.
