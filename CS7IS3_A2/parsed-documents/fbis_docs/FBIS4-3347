This was revealed at a national conference held here on comprehensive supplementary urban reform. The 18 cities are Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo, Anshan, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and Yanji. These cities, large and small, coastal and inland, are highly reform-motivated, with solid foundations in economic reform and economic development, and the experience drawn from the pilot cities could have great impact on the national urban reform. The cities will be the major areas of the new round of urban economic reform and their influence is expected to promote China's market economy, said Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the State Commission of Economic Restructuring. The pilot reform measures carried out by these cities include: -- Reform the property rights system to transform enterprises in line with common practices in modern enterprises in the world; -- Bring the market mechanism into full play in resources allocation, and cultivate and develop the market system; -- Change the functions of the government to serve the market development; -- Establish a sound social security system and reform the housing system. -- Carry on other supplementary measures in other fields to guaranteeing the overall economic reform. The vice-minister said that different from other pilot schemes, the 18 cities will not enjoy privileges as such cities previously did. "The experience drawn this way could be applicable in other places," Wang said, noting that preferential policies run against the market economy, which is based on competition on an equal footing and international practice. Wang's commission will be responsible for designing standards for the experimental work, establish a work conference system among pilot cities, a liaison system and an "assessment quotas system for reform experiments."
