That is the term used by the government since yesterday to describe the future of the former RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration]. At an extraordinary cabinet meeting, the Dehaene team settled this issue, which has been generating rumors for months. The state will keep control of the public enterprise and sell a maximum of 49 percent of it according to a timetable that has not yet been drawn up. But, the prime minister explained, "the main part of the yield will come in 1995-1996 rather than in 1994." What the government decided yesterday is in fact to proceed to the selection of one or several industrial partners for Belgacom. Supporting the analysis of Communications Minister Elio Di Rupo, it intends to strengthen the Belgian operator to enable it to face competition. This competition is already appearing, especially in the sphere of international communications, but will be complete from 1998, according to the European Council's decision. On that date, national telecommunications monopolies in Europe will come to an end. To survive, Belgacom will have to form an alliance with other operators. [passage omitted]
