A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) today, said that the recent discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium -- enough to make nine nuclear bombs -- at the nuclear fuel-making plant in Tokaimura, Japan is a "breach of the publicly recognized international law which must be dealt with seriously and condemned." He said this shows Japan's "much-touted 'three non-nuclear principles' are merely a 'screen' for stepping up its nuclear armament to a full scale. He criticized the noise Japan has made over the so-called nuclear issue of the DPRK saying it was a petty trick to conceal its own nuclear program and divert the public attention elsewhere. "Japan has been engaged in nuclear development over the past decades and the amount of plutonium it has held in hiding is by no means less than what has been discovered," said the spokesman. He asked the secretariat of the International Atomic and Energy Agency (IAEA) to give much attention to the question and take necessary measures accordingly. "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality," the spokesman noted. He said the Korean Government calls upon the governments of all countries in the world, international organizations and anti-nuke groups to exert "unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development."
