This sense prevails over all others in a little bit more than a third of those polled. It can be added that some 10 percent found it hard to answer the question on what they felt about Yegor Gaydar's quitting. Anxiety was experienced by 18 percent, distress by 15 percent. The main feeling in 17 percent was satisfaction, and if one takes into account the fact that nearly half of them are supporters of communists and national patriots, that feeling is quite deep. The answers to the question on confidence in some political leaders asked in the same All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion survey can be divided into two parts: the number of those who answered or did not answer the question on trusting a political leader, and the correlation between trusting and mistrusting. The first parameter seems to be as significant as the second one. Whereas the trust-mistrust balance is in the positive area, with more than half the respondents unable to say what they thought about the leaders, the result obtained seems to be doubtful. The trust-mistrust correlation and the known-unknown degree for all the leaders are represented below [diagram omitted]. The group of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy-Viktor Chernomyrdin-Boris Yeltsin-Yegor Gaydar is unified by the rather high degree of their being "well- known." The distribution of views about Grigoriy Yavlinskiy evinces what can be termed as the "Yavlinskiy phenomenon." He is trusted by twice as many people as those who do not trust him; nearly 35 percent, however, did not say what they thought about him. The prime minister's position appears to be ideal in the positive area with a rather low share of those who found the question hard to answer. The poll, however, had been conducted even before the final composition of the government was announced. The Boris Yeltsin- Yegor Gaydar crew remained in the minds of the respondents for some time after 20 January. Despite Mr. Gaydar's resignation, his name remains associated with the president's course. The other group is Andrey Kozyrev-Boris Fedorov. They are united by a positive trust-mistrust correlation, and a big number of those who found the question hard to answer. Vladimir Shumeyko and Anatoliy Chubays are found in the negative area with approximately the same number of those who assessed their activities. Two figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis and Gennadiy Zyuganov -- are found separately, and way below them is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, whose scandalous fame makes him known to a great number of respondents. Only 17 percent trust him, however, while 63 percent do not. Way down on the extreme right of the scale is newly elected State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. The number of those who did not answer the question on trusting him is two-thirds of those polled, whereas the trust-mistrust correlation lies in the negative area. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |trust |do not trust |hard to say | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
