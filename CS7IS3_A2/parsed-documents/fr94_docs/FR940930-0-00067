FR940930-0-00067 FR940930-0-00011 Accordingly, by the authority of 10 U.S.C. 301, 32 CFR Part 104 is removed and Part 199 is amended as follows: PART 104_[REMOVED] PART 199_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 199 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086. 2. Section 199.20 is revised as follows: ยง199.20 Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). (a) Purpose. The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries (set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator. The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for the Department of Defense and the other Uniformed Services (e.g., NOAA, PHS, and the Coast Guard) health care beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of CHAMPUS. (b) General provisions. Except for any provisions the Director, OCHAMPUS may exclude, the general provisions of section 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (c) Definitions. Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in section 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (d) Eligibility and enrollment ._(1) Eligibility. Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to the following individuals: (i) Members of Uniformed Services, who: (A) Are discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, under other than adverse conditions; (B) Immediately preceding that discharge or release, were entitled to medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) (except in the case of a member discharged or released from full-time National Guard duty); and, (C) After that discharge or release and any period of transitional health care provided under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefit under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. (ii) A person who: (A) Ceases to meet requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member of the armed forces under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D); (B) On the day before ceasing to meet those requirements, was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, (C) Would not otherwise be eligible for any benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. (iii) A person who: (A) Is an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member of the armed forces; (B) On the day before the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, (C) Is not a dependent of the member or former member under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(F) or (G) or ends a one-year period of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H).
