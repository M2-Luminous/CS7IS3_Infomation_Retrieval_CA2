An independent statistical index of contamination heterogeneity was offered: the Bravais-Pearson coefficient of linear correlation between soil and dry plant biomass radioactivity for demonstration of ``hot'' particles as an indication of relative extent of contamination. Accumulation of _b_ emitter radionuclides was studied in the above-ground portions of rye, oats, barley, wheat and peas raised in 1.5-liter containers with sod-podzolic soil taken in the 10-km zone of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as effects of soil micromycetes (Cladosporium cladosporioides and Penicillium rosco-purpurent) cultivated in Czapek's liquid mineral medium on dissolution of hot particles. Cesium-137 and Cerium-144 radionuclides were absorbed at variable rates by the plants, depending on stage of growth. The rates were higher when in subsequent planted specimens, mainly in rye and oats, affected by their precursors. Experimental data on radionuclide migration were obtained with the use of this index, and its usefulness was validated. Figures 2, tables 2, references: 8 Russian, 2 Western.
