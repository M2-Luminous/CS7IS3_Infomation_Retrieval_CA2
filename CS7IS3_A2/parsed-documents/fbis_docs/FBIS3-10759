The president announced the government is about to present a plan to further expedite the land transfer program so it ends in May, when the new agricultural cycle begins. Cristiani explained the plan allows the possibility of issuing land appropriation titles with a specific value for each beneficiary -- whether he is a member of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] or the Armed Forces -- and they can personally expedite the negotiation with land owners who want to sell their assets. The document can expedite the negotiation with land owners and the only remaining thing would be to sign a deed and grant financial aid through the Land Bank. The goal is to define the ownership of all the land, the president said. "Approximately 10,000 FMLN members have received these benefits and 10,000 are still pending; while barely 2,000 Armed Forces members are still pending," he said. Regarding the compensation demands from demobilized Armed Forces members, Cristiani said the government is complying with the peace accords' stipulations, and the protests are the result of a political movement. The problem is that, in certain cases, persons show up and demand compensation even though they are not registered to obtain the benefits within a given period; and former fighters are demanding their inclusion, and this is not foreseen in the peace accords. "No country granted the necessary aid to pay the compensation, which surpass the 200-million-colones mark, so the funds come from the nation's general budget," he asserted. Moreover, Defense Minister General Humberto Corado explained the Armed Forces are not trying to influence the 20 March electoral results; adding the corps' participation is constitutional and its work will be to place 14 helicopters at the disposal of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] for the transfer of tally sheets from the most distant corners of the country. "The TSE said the tally sheets' transfer will be supervised by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], the electoral boards, and the political parties," he emphasized.
