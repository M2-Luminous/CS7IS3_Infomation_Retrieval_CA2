The move indicates a significant split within the ranks of the former Civil Co-operation Bureau, the special forces killer commando which has been linked to the deaths of anti-apartheid activists. Another group of CCB operatives appears to have allied itself to the ultra rightwing. Luitingh told SABC's [South African Broadcasting Corporation] MONITOR this week his group had "no problem with the ANC. Although we won't join the new defence force, we will work for the new government if asked." A Uitingh associate said the group knew "we won't have problems with the ANC because we are supporting the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]." Confirming the contacts, Sexwale said Luitingh had "come to us in confidence, but not in secrecy. I passed them on to our intelligence department, which is in contact with them." The ANC had been in touch with the Angolan government which had "confirmed the group was involved in guarding oil installations in Soyo." Asked why he had been approached, Sexwale said: "I am not the head of the ANC's cultural department and these are not cultural workers. Everyone knows of my military background: I suppose they felt I was the right person to talk to." Executive Outcomes has denied its employees -- mainly former special forces and 32 Batallion soldiers -- have been involved in combat against UNITA [Popular Movement for the Total Liberation of Angola] forces, but announnced last week that four had been killed in reconnaisance missions in northern Angola. Former Namibian rugby player and 5 Recce [Reconnaissance] member Steyn Marais was killed a week earlier in an operation Executive Outcomes termed an "investigation into criminal activities". This is understood to mean Marais was involved in military activities against illegal diamond mining in the mineral- rich Lunda Norte diamond fields controlled by UNITA. Besides the Angolan government, De Beers is understood to have shown an interest in staunching the flow on to world markets of Angolan diamonds beyond its control. UNITA has financed its war against the Angolan government through diamond sales since losing the official backing of the United States and South Africa in the settlement which led to elections last year. Savimbi returned to his bush war after losing the elections. As increasing numbers of Luitingh recruits appear to be dying in Angola, the war of words with the "unreconstructed" faction within the former Recces has heated up. Former 32 Batallion commander Colonel Jan Breytenbach accused Executive Outcomes of luring people to their death with false promises of security work at U$10,000 a month. Sexwale had played a central role in facilitating contracts between Luitingh and the Angolan army, charged Breytenbach. "That's absolute junk," said Sexwale. "I would be proud to help organise the defence of the revolution and of democracy in Angola, but the fact is I had nothing to do with it. Luitingh's group was involved in Angola before they came to see me." Sexwale said he had been to Angola once and, although he had wanted to see what Luitingh's people were doing there because it would give an indication of their readiness to serve a new South Africa, he had been unable to meet them. "You are seeing mercenaries playing another role today. Eventually all these people who want to play a role, can. But they must accept the principle of reconciliation which is that you cannot forgive want you don't know." Sexwale's stance may mean reconciliation is still a long way off. Luitingh told MONITOR he would prefer the CCB's criminal activities to be forgotted. "Both the ANC and the CCB were responsible for terrible things," he said.
