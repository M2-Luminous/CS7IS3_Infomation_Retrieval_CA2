Prior to that report, the ad hoc committee had engaged in a survey of changes in the role of the yen and activities of Japanese businesses in Southeast Asia, which is undergoing rapid economic expansion. An interview was conducted with Toshimitsu Oba, Japan Center for International Finance (JCIF) director and ad hoc committee chairman, who inspected the ASEAN nations of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, and Hong Kong to seek information on the recent currency situation in those areas. [Konaka] What sort of problems exist in markets of the Southeast Asian nations? [Oba] The finance ministers of each of the nations are troubled by the high volume of capital outflow and inflow from abroad. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore was growing at about 8-10 percent on the high side last year, but such growth supported a massive flow of capital into their stock markets from overseas, and stock prices doubled in the last year. However, once stock prices reached a profitable level, moves took place to reap the benefits and stock prices dropped substantially. Government authorities of the various nations consider such huge movements of capital as detrimental to the smooth management of their economies and are exercising increasing interest in how they might restrain such capital movements. In some cases, they have the perception that controls are necessary and embrace views which are somewhat different from those of advanced nations. [Konaka] Have there been any changes in situations concerning currency because of the evacuation of U.S. military forces? [Oba] The various nations exercise care in ensuring that major fluctuations do not take place in dollar exchange rates because the dollar continues to play a prevalent role in that it is easy to procure and manage. In contrast, there is a tendency to avoid the yen which suffers from sharp changes in value against the dollar. The various governments have displayed sensitivity to a strong yen because of the fact that they hold major liabilities in yen-denominated debt instruments. ASEAN regional trade is in the process of increasing and you would think that greater use could be made of the various nations' currencies, but it seems that these nations do not favor the globalization of their currencies. I imagine that they take such a stance because globalization would impose a burden on their financial policies. [Konaka] What do you think of Japanese corporate investments penetrating the local economies in the form of newly constructed factories? [Oba] I visited a Japanese corporation's color television factory, but it was more modern than the company's domestic plants and its parts vendors had also located themselves in Southeast Asia. On the other hand, wages are low. For example, labor rates in Malaysia are 1/12th those in Japan, and in Singapore they are 1/7th of Japanese rates. In 1993, Japan became a net importer of color television sets and in some categories Japanese domestic plants are no longer competitive. Even the position of producing domestically that which is to be sold in Japan will probably have to undergo inevitable future modification. [Konaka] However, what do you think of the seemingly unchanging Japanese trade surplus with Asia, even if local investments increase because of the strong yen? [Oba] Ever since 1988, Japanese investments in manufacturing in Southeast Asia grew because of expansions in local production facilities. Initially, these investments were followed by increased exports of parts and materials, causing a phenomenon whereby exports grew instead of falling. If investments in manufacturing facilities take place after a strong yen, exports of parts and materials will not be restricted to 12 or 18 months, which means that the impact of a strong yen will not be seen for about five years. For example, if corporate overseas investments were to accelerate with a dollar-yen exchange rate of $1 to 100 yen, effects will not be seen for another five years and the interim will witness a repeat of the vicious cycle. I believe the cause of the huge trade surplus has a more fundamental cause. [Konaka] Are you saying that you question any efforts to reduce trade surpluses based on the strong yen? [Oba] Yes. Up until now, it was felt that if manufacturing facilities were transferred overseas to places such as Asia, that the trade surplus would disappear. However, if we were to view the Southeast Asian regional example, we'd have to say that the formula does not necessarily apply. The study objective of "integration of domestic and foreign economies," in the ad hoc committee report put another way addresses the globalization of economies and I believe we must view international trade issues of this nature not from the perspective of bilateral relationships, but from the perspective of individual regions. I realize we are speaking of a difficult technical approach, but I think if we were to examine economic flows on a detailed basis and conduct a detailed analysis, we just might come up with the desired answers.
