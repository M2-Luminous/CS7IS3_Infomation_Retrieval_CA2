FR941116-2-00051 FR941116-2-00038 Health Care Financing Administration [BPO&hyph;128&hyph;N] Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Delay in Implementation of the Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank Requirements AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of our delay of the implementation of section 1144 of the Social Security Act, which requires employers to report information about all individuals covered by group health plans to a newly established Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lisa Priborsky, (410) 966&hyph;3137. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 7, 1994, we published the information below in the Commerce Business Daily concerning delaying the implementation of the Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank. We are repeating the information here for general information. Section 1144 of the Social Security Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Medicare-Medicaid Data Bank to be composed of information supplied by employers for the purpose of establishing third party liability for health care costs. Initial reports by employers were required to be filed by February 28, 1995. The Conference Report accompanying the Department's Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1995 indicated Congressional intention that no funds be expended by the Department in the fiscal year to implement this requirement. H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;733, 103rd Congress, 2nd Session, page 22. In light of this statement, we have agreed to stay any administrative action to implement the current requirements, including the promulgation of reporting forms and instructions. Therefore, we will not expect employers to compile the necessary information or file the required reports. Likewise, of course, no sanctions will be imposed on employers for failure to file such reports. Authority: Section 1144 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;14). Dated: October 28, 1994. Bruce C. Vladeck, Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28320 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;P
