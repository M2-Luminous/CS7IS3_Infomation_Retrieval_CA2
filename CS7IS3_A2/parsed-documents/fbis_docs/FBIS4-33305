The Interior and National Defense Ministry issued a press release on national television that "advises the border posts and those most concerned that the formal order banning departure is now applied to all who must explain their management of public funds." This order, which also concerns all high-ranking employees appointed by President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide or by Malval, aims at officially figuring the country's accounts. The press release asserts that the measure is taken "in the legitimate interest of guaranteeing the interests of public administration and those of the Haitian nation." The former authorities must present an official discharge regarding their management when they leave the territory. A number of Malval government ministers are already abroad, according to some informed sources. Father Aristide ordered the same measure after the election, which was denounced at the time as political revenge.
