FR941028-0-00105 FR941028-0-00010 OHA believes that, when analyzed under Mathews v. Eldridge, the procedures proposed for OSM decisions and for OHA administrative review of those decisions provide adequate due process protection of the interests involved. The proposed rules recognize a distinction between a person who holds a permit that might be suspended or rescinded because OSM determines it was improvidently issued (43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377) and a person who has applied for a permit or might apply for one in the future (43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387). A person who holds a permit is entitled to more protection than the person who has applied for one or plans to do so. In recognition of this distinction, OSM's final rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2) will provide, for a person who has a permit, that OSM will determine whether a violation, penalty or fee existed when it was cited and whether an ownership or control link between a permittee and the person responsible for the violation existed, still exists, or has been severed, before issuing a notice to suspend or rescind a permit. An applicant for a permit, however, may challenge the existence of a violation in a review proceeding under 43 CFR 4.1360&hyph;4.1369 after the application has been denied, not before. An applicant (or any other person shown in the AVS) may challenge an ownership or control link or the status of a violation before a permit application is denied, or even filed, under proposed 30 CFR 773.24, as discussed further below. (The ``status of a violation'' concerns whether the violation remains outstanding, has been or is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an administrative or judicial appeal. The status of a violation is distinct from ``the existence of a violation,'' i.e., whether the violation existed at the time it was cited.) The ``private interest that will be affected,'' i.e., a permit, is limited. A permit is issued for a five-year term (with a right of renewal unless its terms or other requirements are not being met), 30 U.S.C. 1256(b), (d) (1988), and is conditioned on compliance with several performance standards, 30 U.S.C. 1265(a) (1988). It may be terminated, revised, reviewed, suspended, or revoked. 30 U.S.C. 1256(c), 1261(c), 1265(c), 1271(a)(4) (1988). Thus, while valuable, a permit to conduct surface coal mining is not a private interest comparable to the welfare benefits in Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, that entitles the holder to an evidentiary hearing prior to suspension or rescission. In Mathews v. Eldridge, supra at 343, the Supreme Court held that termination of disability payments may be effected without a pretermination evidentiary hearing. Similarly, suspension or rescission of a surface coal mining permit does not require a prior hearing in addition to the other procedural safeguards provided in the OSM and OHA rules. Those rules significantly reduce ``the risk of an erroneous deprivation'' of a permit. If OSM finds a permit was improvidently issued because at the time it was issued one or more of the circumstances set forth in the review criteria in 30 CFR 773.20(b)(1) existed, it does so in accordance with the standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations in proposed 30 CFR 773.26, 56 FR 45801&hyph;45803 (Sept. 6, 1991). See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). As mentioned above, these standards will apply, under OSM's final rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), to a determination whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been or is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an appeal, and whether an ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed. OSM has a choice of four remedial measures if it finds a permit was improvidently issued, including suspension or rescission of the permit. 30 CFR 773.20(c); see proposed §773.20(c)(1), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to suspend, it will give the permittee 30 days written notice and inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370 et seq. See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to rescind, it will issue the permittee a notice of proposed suspension and rescission under 30 CFR 773.21 that includes the reasons for finding the permit was improvidently issued and will inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370 et seq. See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). Under OHA's proposed rules 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377, the permittee may file a request for review with OHA that includes OSM's notice; documentary proof or offers of proof concerning the §773.20(b) review criteria (or their analogues in §773.21(a)(1)&hyph;(4)); other relevant information; a request for specific relief; and a request for an evidentiary hearing. §4.1372. The permittee may amend its request for review once as a matter of right before OSM files a response and may also do so afterwards with leave of the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge is to convene the hearing within 90 days of receiving responses to the request (unless the parties waive this deadline); this gives the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery under 43 CFR 4.1130&hyph;4.1141. §4.1373. The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision within 30 days of the date the hearing record is closed. §4.1375. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its notice while the person requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the notice is in error. §4.1374. Any party may file a petition for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision with IBLA. The petition shall attach a copy of this decision and specify the alleged errors. Other parties have 30 days to file responses, after which IBLA shall issue a decision within 60 days denying the petition or granting it and deciding the merits. §4.1377.
