FR940325-0-00052 FR940325-0-00012 40 CFR Parts 712 and 716 [OPPTS&hyph;82041A; FRL&hyph;4768&hyph;2] Preliminary Assessment Information and Health and Safety Data Reporting; Addition of Chemicals; Stay of Certain Reporting Requirements AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule; stay. SUMMARY: EPA is staying certain provisions of a final rule which was published in the Federal Register of December 27, 1993, adding chemical substances to two model information-gathering rules: The Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (PAIR) and the TSCA Section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. EPA received correspondence requesting clarification of the chemical identities of certain propylene glycol ethers and esters and the removal of certain other propylene glycol ethers and esters from the reporting requirement. EPA is staying the final rule as it relates to chemical substances under the category propylene glycol ethers and esters in order to resolve these issues and determine those chemical substances on which reporting will be required. DATES: This stay is effective March 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 545&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68311), EPA added 24 chemical substances and two categories of substances to both the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. Any person believing section 8(a) or 8(d) reporting required by this rule to be unwarranted was given opportunity to provide EPA in detail the reasons for that belief. EPA received correspondence from several chemical companies and the Chemical Manufacturers Association's (CMA) Propylene Glycol Ether Panel which raised questions concerning the appropriate identification of some chemicals listed under the category propylene glycol ethers and esters and requested that certain chemical substances in this category be removed from the rule. These substances were among those recommended for testing by the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) and added to the section 4(e) Priority List in its 31st Report to the EPA Administrator. Pursuant to 40 CFR 712.30(c) and 716.105(b), EPA routinely adds substances to the TSCA 8(a) and 8(d) rules when the ITC adds substances to the section 4(e) Priority List. To provide sufficient time for EPA and ITC member agencies to review these issues, EPA is staying the provisions of the final rule that relate to the category propylene glycol ethers and esters. EPA will announce, via notice in the Federal Register , the final reporting requirements for this category when the issues have been resolved.
