The Congress plenary gathered this morning to vote on the measure. The session, however, was suspended after an agreement with government leaders in Congress. The congressional session began with the presence of 113 members of Congress, which is enough of a quorum to initiate the session but not enough to vote on the provisional measure that creates the URV. The congressional rural bloc, which has 200 members, was obstructing the session [through their absence]. They will only approve the provisional measure if the government accepts an amendment guaranteeing the correction of the minimum prices for agricultural products through the URV. Since not enough members of Congress turned up for the session, the Congress director board and government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos, decided to suspend the session. It is now thought that the government will tomorrow re-edit the provisional measure that creates the URV. [Begin Santos recording] It would be irresponsible to attempt to have the provisional measure voted on without the certainty of holding a majority of votes in favor of its approval. Therefore, lacking the certainty of having the provisional measure approved, the government now must probably re-edit the measure. [end recording]
