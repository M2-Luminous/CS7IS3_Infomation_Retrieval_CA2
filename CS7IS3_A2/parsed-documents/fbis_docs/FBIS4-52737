The Khmers were seeking temporary refuge in Thailand due to fighting in Cambodia between government troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas. At least two Cambodian civilians were injured when four mortar shells, fired by the guerrillas, landed about one kilometer from a market in Poipet border town. The fighting prompted some 100 Cambodians to attempt to cross Mahot canal which demarcates the border. However, they were stopped by troops from the Burapha Task Force.
