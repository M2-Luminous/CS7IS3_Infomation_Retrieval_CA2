The Commission's Chairman Nikolay Demenev has reported to Interfax that the appeal was filed in response to the Shchelkovskiy Town Court decision to dismiss the election results as invalid because of the violations exposed in the commission's work. In an interview with Interfax Demenev denied that Zhirinovskiy's victory had been rigged as a result of improper votes counting. In his opinion, not a single electoral commission member shares Zhirinovskiy's views or sides with him. "We were politically impartial and absolutely objective. As for insignificant irregularities, they can be found in any electoral commission", Demenev declared. In his opinion, this legal case is "explicitly" political, and its aim is to strip Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary mandate. "To stop at nothing to discredit electoral commission workers is base", Demenev said. Legal proceedings against the electoral commission were initiated by Oleg Novikov, a candidate to the Duma from that district. The commission's appeal will be considered next week-end.
