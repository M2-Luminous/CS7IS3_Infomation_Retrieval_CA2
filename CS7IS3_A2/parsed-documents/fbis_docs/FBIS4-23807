The report of the committee, chaired by Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom, was submittted to cabinet on Wednesday [15 June]. On April 25, two days before the election, the then State President F W de Klerk assented to the transfer of the land to the trustee of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust, King Goodwill. The transfer, made in terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Act of 1994, caused an outcry when it was made public after the elections, and the cabinet on May 23 appointed a committee to investigate the act. Mr Hanekom said in a statement on Wednesday there was sufficient common ground between the relevant parties to arrive at an acceptable solution and to secure an appropriate role for the Zulu king as guardian of the tribal land. The committee found the goals for the establishment of the trust were to ensure that land occupied or owned by tribes in the affected area would vest in them when the new constitution came into effect. "The intention was to create a mechanism to preserve tribal interests in the land, within the present framework of traditional authority structures. There was no intention to give the trust the powers of government. "The act does not make the ingonyama the owner of the land in the sense that it is his personal property -- he holds the land as statutory trustee, subject to existing rights of people," Mr Hanekom said. Furthermore, most of the land was already occupied by tribes and communities since before 1913 and the act would have limited impact on land redistribution and restitution. "However, the act results in an unusual mixture of public and private law powers and functions. This complicates its interpretation and application, resulting in uncertainty and administrative problems." The committee recommended the act be amended or substituted so that the ingonyama continued his guardianship of the land, with his powers and functions described. The act should address issues dealing with alienation of land and resolution of tribal border disputes, and should govern all tribally-owned land falling within the former territory of KwaZulu, subject to the existing rights of occupants of that land. "Legislation should create a structure for managing the land which is sufficiently broadly-based to ensure any unwarranted interference by any person or body, or manipulation of the land is not possible. This is done to allay any fears of possible illicit interference or manipulation," Mr Hanekom said. Legislation to give effect to this decision should be the subject of consultation between the national government and the provincial government."All parties should agree and undertake not to take any action which might pre-empt the implementation of this decision." Mr Hanekom said he wished to assure the South African public that the cabinet committee, operating within a tight deadline, had taken its task "very seriously indeed". All facts and implications were taken into account in formulating the recommendations to cabinet, he said.
