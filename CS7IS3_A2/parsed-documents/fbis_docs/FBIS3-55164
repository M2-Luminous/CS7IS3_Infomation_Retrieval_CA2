The process will take about four months, he said. Tarand's statement was based on Foreign Ministry Adviser Mark Sinisoo's claim that Russia proposed June 30 as the deadline for taking out the fuel. The minister told BNS this is "a case typical of the situation in Estonia where a department does not coordinate its activity with others." In Tarand's opinion, the Transportation and Communications Ministry and the Rescue Service should certainly take part in the dismantling of the reactors. Kalev Timberg, the deputy director of the Rescue Service, told BNS the service is to secure fire safety during the process and deactivation of radioactive substances if an accident occurs. Russia hasn't yet submitted to the Rescue Service the dismantling blueprints, which complicates the situation, he said. Timberg refused to comment reports that Russian military authorities want the Rescue Service to bring to the scene equipment able to shoot jets of water to a height of at least 12 meters. Henno Putnik, the chief specialist of the Estonian Meteorology and Hydrology Institute's radiation laboratory, told BNS removal of nuclear fuel rods from reactors "is an operation Russian submariners often carry out." The dismantling of the entire nuclear reactor complex in Paldiski is to take place in the second stage of the operation. Tarand told BNS Finnish and Swedish specialists have offered to help Estonia in this.
