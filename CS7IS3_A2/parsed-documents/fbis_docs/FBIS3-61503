To bridge this gap, an attempt is made to ascertain the minimum acetylcholine concentration which no longer affects the [.sup]45 [/] Ca[.sup]2+[/] influx into the Helix pomatia neurons. To this end, nervous ganglia of Helix pomatia incubated in 2 ml of physiological solution containing 10 ï¿½l of the [.sup]45[/]Ca isotope with or without addition of 10[.sup]-10[/]-10[.sup]-18[/] mole/l of acetylcholine during a 1-120 min time span are investigated. The experimental procedure consisting of two series of tests is outlined. During the first, the effect of low acetylcholine concentrations was studied on snails in a physiologically active state (Jun-Jul) and in the second (involving two sessions)--on snails preparing for hibernal hibernation (late November). The effect of various concentration of acetylcholine on the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx into the Helix pomatia neurons after various incubation periods is plotted. The study shows that an increase in the incubation period shifts the acetylcholine triggering threshold toward lower concentrations; below an acetylcholine concentration of 10[.sup]-18[/]-10[.sup]-19[/] M even after 90-120 min of incubation, acetylcholine no longer affects the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx. The findings warrant a serious reevaluation of existing notions of effective neurotransmitter concentrations and open up the possibility of utilizing homeopathic doses of biologically active substances in treatment practices.
