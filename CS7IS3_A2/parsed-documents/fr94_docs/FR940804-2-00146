FR940804-2-00146 FR940804-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;34456; International Series Release No. 693; File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. To Establish a Northbound Trading Linkage With the Montreal Stock Exchange July 28, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on February 7, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 On June 20, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission a draft of the proposed Linkage Plan for the northbound linkage (``Draft Linkage Plan''). The Linkage Plan is an agreement between the BSE and Montreal Stock Exchange which contains arrangements for the management of the northbound linkage, settlement of trade disputes, comparison and settlement of trades, and surveillance of trading activity. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The BSE seeks to commence northbound trading pursuant to its linkage with the Montreal Stock Exchange (``ME''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Securities markets are becoming increasingly international, reacting to many of the same economic and political events that affect the rest of the world. The globalization of these markets is driven by several factors, but advances in automation and telecommunications have propelled its rapid growth. Factors driving this globalization include investors' desire to enter foreign markets, the growth of large institutional funds needing to decrease risk by diversifying investments in other countries, and regulatory changes that opened markets to foreign broker-dealer firms and their customers. Effective international securities markets require efficient and valuable systems for order routing and execution, information dissemination, and clearance and settlement. Most major and emerging markets have automated or plan to automate all or some of these functions to take advantage of efficiency, competition and market expansion opportunities. The Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25284 stated that the international securities market should feature efficient structures for quotation, price and volume dissemination concerning securities and derivatives markets traded worldwide. 2 A critical step in achieving a worldwide securities market information system would be the creation and maintenance of international linkages between the automated information systems of the various national securities markets. Such a link was established between the BSE and the ME in 1984 for orders in U.S. stocks transmitted southbound from Montreal to Boston. This rule proposal is designed to complete the ``loop'' with orders in Canadian stocks being routed northbound from Boston to Montreal. 3 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26284 (November 14, 1988), 53 FR 46963 (November 21, 1988). The Commission issued its Policy Statement on Regulation of International Securities Markets in 1988 to identify areas of regulatory concern presented by the continued internationalization of the securities markets. 3 Under the Draft Linkage Plan, see note 1 supra, all securities listed on the ME, except for options and futures, would be eligible to be traded through the proposed northbound linkage. The proposed rule change seeks to commence northbound trading pursuant to the trading linkage previously established with the ME. 4 This would provide an additional means for U.S. customers to place orders in Canadian stocks with U.S. brokers for execution on the ME. These orders would be entered into the broker/dealers' order-match systems which are linked to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON would receive and log the details of the order and pass it on to the ME's automated order-routing and execution system. The order would contain the terms for the price, if any, stated in Canadian dollars, and an identifier indicating that its transmission is for the ME. The ME system would also log the order and direct it to the specialist's electronic book for action. These orders will be treated as would any other order sent to the ME floor. 4 The Exchange's southbound foreign linkage rule and the linkage plan with the ME was approved by the Commission in 1989. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27080 (July 31, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;89&hyph;01). Upon execution, the customer report would be sent from the specialist's book through the ME system to the BEACON system, with both systems logging in the details of the report, then to the broker/dealer's order-match system. BEACON will essentially function as a conduit for the benefit of member firms who today conduct this business through correspondents. While BEACON will keep detailed records of all traffic, it will not function as an execution system for Canadian stocks, nor show quotes in Canadian stocks, and it will not be advertised as such.
