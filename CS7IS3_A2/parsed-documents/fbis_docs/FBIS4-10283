We acknowledge that this is a very significant step which, during the past decade, did not occur in any Central American nation, or with any similar armed group. However this not the only thing we want. We are calling for and demanding more. In this respect I say to the governor, and at the same time answer a question that is floating around, that yours truly has no intention of retreating to any embassy. Yours truly plans to remain in Mexico, and wants to remain in Chiapas because he believes that the people who are doing things here are doing it in good faith and intelligently. Yours truly also believes that there are issues to be solved here that are worth solving, and because he intends to continue working for peace. [end recording] Without any doubt, one of the important questions surrounding this issue is related to when the peace talks will resume. When will the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Army]; peace mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas; and Special Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis once again sit at a negotiating table? In this respect, Camacho Solis' reply was as follows: [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am also aware that this is the most important effort we can make because by safeguarding the negotiation process with the EZLN, and respecting their decisionmaking process, I am sure that in the next few weeks we will be able to take further and firm steps to ensure lasting peace. [applause] Who will accomplish this? The peace commissioner? No. The mediator? No. This will be accomplished by all of us. Every individual, every household that can come up with an answer. When abuses by the authorities are amended, then we already have someone who is working for peace. Every resolution by a magistrate or a judge that carries this same spirit, is already supporting the peace process. [end recording] Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that by adding all these dispositions, and with the support of the president of the republic, as well as all the political forces committed to peace, there is no reason why progress in the Chiapas peace process cannot be made.
