By luck, and despite a clever plot against the bank, the Handelsbank avoided becoming the guarantor of purchases worth 400 million kronor [SKr]. The head of a Swedish bank may almost have seen his career go down the drain because of the attempted plot. One Swedish lawyer left the case after a remarkable photographic exhibition. Exactly how the plot was put together and who was supposed to be duped into financing the purchase of weapons for the war in the former Yugoslavia was not made clear in the criminal report that was submitted to Stockholm city court. Bank Guarantee the Core The core of the case is a bank guarantee, called a standby letter of credit, in the amount of $50 million. The Handelsbank drew up the check. However, the Swedish police report showed that the contents of the bank guarantee were a forgery though the form on which it was drawn up was genuine. "It's indeed possible they had some sort of inside help," said Gunnel Skeppholm, the district prosecutor. Serbian Account On 24 August last year, the bank guarantee was presented to a bank in London. The bank's task was to verify the guarantee, i.e., assure the international businessmen present that the Swedish bank guarantee was genuine. That in turn was supposed to be the green light for a series of transactions. In the end, SKr320 million were supposed to have ended up in a Serbian account in Switzerland. The date on which the London bank was supposed to have made the contact was obviously not chosen at random. On precisely that day, it had long since been decided that the top official at the Handelsbank, the one who appeared to have signed the guarantee, would be out sailing in the Stockholm archipelago with some of the bank's major clients. Prosecutor Skeppholm assumes that the intent was for someone else to have attested to the top official's connection and given his "okay" regarding the propriety of the guarantee when the London bank telephoned. However, the London bank first telephoned the day after. Then the top official was at work. The swindle thus ground to a halt. Royal Family It is the two Swedes who traveled to London with the bank guarantee who have now been charged in Stockholm. They are 38 and 39 years old. One of them was earlier sentenced to five years in prison for robbery. Both had formerly been convicted of grand larceny. One of them was very falsely introduced in London to the foreign businessmen as being a member of the Swedish royal family. The Swedes were first taken into custody in the late fall. At that time the police report was mainly directed at figuring out the origin of the bank guarantee. One of the men charged said he had a contact at the bank who was behind the attempted swindle but would not reveal who this contact was. "At a later remand hearing he was shown a photographic collage containing a total of 28 pictures on the judge's bench. He immediately pointed to the person he claimed was the contact," Skeppholm said. The person he pointed to was the chief officer at the Handelsbank whose signature or at the very least a signature very like his appeared on the bank guarantee. "When you're a prosecutor you react in two ways when there's such a quick identification. In part you wonder how it can happen so quickly and so totally without doubt. In part you wonder whether this is really the way it is." So prosecutor Skeppholm suspected there was something suspicious and prepared a special report relating to just this subject. It turned out that earlier in the autumn the partner's lawyer had bought a passport picture of the bank's current chief from the files of the national police administration. "My goal was to ask the suspect for information about what his contact looked like so I could compare that with a photograph of how the bank employee looked," the lawyer explained in the criminal report. Easy To Smear Yet the lawyer insisted that he had never shown the passport photograph he had bought around. The lawyer has since voluntarily resigned from the case. "What jolted me somewhat in this case was how someone can get smeared this way. It really can hit anyone," said Skeppholm about the fix the bank employee has gotten into. The bank employee should take a certain degree of comfort from the charge that, in addition to attempted grand larceny by means of forged documents also includes misleading allegations. The accused men deny having committed a crime. They thought they were taking part in a legal transaction in which their commission for arranging the bank guarantee was to have been 0.25 percent, i.e., SKr1 million. The men have further been charged with attempted grand larceny using counterfeit cashier's checks worth SKr8 million, but that is an entirely different matter.
