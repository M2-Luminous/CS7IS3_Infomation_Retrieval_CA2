Galindo, brother of Samuel Lewis Galindo -- beer businessman and one of the six presidential candidates who lost in yesterday's elections -- was one of the Panamanian negotiators of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977 and one of the main opponents of former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. Perez Balladares, who confirmed the report published by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA about the list of possible ministers, said the posts of attorney general; comptroller; and ministers of the Presidency, agricultural development, education, health, and foreign relations will be offered to political figures who do not belong to his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). The victorious candidate said the Housing, Public Works, Labor and Social Welfare, Commerce and Industries, Planning, and Government and Justice Ministries might be occupied by PRD members. In this way, the future president kept his campaign promise to appoint a cabinet with an undetermined number of opposition and independent members. Perez Balladares said current magistrates Eduardo Valdes, Dennis Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will be retained in the Electoral Tribunal. Jose de los Santos Chen Barria of the Christian Democratic Party may be confirmed as comptroller. The Attorney General's Office will be occupied by Jose Antonio Sossa, another PDC member, and Oswaldo Fernandez, who was appointed by President Endara as head of the Public Force, will retain his post. Stanley Muschett, president of the Justice and Peace Commission and rector of the private Santa Maria la Antigua University, will occupy the post of education minister, while Carlos Souza, former president of the Cattlemen's Association, will hold the post of agricultural development minister. Also, veteran Liberal Party politician Raul Arango will be designated Presidency minister and Carlos Garcia de Paredes, former dean of the School of Medicine of the University of Panama, will be appointed health minister. Two PRD members will be appointed commerce and industries minister and government and justice ministers: livestock businessman Felix Gonzalez and the PRD's leftist First Assistant Secretary Mitchel Doens, respectively. Two women will be named to the posts of labor and social welfare minister and economic planning minister, but their names were not disclosed by Perez Balladares. After learning of his triumph, Perez Balladares said: "The era of electoral confrontation has passed, and we must enter the 21st century with a vision of the future and with the commitment to our children and grandchildren, without returning to the past and without links to the past."
