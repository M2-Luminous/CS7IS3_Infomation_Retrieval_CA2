Palabrica: "Inconsistency in Joma Sison's Position"] [Text] Internal problems continue to wrack the ranks of the Leftist movement in the country. More than a year after President Ramos initiated peace talks with its umbrella organization, the National Democratic Front, the question of who between the leaders in the field and the officials based abroad has the moral authority to represent the movement in the negotiations remains unsolved. The difference in opinion on how to approach this issue has led to the breakup of the once monolithic Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its affiliate organizations. Three factions, all claiming to represent the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed masses, have emerged from the conflict. The intense ideological dispute is believed to have gone beyond the level of debate and claimed its first victim in the person of former NPA [New People's Army] Banahaw Command leader Leopoldo Mabilangan. A faction identified with Jose Ma. Sison, CPP founding chair, claimed responsibility for the death of Mabilangan. The bloodletting is expected to continue in the wake of reports coming from Sison's camp that a "people's court" has found former CPP stalwarts Felimon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, and Ricardo Reyes guilty of serious crimes against the people and sentenced them to death. The verdict will be carried out by a group specially organized for that purpose. The announcement served to confirm Sison's earlier statements that his four rivals would be facing trial for their alleged crimes. The news came shortly after reputed CPP Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon was arrested by elements of the Philippine National Police. When demands for the release of Tiamzon were not heeded by the government, Sison, speaking from The Netherlands, bewailed the arrest and detention as illegal (because the basis for the arrest, illegal possession of firearms, was dismissed by the prosecutor) and inhuman (because she is suffering from serious health problems). He threatened to pull the National Democratic Front out of the peace talks if Tiamzon would not be freed. It is amazing how Sison can change from one ideological posture to another without batting an eyelash. A day after Tiamzon's arrest, he spoke on several radio talk shows to condemn the violation of Tiamzon's human rights. Without being forthright about it, he acknowledged that Tiamzon was entitled to all the rights and privileges that the Constitution guarantees to Filipino citizens suspected of having committed a crime. The same Constitution he refuses to accept as the framework within which the peace talks shall be conducted. However, for former CPP leaders who dared question his handling of the affairs of the Leftist movement in the country, that adherence to democratic processes is non-existent. His critics are not in the same league as the run-of-the-mill politicians who criticize for the sheer joy of it or to attract attention. They are men who braved the guns of the military and bore the rigors of life in the mountains to keep the flame of the movement burning while Sison enjoyed the comforts of self-exile in Europe. Their past achievements, notwithstanding refusal to toe the line of the party chair, was considered a serious offense against the movement which deserved disciplinary action after hearing by a "people's court." The word is out that a "people's court" has convened and decided that Sison's four erstwhile comrades should die for their crime. How the verdict was arrived at was never explained. Whether or not Lagman, Tabara, Kintanar, and Reyes were given the opportunity to defend themselves is a big question mark. As there are no transcripts of the proceedings, third parties can only speculate on what transpired in the trial assuming it was really held. One thing though is sure: the subject of the trial kept away from the places where Sison's faction holds fort in the wake of reports that his followers are after their head. Noticeably, Sison has not expressed any concern for the human rights of the four "convicts" as he did for Tiamzon. Neither has he shown equivalent compassion for them and their families who now have to suffer the anguish of anticipating death whenever they sense the presence of unidentified or suspicious-looking persons in their midst. In Sison's book, those opposed to his rule enjoy less rights and privileges than the faithful who accept his doctrinaire teachings as gospel truth. The principle of equality of all social classes which is a cornerstone of the CPP's war for national liberation appears to have lost its meaning in the current strife within the Leftist movement. It's time Sison accepted the reality that more than 30 years have passed since he started his struggle. The world's political climate has changed. The principal source of financial support for the movement, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. The dictator he fought so strongly against is already dead. A more democratic system of government is in place. The Marxist-Leninist doctrine on seizure of political power is no longer in tune with the times. A change in approach is necessary if Sison sincerely wants to play a significant role in the political development of our country. Unless corrective measures are taken by its leadership, the "people's court" verdict on the four former CPP stalwarts may turn out to be the spark that would trigger the incineration of the Leftist movement in the country.
