FR940325-2-00024 FR940325-2-00004 DOC Position We agree and have adjusted the R&D expenses reported for purposes of calculating clinker CV to reflect the inclusion of depreciation for R&D assets. We note that this adjustment also affected the total reported COM of the imported clinker and flux used in the calculation of U.S. value added profit. Comment 21 Petitioner asserts that exchange rate gains and losses should be added to raw material costs for purposes of calculating clinker CV. According to petitioner, during verification the Department discovered that Lafarge had not reported the foreign exchange gains and losses related to the importation of raw materials used to produce the subject merchandise. DOC Position We agree, based on our findings at verification, that Lafarge did not report these foreign exchange gains and losses. Accordingly, we have added these gains and losses to the reported raw material costs for purposes of calculating clinker CV for the final determination. We note that this adjustment also affected the total reported COM of the imported clinker and flux used in the calculation of U.S. value added profit. Comment 22 Petitioner argues that, because LFI repeatedly refused to separately report its labor costs and classify them according to Department practice as variable costs for purposes of calculating clinker CV and total flux and clinker COM used in the calculation of U.S. value added profit, the Department must resort to BIA to determine these costs. As BIA, petitioner asserts that the Department should not annualize any fixed costs but rather use only the fixed costs reported for the POI. Petitioner argues that this is a reasonable BIA methodology given the Department's inability to break out the labor costs from fixed costs and properly treat the labor costs as variable costs. Respondent contends that LFI's labor costs have the characteristics of fixed costs since the number of workers working at LFI's plants is generally constant and the total pool of labor costs tends not to vary with production levels. LFI also asserts that labor costs are distorted by fluctuations in monthly production volumes as a result of plant shut-downs for maintenance. According to respondent, the use of fixed costs for the POI would distort the Department's CV and further manufacturing cost calculations. LFI states that, under the logic of the preliminary determination, fixed labor costs should be based on the reported annual period. DOC Position We agree with petitioner. Lafarge normally records labor costs for clinker and flux as a fixed cost. Respondent followed its normal accounting system for the response and reported labor as a fixed cost for the year 1992. This methodology differs from the Department's normal practice where labor is considered a variable cost and as such would be reported on a weighted-average basis for the POI. In the preliminary determination the Department accepted the annualization of fixed costs because LFI claimed that periodic shut-down expenses incurred for maintaining its furnaces created significant aberrations in monthly production costs. In order to eliminate the effect of these distortions, we allowed LFI to report fixed costs on an annual weighted-average basis. However, it was not until verification that the Department first discovered that labor costs were included in the reported annualized fixed costs. The Department's Section D and E questionnaires for clinker and flux identified direct and indirect labor as costs that should be reported as variable costs for response purposes. The questionnaires also specifically requested that LFI itemize the expenses included in fixed and variable costs. LFI did not itemize its variable or fixed costs or otherwise identify how it treated its labor costs in response to the Department's requests. Because LFI was not responsive to the Department's requests for information and incorrectly classified labor costs as fixed costs, and since there was no information on the record to permit the accurate reclassification of labor costs, we have disallowed the annualization of fixed costs and have used only the reported fixed costs for the POI as BIA for purposes of the final determination. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of CA cement and cement clinker from France and to begin the suspension of liquidation of all entries of CA flux from France that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which the FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP, as shown below. The less than fair value margins for CA cement and cement clinker are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Producer/manufacturer/exporter 1Weighted-average margin percentage Lafarge 18.91 All Others 18.91
