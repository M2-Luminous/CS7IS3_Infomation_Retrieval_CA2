FR940511-2-00199 FR940511-2-00128 (c) Eligibility (1) Eligible Applicants Funding for this program in FY 1994 is limited to PHAs and IHAs. Although section 520 of NAHA lists seven categories of entities qualified to receive grants (States; units of general local government; local park and recreation districts and agencies; public housing agencies (PHAs); nonprofit organizations providing youth sports services programs; Indian tribes; and Indian housing authorities (IHAs)), and HCDA 1992 section 126(b) added institutions of higher learning that have never participated in a Youth Sports program as eligible applicants, the 94 App. Act limited the funding for the Drug Elimination Program to PHAs and IHAs only. Since the funding of the Youth Sports Program is dependent on the appropriation for the Drug Elimination Program, the limitations that apply to Drug Elimination affect Youth Sports as well. Therefore, for FY 1994 only PHAs and IHAs are eligible applicants for Youth Sports Program Funding. In designing an activity for funding, PHA and IHA applicants shall consult with RMCs/RCs where they exist, and with other entities that would be eligible for funding under this program, as listed above, with at least two years of experience in designing or operating sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities for youth. Eligible local entities that are affiliates of national organizations may rely on the experience of the national organization for this purpose. These consultations will provide applicants with valuable resident input and will involve entities with experience in designing and implementing the eligible types of activities under this program with PHA and IHA applicants that may not have this type of experience. These experienced entities may establish a sub-contracting relationship, in accordance with 24 CFR part 85, with the PHA/IHA if deemed appropriate by the grantee to further their public/private partnership. This consultation process will also provide entities that are not PHAs or IHAs with a greater appreciation and understanding of the operations and problems of public and Indian housing developments. The end result will be more effective program activities that make more efficient use of program funds. This result is expected because it draws upon and combines the expertise of PHA and IHA applicants with respect to the operations and problems of public and Indian housing developments, and the expertise of other entities with respect to designing and implementing youth activities. (2) Eligible Activities Youth Sports Program funds may be used to assist in carrying out sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities for youth in any of the following manners: (i) Acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of community centers, parks, or playgrounds is an eligible activity under the Youth Sports Program. (A) Acquisition, construction or rehabilitation costs shall not be approved unless the applicant demonstrates the need for the type of facilities to be assisted by the grant (section III.(a)(3) of this NOFA). (B) Facilities that receive Youth Sports funding must be used primarily for youth from the public or Indian housing developments in which the funded facility is operated (section III.(a)(2)(ii) and III.(a)(10)(iii) of this NOFA). (C) Facilities (community centers, parks, or playgrounds) acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated under this program must be on or adjacent to the premises of the public housing development identified in the application for assistance under this program. In the case of Indian Housing Authorities, the applicant must specify how youth from IHA developments will have access to the facility, since IHAs often cover large areas (section III.(a)(9) of this NOFA). (D) Facilities receiving Youth Sports funding must comply with any applicable local or tribal building requirements for recreational facilities (section III.(a)(2)(iii) of this NOFA). (E) Facilities receiving Youth Sports funding must be used for Youth Sports activities commensurate with the extent of the Youth Sports funding. For example, if a facility's operation is funded 60 percent by a Youth Sports grant, then it must be used at least 60 percent for Youth Sports activities. (F) In accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.21, facilities should be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, make them made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. (G) In accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.20, no qualified applicant with handicaps shall, because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefit of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in the program. (ii) Redesigning or modifying public spaces in public or Indian housing developments to provide increased utilization of the areas by Youth Sports activities is an eligible activity under this program. (A) The construction of sports facilities on public or Indian housing property to implement Youth Sports activities is permitted under this program. These facilities may include, but not be limited to, baseball diamonds, basketball courts, football fields, tutoring centers, swimming pools, soccer fields, public or Indian housing community centers, and tennis courts. (iii) Provision of public services, including salaries and expenses for staff of youth sports programs, cultural activities, transportation costs, educational programs relating to drug abuse, and sports and recreation equipment are eligible activities under this program. (A) Educational programs for youth relating to illegal drug use are permitted under this section. The program must be formally organized and provide the knowledge and skills youth need to make informed decisions on the potential and immediate dangers of drug abuse and involvement with illegal drugs. Grantees may contract with drug education professionals to provide the appropriate training or workshops. These educational programs may be part of organized sports activities or other eligible youth activities. (B) Activities providing an economic/educational orientation for Youth Sports Program participants are eligible for funding as public services. These activities must provide, for public or Indian housing youth, the opportunities for interaction with, or referral to, higher educational or vocational institutions, and develop the skills of program participants to pursue educational, vocational, and economic goals. These activities may also provide public or Indian housing youth the opportunity to interact with private sector businesses in their community with the purpose of promoting the development of educational, vocational, and economic goals in public or Indian housing youth. (C) The cost of the initial purchase of sports and recreation equipment to be used by program participants is permitted under this program.
