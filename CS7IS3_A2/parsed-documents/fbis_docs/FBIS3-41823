This is fundamentally different from the existing method of breaking up DNA by radical cutting, and its most unique characteristic is that cutting is done by hydrolysis, the same as with natural enzymes. It is predicted that this can be used as "scissors" that can cut human DNA at any desired location by bonding lanthanide complex to nucleic acid recognizing molecules. If it can be given concrete form, this will have broad application in research on the treatment of cancer and AIDS, and future advances in research will be carefully watched. In recent years, advances have been made in research on man-made materials that will selectively cut DNA and RNA. There are many restriction enzymes in the natural world that cut DNA and RNA, but while restriction enzymes uniquely recognize the base sequence of DNA and hydrolyze efficiently, cutting location is limited by type of enzyme and cutting cannot be performed at specified locations. So far, however, artificial restriction enzymes that will cut DNA by the hydrolyses method used by restriction enzymes have not been developed. This is because DNA phosphodiester bonding is extremely stable, with a half-life of about 200 million years (under pH7, 25�C conditions; RNA is about 130 years), and the artificial enzymes developed so far break up DNA, and in effect cut them through radical generation. The Komiyama group and others have been conducting research on cutting DNA and RNA phosphodiester bonding by hydrolysis. In the case of RNA, success has been achieved by using a cobalt complex as a catalyst, but research had not made progress in the case of DNA, which has an extremely long half-life. Based on knowledge gained thus far, the Komiyama group conducted research with lanthanide, a trivalent ion like cobalt, and as a result, confirmed that cerium and other lanthanide ions hydrolyze DNA at a very rapid speed. Specifically, in a pH7, 50�C buffer solution, cerium and the other lanthanide base cyclic complexes in Figure 1 were added to dimer DNA (TPT). The reaction product was measured by high-speed liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the cutting reaction was studied. TPT peak went down in a few hours and a peak was formed for thymidine. There was no formation of thymina through radical action, and it was confirmed that hydrolysis was proceeding. Other lanthinides also displayed cutting action vis-a-vis the TPT, but inversion rate after 1 week was only a few percentage points. No progress was made with ions of iron, zinc, magnesium, etc., and it was made clear that this is a unique characteristic of the ions of rare earth elements. Additionally, the electrophoresis result during experiments with cutting 35 mer DNA (under the following conditions: 10 milli-mole concentration cerium complex, pH7.2, 24 hours) was that the fragments were consistent with Maxam Gilbert's migrating band, and it is assumed that the cut ends formed complexes and became equal to phosphomonoesters. From these research results, it is predicted that with cerium and other lanthanide complexes, DNA cutting action can be controlled by ligand selection, and if these complexes are bonded with nucleic acid recognizing molecules, cutting by means of hydrolysis at any desired location is possible. If the technology can be refined, it is expected that there will be no limit to the expansion of its use as "scissors" for DNA cutting for human and other advanced organisms and cancer.
