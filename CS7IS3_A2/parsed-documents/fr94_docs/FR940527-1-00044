FR940527-1-00044 FR940527-1-00014 Specifically, we propose to revise ยง412.63(s)(2) to provide that the Secretary may make midyear corrections to the wage index only in those limited circumstances where a hospital can show: (1) That the intermediary or HCFA made an error in tabulating its data, and (2) that the hospital could not have known about the error, or did not have an opportunity to correct the error, by September 23, 1994. As indicated earlier, since a hospital will have the opportunity to verify its data and the intermediary will notify the hospital of any changes, we do not foresee any specific circumstances under which midyear corrections would be made. However, should a midyear correction be necessary, the wage index change for the affected area will be made prospectively from the date the correction is made. If midyear corrections are made, we will evaluate their impact to determine if a budget neutrality adjustment to the program payments should be made at the beginning of the following fiscal year in accordance with ยง412.63(s)(4). 3. Computation of the Wage Index As noted above, we are proposing to base the FY 1995 wage index on wage data reported on the FY 1991 cost report. The wage index would be based on data from 5,294 hospitals paid under the prospective payment system and short-term acute care hospitals in waiver States. The method used to compute the proposed wage index is as follows: Step 1_We gathered data from each of the non-Federal short-term acute care hospitals for which data were reported on the Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II of the Medicare cost report for the hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1991. Each hospital was assigned to its appropriate urban or rural area prior to any reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8) or 1886(d)(10) of the Act. In addition, we included data from a few hospitals that had cost reporting periods beginning in September 1990 and had reported a cost reporting period exceeding 52 weeks. The data were included because no other data from these hospitals would be available for the cost reporting period described above, and particular labor market areas might be affected due to the omission of these hospitals. However, we generally describe this wage data as FY 1991 data. Step 2_For each hospital, we subtracted the excluded salaries (that is, direct salaries attributable to skilled nursing facility services, home health services, and other sub-provider components not subject to the prospective payment system) from gross hospital salaries to determine net hospital salaries. To the net hospital salaries, we added hospital contract labor costs, hospital fringe benefits, and any home office salaries and fringe benefits reported by the hospital to determine total salaries plus fringe benefits. Step 3_For each hospital, we inflated or deflated, as appropriate, the total salaries plus fringe benefits resulting from Step 2 to a common period to determine total adjusted salaries. To make the wage inflation adjustment, we used the percentage change in average hourly earnings for each 30-day increment from October 14, 1990 through September 15, 1992, for hospital industry workers from S.I.C. 806, Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment and Earnings Bulletin. The annual inflation rates used were 5.6 percent for FY 1990 and FY 1991 and 4.8 percent for FY 1992. The inflation factors used to inflate the hospital's data were based on the midpoint of the cost reporting period as indicated below.
