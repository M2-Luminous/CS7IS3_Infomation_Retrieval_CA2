The sun shone brightly and a gentle breeze could be felt in the Tashkent afternoon. An Uzbek Foreign Ministry official told reporters that today's welcoming ceremony was the most solemn held in Uzbekistan since it declared independence. A guard of honor comprising the airborne force, air force, tank force, and army units was used for the first time as was the newly inaugurated airport terminal for reception of foreign guests. It shows that Uzbek leaders attach very great importance to the further development of Sino-Uzbek relations as well as Li Peng's visit. Uzbek President Karimov looked particularly happy today. He led the acting chairman of the Supreme Soviet, prime minister, various ministers, and ranking officials to greet Premier Li Peng and his party at the airport. This was the second time Karimov and Li Peng were to meet each other. The two leaders held friendly talks in March 1992 when President Karimov paid a state visit to China. Premier Li Peng's current visit marks the first visit by a high-level Chinese leader to Uzbekistan since it declared independence. The city of Tashkent carried out renovation of its main streets especially to welcome Premier Li Peng's visit. When Li Peng and his party's motorcade drove through the level, clean, and tidy streets, pedestrians on both sides waved their hands to greet the visitors. Uzbek and Chinese national flags and various colorful flags fluttered in the wind on some main streets. Large signs with Chinese characters reading "Welcome Premier Li Peng's Visit to Uzbekistan," "Friendship, Peace, and Friendly Relations Between Uzbekistan and China,"...met the eyes of honored Chinese guests at the intersections. All this added an atmosphere of warmth and friendliness to this famous ancient city in central Asia, and made visitors from Beijing feel warm and comfortable. Tashkent's news media attached great importance to Premier Li Peng's visit. Today's KHAIK SUZI [renmin yanlun bao 0086 3046 6056 6158 1032], an official newspaper of the Uzbek Government, carried a front-page headline in Chinese characters: "Respectable Chinese Premier Li Peng, We Warmly Welcome Your Visit to Uzbekistan!" It noted in a published news item: Uzbek leaders are convinced that Premier Li Peng's current visit will further promote the development of mutually beneficial Sino-Uzbek relations on an equal footing. In the past week, Tashkent's newspapers and TV stations have carried extensive reports on China's situation -- the ancient culture and beautiful scenery of the Chinese nation, the modern look of Shanghai and other industrial cities, rapid economic development enjoyed by special zones, and so forth. Chief editor (Alihanov) of the Uzbek State TV Station said to reporters: "We expect more Sino- Uzbek joint ventures will be established after Premier Li Peng's visit. It is advantageous to the two countries." Premier Li Peng's visit has become an important topic of conversation between citizens on Tashkent's streets which are permeated with a jubilant atmosphere. The people are looking forward to continuous development of friendly Sino-Uzbek contacts which go back to ancient times. They hope the ancient silk road blazed by their forefathers will glow with new splendor.
