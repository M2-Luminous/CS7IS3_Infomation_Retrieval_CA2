It is about a probe of a scandal that seems to have dominated the domestic media and had overflowed externally. Coming out of testimony, the person remarked being really encouraged to have participated in something where the finding of fact is important, as opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip and sensationalism. In whatever is done on a personal or other level, there has to be a fairly healthy respect for others even if there should be emotions played up to get persons embroiled. When too much risk is raked up, or when there is reason to believe there could be undue muck-raking, there is good reason to speak up. In this paper yesterday, there was a piece of news that reflected badly on the intent behind a disclosure that the United States Senate had passed a bill authorizing the establishment of "Radio Free Asia", a broadcasting service to target the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Myanmar [Burma], Laos, and Vietnam. Concerned that such an act might harm friendly relations, the director general [D-G] of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had invited the Charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy to the ministry and conveyed Myanmar's deep regret that such a decision had been taken. The D-G pointed out that the creation of the surrogate broadcasting service was unjustifiable as there already existed a plethora of radio stations in the Asian region, even pointing out that our listeners are adequately served by foreign sources even including the Voice of America. The D-G made it plain that if "Radio Free Asia" should become operational and Myanmar is targeted, it could in no way be considered constructive or promoting the development of good relations between Myanmar and the United States. We would venture to add that should that radio station materialize and should Myanmar be targeted, we might have to borrow one of the American jingles and say "It ain't funny, but sure is corny". Let us hope we do not have to do that. We are equally opposed to innuendo and rumor-mongering and gossip and sensationalism.
