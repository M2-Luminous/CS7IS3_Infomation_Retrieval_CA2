Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, said yesterday. He has ordered a two-year study into whether the spending of billions to protect this country and its servicemen abroad would be justified. Mr. Rifkind added that a study was also under way to examine the possible purchase of stand-off cruise missiles, another expensive option. He emphasised that ballistic-missile technology was not confined just to those countries that Britain had "traditionally regarded as threatening us". The need for a ballistic-missile defence system is based on the assumption that such countries as Libya or Iraq, within potential range of Britain, could pose a threat within ten years or so. More than 20 countries are known to be buying or developing ballistic-missile systems. During the Cold War, Britain's strategy against a Soviet missile attack was based on deterrence. The possession of Polaris and its replacement Trident missile system was thought sufficient to deter the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear attack. In the post-Cold War era, the threat could come from countries prepared to call Britain's bluff and launch an attack, gambling that the Government would not retaliate with a strategic Trident missile. Partly to meet this threat, the Ministry of Defence intends to convert some Trident missiles into sub-strategic, shorter-range systems. The new study will examine which countries are likely to acquire effective missile systems, whether they pose a threat to Britain, what warheads they might have (nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional) and if a defensive system is affordable. Although there is no estimate, a national system could cost several billion pounds. Addressing the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, London, Mr. Rifkind said ballistic-missile defence had moved from the "Star Wars" projects of Cold War days to programmes with more limited scope.
