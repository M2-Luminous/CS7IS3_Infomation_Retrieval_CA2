"It would be controversial to play a role in a neighboring state's problem when I have not done it in my own country," Menchu said at a news conference, where she deplored the fact that the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have not asked her to mediate. Menchu said she was expressing her view on this matter because of the expectations that had been raised concerning the EZLN proposal, although, she stressed, the request to mediate was not made officially in a written document.
