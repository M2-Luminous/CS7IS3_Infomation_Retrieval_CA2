The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea in a letter of protest to the Japanese prime minister June 3 said the Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon, a legitimate organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, with the mobilisation of huge police and even their unhesitating murder and violence are a politically motivated sinister inhumane act. Noting that this was an anti-human political suppression the like of which could hardly be seen in the history of the world, the letter demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately stop suppressing Chongnyon organisations, apologize for their encroachment on the legitimate rights of Koreans in Japan and fully guarantee their political rights and freedom regulated under the publicly recognized international law. The chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship Association in a letter of protest to the Japanese Government May 31 denounced the Japanese authorities for suppressing Chongnyon as part of their campaign against the DPRK and stepping up the anti-DPRK campaign in league with international reactionaries, and urged them to stop it at once.
