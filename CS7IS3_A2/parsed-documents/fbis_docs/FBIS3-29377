Wichit said the Cabinet had given approval to the Defence Ministry to buy six transport planes, worth Bt3.42 billion, from Italy, but it must cooperate with the Finance and the Commerce ministries to persuade Rome to buy Thai agricultural produce in return. Wichit said it would be difficult fol Thailand to ask Rome to accept the barter-trade deal since the purchase was not at government-to-government level. He also said if the Air Force had to coordinate with the other two ministries it might delay the plan and "the price will go up." The Cabinet decided last November that the armed forces must inform the Commerce Ministy about future arms purchase so that it could help to negotiate possible barter deals. The Cabinet's move was lauded as a way to end decades of obscure weapons purchases which sometimes were plagued with charges about irregularities. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai later played down the issue by saying that the decision was not mandatory. The Commerce Ministry however has set up a committee, chaired by Director General of the International Trade Department Oranut Osathanon, to study and coordinate potential arms barter-trade deals with foreign countries.
