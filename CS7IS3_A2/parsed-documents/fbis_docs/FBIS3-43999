Shortly after his arrival, the two governments held bilateral talks in the Presidential Villa. State House correspondent, Chris Ngu, reports on President Ousmane's first stay in Abuja. [Ngu] The Nigerien [Nigerois] President was received on arrival by the head of state, General Sani Abacha, and top members of his administration, including the chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya and a number of ministers. The airport reception featured the traditional 21-gun salute, a guard of honor inspected by the visiting head of state, and displays by Nigerian cultural groups. Bilateral talks were held behind closed doors. However, in the opening session just before the talks proper, head of state, Gen. Abacha, had said that Nigeria-Niger relations over the years could justify reference to Nigeriens as brothers. He said he looked forward to additional new ways of forging closer and more fruitful relations between both countries. President Ousmane expressed similar hope as Gen. Abacha. He said the Niger-Nigeria relations have been reinforced over the years by geographical, historical, and cultural factors common to both countries. He said he hoped that the talks will help consolidate relations between the two countries. The outcome of the talks is yet to be made public. About now, a state banquet in honor of the visiting head of state should be taking place in Abuja. He is expected to return to his country tomorrow.
