The Serbian aggressor has been attacking the defense lines in Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and [word indistinct] with all available arms." As Sadikovic continues to report, "our defenders are offering heroic resistance." He also says that "Cazin and Bihac commune were shelled early last night and this morning. There were numerous casualties among the fighters and the civilians." A dispatch from Mostar by the Information Service of the 4th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "over the last 24 hours the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] on several occasions seriously violated the cease-fire agreement on the Mostar battlefield. The HVO extremists have opened fire with portable grenade launchers at the separating lines and the town center throughout the night. The HVO snipers in the House Economics School were not sitting idle either." "The chetniks displayed intense combat activities on all battlefields in the zone of responsibility of the 3d Corps," the 3d Corps Information Service reports. "In the Bosna River valley, the chetniks in Blizna attacked the villages Medik and Luke with a Bofors gun and Smaljbasici from a B-1 gun. With 34 shells from a 120-mm caliber mortar the chetniks shelled our positions in Djedovac and Zedni Vrh yesterday evening. Karadzic's criminals from Vlasic opened fire at Turbe, using mortars and Bofors gun. At approximately 1800 they attacked with a B-1 gun. The consequence of this shelling are three injured civilians." It is also reported that "the chetniks in Komare fired one tank shell at Travnik." The 3d Corps then adds that "the cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO is more or less being observed. More serious cease-fire violations have been noted in the region of (Luknica) and Brdjani in the Bosna River valley, where the HVO soldiers fired one explosive device and displayed intense small arms fire." Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian aggressor continued to shell the lines of Brcko's defense over the last 24 hours. Yesterday at midday the enemy carried out a powerful artillery attack at our positions in Djukici. From the direction of Sekulic, the chetniks fired nearly 100 projectiles of 60-mm and 82-mm caliber." Deronjic adds that "the positions of our fighters on Kladje-Djukici line were the most frequent target of aggressor's mortars in the course of last night. The chetniks were attacking the central part of defense of the free Brcko territory with antiaircraft guns. Two powerful explosions that echoed in the most densely populated part of the temporarily occupied Brcko at 1140 yesterday confirm that the Serbian fascists continue to destroy the biggest town of the Bosnian Posavina."
