Acting on the basis of its firm, consistent adherence to the NPT and its determination to prevent a center of tension -- especially nuclear -- emerging on its borders, Russia is in favor of a comprehensive settlement to the situation, says a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, with which Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acquainted journalists at a briefing today. Russia is prepared, the document observes, to support the resolution now under discussion in the UN Security Council appealing to the DPRK to meet its commitments to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] under the NPT. Taking account of the fact that the talks have not been crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to tackle the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose using a multilateral approach, which could be centered on an international conference attended by Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN secretary general and the IAEA director general, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement says. We are certain, the Russian foreign policy department stresses, that only such an approach will enable us to find mutually acceptable, balanced solutions, which will ensure that the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into confrontation. The Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry today issued a statement, which says: "The situation surrounding the problem of the DPRK's participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] is prompting growing anxiety and alarm. Acting on the basis of its firm, consistent adherence to the NPT and its determination to prevent a center of tension -- especially nuclear -- emerging on its borders, Russia is in favor of a comprehensive settlement to the situation. "First: We are prepared to support the resolution now under discussion in the UN Security Council appealing to the DPRK to meet its commitments to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] under the NPT. We will also seek decisive action by the Security Council in all other instances where threats of nuclear proliferation emerge, without double standards. "Second: Taking account of the fact that the talks have not been crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to tackle the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose using a multilateral approach, which could be centered on an international conference attended by Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN secretary general and the IAEA director general. This format for the conference is the most logical, because the aforementioned countries are located on the Korean Peninsula or in the immediate vicinity, and have a realistic ability to play a special part in a settlement. "The agenda for the conference must make it possible to reach comprehensive solutions that take account of the legitimate interests of all the parties involved. In particular, subjects for discussion and agreement could be security guarantees for the DPRK and the ROK, assistance for the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with international guarantees of its nonnuclear status, including appropriate international verification [kontrol], and guarantees of noninterference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and ROK. "We are certain that only such an approach will enable us to find mutually acceptable, balanced solutions that will ensure that the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into confrontation."
