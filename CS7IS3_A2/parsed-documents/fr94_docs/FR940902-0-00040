FR940902-0-00040 FR940902-0-00010 The final rule is revised to permit a simplified service strategy. For example, under title II, it is intended that a participant, based upon the needs identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS, will be provided or the program will arrange for the necessary payments and supportive services to enable the participant to meet the goals set out in the ISS. The necessary payments and supportive services may be provided or paid for in different ways. For example, participants may receive a payment from a training activity, such as an employer-paid wage for OJT, or work-based training payment for work experience which may be counted toward meeting their needs in addition to other supportive services like child care. Participants may also receive supportive services, such as financial assistance under title II that will provide for the participant's general welfare. If the participant has additional specific needs not met by the supportive services, including a need for financial assistance, title II further provides for an individually determined needs-based payment may be made to the participant. The final regulation provides for significantly different documentation requirements than did the interim final rule. An individual determination of need, over and above what normally occurs in the objective assessment and ISS, is not required to justify the provision of any supportive service. When a participant is given money rather than a voucher for a supportive service, SDA's and SSG's need not ensure that the payment is exactly equal to the participant's expenditure. The policy of the SDA or SSG may allow for a fixed reimbursement or a schedule of different reimbursement amounts for a type of service, however, the policy must provide the rationale for such amounts. Under title II, if the objective assessment and the ISS indicate that a needs-based payment is also necessary, then that determination will be sufficient to make the payment. A payment may then be made in accordance with a locally developed policy and recorded in the ISS along with the other services provided. Changes to reflect this strategy are made throughout §§627.305 and 627.310 of the final rule. Shifting to more specific recommendations, in response to comments that the supportive services section be separated from the benefits and working conditions section, the supportive services regulations are now found under §627.310, while benefits and working conditions are now addressed under a new §627.315. Section 627.300 and the title of subpart C are also amended to clarify these changes. A comment was received regarding the ability to ensure that services were provided equitably. This concern is heightened with the reduction in documentation required when providing supportive services and payments. Therefore, a new provision is added at §§627.305(a)(3) and 627.310(d) requiring that SDA's ensure, to the extent possible, that similarly situated participants receive similar payments or supportive services, as appropriate. Payments A few commenters requested clarification on when payments shall count towards the determination of income for other programs that serve JTPA participants. To clarify, language from section 142(b) of the Act is now included in §627.305(a)(4). Any payment under JTPA, broadly defined for this section as any JTPA funds received by a participant except OJT wages (since OJT wages are paid by an employer), shall not be counted for purposes of determining income for other Federal or federally assisted programs, except as provided under the Social Security Act. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued a policy notice (PIH 92&hyph;48, October 16, 1992) which states, ``[A]ll payments received under programs funded in whole or part under the Job Training Partnership Act are excluded from Annual Income'' for purposes of Public and Indian Housing. The major exception to disregarding JTPA income is under title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act which governs Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The AFDC regulations do allow States flexibility in allowing a dependent child's JTPA income to be disregarded as income for AFDC purposes (45 CFR 233.20(a)(11)), but generally, any JTPA payment to an adult AFDC recipient, except to cover the cost of child care, transportation, work-related expenses or work-related services, is counted as earned income. States are encouraged to work with their welfare departments in developing State policies specifically for JTPA. SDA's also are encouraged to coordinate with their local AFDC agency to determine local policies on income disregards and to consider co-enrollment with JOBS, where appropriate, so that the participant may be aware of all available services. Section 627.305(a) is revised to include a new paragraph (a)(6) which authorizes SDA's to set fixed levels for payments. Section 627.305(b) is amended by replacing the words ``formula or procedure'' with the word ``policy''. These changes permit SDA's to make needs-related payments based on a payment schedule without any other documentation than that used to develop or support the schedule. Only in cases in which a participant's needs exceed the payments available under the payment schedule is any other documentation or justification necessary. The change in the wording of §627.305(b) also is intended to make it clear that there are no extraordinary documentation requirements to support the SDA's system for payments above its payment schedule. All that is needed is a reasonable policy based on the circumstances of the local community.
