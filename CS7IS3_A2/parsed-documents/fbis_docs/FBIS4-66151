Can they reasonably form the subject of a pact? [Hurd] First, I would like to stress that the initiative taken by Mr. Balladur is positive. Of course, it is appropriate to examine all aspects of it. However, it must not lead to the creation of a new world machinery. There are already enough international meetings as it is. But, if it is possible to prevent possible antagonism in Central and East Europe through diplomacy, then it is worth the effort. [Duplouich] Is this the right way of establishing a new peaceful order in Europe? [Hurd] Let us look at things in practice. Look at what is happening in the Balkans and further east, in Crimea, for instance. These are dangerous situations which may deteriorate if no preventive action is taken. And another Bosnia could then appear. It is therefore reasonable to invite all those primarily concerned by a potential conflict to solve their differences before they reach a critical threshold. This is the very concept of the Pact for Security and Stability, and it is a good concept. The problem is how to translate it into procedure. [Duplouich] Russia has finally agreed to sign the Partnership for Peace unconditionally. What is your view of this promise? [Hurd] I warmly welcome the Russian decision. This idea of a partnership which will create links between Russia and NATO is really very ingenious. [Duplouich] But is there not reason to be worried when it defense minister, General Grachev, publicly states: "The CIS is Russia!"? [Hurd] I recently spoke with Gen. Pavel Grachev and I do not recognize this statement which is attributed to him. No, Russia accepts the sovereignty of its neighbors. Of course, it has a special interest in its relations with them, and the international community recognizes that. But this interest must be demonstrated in the sphere of international law. Andrey Kozyrev, my Russian counterpart, accepts, for instance, that the peacekeeping interventions in the neighboring states must be organized at the request of the states themselves and not unilaterally decided by Moscow. No Justification for Europessimism [Duplouich] At present Europe is also about the renewal of the Strasbourg Parliament. This is an election which is being prepared amid virtually universal indifference. What is the reason for this apathy? [Hurd] The European Twelve continue to enjoy a prosperity and stability which grateful future generations will admire. The Union is now emerging from the recession. I therefore see no justification for gloom or pessimism. [Duplouich] The fact remains that the one feeling which is shared by the Europeans is disillusionment. [Hurd] Allow me to qualify that: There is disillusionment with all those who promise too much in Europe's name! The lesson is clear: We must beware of promising too much. With the Maastricht Treaty, we have a good structure. We must now build its success brick by brick on the three pillars on which it rests: common foreign and security policy; cooperation on crime, drugs, and terrorism; implementation of subsidiarity, respect for strict budgetary discipline; and completion of the single market. Let us avoid thinking of a new structure before we have completed the other. [Duplouich] So, is a pause vital? [Hurd] One of Europe's weaknesses, when faced with criticism, has always been to go further, to "do more." What the Europeans want is not for us to do "more!" It is to do better what is already being done. [passage omitted]
