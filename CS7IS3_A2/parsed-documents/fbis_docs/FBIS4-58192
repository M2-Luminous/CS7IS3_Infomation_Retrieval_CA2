In his message, brother Abu-'Ammar affirms that the edification of our national authority as a first step toward the setting up of an independent state requires the use and mobilization of all the energies and potentials of our people. Here is the text of the message of brother Abu-'Ammar: Brother and sister members of the Ramallah Club, honorable friends and guests, greetings to you. On the occasion of the convening of your conference for this year in Ramallah on the soil of our dear homeland, I address my sincerest greetings, my congratulations and heartfelt wishes to you all, to the honorable friends and guests, and all the sons of our people in the homeland and in the diaspora. I wish your conference success in its work and I wish it will realize its objectives, with the hope that your conference next year will be held on the soil of the homeland when the long night of occupation will have lifted for our people, who will have gained freedom and independence and secured sovereignty over their national territory. Your conference is being convened at a time when we are close to starting to reap the first fruit of the long march of the struggle of our people, during which they have made the greatest sacrifices. This first fruit is the end of the Israeli occupation of dear parts of the territory of our dear homeland Palestine in Gaza and Jericho, and the beginning of a new stage of struggle which is no less important and difficult, namely the stage of edification and construction, the building of infrastructure, and the setting up of institutions and bodies in order to establish our national authority and entrench its bases and foundations as a first step toward the setting up of our independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. This requires the use and mobilization of all the energies and potentials of our people with all seriousness and loyalty so as to secure the success of this march and lead it to its objective; to work with all objectivity and eagerness in order to preserve the national unity of our people; and to strengthen and entrench this unity, so that it may be the guarantee of our success in building our free, civilized, and democratic Palestinian society. Our people are facing a great challenge, and they deserve to tackle it, given the glorious history of our people, and given their energies, capabilities, and potentials which enable them to march toward the future with confident steps to succeed and overcome all difficulties, no matter how great, to realize their progress and prosperity, to take their proper place among the peoples of the world, and to take part in the progress and prosperity of the region and in the march of the civilization of mankind. I reiterate my greetings to you and I shake your hands. See you soon, God willing, in our beloved homeland Palestine, within our own independent state, to raise the high and floating banners of our people and nation over the churches, mosques, and walls of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our independent state, Almighty God willing. It is revolution until victory, until our floating banners are raised over Jerusalem, with the help of Almighty God.
