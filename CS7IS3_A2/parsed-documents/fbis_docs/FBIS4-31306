Our correspondent Zdena Cela filed this telephone dispatch: [Cela] The military Immunology and Bacteriology Research Institute in Techonin in Usti nad Orlici district has never produced, developed, or stored military bacteriological weapons. This is what Dr. Jiri Beran, dean of the Hradec Kralove-based Military Medical Academy, who is in charge of scientific work, told the news conference today. Development of a combat biological agent is, above all, a matter for top scientists in the sphere of gene handling and genetic engineering, Beran went on to say. The point is that all of the agents have been identified [zmapovat], and, if one wants to develop a new agent, a new part of a genetic information [carrier] would have to be inserted [in the already identified agents]. No work has ever been done on this subject at the Military Medical Academy. Dr. Beran explained the attacks waged by CESKY DENIK in March of this year by saying that editors have little knowledge of the subject and are unwilling to look deeper into the problem. The matter is being investigated by the Defense Ministry inspection team and an interministerial commission.
