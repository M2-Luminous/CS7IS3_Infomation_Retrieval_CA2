Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed reporters on the details of the meeting: [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral, regional, and international events, as well as events related to APEC after the grouping's meeting in Seattle last year. Several points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view that ties between Indonesia and Australia have progressed smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime Minister Keating visited Indonesia a few months ago. The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of visits between the two countries' officials, both at the national and regional level. The president pointed out that in some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe that relations between businessmen and private citizens should be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for the progress of both countries. The two leaders also discussed matters relating to APEC, as well as the APEC leaders' meeting on Blake Island. They noted that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful for preparations to hold the second APEC summit meeting scheduled in Indonesia in November. The Australian prime minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to make the upcoming APEC meeting successful. That is all I can tell you; thank you for your attention.
