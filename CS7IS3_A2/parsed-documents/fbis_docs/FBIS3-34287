[Mirhij] I held wide-ranging talks covering the possibility of supplying Lebanon with arms, equipment, helicopters, coast guard requirements, rescue boats, light weapons, communication equipment, and various means of transport. The talks were held in the commercial way used traditionally between states. We sensed a British interest in strengthening economic ties and in playing a part in the region. We also sensed a British interest in the Lebanese market as a key to the region and beyond. They appreciate the Lebanese activity abroad and know that the goods it receives become popular. [AL-HAYAH] Did the British officials show no inclination to provide financial or technical aid? [Mirhij] The talks were held on a selling and buying basis but the British expressed willingness to provide facilities if deals were concluded. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the process of reconciliation between the various sects? [Mirhij] It means nothing. Thr reconciliation should be among all the Lebanese because there are differences within each sect. Sectarian solutions only confirm the old disease. I hope that what I have said will not be interpreted to mean that I am against good relations within each sect and between sects, for that is a binding moral and humanitarian necessity. [AL-HAYAH] Is the cabinet now an institution as stipulated in the al-Ta'if agreement or is it still controlled by the "troika"? [Mirhij] The cabinet is in the process of becoming an institution. This road is full of challenges but there is no alternative to it because when the cabinet becomes an institution it will be fulfilling everyone's rights and will be a guarantee for everyone. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the president's call for the amendment of the al-Ta'if agreement in connection with the powers of the presidency? [Mirhij] The al-Ta'if document represents the political ceiling in a dangerous phase in Lebanon's life and it has achieved some kind of political balance and, more importantly, national accord on the basis of which the state has been rebuilt. That is why that formula should be preserved and protected by all means. [AL-HAYAH] Are you in favor of the literal implementation of the al-Ta'if agreement? [Mirhij] Yes, and after implementation we can improve from within. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Have their been any operations against Syrian checkpoints? [Mirhij] There have been some attempts against some position and the culprits have been arrested. [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International has talked about torture of detainees. [Mirhij] I have no official information that anyone has been tortured. Let me say that such attempts in fact target stability and not the legal and legitimate Syrian presence which is objectively and strategically needed. Resisting the Syrian Army in this connection means resisting the supreme national interest. [AL-HAYAH] There are those who claim that there has been an arrangement to ensure that the Syrian presence is not terminated. [Mirhij] It will be a different matter when Lebanon is united and its institutions well established. The Syrians are helping Lebanon build its institutions because that is in their interest. [AL-HAYAH] What about political decisions? [Mirhij] Political decisionmaking in accordance with the al-Ta'if agreement has eliminated the possibility of conflict with the Syrian position and pushed toward integration. For instance, how would we have confronted the Israeli ambitions had there been no Lebanese-Syrian solidarity? [AL-HAYAH] If the challenges of negotiations with Israel necessitated a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you agree? [Mirhij] I am for any close integral political links that serve Lebanon, confirm its existence, and contribute to the liberation of its territory from occupation and the rebuilding of its state. What is going on now is the consolidation of the fraternity treaty and the building of its institutions. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Are you continuing to grant citizenship to whomever it is due to? [Mirhij] That is a commitment under the al-Ta'if agreement and the cabinet statement. We want to carry it out whatever the difficulties and complications. [AL-HAYAH] What about Palestinian rights? [Mirhij] Relations with the Palestinians are at their best. We always meet with them and facilitate their work as much as possible. There are some problems regarding the practice of certain professions such as medicine, engineering, and law. Apart from that, we help them in all fields. [AL-HAYAH] There are those who use a racist language against the Palestinians. [Mirhij] There is such a thing but we are fighting it. The Palestinians are our brothers and they have suffered and have been the victims of international ambitions and the Zionist movement. It is our duty to do our best to help them. Sometimes there is failure. That happens with our own people but it is something we are continuously trying to surmount and not a position we take.
