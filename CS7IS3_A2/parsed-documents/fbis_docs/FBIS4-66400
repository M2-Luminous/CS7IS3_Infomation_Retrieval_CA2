This makes it possible for all nine utility companies throughout Japan, with the exception of Okinawa, to participate in a local telecommunications system. The circuits among these companies if connected into what has been described as a "utilities-based Shindenden," it could become a "Second-Tier NTT." The "utility company threat" is taken seriously by the telecommunications and broadcasting industries, now combining their own efforts, if only because the utility companies already are well supplied with equipment, such as regular power lines to expand communication circuits. During a recent "incident," the communications industry, including NTT, charged the utility companies with taking the first steps toward creation of a "utilities-based Shindenden" with the intention of dominating the national market. The Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) based Shindenden, Tokyo Telecommunications Network (TTNet), in February 1994, requested permission to link up with its adjacent "utilities-based Shindenden" at a meeting of an advisory study group labeled "The Study of the Status of Link-up for More Versatile Services." The study group is under the Director of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). TTNet has been operating the business and household telephone services, but their area of operation has been limited to customers in the region TEPCO serves with their electricity. For example, in Shizuoka Prefecture, which includes territory west of the Fuji River, Fuji City, which is located east of the Fuji River, cannot be directly connected with Shizuoka City which is located west of the river. Neither can TTNet be connected with Fukushima and Niigata Prefectures where TEPCO's nuclear power plants are located. In order to work around such inconveniences, TTNet requested approval of link-up with adjacent operators. Each utility-based Shindenden is at present operating mainly business lines, exclusively used for communications within their own company. However, if all of the utilities-based Shindenden were linked with an expanded telephone service network, they would establish a nationwide network comparable to a "Second NTT." NTT President Masashi Kojima indicated the possibility of the utility group becoming a major counterpart to NTT at a press interview by stating, "The utilities-based Shindenden will eventually link up among themselves. So the future telecommunications market will be divided into NTT and its counterpart group." Advantages Over "Optical Fibers" In response to the "utility companies threat" theory now circulating, utility companies are busy describing the charge as "exaggeration." "Utilities-based Shindenden are simply small-scale communications companies and not utility companies. They cannot be anywhere near big enough to be rivals." The communications business can be divided into two major areas. One is general purpose telephone service and the other is exclusive business lines which connect company headquarters and their branch offices. The telephone market is estimated to reach 짜5 trillion and the business lines are a 짜500 billion market. However, in reality, a majority of the operation of even TTNet, which was established early on, is aimed at exclusive lines, a business whose market share is rather frugal. Only 10,000 telephone lines were subscribed, only 0.05 percent of the approximately 20 million line capacity of the TEPCO jurisdiction. TTNet's FY92 pretax profit reached 짜4.4 billion, a cumulative deficit of 짜14.1 billion. Sources close to MPT commented coolly, "Business is tough even in the metropolitan area. Local utility companies are simply entering the communications business under pressure to please local businessmen and officials." While such a situation exists, utility-based communications companies still seem to be pushing for business as they have high hopes for the advantages of optical fibers. For example, a single optical fiber 0.1mm in diameter can handle 23,000 telephone lines. Nowadays, many offices are being equipped with computers. Demand for high quality imagery and high speed digital transmission keep increasing. Potential applications of optical fibers, including company TV conferences and imagery supervision systems for medical facilities are enormous. The uses of optical fibers for individual homes will include telephones, and also make it possible to transmit high quality imagery and sound through CATVs and HDTVS. Utility group communication companies which originally began in business using mostly optical fibers can in this regard actually compete with NTT. The utility industry assumes a humble posture, insisting that the potential of their communications business has been "overestimated." However, they have not discarded their hopes of penetrating the field for household customers as they ride with the current tide of new media and multimedia. Rivalry Between MITI and MPT Also Seen Behind the "Threat Theory" In the background of this Shindenden threat theory, rivalry between the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which is the supervising agency for the utility industry, and MPT which controls information communications policy, is seen. Some MITI officials have complained about MPT not approving link up of the utility group Shindenden saying, "MPT is aiming at dividing NTT at the local level. If MPT approved the link-up of the utilities-based Shindenden, it will be hard for them to divide NTT." On the other hand, MPT officials made conservative statements about the future of a utilities-based Shindenden by saying. "It is hard for a utility-based Shindenden to obtain private telephone customers to improve business. It will have to be limited to a special area including exclusive business lines and portable hand-held phones (PHP)." Others said, "The utilities-based Shindenden will be able to provide channels for CATVs and build up the strength to eventually compete with NTT." MPT wants to encourage local group-based communications companies to be competitive in order to avoid NTT's monopoly, but at the same time they fear that MITI's domination over the local utilities group-based communications companies might end up becoming too great if they become prosperous.
