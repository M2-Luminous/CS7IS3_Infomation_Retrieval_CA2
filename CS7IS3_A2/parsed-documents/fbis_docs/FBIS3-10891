The increase annoyed President Itamar Franco, who demanded that measures be taken. Before learning that he had been dismissed, Gastao asserted that the rate hikes had been suggested by Jose Milton Dallari, special Finance Ministry adviser on pricing policies. Franco demanded that it be determined who was responsible for the increase. From that point on, those responsible for pricing policy in the Finance Ministry and in the Mines and Energy Ministry tried to dodge responsibility. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso himself began to absolve his advisers of blame. He asserted: "Neither I nor Dallari authorized this increase. The reasons for it should be sought in the Mines and Energy Ministry." Yesterday Fernando Henrique said the price adjustment was "unacceptable": "Rates were increased without my approval. Someone is going to have to pay for this, because it goes against the stabilization plan." According to Cardoso, an agreement between the Finance Ministry, the DNAEE, and the public energy contractors estimated that the increase should be based on the average increases of the past four months, which would have been approximately 38 percent. According to the minister's estimates, electric power rates accumulated a real increase of 8.6 percent last October. Stepanenko refused to comment on the reasons that compelled him to dismiss Gastao. He said: "I made the decision in exercise of my authority, and do not wish to discuss it." Stepanenko is now trying to figure out what to do with the increase: He can either cancel it, or compensate for it in the next adjustment. Gastao defended himself: "The initial order was to transform rates into URV's [real value units]. But we then received a counter order not to do so, and to continue using the parametric formula. That order came from Dallari." The parametric formula takes into account the operational costs of each of the enterprises of this sector. Israel Vargas stood up for his director: "Gastao was in constant contact with the Finance Ministry. The minister and I were probably duped in our good faith by factors beyond our control."
