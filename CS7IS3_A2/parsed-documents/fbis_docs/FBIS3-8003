Defenders at (Vlasko), Hasino Brdo, and Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights have been submitted to unprecedented howitzer and tank fire, which has killed a large number of them. Although they have been suffering constant losses in manpower and military hardware, the chetniks are still mindlessly attacking. Heroes of the 5th Corps have destroyed one enemy antiaircraft gun, two ZIS weapons, and several motor vehicles, which obviously serves the chetniks with a reason to continue and increase their wild artillery activity on Bihac, Cazin, and their outskirts. There are dozens of injured civilians due to the systematic destruction of settlements over the last 24 hours. Local hospitals are full, and there are hardly any basic first aid kits. Chetnik helicopters are still freely flying over the Bihac area bringing in new manpower and new artillery. The world is still calmly observing this [word indistinct] and disappearance of people and tows from the face of the earth.
