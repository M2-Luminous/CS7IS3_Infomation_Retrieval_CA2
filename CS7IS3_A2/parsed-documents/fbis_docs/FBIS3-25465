Nigerian Army units, which have been occupying parts of the peninsula since December 21, launched a fresh attack against Cameroon troops on Friday and Saturday, but it was beaten off, it said in a statement. The latest incident took place despite the fact that Cameroon had sent "several high-level missions" to Nigeria to resolve the dispute peacefully and talks were still going on, said the statement signed by Joseph Owona, secretary-general of the presidency. The government was appealing to the UN Security Council, the International Court in The Hague and the Organisation of African Unity, "to establish our rights against this illegal occupation of our territory," it said, arguing that Cameroon's sovereignty was supported by international treaties. The country would continue to maintain talks with Nigeria and "seek a peaceful, just and durable settlement of the issue," the statement continued. The Pakazzi Peninsula (known as Bakassi by Nigeria), along with the Apani and Diamant Islands occupied by Nigerian soldiers since the beginning of the year, lies at the mouth of the Akpa Yafe River which marks the boundary between the two countries. The border was never precisely drawn through the peninsula, an area of mangroves and swamps where most people make their living from fishing, and Nigeria has maintained a claim to the territory. Nigeria says Cameroonian incursions have caused the deaths and flight of thousands of Nigerians from the region, prompting Lagos to deploy troops there. During an earlier period of tension in 1981, France threatened to intervene militarily to defend Cameroon against Nigerian demands, under the terms of its defence agreement with Yaounde. The two countries began border demarcation negotiations under a joint commission in 1986 but it has never given a final ruling. Over the last 10 days they have been exchanging government delegations and on Friday Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, Francis Nkwain, handed over a message from President Paul Biya to his Nigerian counterpart, General Sani Abacha.
