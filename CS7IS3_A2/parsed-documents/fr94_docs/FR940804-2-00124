FR940804-2-00124 FR940804-2-00068 United States District Court for the District of Columbia Civil Action No. 94&hyph;0948 Comments of GTE GTE Service Corporation, on behalf of its affiliated domestic telephone operating companies and GTE Laboratories Incorporated (GTE), herewith respectfully submits these Comments to the proposed Final Judgment in the above-captioned action. I. Introduction Although the proposed Final Judgment (hereinafter, Consent Decree) is a worthy attempt to stem the anti-competitive conduct rampant in the cable industry today_of which Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Liberty Media Corp. (Liberty) are major players_it suffers from two primary flaws. First, the term of the Consent Decree is clearly inadequate. Second, the Consent Decree would permit TCI/Liberty to withdraw high appealing programming from distribution_and specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the term of the Consent Decree. To remedy these flaws, GTE recommends: (1) That the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to seven years, and (2) that upon expiration of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty should be restrained from withdrawing any programming from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective competition'' within the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the Act 1 or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which TCI or Liberty has an interest. 1 47 U.S.V. §543(l)(1). II. Statement of Facts Currently, the distribution of multichannel video programming is overwhelmingly dominated by the cable industry. Cable systems are accessible to ninety-six percent of television households in American and over sixty percent of those households subscribe. Annual cable revenues now exceed twenty-one billion dollars, and the industry has been increasingly controlled by large Multiple Systems Operators (MSOs), including TCI and Liberty. 2 From the customer's perspective, ninety-nine percent of all cable customers have only one cable operator to choose from. 3 As the industry exists today, the transport of video programming to consumers is a monopoly service. 4 2 See National Cable Television Association, Cable Television Developments (March, 1993). The merged TCI and Liberty entities will serve more than thirteen million customers_a quarter of the nation's cable subscribers_and have financial interests in a wide range of programming services including a number of the most popular and widely-carried services. See Competitive Impact Statement, ¶ ll.A, at 3. 3 Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;385, section 2(a)(2), 106 Stat. 1460; see also S. Rep. No. 92 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1991), reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1133, 1141. 4 Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. v. United States , 830 F. Supp. 909, 927 (E.D. Va. 1993), appeal pending, No. 93&hyph;2340 (4th Cir). The most promising potential competition to entrenched cable interests comes from local exchange carriers (LECs), including GTE's domestic telephone operating companies. While LECs are presently prohibited from providing video programming to customers in their own service territories, 5 recent action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allows LECs to provide common carrier transport of the video signals of unaffiliated programmers, know a video dialtone (VDT). 6 While LECs look forward to providing consumers with a competitive alternative to incumbent cable operators like TCI and Liberty, these operators have fought vigorously to stave off competition at every turn. 7 5 47 U.S.C. 533(b); 47 CFR 63.54(c). GTE has challenged this ban on video programming. GTE California Incorporated v. Federal Communications Commission , No. 93&hyph;70924 (9th Cir.). Two district courts have already struck down the ban as unconstitutional. Chesapeake & Potomac, supra; US East, Inc. v. United States, No C 93&hyph;1523 R, Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (W.D. Wash., June 15, 1994). Numerous other district court actions are also pending. See, e.g., Pacific Telesis Group v. United States, No. C 93&hyph;20915 JW EAI (N.D. Cal.). Additionally, Congress is considering lifting the ban. See H.R. 3636 (103d Cong., 2d Sess.), S. 1822 (103d Cong., 2d Sess.). 6 Telephone Company-Cable Television Cross-Ownership Rules, Sections 63.54&hyph;65.58, Second Report and Order, Recommendation to Congress, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Dkt. 87&hyph;266, FCC 92&hyph;327, 7 FCC Rcd 5781 (1992) (Video Dialtone Order), pets, for recon. pending, appeal pending sub nom. Mankato Citizens Telephone Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 92&hyph;1404 et al. (D.C. Cir.). See Competitive Impact Statement, ¶ II.C, at 7. 7 See, e.g., the National Cable Television Association's July 5, 1994 Petition to Deny the Applications of Contel of Virginia, Inc. d/b/a GTE Virginia, GTE Florida Incorporated, GTE California Incorporated and GTE Hawaiian Telephone Company, Inc. for authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to construct, own, operate and maintain video dialtone facilities, Nos. W&hyph;P&hyph;C 6955, 6956, 6957, 6958. III. The Consent Decree Must be Modified To its credit, the Consent Decree seeks to discourage TCI/Liberty's anti-competitive conduct with respect to multichannel subscription television distributors (MSTDs) and video programming providers (VPVs). 8 However, TCI/Liberty's existing monopoly position, the cable industry's long history of anti-competitive conduct, coupled with their current attempts to derail all potential competition, present a clear and present danger that the provisions of the Consent Decree will be woefully inadequate. In particular, the restraints imposed by the Consent Decree appear to be lifted at the very point in time when competition will likely be becoming a reality. 8 See Proposed Final Judgment ¶ II.D and E, at 2. Sections 616 and 628 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. 536 and 548, refer to these entities as multichannel video programming distributors and video programming vendors. A consent decree is not merely a private contract between the parties; it is a judicial decree backed by the contempt power of the Court. Thus, in approving the decree, ``the Court performs a judicial function and is called upon to decide whether it is equitable to enter the decree as proposed by [the parties].'' United States v. Carter Products , Inc. , 211 F.Supp. 144, 147&hyph;48 (S.D.N.Y. 1962). The decree ``must be scrutinized carefully and approved, both as to form and content, by the court entering it, prior to such entry.'' Esso Corp. v. United States, 340 F.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 1965). Indeed, the Court is required ``to make an independent determination of the propriety and equity of the decree proposed.'' United States v. F.&M. Schaefer Brewing Co., 1968 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 72,345 (E.D.N.Y. 1967). As presently proposed,the Consent Decree fails this standard. Because the Consent Decree does not adequately serve the public interest, it must be modified or rejected by the Court. See, e.g., United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131,216 (D.D.C. 1982); State of New York v. Dairylea Cooperative, 547 F.Supp. 306, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). It is therefore incumbent upon the Department of Justice, consistent with its responsibilities under the Tunney Act, 9 to seek modification of the Consent Decree before any request for entry of judgment is made to the Court. 9 Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h).
