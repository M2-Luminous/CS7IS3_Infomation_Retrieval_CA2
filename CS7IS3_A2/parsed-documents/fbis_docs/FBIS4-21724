The attack, which occurred yesterday afternoon, has left more than 50 people homeless, because it caused a fire that destroyed 13 houses. Local police reported the reasons for the incident are still undetermined, but witnesses say two men called Arturo Andrade and Rito Duran, MIR leaders, were the ones who threw the bombs. Area residents have said this is not the first time the alleged culprits have attacked the area with explosives. Five years ago, the residents say, those people also threw bombs at them, because they refused to pay a cooperation quota to their organization. The attack was apparently aimed against the house of Maria Guadalupe Perez, a former MIR member who decided to leave that organization a few months ago. MIR is an ultra-leftist political organization that emerged in the past decade and has influence in several states in central Mexico. MIR has not openly declared itself an armed group.
