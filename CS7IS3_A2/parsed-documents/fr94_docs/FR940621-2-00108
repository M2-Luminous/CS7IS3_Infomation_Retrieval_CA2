FR940621-2-00108 FR940621-2-00068 13. Where a life annuity payment option is selected, the mortality risk borne by National Home under the two forms of the Contract arises from the obligation of National Home to make annuity payments regardless of how long an annuitant may live. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants will live longer than National Home's actuarial projections indicate, resulting in higher than expected annuity payments. National Home also assumes mortality risk as a result of an adjusted death benefit which is to be paid to an annuitant's beneficiary if the adjusted death benefit is greater than the Contract's accumulated value. 14. The expense risk borne by National Home is the risk that the charges for administrative expenses which are guaranteed for the life of the Contract may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of issuing and administering the Contract. 15. The mortality and expense risk is higher under the B Unit Contracts than under the A Unit Contracts because B Unit Contracts are expected to be more attractive to Contract owners purchasing a Qualified Contract. While both A Unit Contracts and B Unit Contracts are offered as Qualified Contracts, historically, the Contracts offering a contingent deferred sales load (like the B Unit Contracts) have been more appealing to those seeking to purchase Qualified Contracts than contracts with a front-end sales load (like the A Unit Contracts). The more complicated regulatory structure surrounding the offering and maintenance of Qualified Contracts makes these Contracts more expensive to administer. In addition, it is anticipated that the utilization of B Unit Contracts for Qualified Contracts will increase the instances where life annuity payment options are selected by B Unit Contract owners, in comparison to A Unit Contract owners, thereby increasing the mortality risk National Home is bearing under B Unit Contracts. 16. If the charges deducted are insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk, the loss will fall on National Home. If the charges prove more than sufficient, the excess will be added to National Home's surplus and will be used for any lawful purpose including any shortfalls in the costs of distributing the Contracts. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions 1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent any relief is necessary to permit the deduction from the Separate Account of the mortality and expense risk charges under the Contracts. Applicants request that the order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charges described herein from the assets of the Separate Account pursuant to other contracts offered in the future through the Separate Account, to the extent that such contracts are substantially similar to the Contracts. 2. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to materially similar contracts offered in the future by the Separate Account is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for National Home to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring National Home to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application. 3. Applicants represent that they have reviewed publicly available information regarding the aggregate level of the mortality and expense risk charges under variable annuity contracts comparable to the A Unit Contracts and the B Unit Contracts currently being offered in the insurance industry taking into consideration such factors as current charge level, the manner in which charges are imposed, the presence of charge level or annuity rate guarantees and the markets in which the Contracts will be offered. Based upon this review, Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charges under the Contracts are within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts. Applicants will maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying this representation. Similarly, prior to making available any substantially similar contracts through the Separate Account, Applicants will represent that the mortality and expense risk charges under any such contracts will be within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts. Applicants will maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying such representation. 4. Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in underlying funds that have undertaken to have a board of directors/trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of any such fund, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses. 5. Applicants do not believe that the front-end sales load or contingent deferred sales load imposed under the Contracts will necessarily cover the expected costs of distributing the Contract. Any shortfall will be made up from National Home's general account assets which will include amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charges. National Home has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the distribution financing arrangement being used in connection with the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract owners. National Home will keep and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation. Conclusion Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contract, or under substantially similar contracts offered in the future by the Separate Account, meets the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
