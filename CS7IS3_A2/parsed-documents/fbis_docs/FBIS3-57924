Meanwhile, Gen. Cot says that if his pride can be set aside, then there will come a time when it is a matter of honor. Indeed, there is a feeling of lost honor among the men who, on the ground, are finding that they are impotent to correctly fulfil the mandate entrusted to them by the United Nations. And yet, what mandate are we concerned with precisely? Creating safe areas? They are violated every day. Ensuring that the embargo imposed on Serbia is respected? European countries, and major ones at that, are suspected of bypassing it regularly. Protecting a Bosnian population under fire from snipers, or ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid? Every day, drivers of UN trucks -- some of them Belgians -- are confronted with fresh pitfalls and new obstacles which force them to negotiate and parley with people whom they would rather have wanted to prevent from causing harm. The military assure us that they lack the means to carry out their mission. There is a shortage of personnel: At least 50,000 men would be needed to guarantee the safe areas. There is a lack of training: How to handle endless arguments with village chiefs, whether in Bosnia or Somalia, is not yet taught at military academies. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had an easy time replying to his critics back in 1992 when, in his "Agenda for Peace," he advocated creation of "peace enforcement units" which would be made available by relevant governments. Alas! Ever since he has had to make do with an administrative staff which only has an entirely relative authority over the contingents "loaned" to the United Nations. In Somalia, it is from Rome -- not New York -- that the Italian soldiers take their orders; the Swedish troops in Yugoslavia follow the directives issued by Stockholm, while U.S. troops refuse to obey officers of other nationalities. Furthermore, the United Nations is faced with rising costs of peace missions: In Somalia, UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] is reproached for having cost $1.5 billion. In Angola, on the other hand, where the UN commitment during the elections was inadequate, an interventionary force is now required: Upon his return from Luanda, [former Belgian Prime Minister] Martens estimated that 10,000 men would be needed -- but who should be sent? Who will pay the bill? If the United Nations, or more specifically the five permanent members of the Security Council, grumble about supporting a new intervention in Angola, Burundi, or even Zaire, then it will be precisely because Bosnia and Somalia have poured boiling water over any goodwill that there might have been. The United Nations, which is expected to do great things but is often accused of performing very badly, is only an instrument of the policy -- or lack of policy -- of the international community. The real mandate of intervention -- imposing or maintaining peace, transporting humanitarian aid, disarming warring factions, protecting civil populations -- whether in Somalia or Bosnia -- is as blurred as the political will of the member states. Moreover, at the end of the day, the armed forces who are taking the risks and the humanitarian personnel who are making sacrifices have the uncomfortable feeling of being the screen destined to mask the incapability of leading politicians to zero in on the real problems and decide on genuine solutions.
