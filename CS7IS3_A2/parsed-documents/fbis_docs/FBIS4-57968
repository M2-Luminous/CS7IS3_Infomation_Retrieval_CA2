I want to reiterate that I have listened to fellow Sandinists and believe that their views are logical. The party's common interest is above my own. We have always worked for the common interest. The FSLN represents social rather than political interests. The FSLN seeks to benefit the majority of Nicaraguans; stability [words indistinct] is not enough. We have always strived for social laws that help alleviate the current poverty and misery facing Nicaragua. In light of these goals, which are above my personal interests, I have reconsidered my decision. [Reporter] The decisions of the FSLN bloc will always be subject to the Sandinist Assembly. I am referring specifically to the constitutional reform regarding reelections. [Ramirez] Constitutional reforms were discussed by the Sandinist Assembly, which is the FSLN's highest consultative body. The Assembly approved guidelines for negotiations, and the Sandinist bloc has fully complied with these guidelines. We have worked with the other factions on the draft constitutional bill, thus abiding by the said guidelines. I believe this matter will not be reviewed again by the new Sandinist Assembly. [Reporter] Then, will the FSLN be subject to the Sandinist Assembly? [Ramirez] There is no reason for the FSLN not to be subject to the Assembly since it is a political party. As William [name as heard] said, the Sandinist Assembly is a part of the political whole embodied by the FSLN.
