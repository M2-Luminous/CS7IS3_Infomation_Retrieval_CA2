The prime minister made the remark on Sunday evening, during his visit to the National Election Centre. Attending the session of the National Election Committee, Boross expressed satisfaction that the work of the Interior Ministry, which he formerly headed, played a decisive role. In his view, the country was characterized by a moderate tranquility during the elections. Leaving the session, the prime minister answered questions from journalists. He said that although he regards it as unpleasant, he would not be overly disappointed if his party does indeed win only 34 mandates, as was indicated by the public opinion poll issued in the evening hours. For him the true disappointment was the first round (in which the Hungarian Socialist Party won 32.96 per cent of the votes cast for party lists, while the senior party of the current government coalition, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, received 11.73 per cent.) In answer to a question on how effective a small-sized opposition can be in Parliament, Boross said that everything will depend on the readiness shown by the winning party. Up to now, many promises have been made which express a desire to keep in contact with the opposition.
