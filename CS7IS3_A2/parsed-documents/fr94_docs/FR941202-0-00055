ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to require U.S. firms entering into offset agreements associated with the sale of defense articles and/or defense services to foreign governments or foreign companies to provide BXA certain information regarding those agreements when they exceed $5,000,000 in value. This new regulation is being promulgated pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. DATES: This rule is effective December 2, 1994. Annual reports must be submitted on or before June 15 of the succeeding year, except that the report for calendar year 1993 must be submitted on or before March 15, 1995. ADDRESSES: Annual reports should be sent to Brad Botwin, Director, Strategic Analysis Division, Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, Attention: Offset Regulation Report, Room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erin Finn, Offsets Program Manager, Strategic Analysis Division, Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, Room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20230. Telephone 202&hyph;482&hyph;2322 or Fax 202&hyph;482&hyph;5650. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 amended the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the Act). The Act now requires that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense services to foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding such sales to the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations to collect this information and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized by the firm furnishing the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive agent in preparing an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States. This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant to the regulation provided here. It will address the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade of the United States. On April 26, 1994, BXA published in the Federal Register (59 FR 21678) a proposed rule on reporting of offsets in military exports designed to elicit comments, suggestions, information, or advice relative to the proposed regulation. 20 responses were received commenting on the proposed rule. The two major comments concerned the requirements to submit semi-annual reports and to report each individual transaction undertaken to fulfill an offset commitment. The rule has been amended to address these concerns. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This rule has been determined to be ``significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 940364&hyph;4212. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an average of 10 hours, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions already must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity that is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to these regulations is less than that required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered into, the information requested is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties involved.
