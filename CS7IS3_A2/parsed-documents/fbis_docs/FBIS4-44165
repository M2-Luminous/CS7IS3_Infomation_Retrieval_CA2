The recently implemented legislation on stricter inspections of incapacitated persons, must first demonstrate its use in practice. According to PvdA leader Kok, an agreement was reached with VVD leader Bolkestein, and D66 leader Van Mierlo on this subject. Kok does not rule out additional measures during the new cabinet legislature. Whether or not this will happen, depends on a criterion to be established in social security. The three parties still have to come to terms on this criterion. There are rumors about a standard for the number of persons entitled to an allowance, or for the overall amount of money involved in social security. Last Tuesday night [21 June] after the "purple" coalition talks, it also turned out that the three negotiators still disagree on the steps to be taken at that moment. The "purple" negotiators (namely Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo) are proposing a new package of policy measures to the Central Planning Bureau (CPB), which should serve as a first outline of a coalition agreement. On Tuesday morning, the relevant parties' financial experts reached an agreement on a different implementation of previously agreed savings, involving a total of 20 billion guilders. Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo requested calculations for several policy measures. At the end of the week, when Kok will be back from the European summit on Corfu, the final decision will have to be taken. Depending on the results of the CPB calculations in terms of employment and purchasing power, the negotiators will then decide whether or not a "purple" cabinet is feasible. However, additional adjustments are not ruled out at that stage. Kok expects the knots to be cut "next weekend or immediately after that." An important reference point for the negotiators, is an increase of employment by at least 100,000 jobs. In addition, PvdA and D66 made their political approval subject to an unchanged distribution of incomes. A previous calculation by the CPB, had stranded at upwards of 70,000 jobs. When including the effects of new policy plans (such as in the police force), between 74,000 and 75,000 additional jobs would be created. For all three parties, these figures are largely insufficient. The lowest incomes would suffer a 2 percent loss in purchasing power, while the average income would remain practically the same. This is unacceptable to PvdA. Another complication is that the consequences of certain measures fall outside the CPB model's scope.
