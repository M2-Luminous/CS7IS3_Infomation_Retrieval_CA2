Not long ago, a White House official complained: "As long as the Whitewater case can be driven out of the first page of the newspapers, any bad news can now be regarded as good news." An interesting fact was that on 17 March 1992, that is, two years ago, THE NEW YORK TIMES published a report on the event, but the report aroused no attention like a stone dropping into the sea. In late 1992, when Clinton and Bush contended for the presidency, the Department of Justice turned down the proposal of the department concerned on investigating the case for fear that this might be used by the Bush administration. In July 1993, Vincent Foster, deputy counsel to the president on legal affairs who was in the know, suddenly committed suicide, and the relevant materials in his hands disappeared without a trace. At that moment, the case just stirred up some ripples. Five months ago, a reporter talked about his investigation of the "Whitewater incident" at a banquet in Washington, but the subject was still discussed by very few people. How come the "Whitewater incident" changed from minor ripples into monstrous waves in the spring? "Whitewater" is the name of a business company. Fifteen years ago, Clinton and his wife, together with Mr and Mrs McDougal who later became Clinton's political ally, set up the Whitewater Development Corporation on the banks of Whitewater River in Arkansas, and the company was mainly engaged in trading idle real estate. In September 1991, Whitewater applied for bankruptcy after incurring business losses. The "Whitewater incident" was thus named after the company, and the incident itself developed into an extremely complicated economic-political case. The scope of investigation extended to Clinton's personal life as governor of Arkansas State for 12 years and his wife Hillary's main economic activities as well as Clinton's personal involvement in such activities. At present, it does not seem important to find out whether the Clintons underpaid Whitewater Corporation income taxes, and people have also paid less attention to the financial details of the case. People's interest is now focused on the conclusion: Did the Clintons use the influence of Bill Clinton's governorship to illegally transfer any funds of a state-run savings and loan bank to Whitewater Corporation for real estate investment? Was any money from the bank used to repay Clinton's $50,000 debt he owed when campaigning for the governorship, thus causing losses to taxpayers in Arkansas? Was any government loan offered through a certain company, or was any favorable administrative decision made in exchange for funds for campaigning for the governorship and the presidency? In one word, did the Clintons abuse their official power in pursuit of private gains? A major reason the "Whitewater incident" was highlighted by the press in such a frenzied way was that almost everyone made his or her own vague conjecture about this enigma. This year is a Congressional by-election year. The Republican Party hopes to make a comeback, so it is taking advantage of this case to make an uproar in order to add fuel to the flames and to damage Clinton's reputation. Clinton and many leading Democrats angrily call the Whitewater incident a "Republican conspiracy." On the other hand, while promising to give "full cooperation," the White House still tried to equivocate and pry into the process of investigation. Many political allies and long-time cronies were forced to quit government posts one after another. In addition, some Democrats' intention of drawing a "line of demarcation" between the Democratic Party and Clinton, the different assessments of Clinton's performances and administrative principles inside the Democratic Party, the resentment of the East Coast forces against the upstarts from the West spreading in the White House and inside D.C., and the different comments of voters about Hillary's role as both First Lady and major policy-maker responsible for formulating the increasingly controversial medical-care reform program..., all played a certain role in increasing the seriousness of the "Whitewater incident." Recently, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed a motion on holding separate Congressional hearings on the "Whitewater incident" by a unanimous vote and by an overwhelming majority respectively. Clinton also agreed to make public his tax returns between 1977 and 1979. Fiske, the special federal counsel responsible for handling the case, is busy issuing summons to more and more senior government officials. If the conclusion is "yes," Clinton will become another Nixon and "Whitewater" will really wash the White House away. The recent opinion poll showed that in a period of one month, Clinton's support declined by 11 percentage points; and this also showed that the American people believed there are no waves without wind.
