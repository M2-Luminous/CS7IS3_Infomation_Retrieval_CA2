Germany should not stand aside when "peace and freedom in the world and Europe" are at stake, Kohl said this morning in Bonn at a reception for servicemen who have taken part in humanitarian and peace missions. The chancellor recalled that Germany's security and its ability to act in foreign policy terms are based on the trust of its allies. Therefore, Germany must be "a reliable partner." The Bundeswehr's participation in "measures to safeguard world peace as part of the international community" is a key issue of German foreign and security policy, he said.
