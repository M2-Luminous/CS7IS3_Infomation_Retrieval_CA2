They virtually confirmed the legitimacy of the conclusions drawn by the British Defence Ministry which, according to press reports, had warned its government way back last December that Tokyo was close to developing a nuclear bomb. Mr. Fujii believes, in particular, that Japan's strategy is to distribute the formation of a nuclear potential among civilian sectors which raise no suspicions. Under present conditions Tokyo has no possibility to "hide" any large research expenditure in the state budget without specifying the purpose of the research efforts, Mr. Maeda pointed out, for his part. Such a strategy yields certain results because, for example, the country's companies have long devised unique explosive devices for carrying out complex oil-prospecting operations, the devices which may serve already now as finished detonators for a nuclear bomb. Of course, substantial technical obstacles still remain in the path of the development of a combat nuclear capability. However, the main problem, in experts' opinion, still is in making a political decision on the establishment of such systems in practice. Japan is now obviously not prepared for such a dramatic step, considering the pacifist sentiments among the public, the memories of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the constitutional bans, and the government-adopted three non-nuclear principles: Not to have, not to produce and not to import nuclear weapons. However, Mr. Maeda believes that Tokyo may seriously change its stance if it encounters a chain reaction of the proclamation of "nuclear sovereignties" by neighbouring countries. Japan is extremely worried by sufficiently reliable reports about North Korea's feverish nuclear efforts. There are suspicions that Seoul may also embark upon the same road if it fails to contain the military threat from Phyongyang by other means. Mr. Maeda is of the opinion that Japan can well become a third "new nuclear power of the region" after South Korea, although, in his view, Tokyo would hardly make such a decision easily.
