FR940314-0-00063 FR940314-0-00012 c. On AADC trays: LTR AADC 3D BARCODE, except for mailings in which residual mail is prepared under 6.2b use LTRS AADC BARCODED. * * * * * 6.0␣Residual Mail 6.1␣Definition Pieces remaining after packages and trays are prepared under 2.0 through 5.0 are residual (nonqualifying) mail. Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under an option in 6.2 and 6.3. Residual First-Class Mail must be prepared under 6.2 and 6.3, or 6.4, or 6.5, except that preparation may be finer than those standards, by agreement between the mailer and the entry post office for multiple acceptance times. All residual mail must be presented under 6.6. 6.2␣AADC Residual Preparation Options Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under one of these options and in accordance with 6.3. First-Class Mail may be prepared under one of these options and 6.3 if not prepared under 6.4 or 6.5. a. Separate AADC Preparation. Residual mail is trayed separately from qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual pieces to an AADC area in L804 are placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Residual pieces in mixed-AADC trays and in less-than-full AADC trays must be prepared and labeled as AADC packages. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under 6.3. b. Intermixed SCF/AADC Preparation. Some residual mail is trayed with qualifying mail in the 3-digit tier. Groups of 10 or more residual pieces to the same AADC area in L804 are packaged by AADC and placed in AADC trays (with qualifying mail) in the 3-digit tier and in separate mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. AADC trays containing only residual AADC packages are allowed. Mixed-AADC trays are limited to residual AADC packages. At the mailer's option, residual mail may be packaged by 3-digit ZIP Code and placed in SCF trays within the 3-digit tier (remaining pieces sorted by AADC). A less-than-full tray for the origin SCF in the 3-digit tier containing only residual packages is allowed. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under 6.3. 6.3␣AADC Residual Preparation Subject to 6.1 and 6.2, residual mail must be prepared as follows: a. Package size: (1) 3-digit (option 6.2b only): optional with no minimum for residual pieces in single- or multi-3-digit SCF trays in the 3-digit presort tier. (2) AADC: required at 10 pieces per AADC (use L804) for residual pieces in mixed-AADC trays, in less-than-full AADC trays, and in AADC trays (under option 6.2b) that also contain qualifying mail. Packages of fewer pieces not permitted. (3) Working: required grouping of pieces by AADC (use L804) in working trays. Packaging required only in a less-than-full working tray as follows: prepare as few packages as possible, each not more than 6 inches thick, without regard to AADC breaks. b. Package presort and labeling: (1) Optional 3-digit (only for option 6.2b): use green Label 3 or OEL. (2) AADC (required except in full residual AADC trays): use pink Label A or OEL. (3) Working (required in less-than-full working tray): use facing slip marked ``WORKING'' or ``WKG'' or the optional endorsement line ``WORKING.'' c. Tray size: (1) Optional 3-digit (only for single 3-digit SCFs in L002, Column A, identified with three bullets and prepared under option 6.2b): required full trays; less-than-full and overflow trays prohibited, except for one less-than-full tray for the single 3-digit origin SCF. (2) Optional SCF (only for option 6.2b): required full trays; less-than-full and overflow trays prohibited, except for one less-than-full tray for the origin SCF. (3) AADC: required if enough pieces to fill tray; less-than-full and overflow trays permitted. (4) Mixed-AADC: required full trays; one less-than-full tray permitted. (5) Working: required full trays; one less-than-full tray permitted. d. Tray presort sequence and Line 1 labeling: (1) Optional 3-digit (only for single 3-digit SCFs under option 6.2b); use L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), on Line 1. (2) Optional SCF (only for option 6.2b); use L002, Column B, on Line 1 for 3-digit areas listed in Column C. (3) AADC (required); use L804 on Line 1. (4) Mixed-AADC (required); on Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and SCF code from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class mail entered by the mailer at an ASF or BMC. (5) Working (required); on Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and SCF code from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class mail entered by the mailer at an ASF or BMC. e. Line 2: class (FCM, 2C, NEWS, or 3C), followed by LTRS and: (1) On 3-digit trays (only single 3-digit SCFs under option 6.2b) and SCF trays (option 6.2b only): 3DG BARCODED. (2) On AADC trays: AADC BARCODED. (3) On mixed-AADC trays: BARCODED PKGS. (4) On working trays: BARCODED WKG. 6.4␣Sequencing, Grouping_First-Class Mail Only [Insert text of current 6.2 renumber as 6.4. Revise the first sentence to read:] First-Class residual pieces may be sequenced by ZIP Code and prepared with a listing: [Delete renumbered 6.4f. Reletter 6.4 g and h as 6.4 f and g. Revise renumbered and relettered 6.4g to read:] g. For Line 2: FCM LTRS BARCODED WKG. 6.5␣Separation by Rate_First-Class Mail Only [Insert text of current 6.3 and renumber as 6.5. Revise the first sentence to read as follows:] First-Class residual pieces may be separated by rate qualification: [Delete the phrase ``First-Class'' in renumbered 6.5a(1) and 6.5a(3). Delete renumbered 6.5a(4) and 6.5a(5). Revise renumbered 6.5d as follows:] d. For Line 2: FCM followed by: (1) On trays of delivery point barcoded mail: LTRS BARCODED WKG. (2) On trays of ZIP+4 mail: ZIP+4 WORKING or ZIP+4 WKG. (3) On trays of other mail: WORKING or WKG. 6.6␣Presentation When presented to the USPS, trays of residual mail must be separate from trays of qualifying mail except that when prepared under 6.2b, 3-digit, SCF, and AADC trays in the 3-digit presort tier that contain both qualifying and residual pieces are grouped with trays of qualifying mail. 7.0␣Documentation * * * * * 7.3␣Standards Documentation must meet the basic standards in P012 and those below. Residual mail is included in the documentation if prepared under 6.2 and 6.3, or 6.4, or in the summary alone if prepared under 6.5. Abbreviated documentation may be provided under M817. Combined mailings of second-class publications must be documented under E238. 7.4␣Segmentation, Labeling Documentation must be segmented and labeled by qualification tier (e.g., presort and residual). A residual segment is not required for First-Class Mail if separated under 6.5. Each tier must be further segmented by type of package/grouping (5-digit, 3-digit, AADC, as applicable) under 7.5, or have all represented 3- and 5-digit ZIP Codes (and AADC codes for residual mail under 6.2 and 6.3) reported in a continuous sequential list under 7.6 within each tier listing. Under either option, data must be presented as shown in 7.7 and 7.8. 7.5␣Type of Package Option If the report is segmented by type of package, for each type, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 6.4; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L804 (AADC entries must be preceded by ``AADC''). 7.6␣Sequential List Option If the report is a sequential list, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code within each qualification tier, regardless of package type: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 6.5; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 6.2 and 6.3, by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L804 (AADC entries must be preceded by ``AADC''). For second-class only, listings for 5-digit, city, and 3-digit packages must be preceded by the prefixes 5DG, CTY, and 3DG, respectively. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5866 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7710&hyph;12&hyph;U
