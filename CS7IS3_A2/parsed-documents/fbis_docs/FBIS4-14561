FBIS4-14561 "drsov063_b_94012" FBIS-SOV-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Official Discusses Presidential Security Service Official Discusses Presidential Security Service MK0104105094 Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian, No. 13/38, 1-7 Apr 94 (Signed to press 31 Mar) p 2 MK0104105094 Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian, BFN [Interview with Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Main Protection Directorate (MPD) official, by Rodion Morozov in the "Hello" column; place and date not given: "Vitruk Puzzles the MPD"] [Text] Constitutional Court acting chairman Nikolay Vitruk told a press conference: The Main Protection Directorate [MPD] needs reorganization. He suggested that it ill suits the MPD to engage in operational activity and provide material supplies and everyday services. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent Rodion Morozov phoned Andrey Oligov, an MPD representative. [Morozov] How far does MPD jurisdiction extend? [Oligov] Briefly, we are responsible for ensuring the security of the president's residence -- the Kremlin (MPD chief Lieutenant General Mikhail Barsukov is also Kremlin commandant), the president himself, and also a specially defined circle of state officials. The MPD also includes the traffic [komendantskaya] service, the administrative service, and the medical service. The MPD's aggregate strength, including the presidential regiment, is approximately 6,000. To compare: In the United States the security service numbers up to 33,000 people. [Morozov] How is the range of persons needing your "services" established? [Oligov] The list of these people is prepared in accordance with a presidential edict. [Morozov] Are members of the Constitutional Court among them? [Oligov] In the past, we also ensured their protection. At the same time, certain measures were undertaken to minimize threats with respect to the justices: and there were such threats. Who ensures the security of the constitutional justices, I do not know, but it's not us. In its time the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Committee on Defense and Security drafted a Russian Federation law on state protection of Russian legislative and executive power bodies and top state officials. It was envisioned that protection of all the three branches of power will be entrusted to a single body -- the Main Protection Directorate. And then, organized with it should be a presidential security department, an executive security department, a legislative security department.... But the law was never adopted.... [Morozov] How would you respond to the "charge" of engaging in operational activity? [Oligov] The operations department has always been organic to the MPD; and this is justified. The law on operational and investigative activity also extends to the MPD. Otherwise, how, without a corresponding operational apparatus, can we possibly monitor information about threats with respect to government officials? [Morozov] And still, how extensive are the powers of your operations department? Do its officers have the right to tap somebody's telephone or monitor his apartment or detain a suspect? [Oligov] No. If we pursue a plan involving terrorist intentions, we do this in "linkage" with the Prosecutor's Office. [Morozov] What about the "provision of material supplies and everyday services"? [Oligov] Here, honestly, I find it hard to understand Vitruk. The MPD is tasked to maintain order at the [presidential] residence. To this end it is necessary to have an administrative unit as part of it. There is a team of construction workers, naturally civilians, who engage in maintenance and modernization of particular buildings and premises. Whatever else was meant, I cannot even imagine.
