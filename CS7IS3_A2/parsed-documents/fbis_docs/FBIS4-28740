Who Should Be Responsible?"] [Text] According to a report from Koh Kong Province, in an operation launched on the night of 8 June, the combined ministerial team for cracking down on illegal smuggling along the Sre Ambel Pass held up a barge trying to smuggle processed wood out of the country. The head of the team reported: While we were holding up the barge, three motor boats from Koh Kong Province's combined team (one of which belongs to the provincial office of forestry and wildlife) led by Ung Voan, second deputy governor of Koh Kong, surrounded the inter-ministerial team's motor boat, directing all their spotlights on it as a threat. Seeing that it was outnumbered by the Koh Kong provincial team, the combined ministerial team then released the timber barge. The report added that the inter-ministerial team also saw 22 other timber barges tagging after the provincial boats out of that area. This is the second time this week that the Koh Kong provincial team helped the timber barges get out of Andong Toek area, claiming that it would take action against the barges after bringing them to Koh Kong Province. In the first event on 4 June, the Koh Kong team brought 12 barges carrying about 400 cubic meters of processed wood out of this area, claiming that it would take action against the barges when they returned to Koh Kong Province. But not a single timber barge was seen in Koh Kong. When asked about it, the provincial team said that all the barges fled along the way. The report said that these 23 barges carried a total of 750 cubic meters of processed wood. The sources of the inter-ministerial team reported that the timber carried in the 23 barges were worth about 5,500,000 Thai baht or 750 million riel. It is not yet known whether this second batch of timber barges will arrive in Koh Kong or not since the first batch already failed to arrive. And if they do not arrive there, what measures will the Ministry of Interior take against Mr. Ung Voan? The logging war in Koh Kong Province is still going on so terrifyingly. The bad consequences of such anarchy will only cause more complicated problems and distrust. Those who have kept a close watch on this matter say: In such a situation, who will listen to whom and who is to be responsible for all the bad consequences?
