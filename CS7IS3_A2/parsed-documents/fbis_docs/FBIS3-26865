Representatives from a handful of non-governmental organizations sold the idea of "independence of Tibet" in their speeches in the commission's session today. They alleged that the ethnic Tibetans are becoming a minority in Tibet, and that the Chinese government restricts religious freedom there. Zhang Yishan, the Chinese representative, said there is nothing new in their speeches today, which are only a repetition of some old lies. Zhang said it is known to all that since the 13th century, Tibet has been an inseparable part of the Chinese territory. China has been exercising its sovereign rights over Tibet for more than 700 years, and no country in the world has ever recognized any kind of independence of Tibet, he said. He added that the conclusion of some agreements between the central government of China and the local government of Tibet in 1950 is purely China's internal affairs. He pointed out that it is a blatant violation of the principles and purpose of the United Nations charter for some people to describe this event as "Chinese occupation of Tibet." On the Tibetan population, Zhang cited a census conducted in July 1990 by the Chinese government in Tibet, which showed that the number of ethnic Tibetans there are 2.096 million, about 95.46 percent of the total population in the area. The ethnic Han population living in Tibet is slightly higher than 80,000, about 3.7 percent of the total population, the census shows. Zhang said this indicates that the claim that Tibetans are becoming a minority is totally groundless. Zhang finally pointed out that some non-governmental organizations are politically motivated and irresponsible when they create and spread lies about Tibet. However, lies will be lies even they are repeated a thousand times, he said, adding that the action of some people on the issue of Tibet only exposes the fact that these people are not really interested in human rights, but only in attaining their own goals by using the issue of human rights.
