FR940913-0-00045 FR940913-0-00015 As a primary tool for the review of the quality of emission inventory submittals, the USEPA has developed three levels (I, II, and III) of emission inventory quality assurance review checklists. The Level I and II reviews are used to determine that all required components of the base year emission inventory and its associated documentation are present. These reviews also evaluate the level of quality of the supporting documentation and the data provided by the State and assess whether the emission estimates were developed according to current USEPA guidance. The Level III review evaluates 10 crucial aspects and the overall acceptability of the emission inventory submittal. Failure to meet one of these crucial aspects would lead to disapproval of the emission inventory submittal. The 10 crucial aspects of the emission inventory submittal are: 1. An Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) must be submitted by the State and approved by the USEPA. In addition, a Quality Assurance (QA) plan contained within the IPP must have been implemented and documented. 2. The emission inventory submittal must contain adequate documentation showing the procedures and input data used and the input data sources. 3. The point source portion of the inventory must be complete. 4. The point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated in accordance with current USEPA guidance. 5. The area source portion of the inventory must be complete. 6. The area source emissions must have been calculated in accordance with current USEPA policy. 7. The biogenic emissions must have been calculated using USEPA's PC-Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (PC-BEIS) or other equivalent technique in accordance with current USEPA guidance. 8. The Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) estimates used in the calculation of on-road mobile source emissions must have been adequately documented in the inventory submittal. 9. The MOBILE emission factor model must have been correctly applied to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes. 10. Non-road mobile source emissions must have been prepared in accordance with current USEPA guidance for all of the non-road mobile source categories. Detailed Level I and II review procedures and questions may be found in the ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,'' United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1992. Level III criteria are specified in a memorandum from David Mobley, Emission Inventory Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, USEPA, to the Chief of the Regulation Development Branch, Region V, et al., titled ``Final Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,'' October 7, 1992. The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in development and submitting SIP revisions, including the base year emissions inventory submittal. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each SIP revision submitted by the State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Final approval of the emissions inventory would not occur until the State revises the emissions inventory to address public comments. Future changes to the base year emission inventory (due to previously missed sources or to corrected source emission factors or activity levels) that impact the 15 percent RFP calculations or the demonstration of attainment or that require a revised emission control strategy will be required to be addressed in a SIP revision. II. Illinois' Emission Inventory Submittals On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted the final, adopted base year ozone precursor emission inventories for the Chicago, Metro-East St. Louis (the Illinois portion of the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area), and Jersey County ozone nonattainment areas. The emission inventory submittals cover the emissions of VOC, NO X , and CO for each of the ozone nonattainment areas as well as the emissions from major stationary sources located within 25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas. Prior to developing the base year emission inventories, the IEPA developed an IPP as required by the USEPA. This IPP outlined the procedures that would be followed in preparing and documenting the emission inventories and defined the QA procedures that would be used to assure the accuracy and completeness of the emission inventories. The IPP was submitted to the USEPA in March 1992, and was approved by the USEPA in May 1992. Emissions contained in the emission inventories cover the general source categories of stationary point sources (or simply point sources), area sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and biogenic sources. Emission inventory summary tables in the submittals include more detailed source category breakdowns as requested by the USEPA. All emission summaries were accompanied by documentation covering the sources and values of input data and by sample calculations.
