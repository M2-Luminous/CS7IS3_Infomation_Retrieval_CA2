"The church has mobilized all its strength, this time it put everything in the balance, (...) but it failed to mobilize such masses of voters to go to the ballot box it counted on. I believe this is the expression of disagreement of many believers to a politicized role the church has recently sought to play in Poland," Miller told journalists in Lodz on Monday. Miller thought that the outcome of the elections offers a chance for political stability in Poland. It will be possible to keep the election and political timetables--presidential elections in over a year, next local government elections in four years, and parliamentary elections in less than four years. He added that the elections must have convinced all politicians and all Poles that the "road to a civic society will be arduous, difficult and long."
