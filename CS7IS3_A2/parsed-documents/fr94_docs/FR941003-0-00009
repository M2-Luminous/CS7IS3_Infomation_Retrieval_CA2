FR941003-0-00009 FR941003-0-00002 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 0694&hyph;0001, 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, 0695&hyph;0010, and 0694&hyph;0016. Licensing requirements under OMB control numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, and 0694&hyph;0010 will be reduced as a result of this rule, while there will be a small increase under 0694&hyph;0001 and 0694&hyph;0016, thereby reducing overall the paperwork burden on the public. The Import Certificate issued by the Government of Taiwan does not constitute a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
