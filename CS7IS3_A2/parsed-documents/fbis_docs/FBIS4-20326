FBIS4-20326 "jpcar022___94006" JPRS-CAR-94-022 JPRS China 21 February 1994 ECONOMIC PROVINCIAL Jiangsu 1993 Statistical Communique Jiangsu 1993 Statistical Communique 94CE0351A Nanjing XINHUA RIBAO in Chinese 21 Feb 94 p 8 94CE0351A Nanjing XINHUA RIBAO Chinese CSO [Report: "Statistical Communique by Jiangsu Satistical Bureau on Jiangsu's National Economic and Social Developments in 1993"] [Text] In 1993, the people of Jiangsu Province, under the correct leadership of the Jiangsu party committee and government, conscientiously acted in the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's important speeches on his inspection of southern China and of the 14th CPC Congress, by freeing up our thinking, seizing opportunities, and pushing forward resolutely with reform and opening. We tightened and improved our macroeconomic regulation and control, explored boldly, and worked genuinely and solidly, continuing to maintain our rapid national economic growth momentum, and achieving new successes in all causes. Our preliminary estimates for Jiangsu in 1993 are that our GDP reached 255 billion yuan, up 18.5 percent from 1992, including value added in tertiary industries of 62.3 billion yuan, up 20.3 percent, to make up 24.4 percent of our GDP. We doubled our GNP for the second time seven years ahead of schedule, laying a solid foundation for tripling Jiangsu's GNP by the end of the century. But certain noteworthy problems and conflicts still exist in our economic development, with market prices up considerably, our economic structure still not rational enough, our rural foundation remaining relatively weak, and some state enterprises experiencing more production and operating problems. I. Agriculture In 1993, governments at all levels throughout Jiangsu vigorously implemented all Party Central Committee and State Council policy measures on strengthening agriculture and protecting peasant production initiative by paying attention to more investment in agriculture, which brought quite evident results. We conquered severe natural disasters in agricultural production throughout Jiangsu to reap better harvests. Our value added in agriculture for 1993 was 42.184 billion yuan, up 4.2 percent from 1992, to make up 16.6 percent of our GDP. This included value added in farming of 27.927 billion yuan, down 2.9 percent from 1992, in forestry of 809 million yuan, up 13.3 percent from 1992, in livestock raising of 7.64 billion yuan, up 1.9 percent from 1992, and in fishery of 5.809 billion yuan, up 29.7 percent from 1992. Our agricultural output grew steadily, with considerable growth in specialty cultivation and breeding. As to staple farm products, we basically maintained our grain and edible oil output at about the level of our 1992 bumper harvests, with cotton output down nearly 20 percent due to less cultivated area and considerable disaster damage, but output of cash crops, such as sugar, hemp, fruit, and vegetables, all up to varying degrees from 1992. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Staple Farm-Product Output | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Product |1993 |Percent Growth from 1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grain |32.797 Million Tons |-1.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cereal Grain |30.8011 Million Tons |-2.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Soybeans |559,200 Tons |45.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Potatoes (Fresh) |5.048 Million Tons |9.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cotton |429,000 Tons |-18.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Edible Oils |1.2571 Million Tons |-1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: Rapeseed |870,400 Tons |-9.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sugar |331,700 Tons |33.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tobacco |4,200 Tons |-60.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hemp |16,700 Tons |25.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Silkworm Cocoons |172,300 Tons |18.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tea |15,100 Tons |7.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fruit |712,600 Tons |25.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We continued to optimize our cultivation structure. Impacted by market demand and the law of value, our crop structure throughout Jiangsu developed in the direction of high quality and efficiency. Our soybeans, potatoes, and food grains other than wheat and rice (including corn) area reached 22.0434 million mu, up 1.5345 million mu from 1992. We achieved new successes in forestry production and development and in greening work. In 1993, Jiangsu's afforested area reached 379,900 mu, up 81,800 mu, or 27.4 percent, from 1992. Our livestock industry output continued to grow. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Staple Livestock-Product Output and Livestock-Onhand Headcount | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Product |1993 |Percent Growth from 1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pork, Beef, and Mutton |1.7923 Million Tons |4.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: Beef and Mutt-|135,500 Tons |17.9 | |on | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Milk |112,100 Tons |-2.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Meat-Hog Out-of-Pen Count|23.5464 Million Head |4.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year-End Hog Count |19.4694 Million Head |-1.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year-End Sheep Count |9.7855 Million |12.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year-End Large-Livestock |1.004 Million Head |3.8 | |Count | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Eggs |1.3238 Million Tons |18.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We set a new fishery-production record; our aquatic product output for the year was 1.5726 million tons, up 16.8 percent from 1992. This included freshwater product output of 1.1052 million tons, up 19.6 percent, and saltwater product output of 467,400 tons, up 10.5 percent. We continued to adjust our agricultural structure. Our ratio of value added in forestry, livestock raising, fishery, and commodities produced by mixed peasant-household industrial operations throughout Jiangsu to our value added in agriculture reached 39.5 percent, up again from 1992's 36.6 percent. We continued to improve our agricultural-production conditions. By the end of 1993, our overall farm-machinery power had reached 20.8175 million KW, up 3.3 percent from the end of 1992; we had 21,300 large and midsize tractors, up 2.9 percent; 735,200 small and hand tractors, up 1.5 percent; 18,100 trucks, up 11.7 percent; our agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery power had reached 5.0135 million KW, up 1.4 percent; our 1993 chemical-fertilizer usage (converted pure) had reached 2.4971 million tons, up 1.2 percent; our rural power usage had reached 16.92 billion KWh, up 15.5 percent. And we completed our annual plans for water-conservancy projects, such as Tai Hu and Huai He. We continued to develop our rural economy. In 1993, township enterprises throughout Jiangsu emphasized size, level, and quality, raising economic efficiency, and continuing to grow quickly while adjusting, with gross output value and all taxes and profits both up more than 50 percent from 1992. Jiangsu's nonfarm industrial economy in sectors, such as rural industry, construction, transportation, wholesale and retail trade, and food and drink, grew 65.5 percent from 1992, with its ratio of our rural economy up from 1992's 80.8 percent to 84.6 percent. II. Industry and Building Construction In 1993, all of Jiangsu pushed ahead actively with reform, by continuing to intensify our implementation of the "Regulations on Converting the Operating Forces of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," further invigorating large- and medium-sized state enterprises, speeding up our pace of operating-force conversion and organizational-structure adjustment, and working to sustain our fast growth of industrial output based on an optimized structure and improved efficiency. Our 1993 value added in industry was 136.535 billion yuan, up 23.1 percent from 1992, to make up 53.5 percent of our GDP. Our heavy industry grew faster than our light industry. Jiangsu's 1993 value added in light industry reached 62.615 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent from 1992; in heavy industry it reached 73.92 billion yuan, up 25 percent. Our outputs of key manufactured goods all grew to varying degrees. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Key Manufactured-Goods Output | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Goods |1993 |Percent Growth from 1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yarn |658,800 Tons |17.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cloth |2.782 Billion m |-4.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Woolen Goods |84.2367 Million m |-27.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Machine-Made Paper and C-|888,200 Tons |0.1 | |ardboard | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crude Salt |2.4974 Million Tons |2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Synthetic Detergent |167,500 Tons |6.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Household Washing Machin-|545,500 |90.1 | |es | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Household Refrigerators |178,800 |8.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Electric Fans |9.4208 Million |-13.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TVs |5.1219 Sets |-15.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: Color TVs |1.6953 Million Sets |0.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Raw Coal |25.0576 Million Tons |2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crude Oil |862,100 Tons |-5.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Refined Crude |9.1404 Million Tons |2.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power Production |51.283 Billion KWh |6.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Steel |3.1229 Million Tons |15.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Finished Rolled Steel |4.7679 Million Tons |23.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pig Iron |1.779 Million Tons |8.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cement |27.3361 Million Tons |20.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Plate Glass |4.8687 Million Weight Bo-|28.4 | | |xes | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sulphuric Acid |1.3336 Million Tons |-4.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Soda Ash |492,900 Tons |29.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Caustic Soda |399,800 Tons |5.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power-Generation Equipme-|632,700 KW |95.0 | |nt (Over 500 KW) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Metal-Cutting Machine To-|35,600 Sets |28.1 | |ols | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Motor Vehicles |124,400 |23.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tractors (Large and Mids-|1,100 |-38.9 | |ize) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical Fertilizer (Con-|1.3261 Million Tons |-8.3 | |verted 100 Percent) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical Pesticides |60,600 Tons |11.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical Fibers |613,400 Tons |11.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We clearly improved our industrial economic efficiency. In 1993, our composite index of economic efficiency for independently accounted industrial enterprises at the township level and above throughout Jiangsu was up from 1992's 89.30 to 99.34. This included a rate of profit and tax on capital fund of 10.58 percent; a working-capital turnover frequency up from 1992's 2.04 to 2.21; an overall labor productivity rate (calculated at value added) up 43 percent from 1992. Our gross profits and taxes from industrial enterprises at the township level and above reached 32.55 billion yuan, up 31 percent from 1992. We better dovetailed production with sales, with our production-sales rate for industry above the township level up from 1992's 93.67 percent to 95.3 percent. But while we further raised our power use efficiency, with our overall power usage per 10,000 yuan output value for urban industrial enterprises down 14.71 percent, too many funds remained tied up in finished products, leaving the losses of some enterprises still needing improvement. Production in our building construction industry grew quickly. In 1993, building trades throughout Jiangsu steadily intensified reform, with building construction enterprises maintaining rapid production growth. Our 1993 value added in the construction industry reached 13.989 billion yuan, up 23.6 percent from 1992, to make up 5.5 percent of our GDP. Our state-owned construction enterprises raised their overall labor productivity rate 30.7 percent from 1992; our housing construction completed area reached 3.912 million sq m, up 6.1 percent. We also improved our building-product quality somewhat. III. Fixed Assets Investment In 1993, in our fixed assets investment throughout Jiangsu, we paid attention to improving our structure, emphasizing and ensuring priorities, and increasing our stamina for sustained economic growth. Our fixed assets investment throughout Jiangsu was 107.488 billion yuan, up 51 percent from 1992, including a state-unit investment of 45.869 billion yuan, up 59.3 percent, an urban collective-unit investment of 10.028 billion yuan, up 81.6 percent, a rural collective investment of 33.2 billion yuan, up 50.3 percent, and an urban and rural individual investment of 18.391 billion yuan, up 24.7 percent. In 1993, we had 7,591 projects inprocess by state units in capital construction and upgrading, down 841 from 1992. As to our state-unit investment, our capital-construction investment was 20.949 billion yuan, up 34.4 percent from 1992, our upgrading investment was 14.139 billion yuan, up 50.8 percent, and our commercial-housing-construction investment was 9.909 billion yuan, up 230 percent. Our central-project investment was 8.418 billion yuan, up 20.1 percent from 1992, and our local-project investment was 37.452 billion yuan, up 71.9 percent. As to our upgrading investment, in adding product varieties, raising product quality, conserving energy, and controlling the three wastes, we invested 4.209 billion yuan, up 31.1 percent from 1992. We further optimized our investment structure. As to state-unit investment, our tertiary-industry investment was 26.223 billion yuan, up nearly 100 percent, with its proportion up from 1992's 46.1 percent to 57.1 percent, including investment in communications, transportation, and post and telecommunications of 6.773 billion yuan, up 59.3 percent; and in culture, education, public health, and broadcasting of 1.629 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. Our power-industry investment was 4.516 billion yuan, up 8.3 percent. Our raw-materials-industry investment was 4.018 billion yuan, up 23 percent, and our agricultural investment was 649 million yuan, up 47.4 percent from 1992. We made great progress in building priority-infrastructure and basic-industry projects. Work is fully underway on the Shanghai-Nanjing expressway, the Nanjing-Lianyungang and Nanjing-Nantong primary highway construction, and along the Grand Canal in southern Jiangsu, with the early-stage construction in smooth progress on priority projects, such as the new Nanjing airport and the highway bridge over the Chang Jiang at Jiangyin, and the upgrading and expansion of the Yancheng-Nantong section of National Highway $204, the construction of the Nantong and the Gaoliangjian (ship) locks, and the first and second stages of the upgrading of the southern Jiangsu highway network all completed on schedule. Our investment in 84 inprocess large and midsize capital construction and above-quota upgrading projects throughout Jiangsu was 6.6 billion yuan, just about our annual plan. We completed and put into operation in 1993 10 large- and medium-sized capital-construction projects, as well as four above-quota upgrading ones. The priority projects or units that we wholly or partially completed and put into operation were mainly ones, such as the Wuxi Ligang Power Corporation, the Wuxi Enzyme Preparation Plant, the Changzhou Qishuyan Power Plant, the Zhangjiagang Harbor Construction, the Changshu Power Plant, the Nantong Airport Construction Project, the Nantong Port Authority Harbor Construction, the Huaneng Huaiyin Power Plant, the Zhenjiang Port Construction, the Nanjing Gu'nandu Hotel, the second stage of the Suzhou Gas Project, the Suzhou Sulun Plant, and the Nantong Composite Materials Plant. Our newly added key production capacity was generators with an installed capacity of 1.7 million KW and ports with an annual handling capacity of 9.64 million tons. Meanwhile, we built new service facilities, such as civil aviation facilities and tourist hotels, giving us complete sets of facilities to develop an externally oriented economy, and increasing our service capability. IV. Transportation, and Post and Telecommunications In 1993, Jiangsu maintained overall production growth in communications, transportation, and post and telecommunications, completing a value added in 1993 of 11.98 billion yuan, up 17.7 percent from 1992, to make up 4.7 percent of our GDP. But conflicts remained between our transportation and post and telecommunications and our overall economic and social development needs. Our communications and transportation production grew steadily. We completed a value added in 1993 of 10.223 billion yuan, up 12.2 percent from 1992, to make up 4 percent of our GDP. Both our cargo and passenger turnover for 1993 through all means of transportation were up somewhat from 1992. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All Transport Volume | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Category |1993 |Percent Growth from 1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cargo Turnover |130.547 Billion Ton Km |23.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Railway |34.649 Billion Ton Km |3.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Highway |23.507 Billion Ton Km |30.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Water Transport |68.963 Billion Ton Km |37.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pipeline |3.428 Billion Ton Km |-9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Passenger Turnover |59.785 Billion Passenger-|16.0 | | |Km | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rail |16.136 Billion P-Km |9.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Road |42.93 Billion P-Km |18.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Water |719 Million P-Km |14.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Port Cargo Handling Capa-|195.48 Million Tons |2.2 | |city | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We speeded up our post and telecommunications industry growth. Our value added for 1993 was 1.757 billion yuan, up 63.9 percent from 1992, with a post and telecommunications gross business turnover of 3.443 billion yuan, up 68.8 percent, and a business income of 2.315 billion yuan, up 54.58 percent. We added in 1993 a new computerized-telephone installed-capacity of 843,000 urban phones and 445,100 rural phones, ranking us second to Guangdong in having an urban and rural telephone exchange capacity of over 2 million phones. All of our county seats have computerized phones. We completed ahead of schedule the Beijing-Jinan-Nanjing fiberoptic cable transmission artery and the Shanghai-Nanjing electric cable capacity-expansion projects. Our services, such as telephone fax and express transmission, also grew very quickly, with wireless search-and-call customers reaching 289,800, more than triple that of 1992, with mobile communications spreading throughout Jiangsu. V. Domestic Commerce and Market Prices In 1993, we brought the role of market forces into full play at all levels throughout Jiangsu, stimulating circulation sharply, giving us abundant market goods supplies and brisk buying and selling, and maintaining a basic overall stable consumer goods market order. Our 1993 retail commodity sales were 107.427 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent from 1992, (for real growth of 16 percent corrected for inflation). This included retail sales of consumer goods to residents at 85.078 billion yuan, up 36.1 percent, retail sales of consumer goods to social groups at 11.699 billion yuan, up 47.4 percent, and retail sales of agricultural capital goods at 10.65 billion yuan, up 8.6 percent. In our retail consumer-goods sales, urban retail sales were 54.019 billion yuan, up 48.2 percent from 1992, with retail sales at the county level and below at 42.758 billion yuan, up 25.7 percent. All retail sales of consumer goods for industries in all economic categories grew. This included retail sales for the state-owned economy of 33.251 billion yuan, up 28.7 percent, for the collective economy of 34.172 billion yuan, up 31.2 percent, and for the individual economy of 15.804 billion yuan, up 41.5 percent. Of all key consumer goods, retail commercial sales were up 7.3 percent for edible vegetable oils, 23.4 percent for sugar, 2.1 percent for woolen goods, 26 percent for silk and satin, 14.5 percent for all clothing, 64.3 percent for color TVs, 61.3 percent for VCRs, 44.7 percent for washing machines, and 55 percent for household refrigerators, with varying degrees of growth also for all other durable consumer goods, such as home air conditioners. Buying and selling were brisk for capital goods markets. In 1993, commodity circulation enterprises throughout Jiangsu bought capital goods worth 108.15 billion yuan, up 47.9 percent from 1992, with sales of 109.18 billion yuan, up 43.7 percent. This included sales of 43.72 million tons of coal, 10.3 million tons of rolled steel, 3.48 million tons of cement, and 75,000 motor vehicles. In 1993, we took larger price-reform steps, smoothly deregulating grain and edible oil buying and selling prices, raising cotton-purchasing prices, and deregulating and adjusting the prices of a group of basic products, such as coal, power, and oil, to increase their market-regulation ratio. Retail prices rose 15.4 percent in 1993, quite a lot, including retail price rises of 16.6 percent in the cities and 14 percent in the countryside. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All Price Indexes (Compared to 1992) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.

External Economy In 1993, Jiangsu further opened up new development space, continuing to open up further to the outside world, maintaining the vigorous growth momentum of our externally-oriented economy, and actively advancing it from south to north. Our foreign trade grew steadily. Our 1993 foreign trade turnover reached $8.7 billion, up 39.2 percent from 1992, including exports of $5.959 billion, up 27.6 percent, and imports of $2.741 billion, up 73.4 percent. We further optimized our export structure, with exports of finished manufactured goods up somewhat. FIE exports were $2.269 billion, up 73.6 percent from 1992, with their percentage of Jiangsu exports up to 38.1 percent. We further increased our use of foreign investment. In 1993, 10,289 new agreements on the use of foreign investment were signed throughout Jiangsu, for an agreed foreign investment of $10.11 billion, up respectively 24.3 percent and 29.7 percent from 1992. We approved 10,032 new FIEs in 1993, for a contracted foreign investment of $10.056 billion, up respectively 22.4 percent and 30.8 percent from 1992. Jiangsu actually used $3.287 billion in foreign investment in 1993, up 90.9 percent from 1992, including an actual foreign investment of $3.002 billion, up 114 percent. Foreign investment in Jiangsu increased in size, at a higher level, with more large projects, and beginning to involve fields, such as energy, communications, basic industry, high technology, and tertiary industries. Our foreign economic and technical exchanges and cooperation expanded rapidly. In 1993, Jiangsu signed 418 new foreign contracting and service cooperation projects, 155 more than in 1992, for a contracted amount of $332 million, up 52.9 percent, and our actual business volume was $259 million, up 76.5 percent. We approved 210 new overseas nontrade enterprises, with 368 having been approved by the end of 1993. Our international tourism was increasingly prosperous. In 1993, Jiangsu received 792,200 visits by overseas travellers for tourism, sightseeing, interviews, and other activities, including 455,200 visits by foreigners, up 22 percent from 1992. Our tourism foreign exchange earnings were 741 million yuan (in foreign-exchange certificates [FECs]), up 21.5 percent from 1992. VII. Finance, Banking, and Insurance In 1993, Jiangsu's revenues were better. Our 1993 revenue was 22.13 billion yuan, up 45.3 percent from 1992, for a record increase. This included industrial and commercial tax revenue of 21.273 billion yuan, up 54.4 percent from 1992, with our tax revenue involving foreigners up 125.8 percent. Our spending was 16.258 billion yuan, up 29.2 percent. Our banking situation stabilized gradually. In 1993, financial institutions throughout Jiangsu vigorously organized all deposits, so that by year's end, we had a deposit balance of 179.733 billion yuan, up 36.934 billion yuan from the beginning of the year, and a loan balance of 177.78 billion yuan, up 28.916 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. We continued to maintain our deposit increase higher than our loan increase, with net currency put into circulation in 1993 at 11.601 billion yuan, up 2.285 billion yuan from 1992. Our insurance business grew rapidly. In 1993, the People's Insurance Company system throughout Jiangsu insured 525.76 billion yuan in domestic assets, up 39.1 percent from 1992. Jiangsu had 64,000 enterprises covered by enterprise property insurance, 10.25 million residents covered by family property insurance, and 18.497 million people covered by personal insurance. Our insurance companies handled 345,000 domestic property insurance settlements, paying out compensation of 720 million yuan, and paying out 320 million yuan in personal insurance compensation to 103,000 people. VIII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports We achieved new S&T successes. In 1993, we won 368 provincial-level S&T-progress awards, including three #1 awards, 28 #2 awards, 126 #3 awards, and 211 #4 awards. At the national level, we won one invention-award, three S&T-progress awards, and six Spark awards. We authorized more patents. In 1993, Jiangsu had 4,170 patent applications, with 3,757 being authorized, up 80.1 percent from 1992. We expanded our S&T ranks. Local state enterprises and institutions throughout Jiangsu had 1.2133 million specialized technicians of all types, up 5.1 percent from 1992. We continued to increase our average education. In 1993, Jiangsu enrolled 3,000 graduate students, up 600 from 1992. Our general institutions of higher learning enrolled 68,500 undergraduates, with 180,200 students in school, up 27,500 from 1992. Our intermediate specialized technical schools of all types had 191,800 students in attendance, up 42,400 from 1992. Our vocational senior high schools had 220,800 students, or 52.1 percent of Jiangsu's general senior high school students. We had 2.9398 million general high school students, and 5.9494 million grade school students, with an entrance rate for grade-school-age children of 99.5 percent. In 1993, another 28 counties (cities, districts) and 420 townships throughout Jiangsu fully implemented 9-year compulsory education. By the end of 1993, 59 counties (cities, districts) and 1,227 townships throughout Jiangsu were fully practicing nine-year compulsory education, for a population coverage rate of 56.8 percent, up 20 points from 1992. Meanwhile, we also made some developments in preschool education and in special-ed for low-intelligence and disabled children. We continued to reinforce our adult education. In 1993, we enrolled 38,900 adults as college undergraduates, with 84,800 in college, up 18,000 from 1992, and had 135,200 adults in intermediate vocational schools, up 31,800 from 1992, and 762,100 adults in intermediate and primary schools. We eliminated illiteracy in 1993 for 565,000 youths and adults in the prime of life (ages 30-50). We continued to expand our cultural enterprise. By the end of 1993, Jiangsu had 136 arts performance troupes, 110 cultural centers, 93 public libraries, 66 museums, 20 radio stations, one short-wave broadcast and relay station, and 38 TV stations. We had 147 TV broadcast and relay stations, and 4,358 film-projection units. In 1993, we printed 1.177 billion newspapers, published 59.83 million magazines of all types, and published 3,722 books. We further developed our public health enterprise. By the end of 1993, Jiangsu had 12,074 public health organs of all types, 207 less than in 1992, with 173,300 sickbeds, including 152,900 hospital beds, up 2,200 from 1992.

Jiangsu had 261 sanitation and antiepidemic stations and professional prevention and treatment organs, with 8,749 personnel, up 5.4 percent from 1992. We achieved new sports successes. In the Seventh National Games, Jiangsu athletes won 20 gold medals, 16 silvers, and 17 bronzes, with seven breaking 15 Asian records 26 times, nine breaking 17 national records 28 times, and the Jiangsu team ranking sixth in the nation. In major international competitions, seven Jiangsu athletes won nine world championships, with five setting six Asian records and breaking three world records 18 times. It is estimated that 95.02 percent of our school-age students in schools of all types at all levels throughout Jiangsu reached international physical-education training standards. IX. Population and Living Standards We continued to control our population-growth rate. Based on a sampling of 1993 population changes, Jiangsu's birthrate was down from 1992's 1.571 percent to 1.397 percent, with our deathrate down from 0.676 percent to 0.661 percent, and our natural growth rate down from 0.895 percent to 0.736 percent. Projecting from this, by the end of 1993, Jiangsu's permanent population was 69.6727 million, up 560,700 from the end of 1992. Our urban and rural incomes continued to grow. Based on a sampling for 1993, our urban cost-of-living income averaged 2,526 yuan, up 30.4 percent from 1992 or, corrected for inflation, up a real 10.2 percent. Our rural net income averaged 1,267 yuan, up 19.4 percent or, corrected for inflation, up a real 3 percent. We steadily intensified our labor reforms. In 1993, we had 206,400 new urban jobs throughout Jiangsu, with a year-end urban unemployment rate of 2 percent. Our contract-system employees reached 2.6 million, or 28.4 percent of all urban employees. Jiangsu had 5.9308 million employees and 1.2406 million retirees covered by overall old-age insurance. By year's end, our urban workers numbered 9.113 million, up 72,100 from the end of 1992, with urban private-enterprise and self-employed workers numbering 359,600, up more than 120,000. Our employee wages also increased. In 1993, Jiangsu's payroll was 32.15 billion yuan, up 27.8 percent from 1992, with employee wages averaging 3,544 yuan, up 26.6 percent or, corrected for inflation, up a real 6.6 percent. Our urban and rural savings continued to grow. In 1993, our residents' savings deposit balance reached 96.422 billion yuan, up 19.175 billion yuan from the end of 1992, or 25.7 percent. Purchases of all types of securities also increased clearly. We further improved our urban and rural housing conditions. By the end of 1993, our housing space for urban residents (including living and auxiliary space) averaged 14.63 sq m, up 0.27 sq m from the end of 1992, and our peasant housing space averaged 24.53 sq m, up 0.96 sq m from the end of 1992. We further intensified our environmental protection cause. In 1993, Jiangsu had 4,530 employees in our environmental protection system, 101 environmental monitoring stations of all types, 16 national and provincial nature-protection zones, three national-forest parks, and 379 environmental-pollution control projects completed in 1993 with an investment of 125 million yuan. By the end of 1993, we had established 867.27 sq km of smoke and dust control zones, and 264.91 sq km with environmental noise standards. Notes: 1. This communique's GDPs and all industrial value-added indexes were calculated at prevailing prices, with growth rates calculated at comparable prices. 2. GDPs and all industrial value-addeds include mainly worker remuneration, profits, taxes, and depreciation, not various intermediate consumption values, such as energy, raw materials, or the sum of material-product and service value that show the year's production that can be used for final consumption. The difference between GDP and GNP is mainly that the former does not include overseas net factor income, while the latter does. 3. The national S&T awards won by Jiangsu do not include those won by enterprises and institutions of state ministries and commissions in Jiangsu.
