As was stressed by Juergen Westphal, the chairman of the Economic Council's "Economic and Competitive Policy" Commission, there is also a need for savings banks and land banks to be privatized. These public law institutions have a market share of over 35 percent and their volume of business amounts to about 2 trillion German marks [DM]. Contrary to their original aims, the savings and land banks have developed into universal banking institutions. In terms of the range of services they offer, they are hardly distinguishable from private banks and credit cooperatives. Nevertheless, the privatization of the savings and land banks should involve more than just a formal legal change. The more important point is that at least 51 percent of the capital should be really sold to the private sector. According to Westphal, privatization does not mean that the savings banks have to lose their regional links. According to the Economic Council, by far the greatest potential for privatization among all public bodies is at the municipality level, where there are over 100,000 publicly owned companies. The gains in efficiency resulting from privatization would amount to an estimated DM40 to DM50 billion a year for the municipalities. The most important areas are garbage collection, sewage treatment, cleaning streets and buildings, planning, construction, transportation, telecommunications, energy, and housing administration. Western German laender should also step up privatization efforts, especially with regard to public law financial institutions, housing and energy companies, as well as airport and trade fair companies. The nominal value of their direct capital holdings amounts to over DM13 billion. This amount is twice that held at the federal level. In addition, there are all kinds of forms of indirect ownership. For example, through its 43.6 percent share in the WestLB [bank], North Rhine-Westphalia owns 10 percent or more of nine companies quoted on the stock exchange. Privatization must also continue at the federal level. The reform of the federal railroads and the postal service should involve more than just reorganization. Telekom, above all, is suited for wide ownership on the part of citizens. The implementation of all federal privatization projects to date, including Lufthansa, has reduced federal ownership by 40 percent or DM2.3 billion.
