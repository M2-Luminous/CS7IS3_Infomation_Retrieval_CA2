That is what producers said when LA NACION asked them, by telephone, about their position regarding the Mexican Government's offer on such items as vehicle exchange, cocoa, candies and marmalades, dairy products, palm oil, and textiles. Regarding vehicles, the northern nation asked our authorities to allow the sale of vehicles here, which they manufacture, with hefty tax reductions. This would be Ford, Volkswagen, and Chrysler vehicles, among others. Alfredo Levi, BMW manager in Costa Rica, said: "What is good for John must also be good for Peter." Therefore, he has proposed to the government to design an equitable formula so importers of vehicles from other nations are not harmed. As far as cocoa is concerned, Mexico proposes that only merchandise produced from Mexican and Costa Rican supplies be exempt from taxes. According to Belisario Ardon, director of the Cocoa Marketing Company, this exemption should not be based on this criteria, rather, it should depend on the nation where the cacao grain undergoes a substantial transformation. The northern negotiators also offered to open their borders to Costa Rica products, like candy and marmalades, which are manufactured solely with sugar that has the same price as in the United States. Ardon recommends our government not give into this demand as this would imply surrendering a significant differential in value. He noted: "It would be equal to surrendering our advantage." Mexico wants dairy products to be excluded from the agreement. Nevertheless, Jose Pattoni, manager of Dos Pinos diary, stated this company is very interested in the Mexican market, specifically to sell liquid milk. He suggests -- in case this chapter were included in the treaty -- Costa Rica exchanges "what Mexico does not produce for what we do produce." Regarding palm oil by-products, Mexico would allow us to export these with tariffs, which would be eliminated at the end of five years, on the condition we purchase their soy bean products with no tariffs. Rudy Venegas, industrial marketing manager of Numar Company, said it would be fair to implement an agreement without any type of tariff for both sides. Rodrigo Arguedas, sales manager of INTEX [expansion unknown], categorically rejected Mexico's offer to purchase an initial quota of 350,000 colones of Costa Rican textiles the first year the agreement is implemented. He said: "Costa Rica is capable of exporting 150 million colones worth of textiles every year, but we could begin with an allotment of 75 million colones."
