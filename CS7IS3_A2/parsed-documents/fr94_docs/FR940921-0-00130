FR940921-0-00130 FR940921-0-00016 85. Section 86.1207&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows: §86.1207&hyph;96 Sampling and analytical systems; evaporative emissions. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) For gasoline-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, natural gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere within the enclosure (a heated FID (HFID) (235 ○ # 15 ○F (113 # 8 ○C)) is required for methanol-fueled vehicles). Provided evaporative emission results are not affected, a probe may be used to detect or verify hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds. * * * * * 86. A new section 86.1213&hyph;94 is added to subpart M to read as follows: §86.1213&hyph;94 Fuel specifications. (a) Gasoline fuel. (1) Gasoline having the following specifications will be used in emissions testing for gasoline-fueled vehicles. 1Item 1ASTM test method No. 1Value Octane, research, min.

(2) (i) Unleaded gasoline representative of commercial gasoline which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation. (ii) The octane rating of the gasoline used shall be no higher than 1.0 Research octane number above the minimum recommended by the manufacturer and have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, where sensitivity is defined as the Research octane number minus the Motor octane number. (iii) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used shall be characteristic of the motor fuel used during the season in which the service accumulation takes place. (3) The specification range of the gasoline to be used under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (b) Methanol fuel. (1) Methanol fuel used in evaporative emission testing and in service accumulation of methanol-fueled vehicles shall be representative of commercially available methanol fuel and shall consist of at least 50 percent methanol (CH 3 OH) by volume. (i) Manufacturers shall recommend the methanol fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation.
