FR940810-0-00096 FR940810-0-00021 Other specific systems which do not easily fit the descriptions of the above systems were discussed during the rulemaking. Some, such as the ``Lyons Trough'' appear promising, however, the data submitted are too limited for OSHA to determine effectiveness in the rulemaking. Several TEM and PCM measurements were made during a ``controlled demonstration'' which lasted 31 minutes and during ``field evaluation'' of 29 minutes. The personal sample from the former was below the limit of detection by PCM, and the personal sample from the latter measured 0.002 f/cc by PCM (Ex. 135). Other methods appeared too limited in application to be ``generically'' approved by OSHA, and/or appeared highly dependent on worker behavior to avoid failure. Such a system, devised by Tenneco, is a modified glove bag/mini-enclosure to facilitate safe removal of small amounts of asbestos fireproofing above ceiling tiles (Ex. 65 A&hyph;P). In its post-hearing brief, the BCTD objected to the use of the Tenneco device for two reasons. First, because it was held as close as possible to the ceiling and did not fit against it, they felt there was potential for fiber escape; and second, they questioned how effective it would be if one of the workers holding it up got tired and dropped it. (Ex. 143, p. 103). OSHA agrees; the device may be used therefore only as an alternative control method pursuant to the requirements for certification in paragraph (g)(6). Mini-Enclosures Mini-enclosures, the other control method allowed for Class I work is supported by a submission by BCTD which described a portable isolation enclosure developed by J. Streiter of Southern Insulation Inc. (Ex. 119, # 5). OSHA notes, however, that mini-enclosures are manufactured by other companies and this rule does not limit use of the device to any particular manufacturer. In an accompanying trade paper article the portable enclosure is described as: ``a cubicle with an extendable shroud that fits on top. A HEPA filtration system drew air down from the ceiling. Inside the enclosure was a suited man; opposite was a trapped door with a bag attached *␣*␣* the worker remove[d] the tile, clean[ed] off the grid and deposit[ed] everything in the bag after opening the trap door. Suction would pull the door shut. Within the enclosure was a shower attachment *␣*␣*'' The submission also contained air sampling data obtained during use of this apparatus while removing ceiling tiles from a Virginia building. The results indicated that fiber levels averaged less than 0.01 f/cc. However, as pointed out by BCTD in its post-hearing brief there was failure to achieve clearance (0.01 f/cc under AHERA) in this building following use of the device which ``necessitated evacuation of the work areas on several occasions.'' As explained elsewhere in this document, OSHA is not requiring AHERA clearance levels to be achieved for Class I work. If such requirements must be met, the employer should employ all applicable controls which in some cases may exceed those in these standards. Class II Work Class II asbestos work is defined as activities involving the removal of ACM or PACM which is not TSI or surfacing ACM. According to the definition, this includes, but is not limited to, the removal of asbestos-containing wallboard, floor tile and sheeting, gaskets, joint compounds, roofing felts, roofing and siding shingles, and construction mastics. OSHA has found that the exposure potential from Class II work is generally lower than for Class I work, when removal is conducted under substantially similar conditions. Consequently, if the employer shows, that in any particular job, that well-trained and experienced workers, with an established ``track record'' of keeping exposures low will perform that removal, the required controls are less stringent than those required for Class I removals. Removal of materials which are not TSI or surfacing ACM may be handled by complying with work practice and engineering control requirements for Class II in paragraph (g)(7), and the generic requirements for all asbestos work in (g)(1) of the standard. Additionally, methods allowed for Class I removals may be used for Class II work, unless the system cannot be adapted for Class II work, such as in the case of the water spray process system. Glove bags/boxes can be installed around some materials covered by the Class II designation, such as gaskets and ceiling tiles. It is OSHA's intent to allow Class I methods to be used for removing Class II materials when no modification in the apparatus is required, without special notice to OSHA. As Class II work, removal of asbestos-containing material such as floor tiles and roofing will not be subject to quantity cut-offs for using certain control methods. This is similar to the proposal, which would have allowed these materials to be removed using mandated work practices, and exempted compliant jobs from negative pressure enclosure requirements. Under the final standard, other materials classified as ``miscellaneous'' by EPA such as transite panel and valves/gaskets may be removed without quantity limitation so long as Class II work practices are followed. Additionally, the standard allows all other materials (except TSI and surfacing ACM) to be removed using the generic work practices in paragraph (g)(1) which require wet methods, HEPA vacuuming and prompt waste disposal, and pursuant to additional controls in (g)(2) if the PEL may be exceeded. Paragraphs (g)(7)(i) and (ii) establish ``setting-up'' requirements which apply to all removals of all Class II materials. These include the requirement that a competent person supervise the work and that where a negative exposure assessment cannot be produced or changed conditions during the job indicate elevated fiber levels, critical barriers or other isolation methods must be used or where the ACM is not removed in a substantially intact.
