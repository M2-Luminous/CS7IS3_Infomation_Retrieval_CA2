Interpol is also participating in these investigations. The security authorities seized a list of the diplomats targeted for assassination along with the members of the extremist group, which was led by 'Adil 'Awad, who was killed in the al-Munib battle on 14 April. The extremists confessed to receiving instructions from their leadership abroad to assassinate the foreign diplomats, especially Americans and Israelis. The security authorities also discovered the underground "cells," which the organization's members had prepared in al-Qattamiyah and Bilbays to kidnap the diplomats and detain them there. An investigation is underway on how the detainees identified the persons mentioned in the assassination list, which was seized in one of the organization's hideouts. The investigation authorities held face-to-face confrontations with the eight defendants.
