Generals Basie Smit, Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht had decided to accede to this request from Attorney-General Jan D'Oliviera, who is heading an international investigation into the allegations. Dr D'Oliviera had made the request in the interests of an impartial and unhindered investigation, Gen van der Merwe said. Generals Smit and Le Roux were back at work on Tuesday but their positions were reviewed at a meeting between Gen van der Merwe and Dr D'Oliviera on Tuesday. They had been on "voluntary leave" until Tuesday following an agreement between Gen van der Merwe and the generals that they could resume their duties unless specific evidence to justify action against them was submitted. Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on Monday announced that he had obtained "substantial further evidence" concerning the commission's March 18 preliminary report on alleged senior police involvement in third force activities. Gen van der Merwe said Dr D'Oliviera had indicated that due to the volume of the information he had received from the Goldstone Commission, he could not properly evaluate or make a statement on the issue at this stage. Dr D'Oliviera had undertaken to expedite the evaluation and further investigation. In a separate statement Generals Smit and Le Roux said they had previously undertaken to resume duties on Tuesday unless new information came to light justifying action against them. They said Gen van der Merwe had on Monday informed them that no such information had come to his attention and he therefore ordered them to resume their duties. Gen van der Merwe re-affirmed on Tuesday after his discussions with Dr D'Oliviera that the attorney-general had also not mentioned such information, Generals Smit and Le Roux said. In a copy of a letter by the investigating task force it was said that "...the status quo of withdrawal from service should be maintained until we are in a position to decide on involvement or not of any person... Re-employment at this stage will be against the wishes and advice of the team". The two generals said "to accommodate the attorney-general...we are prepared to voluntarily withdraw from service for a further period from April 6". They called on Dr D'Oliviera and the task force to evaluate the information available as soon as possible to determine whether there were any reasonable grounds why their withdrawal from service should be maintained. It was essential that the matter be brought to a head as soon as possible. "In light of the abovementioned we will soon reconsider our position," the generals said. Earlier on Tuesday, before the generals again withdrew from service, the Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission should release specific evidence against the police generals implicated in the commission report "as a matter of urgency". "The fact that Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have decided to return to work, in spite of President (F W) de Klerk's order that they stay on leave, raises serious problems," said DP Executive Director James Selfe. The discipline of the South African Police [SAP] was essential for holding elections later in the month and for a successful transition to a new democratic order. Equally important was the principle of civilian control over security forces. Nothing sapped the effectiveness of the SAP more than unresolved allegations of third force activities. "Both to clear up these allegations, as well as to avoid a potential clash between the SAP senior management and the political leadership of the country, it is essential the Goldstone Commission makes available the specific evidence as a matter of urgency," said Mr Selfe. The African National Congress, in reaction to the generals returning to work on Tuesday, said the step was typical of the contempt with which senior SAP personnel had sought to cover up charges of police complicity in the third force. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news quoted the ANC as saying it was totally unacceptable that any officer, who had been implicated in alleged criminal activities, be allowed to return to active duty until the allegations had been properly investigated, and they had been cleared by due process of law.
