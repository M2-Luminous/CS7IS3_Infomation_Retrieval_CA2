They handed him a letter to be delivered to the Palestinian leadership in Tunis. Ahmad 'Ubaydat attended the meeting. Here are more details on this story: [Begin recording] ['Ubaydat] A delegation representing the families of Israeli MIA's met with Faysal al-Husani at the headquarters of the Palestinian delegation in east Jerusalem this afternoon. The delegation was headed by (Yona Bawmel), father of MIA soldier (Zakharia). [Bawmel, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into Arabic] The meeting was cordial. I proposed to al-Husayni that we embark on joint cooperation in the interests of both sides. We hope that there will be joint cooperation between both sides. ['Ubaydat] (Bawmel) handed al-Husayni a memorandum to be delivered to the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian leadership. The memorandum explains the agonies of the families of MIA's. With regard to al-Husayni, he commented at the end of the meeting, saying: [Al-Husayni] Indeed, at this point in time, there is no doubt that the two peoples are suffering. There are Israeli MIA's, whose families are suffering. Likewise, there are Palestinian MIA's, whose families are also experiencing agony. This meeting was held at the request of the Israelis. A representative of the Society in Charge of Locating Palestinian MIA's attended this meeting. During this meeting, the Israelis asked us to obtain from the PLO the information it could have on Israeli MIA's. As far as we are concerned, we appreciate this position. We can understand the Israelis' suffering. But, we also discussed with the Israeli delegation the fate of the Palestinian MIA's, particularly since both sides must work to resolve the problem of Israeli and Palestinian MIA's regardless of the political problems that could face them. ['Ubaydat] In reply to a question on the meetings held between Peres and 'Arafat in Bucharest, al-Husayni said: [Al-Husayni] I hope they will manage to resolve some of the problems still obstructing the Cairo talks during these meetings. ['Ubaydat] Several children of Israeli MIA's staged a demonstration before the headquarters of the Palestinian delegation. They raised placards demanding the release of the Israeli MIA's.
