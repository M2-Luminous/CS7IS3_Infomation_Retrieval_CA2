The proposed modifications are now in the hands of Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Paraiba] and Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Parana] -- the rapporteurs of the Constitution and Justice and Economic Affairs Committees of the Senate, respectively. The modifications are based on an agreement approved during the Uruguay round of GATT talks held in April. The agreement is known as TRIPS ("Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights") [given in English]. Bio-technically, the TRIPS agreement does not impose any major restrictions on obtaining patents on microorganisms, says Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) president. Article 27 of the GATT agreement states that "patents will be granted and their rights will be fully enjoyable, without discrimination over the involved technological field. Patents may not apply to plants or animals, but they can apply to microorganisms. In the case of plants, however, a `sui generis' system can be adopted if there is no system of patents for plant species." This article does not clash with the government suggestion to maintain patents on microorganisms but not on plants or animals. Compulsory licenses: Gusmao said the adjustments proposed by the government deal with the wording of regulations. The GATT agreement states that compulsory licenses may be granted provided they meet domestic market needs, except in cases of unfair competition as defined by court or administrative authorities. The agreement adds that the appropriate authorities may cancel compulsory licenses if the circumstances that justified the issuance of such licenses disappear and will probably not reappear. The INPI president said the bill in the Senate will have to be adjusted as follows: "Pipeline": Article 70 of the TRIPS agreement provides for a "pipeline" system (patent protection on products being developed and/or those yet to be sold on the Brazilian market, until the patent in the originating country expires), even in countries that adopt grace periods before granting the patent. It also provides for a five-year period of exclusive sale on such products to prevent imitation. In case of the "pipeline" protection, the government suggested a modification prepared by Deputy Roberto Freire, which the Chamber of Deputies did not approve. The government wants to protect patents that have already been launched abroad, provided the products -- patented in one or more countries -- have not been sold on the Brazilian market. The text approved by the Chamber of Deputies says that "pipeline" protection will be granted only to non-patented products. Domestic manufacture versus imports: Article 27 of the TRIPS agreement says patents will be granted and their rights fully enjoyable regardless of the place where the product was invented or whether the products are imported or locally produced. Gusmao said this article, which is not very clear, will be submitted to the new World Trade Organization (WTC). "Brazil will respect the WTC decision. The government believes a bill adjusted to the TRIPS should prevail. The bill at the Senate conditions a patent to full and complete production of the patented product in Brazilian territory, in order to meet domestic market needs, with full use of the patented process. To assure this "compulsory local production," the bill provides for the issue of compulsory licenses to local manufacturers three years after the issue of the patent. Gusmao said the government believes "importation does not prove the use of the patent." That is, the patent must be exploited in Brazil, and not through imports. The government supports the local exploitation condition, which foments industrialization." Parallel importation: This is the importation of patented products without the authorization of the patent owner. Interfarma -- an organization of 39 foreign laboratories -- has stated that the TRIPS agreement forbids parallel importation. The government, however, maintains that the GATT agreement "says nothing" about parallel importation. Gusmao said parallel importation can be admitted only within a common market or a free-trade zone with reciprocal rights. For example, it will be authorized in Mercosur [Common Market of the South], through regulations in the intellectual property rights code of the four countries. Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan authorities analyzed the subject last week. In its suggested modifications, Gusmao said the government does not consider parallel importation because it is inconsistent with the requirement of local exploitation of the patent.
