According to Chinese sources familiar with the talks, the two sides reached identical views that China and the United States, as two big countries with decisive influence in the world, share extensive common interests and objectives and that the building of good relations between them is not only in the interest of the two countries and peoples, but also contributes to the world peace and stability. Secretary Brown was quoted as saying that encouraging progress had been achieved in many important areas of U.S.-China relations. The United States, he promised, will continue to work for developing long-term economic and trade ties with China. Secretary O'Leary told her Chinese guests she always considers U.S.-China relations as being full of potentialities and that the two countries are long-term partners of economic and trade cooperation. The Chinese vice-premier said that a good foundation has been laid for the development of cooperation between the two countries in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology. As China is speeding up the establishment of a socialist market economy, the Chinese market is holding out an ever greater potential, which is also becoming a reality. This will provide broad prospects of cooperation for the two countries. If things go well in Sino-U.S. relations and man-made trammels are removed, their economic and trade cooperation will be further expanded, the Chinese vice-premier added. Secretary Brown was said to have reaffirmed during the talks that the United States is firm in its support for China's resumption of its seat as a founding member of GATT. The Chinese sources said that the two sides also discussed specific issues regarding the expansion of cooperation and they agreed that the candid, pragmatic and friendly exchange of views they had today was very useful.
