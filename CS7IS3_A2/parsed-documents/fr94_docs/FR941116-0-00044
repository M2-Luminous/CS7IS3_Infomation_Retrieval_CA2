ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), to make certain editorial clarifications and corrections and, in some cases, insert material inadvertently omitted from earlier regulatory amendments. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective November 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharron Cook, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Specifically, this rule makes the following corrections and clarifications: (1) Revises §770.11 by clarifying how applicants obtain status information on export license applications; (2) Revises §770.13 by amending the introductory text. (3) Revises §772.4 by removing the phrase ``or GTE'' and amending how to apply for a validated license. (4) Revises §772.11 by amending the regulatory citing. (5) Revises Supplement No. 1 to Part 772 by adding the phrase ``AND END-USER(S)''. (6) Revises §773.9(l) by adding ``Argentina, Hungary, Finland, and Sweden'' to the list of countries eligible for permissive reexport under the Special Chemical License. (7) Revises §774.2 by adding the parenthetical phrase ``(except supercomputers)''. (8) Revises §776.12 by removing the requirement for submission of Form BXA&hyph;6031P with applications for use of U.S.-origin parts and components in foreign goods. Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for puposes of Executive Order 12866. 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0010, and 0694&hyph;0013. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a foreign and military affairs function of the United States. No other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
