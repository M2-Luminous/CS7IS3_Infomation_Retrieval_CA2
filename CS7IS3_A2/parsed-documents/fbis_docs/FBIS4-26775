Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, presided over the meeting. He said that, as agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, its development has a direct impact on the economy, people's life and social stability. The agricultural issue is very much a matter of concern for the people, he said. The central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council attach great importance to agriculture, having worked out a series of important policies. Li pointed out that, as an institution participating in and discussing state and government affairs, the CPPCC is bound to be concerned about China's agriculture and give its suggestions and opinions on the issue. Chinese State Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the meeting and delivered a report on agriculture. Chen said that, in general, the current situation of agriculture and the rural economy is good. The country has achieved good harvests for many years successively, the rural economy has achieved consistent and all-round development, and farmers'income and living standards have improved. But, he noted, some problems still exist in China's agriculture and rural economy, which can not be ignored, in the process of the rapid development of the national economy and readjustment of the economic system. Chen said that the problems are mainly an imbalance in general grain supply and demand, disequilibrium of agricultural production structure between areas, gap between cotton supply and demand, uneven production of vegetables, slow increase of farmers' income, lack of funds, unemployment of rural laborers, constant growth of rural population and shrinking of cultivated land. The development of agriculture also faces a shortage of scientists and technicians, a withering of agriculture production in the coastal areas and hiking of the prices of farm production materials. Also there are 80 million poverty-stricken people in the rural areas, Chen added. Chen spoke highly of the CPPCC's concern about and contributions to China's agriculture and rural economy. The members have put forward many opinions and suggestions for building up a new and prosperous countryside in China, he noted. He expressed the hope that the CPPCC would continue making contributions to the development of agriculture and the rural economy. The five-day meeting will also discuss reports on CPPCC members' tours of Anhui, Henan and Shanxi Provinces, on Li Ruihuan's visit to five western and northern European countries, the visit of Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, to the Republic of Korea, and a report on a CPPCC delegation's visit to Jordan and Djibouti. The meeting will also discuss and adopt a list of appointments and removals concerning the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC.
