On how the talks are progressing as well as on the prospects for peace in Tajikistan, we talked with Shukurjon Zuhurov and Otahon Latifi, the representatives of the government and of the opposition, respectively. Mr. Latifi, please tell us what topics were covered in the major discussions in recent days and what progress has been made. [Latifi, speaking in Tajik] The recent discussions concentrated on the fact that we are searching for peace and stability in our homeland. Of course, it is very difficult to achieve reconciliation without talks. As to what the outcomes will be, the future will tell. [Qoroqi] It has been said that a temporary cease-fire until the conclusion of the talks has been agreed on. What is your opinion on the mechanism for this cease-fire? [Latifi] A cease-fire mechanism has not yet been proposed. When it is proposed, it will be discussed with UN experts who are experienced in this field and it will be endorsed by us. [Qoroqi] We also interviewed the Tajik Government representative Shukurjon Zuhurov. Mr. Zuhurov, as the representative of the Tajik Government at the peace talks, you have heard what Mr. Latifi had to say. How acceptable do you think these proposals are for your government? [Zuhurov, speaking in Tajik] I strongly support what Mr. Latifi said as far as establishing peace and stability in Tajikistan as soon as possible is concerned. I would like to say that today we feel that no one but the Tajiks themselves can establish peace and stability in our homeland. We can be assisted. But lasting peace can be established in Tajikistan only when the Tajiks are reconciled with each other, when general and national satisfaction is gained, and when the Tajiks live as one nation in this country. Thus, the second round of talks started in Iran--in the land of the people who we feel want to help us very much--and we started to solve the problems that were listed in the agenda of our first round of talks in Moscow. And one of the major problems, as you stated and as was heard in Mr. Latifi's remarks, was establishing a cease- fire and efforts toward this. We started discussions on this today and, God willing, we will reach an outcome. [Qoroqi] The opposition underlines the need to dissolve the government and to hold free elections. In your capacity as the representative of the government, what is your opinion on this? [Zuhurov] Elections should be free and democratic overall. If not, they cannot achieve tranquility. We have not yet discussed how the elections will be held and the participation of all the people of Tajikistan in the elections. We will try to speed up these discussions because we have lost a lot of time.
