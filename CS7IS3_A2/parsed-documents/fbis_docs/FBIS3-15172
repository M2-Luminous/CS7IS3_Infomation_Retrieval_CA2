But no. Passions not inferior to the most somber "witch hunt" models have flared up in Washington -- from the White House and the Department of State to the CIA headquarters. What has been the cause of such hysteria? On 22 February Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad interim in the United States, was invited to the State Department, where he was told of the arrest of Aldrich Hazen Ames, a high-ranking CIA staffer, and his wife Maria Ames on a charge of working for Soviet and then also Russian intelligence. In this connection a protest was made to the diplomat. The next day Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, made a similar demarche when he met with Sergey Lavrov, Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs. Not that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was inclined to dramatize the situation. In particular, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department, believes that, according to the information on the "Ames case" provided by the State Department, Moscow has questions which it would be most convenient to clear up by means of direct contacts between the special services. But Washington's reasoning was different: The next day Aleksandr Lysenko, the official representative of the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] at the Russian Embassy in the United States, was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave U.S. territory within a week. According to the information received at the Foreign Ministry, Aleksandr Lysenko could not have had contacts with the Ames: He arrived in the United States only last summer, and the investigation into their case has already been going on for more than 10 months. Lysenko has been named merely because some time ago the Russian and U.S. special services each agreed to disclose one of their own representatives working under cover of a diplomatic passport. This was done to coordinate actions in the struggle against international terrorism and the drug business. On talking recently with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International Affairs Committee and in the recent past the Russian Federation's ambassador to the United States, I asked a question also about the prospects of the "Ames case." "Foreign intelligence is commonplace in international practice," Vladimir Petrovich explained. "Today they have disclosed a spy in the United States, tomorrow they will find one in Russia, but I believe that our president will not make a tragedy out of this. Moreover, the guilt of the Ames has not yet been proved, and for this there must be a trial." The prognosis was confirmed. A week after the State Department's protest Russia made a counterstrike, so to speak, "on a mutual basis." On Monday the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry made a representation to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in connection with the expulsion of the FIS official representative from Washington. "In this situation," the Foreign Ministry note states, "we are forced on the basis of reciprocity to declare the CIA's representative in Moscow persona non grata and to demand his departure from the Russian Federation." According to information received from the Foreign Ministry, Embassy Counsellor James L. Morris must leave within seven days. Our attempt to secure a comment from the Lubyanka was not successful. FIS Director Yevgeniy Primakov gave a brief reply to an analogous request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "No comment." To all appearances, CIA Director Woolsey is also behaving with delicacy -- which obviously attests to a reluctance to fuel passions. Particularly as last year, so Germany's DIE WELT reported recently, 20 people were arrested in Russia for spying for Western countries. Unlike the United States, however, Moscow did not try to blow up any scandal, the newspaper emphasizes. What is more, recent data published by FIS experts indicate that the claims by Neil Gerardo, president of the U.S. Gerardo International Corporation, that Aldrich Ames could have passed to Moscow production secrets of the company's new invention -- the so-called MRX defense technology -- were an overt fabrication. Information about Ames' involvement in the drugs trade is also no more than disinformation. Against the background of these facts there can be just one conclusion: There are influential forces in the United States which would like, if not to return Russian-U.S. relations to the "Cold War" epoch, then at least to cast a shadow of mutual mistrust over our leaders and to halt the movement which has begun toward a Russian-U.S. partnership.
