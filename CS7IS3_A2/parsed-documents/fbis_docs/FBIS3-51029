A "large" number of EZLN members occupied Chanal, which had been retaken by the Mexican Army five days ago. The reports do not mention whether there is fighting. Chanal is located approximately 50 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is located 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City and which was one of the municipalities seized by the armed group on 1 January, when the conflict began. In a new operation, the Mexican Army is about 75 km from the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, which, according to witnesses, has been cut off by armed men who dug five-meter deep trenches around it. According to the reports, Guadalupe Tepeyac has been under the control of the armed group since 1 January, when the conflict began with the violent seizure of towns and an attack against a garrison, forcing the Army to intervene. Witnesses say the armed group is preventing people from entering or leaving the center of Guadalupe Tepeyac, southeast Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border. Approximately 80 workers of the public clinic in Guadalupe Tepeyac were released yesterday by the armed group and are in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas.
