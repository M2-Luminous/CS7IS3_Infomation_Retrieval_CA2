ACTION: Finalization of interim rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is finalizing its interim rule on Use of Force and Application of Restraints. These amendments take note of public comment received and include clarification on confrontation avoidance procedures, provisions for the use of soft restraints and ambulatory restraints, updated provisions for the documentation of incidents, provisions on the role of medical staff, and various editorial amendments. In updating procedures to follow in situations which require the use of force or application of restraints, these amendments are intended to provide for the security of the institution and for the well-being of inmates and staff. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is finalizing its interim rule on Use of Force and Application of Restraints, which was published in the Federal Register May 17, 1989 (54 FR 21394). A summary of the public comment and agency response follows. The Bureau received comment regarding paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (g), and (j) of §552.21, and on §§552.22 and 552.23. With respect to §552.21(c), the commenter stated that there was a lack of specificity as to which institutional regulations could be enforced by the use of restraints and/or force. The Bureau believes, however, that the general guidelines and statement of purpose in revised §552.20 (discussed below) and the governing principles contained in newly designated §552.22 adequately acknowledge the serious nature of conditions which authorize the use of force and/or restraints. With respect to §552.21(e), the commenter stated that the lifting and carrying of an inmate in restraints could expose the inmate to both malicious and unintentional physical harm by those prison staff carrying the inmate. The commenter further stated that such lifting might also expose staff to injury, and stated that no prisoners should be dragged nor should inmates be enlisted for the purpose of lifting or carrying a restrained inmate because they have not had appropriate training. The Bureau believes that newly designated §552.22(h) clearly prohibits the infliction of malicious harm. In addition, appropriate training on the use of force and/or restraints and on the lifting and carrying of an inmate in restraints is provided to Bureau staff. The Bureau believes that this training is sufficient to address the commenter's concerns on minimizing the risk of unintentional physical harm to either inmate or staff. Finally, the Bureau wishes to note that its regulations on the use of force and/or restraints are implemented by staff and not by inmates. With respect to §552.21(f), the commenter objected to the absence of any reference to maximum time length allowed on the use of restraints. The commenter further noted that medical staff should be consulted when the inmate ``is unable to regain his or her self-control within a normal time'' and for determining whether continued use of restraints is necessary. The Bureau believes that adequate provision for medical review and/or continuing care is contained in newly designated §552.26. As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendment to its provisions for the role of medical staff in use of force and application of restraints incidents.
