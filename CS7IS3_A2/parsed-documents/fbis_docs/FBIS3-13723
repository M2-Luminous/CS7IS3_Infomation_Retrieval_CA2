This draft resolution has been approved by the Arab and Nonaligned groups at the UN Security Council and other states. In light of the contacts that have been held with U.S. President Clinton, and after consultations with some Arab brothers directly concerned with this subject, Syria will soon invite the Arab parties to the peace process to a meeting to discuss the resumption of the peace talks, and to set a date for the resumption of talks in April. Syria believes that the odious massacre that was committed against defenseless Palestinian worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent death and injury of many people affirm to the entire world the need to end the Israeli occupation of the occupied Arab territories and to arrive at a just, comprehensive peace in accordance with the Madrid formula, away from any procrastination and obstacles. Syria is of the view that the issuance of the UN Security Council resolution by unanimous vote and the resumption of the peace talks will bolster the international measures to provide protection for our brothers in the occupied Arab territories to prevent the recurrence of such spiteful crimes.
