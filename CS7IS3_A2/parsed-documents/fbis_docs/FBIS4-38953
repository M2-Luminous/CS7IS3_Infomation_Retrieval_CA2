Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is heading the Ukrainian side at the talks. The talks will focus on the possibility of Ukraine building houses in Russia and supplying technical resources from its enterprises to repay the debt. Gasprom's shareholding in Ukrainian companies will also be discussed. The talks are likely to raise the issue of setting up joint ventures to use Ukrainian gas fields and pipelines, which the Russian side wants as part of debt payment. Asked by UNIAN about the Russian position on gas deliveries to Ukraine, Vladimir Podmarkov, an engineer of Gasprom's central distribution directorate, said it remains unchanged. While Russia continues to supply gas to Ukraine even in greater amounts than pledged, Ukraine is continuously failing to repay the debt. Meanwhile, Russia has repeatedly threatened to suspend gas deliveries if Ukraine does not pay what it owes, which since the beginning of the year has reached approximately $1 billion. Russia has postponed suspension of deliveries until negotiations have been held. At a recent meeting in Moscow, the sides decided that Ukraine will collect $150 million from enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Machine-Building to relieve tension at the next round of talks. Ukrgazprom, the Ukrainian company trading with the Russian partner, told UNIAN, however, that the money has not been found. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov said in an interview for UNIAN that Ukraine's Industry Ministry, which has been asked to pay $100 million, does not actually owe anything for gas. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk met with chiefs of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Machine-Building on 2 June to discuss hard currency payments for gas.
