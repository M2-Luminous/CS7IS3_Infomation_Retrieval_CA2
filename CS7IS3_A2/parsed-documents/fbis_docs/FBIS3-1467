"Inkatha's excuse that the meeting from which the violence erupted was a gathering of Zulus and not an IFP meeting must be dismissed as a transparent political ploy," said Mr Kriel. He also called on the Goldstone Commission to urgently investigate what triggered off the day's violence. Mr Kriel said IFP leaders, many of whom were present at the event, should have foreseen the possibility of violence, especially in the light of the volatile political situation. "They should have taken the necessary steps to avoid bloodshed." He added that Monday's deaths were "yet another warning that political intolerance -- not only of the IFP, but also the supporters of other organisations -- and lack of control over supporters are the single biggest threat to free and fair elections".
