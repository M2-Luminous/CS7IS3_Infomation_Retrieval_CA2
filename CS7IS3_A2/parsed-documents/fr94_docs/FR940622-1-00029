FR940622-1-00029 FR940622-1-00009 a. How many sensitivity to ``scope of injury'' tests are appropriate to require? Are restrictions on differences between scenarios appropriate or feasible? b. Is it appropriate to allow the trustee(s) to conduct the scope test with the base survey instrument, by constructing a valuation function to examine whether variations in belief about injuries predict variations in WTP, controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors? Are there additional/alternative internal validity test(s) that NOAA should consider? 6. 70% is the minimum allowable response rate contained in the proposed OPA rule. In order to minimize non-response bias, should a minimum response rate be specified? If so, is 70% the appropriate level? If 70% is not the appropriate rate, what rationale is there for a different rate? 7. In the proposed OPA rule, the trustee(s) is directed to use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive-compatible, i.e., one that does not provide respondents with incentives to understate or overstate their true value. The reasons are outlined in the preamble for recommending the use of a referendum as the choice mechanism in a survey. Are these requirements appropriate? 8. Should respondents with no knowledge of the resources and/or injuries prior to survey be assigned a zero value? What is the appropriate use of data on respondents' prior information? 9. Should there be thresholds for damages, below which CV could not be used in a damage assessment, e.g., an expected $5/household times the number of households expected to hold passive values; and/or twice the cost of a contingent valuation survey following these regulations. What threshold, if any, is appropriate? How would the threshold be implemented (without performing a CV study? 10. In the proposed rule, the trustee(s) has the option of choosing the mode of administration of a survey, but the choice must be justified. Is one mode, e.g., in-person, telephone, or mail, preferable to another? If so, or if not, what rationale supports it? 11. Should the rule or preamble provide guidance as to criteria to be employed in determining the extent of the market? 12. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on CV studies for valuing direct use only? 13. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on contingent behavior studies? Dated: June 17, 1994. Douglas K. Hall, Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15192 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;12&hyph;P
