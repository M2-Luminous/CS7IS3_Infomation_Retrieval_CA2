The letter reads: "We wish to thank you for the great appreciation of the efforts Russia is making to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the FRY. I understand the difficulties that the people of your country are experiencing. We believe that an urgent political solution and the reaching of an acceptable comprehensive agreement between the three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina will bring about the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia. ``The Russian side made energetic efforts during 1993 to try to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY, primarily in terms of supplying it with energy. Unfortunately, our repeated appeals to the UN Security Council sanctions committee, including the latest one of 10 December 1993, have so far not met with the necessary understanding. However, Russia intends to continue to insist on obtaining permits that would enable it to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY. In so doing, the recommendations by the president of the UN Security Council sanctions committee, of which we have informed you through the Russian Embassy in Belgrade, will be taken into consideration. "For our part, we confirm our readiness to begin humanitarian deliveries of gas once the necessary permit has been obtained."
