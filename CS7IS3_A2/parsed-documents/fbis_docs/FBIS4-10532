Issuing property titles for the peasants' land is an act of justice, not an act of alienation. He also said that ejidos will not be privatized. [Salinas] "These titles mean justice, not alienation." He pointed out that two years after Article 27 was amended, only 38 of the 30,000 Mexican ejidos have requested the full issuance of property titles to become part of the real estate market. [Salinas] "Urban areas are already surrounding those 38 ejidos. Without property titles, their prospects, as Agrarian Prosecutor Arturo Warman already said, would include only expropriation or, even worse, invasion and loss of their own legacy." Salinas pointed out there currently is a sound possibility of overcoming poverty and neglect in the countryside. In short, the validity of Article 27 was discussed. [Warman] "We did not find any reason to revise Article 27 of the Constitution." Prosecutor Warman said that a reform to Article 27 would constitute a setback; in addition, the reform lacks the support of the majority of peasants. He added that only minority groups are requesting modifications to the article. He also talked about Chiapas and rejected that legal large estates are predominantly in the hands of a few individuals. [Warman] "We will continue to search for legal large estates, but I believe that we will find very few." Warman submitted to the president his second report on the works of the Agrarian Prosecutor's Office.
