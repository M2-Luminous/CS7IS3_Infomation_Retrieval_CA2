The revelations came to light at a joint news conference by State President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Justice Richard Goldstone yesterday. Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi denied that any members of his organization were involved in weapons supply. [Begin Buthelezi recording] I am completely unaware that he supplied guns to any person, including any member of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. I am just as surprised as anyone else about the allegations because I'm not aware which member of the IFP he was supplying with guns. [end recording] The 36-page report released to the media yesterday contained allegations involving top police officials including deputy police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Basie Smit, CID [Criminal Investigations Department] Chief Johan le Roux, and the head of the police counterintelligence division, Major General Krappies Engelbrecht. They and other police officers named in the report have been placed on compulsory leave.
