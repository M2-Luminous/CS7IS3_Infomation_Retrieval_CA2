He called for a halt to all terrorist operations when the month of Ramadan begins, making this the starting point in the renunciation of violence and aggression. Defendant Hasan al-Hallawi -- a leading figure in the Islamic Group who is currently serving a prison term in connection with the case of the Military Technical College and the murder of Lieutenant Colonel 'Isam Shams during the events that took place at the Adam Mosque in 'Ayn Shams in 1989 -- made these remarks when commenting on his colleagues' statements of the past few days, which promised more terrorist operations. In his message, which he sent to us from behind bars, al-Hallawi says that threatening to retaliate and murdering innocent and defenseless people, both Egyptians and foreigners, are not approved of by Islamic law, but are a distortion of jurisprudence and religion and the result of an erroneous understanding of the shari'ah. He urged terrorist elements to fear God and listen to the counsel of the sincere ulema in this regard. He added: Any party that fears talks has a weak argument, because dialogues are the path taken by sane people so long as there is an atmosphere of freedom, justice, and safety. This open message to the terrorist groups is the first response and show of sympathy by a prominent figure in these groups. It shows the threat to them as a result of the successful blows security forces have dealt their leaders in the past week, in which they lost important cadres in their military wing. It should be recalled that defendant Hasan al-Hallawi had escaped to and resided in an Arab country. He was among the elements responsible for sending money to their cadres in Egypt before he was arrested and deported to Egypt two months ago along with a group of his associates.
