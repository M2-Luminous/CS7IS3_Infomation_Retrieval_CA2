On the other hand, it wants to preserve the consensus of the large democratic parties concerning European unity. In the opinion of Klaus Haensch (55), it is detrimental for Europe to list prominent candidates for the balloting on 12 June only because of their names--the SPD is supported by tested parliamentarians. In 1989 the SPD received 37.3 percent of the votes. Karl-Otto Sattler interviewed in Strasbourg the SPD's top candidate for the European elections and the deputy chairman of the strongest caucus, with its 199 deputies. [Sattler] Germany is facing a super election year in 1994. Won't the European elections be drowned out? You even have to share 12 June with a lot of municipal elections. [Haensch] It is nothing new or unique to the European elections that several elections will take place on one day. That has often been the case in the past. In North Rhine-Westphalia this time the municipal elections coincide with the Bundestag elections. In a super election year like this one, every election stands in the shadow of the others. [Sattler] Many people feel that nothing is at stake in the European elections and that they can therefore safely give their vote to smaller parties, even right-wing parties. The SPD could hardly benefit from displeasure with the Union. [Haensch] People who think this way are simply mistaken. First, the results of the European elections will have a direct influence on the policies of the European Union [EU]. Since Maastricht, the Parliament has had actual shared responsibility for the legislation of the EU and for the establishment of the Brussels Commission. Which majorities are elected to the European Parliament will therefore be important. I think the people will take this into consideration. [Sattler] At the last SPD election party congress, Gerhard Schmid, chairman of the German SPD Eurodeputies, wasn't even elected to the Executive Committee. No prominent person from the front ranks of the SPD is campaigning in the 12 June elections. Apparently the European Parliament does not enjoy a great deal of importance among the SPD. [Haensch] That is a false conclusion. The SPD has put those politicians on the list who have performed reliable and recognized service in the Parliament. To place prominent politicians on the list who bring nothing but their prominent names would perform a disservice to Europe. The voters would not take this seriously. [Sattler] What are the important issues in the SPD campaign? [Haensch] The most important point is that the EU has to help combat the massive unemployment in Europe. This involves increased efforts to reestablish the competitiveness of the entire European industry in world markets. Next, during a period of limitless destruction of the environment, policy must know no limits in protecting the environment. It is no longer possible to have an effective environmental policy confined to national boundaries. Moreover, in a time when international crime is organizing, we need an international organization to fight crime. We Social Democrats want to strengthen Europol as a European police with real authority. Finally, we Social Democrats want to see to it that the EU, as a model of the voluntary unity of European nations, remains a factor for stability and safeguarding peace in Europe. [Sattler] In the past the European election campaigns were quite dull because there were no controversial issues of note. Everyone was for Europe in the end. Are things going to be different? Will there be fundamental struggles for Europe? Green Europoliticians complained about Maastricht, likewise Manfred Brunner. Edmund Stoiber has reservations toward Europe. Not to mention the nationalist Republikaner. [Haensch] For decades in the Federal Republic there was the basic agreement among the large democratic parties that they should work for European unity. And in the European election campaign, I will not set the whole house on fire just to cook an election campaign soup. The election debates will make it clear that there are parties and groups that want to return to a Europe of nationalism, racism, and instabiltiy. We will oppose these groups. [Sattler] Maastricht expanded the responsibilities of the European Parliament. Nevertheless, this body is still quite powerless. Have you ever had a real feeling of success as a European deputy? [Haensch] I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. There are a great number of such successes. For example, with Maastricht we were successful in providing a political dimension to European unity, at least in the initial stage. Another example: Maastricht strengthened the rights of the Parliament. In the past in a series of legislative processes, we were able to carry the position of the Parliament even though there was no legal obligation. This was the case, for example, with the first Europeanwide exhaust gas regulation for cars, or with various environmental guidelines, such as safeguarding drinking water. In this case, the Social Democratic caucus was able to carry its position. And, finally, it is a fundamental accomplishment to ultimately find a common denominator for the various European national interests--even if only after difficult negotiations in many cases.
