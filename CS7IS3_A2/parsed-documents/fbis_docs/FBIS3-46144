But for decades before reform and opening up, and even in the first few years after reform and opening up began, they were in control of the Chinese people's daily life all the time. At that time, no matter what you wanted to buy, you had to have ration coupons or certificates. Almost everything, be it food, clothing, houses, utensils, or transport, had to be obtained with "the tickets." Someone once did a survey and found that, in the 1970's, every person in Guangzhou typically carried as many as 65 commodity ration coupons and certificates. When discussing grain coupons, an old comrade said with emotion: In the 1960's and 70's, when you were going on a business trip, you first had to take your ration book to the grain store to get grain coupons. You had to take grain coupons with you when you were away from home to attend a conference or to stay in a hotel. Even having a breakfast or snack out required grain coupons. But today the situation is really good. Not only were bicycle ration coupons, color television ration coupons, soap ration coupons, sugar ration coupons, and oil ration coupons all scrapped long ago, even grain coupons -- which had the largest variety, biggest quantity, and longest history among all ration coupons -- have been abolished. Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, alongside the rapid development of China's economy, commodity supply has become more and more sufficient. In 1992, the national commodity retail volume reached 1.0894 trillion yuan, seven times the 1978 figure, representing a net increase of 933.6 billion yuan. In rural areas as well as in urban areas, shops have such a comprehensive array of goods that there is just about everything one would expect to find. In 1992, the retail volume of consumer goods nationwide reached 961.3 billion yuan. In the 15 years of reform and opening up, the life of the Chinese people can be compared to sesame in bloom, with each flower growing higher than the last. However, we still have quite a long way to go to reach the goal of "moderate prosperity," and our country's national income is still rather low compared to developed countries. This is especially true with peasants, whose per-capita annual income last year was only approximately 800 yuan. This requires us to vigorously throw ourselves into reform and economic construction, work hard to develop production, create more material wealth, and satisfy the ever-rising demand of the general public for material and cultural life.
