KOTRA issued a report titled "The Reality of North Korea-Japan Trade of Processing-on-commission and Inter-Korea Trade," which said that North Korea is encouraging processing-on-commission trade, following the example set by China in the early stages of its opening. In processing on commission, foreign companies provide North Korean factories with raw materials and buy the finished products. "The new trade system" which North Korean President Kim Il-song introduced late last year to diversify trading methods is very similar to "the new trade method" China began in 1979, the KOTRA report said. Under the system, all organizations including the External Economy Commission, government ministries, commissions, district administrative bodies, trading companies and manufacturing enterprises should move to expand external trade in addition to doing their own work. The system also means that the forms of trade should be diversified toward processing, border and compensation trade. North Korea's biggest partners in processing on commission trade are Japanese enterprises, especially those related to Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents in Japan, and the main field is the textile industry, according to KOTRA. Textiles exported by North Korea to Japan in the form of processing on commission trade reached 8.7 billion Japanese yen in 1992, up 26.9 percent from a year earlier, and amounted to 8.8 billion yen in the first 10 months of 1993, up 38.2 percent from the same period of 1992. Meanwhile, South Korea is prohibiting businessmen from visiting North Korea, making it difficult for them to instruct North Korean workers on the advanced technology necessary for processing on commission trade for high-value-added goods. South Korea's processing on commission trade with North Korea is thus limited to some simple needlework, KOTRA said. Nonetheless, South Korean purchases of goods processed on commission in North Korea, mainly textiles, skyrocketed 729 percent to 4.39 million dollars in nine cases last year.
