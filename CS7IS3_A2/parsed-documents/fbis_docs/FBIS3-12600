Addressing the Security Council last night, Syrian UN Representative Husayn 'Awwad said Israel's intransigent attitude and expansionist policies, which have persisted since the start of the Middle East peace talks in Madrid in 1991, are either directly or indirectly responsible for regional extremism. He added that Israel has been playing a dual game since the start of the Middle East peace process and that the Hebron massacre is part of an organized and planned operation, not an individual act as asserted by Israel. The government of Israel bears responsibility for this massacre, he added. 'Awwad said that unless the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the peace process, intervene for the sake of reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in the Middle East, Israel will then implement Yitzhaq Shamir's slogans, which he summed up in the following phrase: Negotiate with the Arabs for years, but do not allow these talks to produce any results.
