[Dlouhy] If we talk about individual issues, I would say that, for instance, the successes included foreign visits. I inherited these from the Federal Foreign Trade Ministry, without a clearly defined concept, and I think we succeeded in getting them under way and in implementing a program supporting Czech exporters. On the other hand, I could talk about all sorts of problems: Temelin and the economic agreements, the Ingolstadt oil pipeline and state guarantees for the Bavarian Government, and the unfortunate case of Libkovice. However, no matter how many individual issues economic life is made up of, it is not evaluated according to them. The fundamental question is whether the Czech Republic's economic development in 1993 was correct and whether the government contributed to this by its economic policy. I think the answers to both questions are positive. Economic policy was oriented, first and foremost, toward maintaining macroeconomic stability and releasing certain growth incentives. If we compare the third quarter of 1993 and the third quarter of 1992, the figures do not indicate much growth. If we look at the absolute figures, however, it is possible to anticipate economic growth as early as the first quarter of this year. [Frydl] The Czech Republic is doing relatively well in the macro sphere but is somewhat behind in the micro sphere. It is enough, for example, to look at insolvency or at the, so far, imperfect legislation. What can be done? We will not get by for long with a good macro situation alone. [Dlouhy] This is true. If we do not succeed in getting growth under way, we will not maintain the stability of the macroeconomic parameters for long. If Czech enterprises do not improve their efficiency and productivity, our economy's development will begin to decline and get into difficulty. The macro parameters will not last if they are not generated from the micro level. From the Industry Ministry's point of view, I see a major problem in the implementation of ownership rights. We often hear criticism from the National Property Fund that there are banks here that, through the privatization funds, own a large part of the Czech economy, and the question is just how capable of implementing their rights are these owners, of restructuring, of closing inefficient production lines, and of obtaining new quality management. I consider this to be one of the most important microeconomic issues. [Frydl] Do you think the current relatively good macroeconomic situation is proceeding from the good microeconomic situation or, rather, from the initial impetus caused by the change in our economy's orientation and the opening up of new opportunities? [Dlouhy] The good macroeconomic situation is, first and foremost, a result of the fact that economic policy since 1990 has been conceived as a "package" of mutually linked steps: a balanced budget, relatively strong financial restrictions from the beginning, convertibility, and others. Compare the countries of the former CEMA, where the reform steps are not linked, and you will see far worse problems than in our country. The Czech Republic has also succeeded in reorienting its exports from the former CEMA to West European and other markets, and a private sector has evolved that has absorbed a considerable segment of unemployment. All of this has contributed to macro stability. It will not continue to be maintained by this alone, however. The time has come to show why we conducted privatization, and the private owners have to guarantee stability in the enterprises. Apart from this, until now we had macro stability during economic decline or stagnation. Now we want stability during economic growth. This requires a quite different blend of economic policy. [Frydl] The government has specific prerequisites for future economic growth from which it proceeds in formulating its policy. It is banking on an average GDP increase of some 3.5 percent per annum up to the year 2000. With such growth, however, we will catch up with advanced states very, very slowly. In your opinion, would it not be bette, if not this year then at least in the future, to restore the Czech economy a little--for example, through the state budget? Are the several billions for so-called development projects in this year's budget enough to stimulate the economy? [Dlouhy] The economy cannot be stimulated in one go. The aforementioned prodevelopment elements will certainly have some effect. This is simply the first step, and, in 1995, the situation could be far different in this regard. However, we are still at the transformation stage, and our economy is just establishing within itself all of the traits of the market. The question is whether increasing budget expenditure or, as the case may be, the budget deficit would lead to economic growth or to higher inflation. In reality, these two factors are combined. However, one of them always prevails over the other. [Frydl] Some people are comparing us with the "Asian tigers" whose economic growth has reached, and in some cases is reaching, the order of 10 percent. [Dlouhy] Their conditions are completely different from ours. Such an ideal health and social security system, time off, and so on does not exist in many Asian countries. In other words, the people there are far less demanding. Our country is unwilling and indeed cannot tighten its belt so much in order to attain such growth. Instead, we should follow the paths of Portugal and Greece, but, of course, with the advantage of a far better quality work force. Despite this, we are not burdened with the Western welfare state syndrome; we have great commercial potential. However, it is necessary to state that our economic path toward Europe will be a path on a scale of several decades. The real rapprochement of living standards will take a long time. [Frydl] You compare us with the countries of southern Europe. They have received considerable assistance by joining the EC, however, and it is hard to say where their economies would be today without this membership. Moreover, at the moment, we cannot rely too much on the whim of the European Union [EU]. What do you think of the opinion that, in view of our membership being a distant prospect, we should not set such great store by it? [Dlouhy] I would not say that we will be relying on the EU's whim. Many other countries are waiting to join, and the Community has made it clear to us that we will not become a member in a year or two. It will be a long process. For example, Austria, Sweden, and Finland are ahead of us. Due to our advantages, however, we may be in a better position than, for instance, Greece and Portugal, although we will not receive subsidies from the EU's budget. However, I am afraid that we will not get ahead at the pace of the Asian tigers. We are a European country with a European environment, traditions, and habits. I have already demonstrated on several occasions a certain restraint with regard to the EU. This is associated with the aforementioned foreign visits, in which I try to visit other countries and thus expand our economic contacts. On the other hand, I would not want the Czech Republic to choose, as an explicit policy, to orient itself other than toward the EU. European integration is a train from which we cannot jump. [Frydl] The issue of the Czech economy's specific orientation in the world economy is associated with this. Some rapidly developing countries have found a "market gap" on which to base their prosperity. This could be a specific branch of industry, a general technological orientation, unequivocal support for exports, and so on. It seems that, at the moment, the Czech Republic does not have such a strategy. [Dlouhy] Today it is very difficult to find any gap in the market and hold on to it for any length of time. A gap in the market arises as a consequence of insufficient information about supply and demand. In essence, this phenomenon no longer exists. Trade is globalizing. Today, when a country begins to manufacture socks from its own raw materials, it is highly probable that an enterprise in another country (for example, an Asian one) will soon begin to import these raw materials and also start to manufacture socks and export them to the original country at a profit. Moreover, it is mainly certain Asian states that have chosen the path of "concentrating their efforts" mentioned by you. Thus, we come back to European conditions. [Frydl] So far, the trend in Czech exports is satisfactory. However, opinions are being expressed that this is a temporary boom arising from the new opportunities for gaining access to Western markets. Apparently, the potential competition will not wait long, and the state will have to help our exporters more than at the moment. [Dlouhy] The main conceptual support for our exports was--and, in a number of cases, still is--the koruna's exchange rate, undervalued against purchasing power parity. When we set its rate in 1990, we came in for a great deal of criticism. However, we said clearly that this is, first and foremost, a proxport measure. The aforementioned foreign visits are another deliberate policy in support of our exports. [Frydl] In your opinion, is our proexport policy sufficient for the present and the future? [Dlouhy] No. We are again turning to the issue of the growth we want to achieve. The capacity of the small Czech economy is greater than its domestic market. Therefore, growth cannot proceed other than by exports. The advantage of an undervalued exchange rate will last for some time yet, but it will gradually be reduced. Apart from this, in a number of cases, our exporters are unable to compete because they do not have at their disposal the financial, insurance, and other mechanisms needed to support exports, the kind of mechanisms their competitors have. [Frydl] So, the money in the Export Guarantee and Insurance Company [EGAP] is not enough? [Dlouhy] It is very little. EGAP should gradually transfer to self-financing. It is impossible for the state to keep subsidizing it from the budget because this would not be fair to the other taxpayers. Despite this, before its commencement, it requires a certain amount of funds, but, at the moment, this is not enough. [Frydl] The issue of bankruptcies and your opinion that the state should initiate them has recently attracted a great deal of attention. The prime minister has come out against this, and your initiative has not aroused much response in other quarters. What will happen now? [Dlouhy] It is true that my stance was rather isolated within the debate on bankruptcies. Nevertheless, I really think that there are few bankruptcies, that they proceed slowly, and that this is not good for stimulating economic growth. It is easy to say that this is a mistake and that it is necessary to do something immediately. The law on bankruptcy and settlement has to be examined to see if there are hitches in it that prevent bankruptcies. We can draw a matrix for the banks and put their privatization funds in the rows and, perhaps, all of this economy's more important enterprises in the columns. By declaring an enterprise to be bankrupt, a bank declares its own property bankrupt. This is a fact that certainly does not contribute to the commencement of bankruptcies. [Frydl] Finally, how did you spend Christmas and the New Year? [Dlouhy] I was on vacation. I had promised myself that, sometime in the evening of 23 December, I would say: Good, now I am satisfied and will put my feet up on the table. This did not work out exactly because I had the flu. However, I spent New Year's Eve with my family.
