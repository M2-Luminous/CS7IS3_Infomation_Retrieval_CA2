The statement was made at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the leader of the opposition Russian National Assembly Aleksandr Sterligov. "The USA has actually begun building a new world order through the use of force and we regard this as a dangerous step that might pave the way to a war against the Slavic world", Sterligov said. According to him, in this situation the Serbs will not be left alone, because steps would be made to organize the sending of volunteers to Serbia. He added that if the war in Serbia was not stopped, it would spread to Russia. Sterligov spoke against the coming joint Russian-American military exercises in the Urals this summer. He said the purpose of the exercises is to encourage separatists to split Russia as well as to spy on the capability of the remnants of the Russian army to guarantee the security of the country. "Americans want to consolidate their hold on our territory, set up bases and begin the creeping occupation of Russia", Sterligov said. He stressed that the Russian National Assembly is ready to form public committees of resistance to the appearance of Western troops in Russia. "In this respect we have found full understanding with Cossack organizations and groups of Afghan war veterans", Sterligov announced. He said his organization together with Cossacks and Afghan veteranss would launch a campaign of resistance to the exercises, if the Federal Assembly does not cancel them.
