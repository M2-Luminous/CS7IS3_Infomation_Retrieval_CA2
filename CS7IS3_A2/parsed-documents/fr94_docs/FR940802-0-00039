FR940802-0-00039 FR940802-0-00008 Based on this analysis, adequate tankage and blending equipment exists for roughly 12 percent of the oxygenate required by the reformulated gasoline program to be supplied by ethanol during the winter months only. This is well short of the total 30 percent required by the program, and even short of a 15 percent phase-in level. In order to implement the program smoothly, this shortfall will have to be made up by one of three means: first, pass a greater volume of ethanol through existing tankage and blending equipment; second, construct new ethanol storage and blending capacity at terminals; or third, supplement ethanol blended at terminals with ETBE blended at refineries. It is reasonable to assume that some additional ethanol could be blended at the existing facilities by increasing the throughput of storage tanks and blending equipment, particularly in the Midwest where the close proximity to ethanol production facilities allows for greater flexibility in receiving and blending ethanol shipments. EPA does not believe it unreasonable to assume that ethanol throughput could be increased by 25 percent or more in 1995, since it is unlikely that existing facilities were all designed to operate at their current peak levels with no provisions made for market growth. To the extent throughput can be increased by even more than 25 percent in some markets it could be used to offset (through credit trading) any shortfall in other markets. As a result, a phase-in level of 15 percent should be achievable in 1995 even without expanding ethanol storage and blending facilities. Even if this were not the case, it is reasonable to assume that some additional storage and blending capacity beyond that available in 1993 may have been planned to be available in 1995 to keep up with the planned increases discussed above in ethanol production by 1995. It is not reasonable, however, to assume that existing facilities could increase their throughput by the 150 percent necessary to achieve the full 30 percent requirement of today's program. Furthermore, as discussed above, no appreciable ETBE production capacity is expected to be available until the summer of 1996. As a result, the only way to meet the full 30 percent requirement of the program in 1995 would be through the addition of new ethanol storage and blending capacity. Current estimates of the time necessary to obtain permits, construct new storage and blending facilities, and make them fully operational vary, but range between approximately 6 and 18 months. Thus, sufficient time would not be available to bring on-line additional ethanol storage and blending facilities for use until the fall of 1995. The expanded ethanol blending capacity available by this time is unlikely to be sufficient to supply the full 30 percent requirement over the course of the entire year. Even if it were sufficient, it would not have been available for the entire year and hence would not be sufficient to satisfy the 30 percent requirement. In order to meet the full 30 percent requirement in 1995, storage and blending capacity in excess of what would be needed in subsequent years would have to be built in 1995. While it is very difficult to predict specific market responses, especially given the compliance flexibilities built into the program, it does not appear that sufficient ethanol storage and blending capacity is likely to exist for 1995 without either a phase-in of the program or extraordinary measures to provide additional blending capacity (e.g., tanker truck shipments from terminals outside the RFG areas). The situation is different for 1996, however. It may be possible by 1996 for a considerable amount of ETBE to be blended at the refineries during both summer and winter months. Since refinery-blended ETBE would not require specialized blending facilities at terminals, increased ETBE use might reduce considerably the 150% increase in ethanol blending capacity that would otherwise be necessary. Furthermore, the additional time provided by a phase-in would allow for the construction of additional ethanol storage and blending facilities, most of which could be in place at the beginning of the annual averaging program in January of 1996. Much of this additional ethanol blending capacity is likely to be added in the Midwest to take advantage of lower ethanol transportation costs and State tax exemptions. However, even if every gallon of RFG in the Midwest contained 10 volume percent ethanol, only 40% of the renewable oxygenates required by the program could be met by Midwest ethanol usage in RFG. As a result, until a significant amount of ETBE production comes on-line, ethanol storage and blending capacity in RFG markets outside the Midwest will have to expand by as much as 100 percent (i.e., capacity would have to double).
