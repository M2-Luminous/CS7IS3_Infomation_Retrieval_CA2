SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. Transamerica and First Transamerica are each a stock life insurance company. First Transamerica is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica Insurance Corporation of California (``Transamerica-California''). Transamerica-California is, in turn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica Corporation. Transamerica and First Transamerica are each principally engaged in offering life insurance and annuity contracts. Transamerica is licensed in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, certain provinces of Canada, the District of Columbia, and in all states except New York. First Transamerica is licensed to sell insurance and annuities in New York and New Mexico. 2. Separate Accounts VA&hyph;2L and VA&hyph;2NL are separate accounts established by Transamerica. Separate Accounts VA&hyph;2LNY and VA&hyph;2NLNY are separate accounts established by First Transamerica. The Separate Accounts have been registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. 3. TISSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica-California, is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 4. By orders of the Commission, 1 Applicants, other than TISSC, and Dreyfus Service Corporation (``Dreyfus''), the primary principal underwriter of the Contacts, were granted exemptive relief under Section (6)(c) of the 1940 Act from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the Separate Accounts in connection with the issuance of the Contracts. Dreyfus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dreyfus Corporation. 1 Transamerica VA&hyph;2L, Inv. Co. Act Rel. Nos. 19195 (Dec. 30, 1992) (Order), and 19144 (Dec. 2, 1992) (Notice); * Transamerica VA&hyph;2L, Inv. Co. Act Rel. Nos. 19750 (Sep. 29, 1993) (Order), and 19675 (Sep. 1, 1993) (Notice); Transamerica VA&hyph;1NL, Inv. Co. Act Rel. Nos. 19180 (Dec. 23, 1992) (Order), and 19119 (Nov. 24, 1992) (Notice); First Transamerica VA&hyph;2LNY, Inv. Co. Act Rel. Nos. 19295 (Feb. 25, 1993) (Order), and 19246 (Jan. 29, 1993) (Notice); and First Transamerica VA&hyph;2NLNY, Inv. Co. Act Rel. Nos. 19294 (Feb. 25, 1993) (Order), and 19245 (Jan. 29, 1993) (collectively, ``Commission Orders''). 5. Applicants represent that Dreyfus Corporation will soon be acquired by Mellon Bank. As a result of the proposed acquisition, Dreyfus will become a bank affiliate and, consequently, cannot continue to serve in the capacity of principal underwriter of the Contracts issued through the Separate Accounts because bank affiliates may not act as principal underwriters of investment company securities. Accordingly, Applicants intend that TISSC replace Dreyfus as principal underwriter of the Contracts. 6. Applicants request that the Commission amend the Commission Orders to extend to TISSC, as well as to any NASD member broker-dealer that may in the future serve as principal underwriter for the Contracts (``Future Underwriters''), the same exemptions granted Dreyfus under the Commission Orders. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants represent that all of the facts asserted and representations made in the applications for the Commission Orders remain true and accurate. Applicants specifically incorporate such acts and representations by reference to such prior applications and, further, represent that they each will comply with the conditions set forth in such applications in connection with the exemptions requested. 2. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under Section 6(c) of the Act amending the Commission Orders to exempt TISSC as well as any Future Underwriters from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the Separate Accounts as provided for in the Contracts. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above in the applications requesting the foregoing orders, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
