The former Home Minister and the Akali Dal (Longowal) general secretary, Captain Kanwaljit Today Singh, said the declaration violated the spirit of the Guru Granth Sahib and "I completely and thoroughly reject it." Describing the declaration as "anti-Sikh, anti-Punjabi and anti-nation", the Akali leader appealed to the Sikh masses also to reject it. Meanwhile, the president of the Akali Dal (Mann), Mr Simranjit Singh Mann, today asked the Centre and the State Government to impose a ban on the Shiromani Akali Dal and warned that the Akalis would not entertain threats from any quarter. Addressing a press conference here, he said the Akali Dal leaders are meeting at the Akal Takht on May 6 to discuss the threat reportedly held out by the Union Home Minister, Mr S. B. Chavan, and the Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Beant Singh, and to chalk out the future course of action. When asked whether Mr Parkash Singh Badal would also attend the meeting, he said: "I hope that all Akali Dal leaders would attend the meeting." Referring to reports that Mr Badal would show his strength at the Akal Takht, Mr Mann said: "One should show humility and not strength at the Akal Takht." He said that the Akali Dal would not contest the by-elections in Punjab as it felt that the elections would not be free and fair. He said that the Dal would participate in future elections but the same should be held in the presence of the SAARC and the Commonwealth observers. He said the Dal proposed to write to the Chief Election Commissioner making such a request. The desperate stand of the Akali Dal leaders at Amritsar would prove disastrous as it was an attempt to "rekindle the flames of violence", he added. The Minister of State for Public Health and Public Relations, Mr Surendra Kapoor, today appreciated Capt Kanwaljit Singh's decision in rejecting the so-called "Amritsar Declaration" adopted by the newly-formed Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) seeking a separate area for the Sikhs. Meanwhile, the Punjab unit of the CPI(M) today described the "Amritsar Declaration" of the newly formed Akali Dal as "most unfortunate development", saying it would provide "strong ideological basis to the secessionist forces." In a statement here, the party State secretary, Mr Mangat Ram Pasla, said: "The declaration is not only similar to the Anandpur Sahib resolution of 1973 but it also legitimises the activities of Khalistani marauders".
