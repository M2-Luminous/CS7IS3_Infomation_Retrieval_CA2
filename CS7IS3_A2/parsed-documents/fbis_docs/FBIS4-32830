In a statement made at La Aurora International Airport upon his return from Mexico City, Rosada explained that the parties believed it was necessary to discuss the topic further, because it involves a situation that must be analyzed thoroughly. Rosada added that the discussion of the topic will conclude the week of 30 May since the parties have agreed to meet again for two more days. The dates and location have not been disclosed since they are still awaiting the summoning of UN Moderator Jean Arnault. As for the reason the negotiation was stalled, Rosada refused to comment because since the talks are not over he could not make a public statement in this regard. However, Rosada did not deny that the reason for the delay in the talks might be linked to the Army high command stating that they plan to have command posts in the region of Ixcan, Quiche. Regarding an increase in military activity by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, Rosada indicated that it contradicts the goal of negotiating a peace agreement. Rosada noted that it is not logical to sit at a negotiation table while engaging in violent actions. This belligerent conduct will compel the state to take similar actions to counter the aggression. Any such actions by the government will be justifiable and impending because it is part of the government's constitutional mandate, Rosada concluded.
