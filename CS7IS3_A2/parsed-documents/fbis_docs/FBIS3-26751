The latest authoritative statistics show that the industrial output value of Henan, whose area accounts for merely 1.8 percent of the country's total, reached 230 billion yuan in 1993, making up four percent of the national total, ranking ninth among all 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of the Chinese mainland. Although the agricultural output value of the province in 1993 increased by 9.8 percent over the previous year's to reach 61.5 billion yuan, the proportion of agricultural output value to the total industrial and agricultural output value dropped to only a little more than 20 percent. Experts noted that by adopting the reform and opening policy, Henan Province has managed a substantial boost to its agricultural production. With a great surplus in farm produce and rural laborers, the province began a quick development of its industry, particularly rural industrial enterprises, at the end of the sixth state five-year planning period (1981-85). The province managed to increase its industrial output value to 230 billion yuan in 1993 from 30 billion yuan in 1984. During the period from 1991 to 1993, its industrial output value rose at an average rate of more than 20 percent a year. The province now ranks at least ninth in the output of 12 out of the 17 most important industrial products listed by the central government. It has become a major supplier of coal and electricity to a dozen provinces and municipalities in east and central China. In particular, the output value of the province's rural industrial enterprises rose to over 100 billion yuan in 1993 from only several billion yuan in 1984. Many villages and enterprises in the province now claim annual output values surpassing 100 million yuan each. An enterprise engaging in the production of diamond grinding materials has become the biggest of its kind in Asia. Some other enterprises are now the biggest of their kind within the country. Industrial development has also promoted the development of agriculture. Last year, the province's grain output amounted to 35 billion kilograms, 10 percent more than in the previous year, setting an all-time high.
