It was attended by representatives from the military, Interior, Foreign, Finance, and Commerce Ministries, the governor of the Bank of Thailand, and director of the National Intelligence Agency. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai presided over the meeting. General Charan Kunlawanit, secretary general of the National Security Council [NSC], said in an interview at Government House after the meeting that there was a review of the country's security from the political, economic, scientific, and environmental points of view, both domestically and externally. The meeting studied guidelines on improving intelligence gathering and making the organization more effective in serving national interests. The NSC secretary general said the situation around the country is not a security threat at present. Anyway, fighting along the border near Burma and Cambodia could affect the safety of the people there. On Cambodia, he said the continued fighting there showed that efforts by several countries to help Cambodia achieve peace did not work, and that there were still conflicts between factions in Cambodia. He said it is necessary to try to achieve a sense of unity for the Cambodian people. He believed the fighting would go on until the two Cambodian factions realize that the fighting does not contribute to the nation. Then, the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge would agree to compromise over a fair share of benefits for the sake of national development.
