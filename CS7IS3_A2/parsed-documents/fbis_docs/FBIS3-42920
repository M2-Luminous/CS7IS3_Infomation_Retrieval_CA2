According to officials, and these statements seem reliable, this is not a mass "exodus." The people who make up the Russian-speaking population of the republic today, according to Groznyy's self-assured reports, are in complete agreement with the official aim of building a sovereign Chechen state. The "loyalty" of the Russian minority in Chechnya, however, seems more comparable to the submissive acceptance of circumstances than a conscious choice. A sociological survey conducted in Groznyy in December on a semi-legal basis by researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences (a group from the academy Institute of Sociopolitical Research was driven out of Chechnya two years ago) indicated that 74 percent of the Russians, including Cossacks, wanted to leave sovereign Chechnya. After they had described the Russian Federation leadership's efforts to protect the rights of Russians in the republics of the Northern Caucasus as inadequate (an opinion expressed by 94 percent of the respondents), 73 percent of the Russians said that in spite of the obvious, in their opinion, increase in interethnic friction in the republic, they could not afford to move and to settle down in today's federation without considerable help from the government and public organizations in Russia. The recent campaign for the protection of the civil rights of the "Russian Caucasians" oppressed by Moscow officials virtually eclipsed the long petition Russians from Chechnya had sent to the Russian Federation president, chairman of the government, and heads of kray and oblast administrations. There has been no effective response yet to the petition with its 56-page supplement, citing cases in which Russians were the victims of physical assaults and harassment in 1992 and 1993 in Chechnya. Its authors are convinced, however, that the Chechen leadership's policy toward the Russian minority is intended to "drive out the Russians and Cossacks so that Russian territory can be taken over by Chechnya." Reminding the president of Russia that they were ineligible to vote in elections to the Federation Council and to participate in the discussion of the draft RF Constitution, the "former" citizens of the "former" Chechen-Ingush Republic reported that, in contrast to the Chechens living in Moscow and St. Petersburg and in Rostov, Tver, Volgograd, Novgorod, Astrakhan, and Orel oblasts, Stavropol Kray, and other regions, who are endowed with the same rights as citizens of Russia, they are not receiving wages, pensions, and benefits, were left out of the "voucherization" process, are not participating in the privatization of state property, and so forth. They were the first to be affected by the paralysis of industrial production in the republic. The "breadwinners" of Russian families--specialists--have lost their jobs. Teachers and physicians are being ousted from their position by their more fortunate Chechen colleagues (according to the sociological survey conducted by the Sociopolitical Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 55 percent of the respondents in Groznyy reported the loss of administrative or prestigious positions on ethnic grounds). Russians are the main target of criminals in Chechnya: The authors of the petition informed the Russian president that they live in "constant fear" of thefts, violence, abductions, including the kidnapping of children, forcible eviction from apartments and private homes, and the seizure of private plots and motor vehicles. Although the crime rate in the republic is so high that President Dudayev even announced a special campaign to fight crime, Russians are unlikely to enjoy stronger legal protection at the end of the Chechen campaign. Republic officials have admitted that the 80-90 felonies a week (this is the official crime statistic for Chechnya) already require military intervention. The uncertain relationship between Russia and Chechnya also precludes the protection of the Russian minority by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has not received any "instructions from above" on these matters. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA learned that the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation is still the only agency in Russia from which the Russians from Chechnya can expect advice or assistance. According to the FMS staff, the service will provide Russians with a guaranteed address of a new place of residence and employment in any part of the country. A Moscow residence permit could be difficult to obtain unless the new arrival from Chechnya has relatives in Moscow, but even this problem has a solution: According to the information of the FMS, a residence permit for the capital of Russia can be purchased. In view of the fact that the average wage of civil servants in Chechnya in dollars amounts to only 6-8 "greenbacks," however, this is a largely theoretical possibility for the Russians from Chechnya.
