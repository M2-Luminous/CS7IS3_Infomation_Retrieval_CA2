[sentence as received] The workshop was aimed to collect suggestions and opinions for the world summit for social development which is set to meet in Copenhagen in March 1995, according to UNDP officials. At the two-day meeting, the participants from Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines agreed that the post-Cold War world is still facing the two major issues -- peace and development. They held that without peace, there may be no development, while without development, peace is threatened, and for this purpose, the UN system requires a clearer mandate, integrated policy frameworks and additional resources. According to the meeting, the UNDP, in its 1994 report, has explored the new frontiers of human security in the daily life of the people. The report says that behind the blaring headlines of the world's many conflicts and emergencies, there lies a silent crisis -- a crisis of underdevelopment, of global poverty, of ever-mounting population pressure, of thoughtless degradation of environment. During the discussions, the participants said both the developing countries and developed countries are facing their own problems. For the developing nations, their top task is to develop their own economy self-reliantly in accordance with the practical situation so as to bolster the development of education, healthcare and social security sectors, they insisted. Yang Qingwei, an official from China's State Commission for Planning who participated in the workshop, said that China is facing problems similar to those of other developing countries in the human development field. Since China adopted the reform and opening policy 15 years ago, the country has achieved remarkable progress in developing its economy, which has consequently boosted the social development, Yang noted. He said China should gradually improve the internal mechanism of social development through strengthening the macro-control over its economy while pushing forward the development of the education, healthcare and social security sectors in a bid to meet the requirements of forming a market economy in the country.
