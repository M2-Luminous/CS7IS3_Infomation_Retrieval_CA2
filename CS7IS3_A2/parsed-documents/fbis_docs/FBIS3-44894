Yi also delivered President Kim Yong-sam's intention to invite Jiang to Seoul. "Chinese economy has developed remarkably because of the reform and openness policy of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Jiang," Yi said. Yi proposed to expand cooperation and technology development in automobile and electronics between the two countries. Jiang replied that he will visit Seoul if he has a chance just as he had promised with President Kim at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting in Seattle last November. Jiang said he had ordered the related ministries to take measures to boost cooperation in electronics and automobile with South Korea. On the North Korea's nuclear issue, Jiang asserted that a peaceful solution is desirable through negotiations of concerned parties.
