The trip to Rome is the first phase of the U.S. President's one-week tour of Europe. During his symbolic stay in Italy he is due to meet with the Italian leaders, including Prime Minister Berlusconi and Pope John Paul II, the leader of the world's Catholics, in Vatican. Informed politicians say Clinton is considering two issue in the visit. One is to establish closer economic and political relations with the present rulers in Italy. And the other is to reinforce the significance of the American role in the existence of contemporary Europe as well as propagating U.S. capability in aiding the European countries in solving their problems. Informed politicians believe that at the time when the presence of neofascists in the Italian cabinet has caused worries, the U.S. is trying to persuade the EU [European Union] members, excluding Italy, that it would be able to control Italy and keep away the danger of neofascists. This way, giving a bigger role to America in Europe will be propagated. After the end of the cold war era, with the potential danger of Soviet Union dying away, the EU member states, especially France and Germany, have regulated the policies based on the expansion of economic and trade cooperation among the European states. They have, however, paid little attention to the interests of the countries on the other side of the Atlantic. It seems that the continuation of such policies will undermine the role of the U.S. in dealing with the issue. Presently the U.S. is involved in a trade war with Japan and to isolate that country the U.S. seriously needs the backing of the European countries. In fact another objective of Clinton's visit to Rome, and later on to London and Paris, is to bring about coordination among the Group-7 states. But whether Clinton would be able to have the support of the European countries of Group-7 to confront the trade policies of Japan will depend on the outcome of his meetings with the leaders of France and Britain.
