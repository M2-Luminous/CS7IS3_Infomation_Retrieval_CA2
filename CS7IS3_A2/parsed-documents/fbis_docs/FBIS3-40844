Just like the influence of the major national parties is decreasing, the influence of regional parties is increasing. The Congress (I) was in a bad situation during the recent elections and lost Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The dream that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] had of emerging as a national party was broken by these elections. The influence of the communist and Marxist parties is limited to a few localities, and they are not in position to claim the rank of national parties. During the last few decades, the influence of regional parties has definitely increased. Victory of Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party in a huge state like Uttar Pradesh also points to this change. The regional parties in northeastern states have been enjoying control for a long time. According to scholars, one reason for the increased popularity of these regional parties is lack of interest by national parties in local problems. The people start supporting their local parties in order to resolve their problems. Often, unbalanced distribution of development projects also encourages regional emotions. Haryana was created because of this. At present, regional parties are leading campaigns for separate statehood for Bundhelkhand, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, and Uttrakhand. It is our country's misfortune that five decades have passed since our independence and, instead of considering ourselves Indian nationals, we call ourselves Punjabi, Rajasthani, Kashmiri, Dogri, Himachali, Malayali, and Kannada residents. The louder the discussion of conceptual unity, the harder the selfish politicians incite the emotions for statehood, casteism, and regionalism to strengthen their vote banks and obtain a position. There are many leaders in the national unity commission who want to divide India over language, caste, and religion. Background of Regional Parties: The regional parties have played an important role in politics since independence. The Election Commission divided the regional parties into two categories. Some of these are recognized parties and others are merely registered as parties. The Election Commission recognizes a party whose candidate get a certain percent of votes in an elections. If a party succeeds in getting five percent of total votes in four or five states, it is considered a national party. According to Election Commission records, there are 261 regional parties, and 30 of these are recognized parties. When a party does not receive a specific percentage of votes, the Election Commission cancels its recognized status. According to an Election Commission report, 51 parties took part in the 1952 election, however, only 20 of these did get their representatives in the House. Fifteen of these were regional parties. These included the Akali Dal, National Conference, Hindu Mahasabha, Tamil Nadu Dalit Party, Ram Rajya Parishad, Jharkhand Party, Common Wealth Party, Scheduled Castes Federation, Kisan Kamgar Party, Karantikari Samajwad Party, Lok Swaraj Sangh, Lok Paksh, Forward Block, Madras Muslim League, and Travancore and Tamil Nadu Congress. Their number went down to 13 by the second elections in 1957. They won 39 seats. These included new and small parties such as Dravida Munetra Kagzam, Congress Sudhar Simiti, Loksewa Sangh, Muslim League, and Purvi Bharat Janjati Union. In the 1962 elections, 14 small parties succeeded in sending a representative to Parliament with a total of 31 seats. The new parties among these were: Ganatantar Parishad, Republican Party, Nutan Gujrat Janata Parishad, and All India Hill Leaders Congress. The same situation prevailed during the 1967 elections. The main change was the emergence of DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] in Tamil Nadu which won 25 seats in the Lok Sabha. The DMK won the government in Tamil Nadu. The reason for the DMK popularity was the increasing approval of the anti-Hindi movement there. Anna Durai created the difference between the Aryans and Dravidians and floated the ideas of the superiority of Dravidians and atrocities committed by the Aryans. Later the DMK was split. M.G. Ramachandran rebelled against Karunanidhi's policies and founded the ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]. At present, ADMK leader Jayalalitha is ruling Tamil Nadu. It is a paradox of Indian politics that the ADMK which was established on the hatred for Aryans and Brahmans is controlled by Jayalalitha who is a Brahman herself. She is a daughter of a dancer and an actor who worked in the Mysore royal court. The people have complained about Telangana and royal limits that the Nizam and the Andhra rulers had always ignored their progress. In 1971, the Telangana movement became aggressive and created a new regional party called the Telangana Praja Simiti which won 10 seats in 1971. It got 14.43 percent votes in that election. There was a polarization in Assam also. The new regional party, the All India Hill Leaders Conference, ran for elections and won one seat. Three other regional parties--Peoples Democratic Party, Plain Tribal Council, and Hill State Peoples Democratic Party--did participate in the election, however, all their candidates lost their election deposits. The Vishal Haryana Party led by Rao Vir Bhadar Singh participated in the elections and won three seats. The All India Arya Sabha participated in the Haryana elections, however, its candidates lost. The Kerala Muslim League and Kerala Congress ran for elections in Kerala. Both parties won two seats each. The Akali Party ran for elections in Punjab. It pitted its candidates at twelve seats, of which 11 lost. In Maharashtra, the Republican Party of India (Gaekwad) won one seat with Congress Party's support. The Republican Party of India (Khobergade) also ran for elections, however, all of its 15 candidates lost. The Shiv Sena ran for elections over the question of Hinduism and lost election deposits in 3 of the 5 seats. In West Bengal, three regional parties--Bangla Congress, RSPSP [expansion not given], and the Muslim League--each won one seat. The Sanyukta Govan, the Lokpaksh, and Maharashtra Gomantak Party emerged in Goa. The Maharashtra Gomantak Party won the majority there under the leadership of Mr. Dayanand Bandodkar. The DMK was badly shaken in the 1977 election. It lost 24 out of its 25 Lok Sabha seats. The ADMK emerged as a new force and won 19 Lok Sabha seats. The Kerala Congress was divided into two groups. The Manipur Peoples Party established government in Manipur. The Ramrajya Parished was totally wiped out. Thus, 22 regional parties ran for elections in 135 constituencies and 13 of these parties won 52 seats. The Election Commission issued registered symbols to 27 regional parties in the 1980 elections. Among these Kuki National Assembly (Manipur), Peoples Congress (Mizoram), Sikkim Congress, Tripura Upjati Yuva Morcha, Sikkim Janata Party, and Telagu Desam were the parties. In 1984, the Telagu Desam emerged as a major opposition party in the Lok Sabha with 29 seats. The other parties remained in the same position. The Andhra Pradesh government moved to the Congress Party from Telagu Desam in 1987. In Punjab, the Akali Dal formed government under the leadership of Mr. Surjit Singh Barnala. The hurricane led by Chowdhery Devi Lal in Haryana wiped out the Congress there. The Congress (I) took back the government in Haryana in 1990. The Telagu Desam is preparing to win the government in Andhra Pradesh again. Orissa's chief minister, Biju Patnayak, seeing the weak condition of the Janata Party is organizing a small regional party called Utkal Janata there. The Akali Dal in Punjab is divided in to 16 groups. Recently the Langowal group and the Talwandi group have merged. The Akalis have learned from their experience in the past that they won whenever they collaborated with the Jan Sangh. Perhaps, that is why the Akali leader Prakash Singh Badal had strongly endorsed the Bharatiya Janata Party during the recent elections. He has also contributed to Bhairon Singh Shekhawat's winning the government in Rajasthan. If these two parties form a coalition in Punjab, the Congress (I) will be in grave danger there. As for Haryana, three years ago when Bansi Lal had formed the Haryana Vikas Party, it appeared the he was going to win the election. However, the people in Haryana supported the Congress (I) in his stead and elected Bhajan Lal to the government. Chief Minister Bhajan Lal and his administration helped Chautala to defeat Randip Singh, son of the dissident leader Shamsher Singh Surjewala, in the bye-election in Narvana. Bansi Lal collaborated with the BJP, however, their joint candidate could not even salvage his election deposit. They could not help the BJP candidate win in the Kalka bye-election. Later, his party was divided thanks to Bhajan Lal who moved several of their legislators and the lone Lok Sabha member to his side. There is not doubt that the Bhajan Lal government in Haryana is on shaky ground now. The Congress (I) did not fulfill the promises it made to the people. Because of the disorganization in electricity supply, the state is losing 2.5 billion rupees. There is a major outcry in southern Haryana because of scarcity of water. The people are cursing the day when they voted for the Congress (I). If Bhajan Lal fails in doing a miracle, the Congress (I) definitely will be wiped out in the next election. The people in the state are leaning toward Uncle Chautala again. The number of people attending his public rallies is increasing. The Samajwadi Janata Dal is becoming regional in nature now. Bangarappa Forms the Congress Party: Until now, it was believed that the Congress (I) was very strong in south India. However, this situation changed when Bangarappa, the former Karnataka chief minister, rebelled. He has spoiled Congress (I) high command's sleep by forming a new regional party, the Karnataka Congress. Bangarappa was expelled from the Congress (I) once before, however, political contingencies forced the party to take him back. Bangarappa is very popular among the Dalits and backwards in the state. There is no doubt that his government was notorious for corruption, unfortunately however, corruption has become an integral party of our country's lifestyle, and the voters do not pay much attention to it. Bangarappa joined the politics in 1962 as a disciple of Dr. Lohia. Later, he changed parties depending on which way the wind blew, and enjoyed the fruits of being in government. Being from the Lohia school, he is hard working and aggressive. His fracas with his party leaders are common. Most of the Lohia disciples are very liberal about their eating habits. They do not care much for their clothes either. Bangarappa is different from them in this area. He likes to wear spotless white clothes and plays badminton. He also likes to jog. He used to jog for three kilometers daily even when he was the chief minister. He rebelled from the Join Socialist Party in 1963 and joined the revolutionary group of the that party. In 1977, Dev Raj Urs brought him into the Congress Party. They did not stay together for long. In 1979, when Urs broke up with Indira Gandhi and established Congress Urs, Indira Gandhi had Bangarappa run against him to diminish his influence. He could not get along with Indira Gandhi either. In 1982, he established a new party named Karantiranga with Dev Raj Urs in Karnataka and won the elections by collaborating with the Janata Party. He disagreed with the leadership later over the question of appointing the chief minister. He resigned from the Karantiranga and joined the Congress Party. He became the opposition leader. In 1989, the Janta Dal lost the government and he become the chief minister of Karnataka. Rajesh Pilot, Sita Ram Kesari, and Buta Singh played a major role in getting him into the government. Soon after he became the chief minister, the Congress (I) legislators began to rebel against him. Activities of the dissidents increased under the leadership of Veerappa Moily. Reportedly Narasimha Rao had encouraged the dissidents. Kerala's Chief Minister Karunakaran also wanted his favorite person as the chief minister of Karnataka. Bangarappa openly opposed the prime minister in the Kaveri water dispute. This led to increase in the tension between the two. The dissidents accused Bangarappa of the serious crime of amassing billions of rupees illegally. It is said that Bangarappa, in order to get the prime minister's support, tried to get his son Prabhakar Rao to his side. The prime minister endorsed him in the beginning, however, when the campaign against Bangarappa in the newspapers became very strong, the Congress (I) high command had to remove him. Veerappa Moily was his successor. In the budget session of the vidhan sabha, Bangarappa levied some serious accusations against the government of his own party. In response, Moily assigned the Classic Computer fraud case to the CBI to trap Bangarappa. The CBI searched Bangarappa's house also and this made Bangarappa angry. He blamed the prime minister for the recent defeat of the Congress (I) in northern India. He also accused that Narasimha Rao was playing into the hands of the BJP, and that he failed to protect the Babri Masjid. He called Narasimha Rao a scorpion. He was expelled from the Congress (I) because of it.
