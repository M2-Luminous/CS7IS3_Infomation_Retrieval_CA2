Gen. Abacha said this at the opening of bilateral talks between Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The delegationfrom Sierra Leone is led by the country's head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser. Statehouse correspondent, Chris Mbu, reports on the meeting: [Begin recording] [Mbu] General Abacha said that ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is now passing through a critical stage of its operations but, (?as he says), peace and stability is being restored in Liberia on the basis of the Cotonou Peace Accord. Gen. Abacha pleaded with West African countries to come together and put pressure on the warring groups in the Liberian crisis to make them understand the need for peace in Liberia. He said that time had come for the sacrifices being made by countries involved in the ECOMOG operations to be justified by way of lasting peace in Liberia. The head of state then called for support for efforts coming from outside Africa in aid of ECOMOG operations in Liberia, citing the United Nations efforts as example. [Abacha] The interest that is being shown by the United Nations is something which is very, very positive and it has got to be encouraged. Countries that [word indistinct] not only in the subregion, but also in particular in Liberia wish to cooperate to ensure the success of the accord. [Mbu] Gen. Abacha then assured Capt. Strasser of Nigeria's willingness to continue assisting the Sierra Leone which, he said, has been experiencing some destabilizing fallout from the Liberian crisis. The Sierra Leone shares borders with Liberia. On the issue of ties between the two countries, he said that Nigeria and the Sierra Leone will explore ways of widening the scope and strengthening existing relations. The Sierra Leonean head of state, Capt. Strasser, reacting to some of the issues raised by Gen. Abacha, expressed concern that seven months after the Cotonou Peace Accord, as he put it, no major advancement has been made towards lasting peace in Liberia. He said that in Sierra Leone, questions are now being raised about the sense in deploying national resources for ECOMOG operations when Sierra Leone is faced with what he referred to as serious security problems. All that notwithstanding, he assured Gen. Abacha that the Sierra Leone will continue to maintain its presence in the ECOMOG but with Nigeria assisting in tackling the country's security problems. Delegations of the two countries later went into a closed-door session. The Sierra Leonean head of state who flew into Abuja morning has since left for home. [end recording]
