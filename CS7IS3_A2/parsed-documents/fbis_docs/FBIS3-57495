As was expected, the meeting was held behind closed doors. Boris Fedorov left the president just 15 minutes later. Some 30 minutes after that, Boris Fedorov gave an exclusive interview to IZVESTIYA and INTERFAX correspondents. But first of all he suggested that we study the statement he had formulated as soon as he arrived back from the Kremlin. "My position (refusal to join the government) has nothing to do with personal reasons," the document says. "It cannot be right to include in the cabinet or to retain in their previous jobs people who have caused colossal economic and political damage to the state, people who are the main and overt opponents of the reforms policy. I cannot agree with the policy turnaround which was recently formulated by the premier and is being implemented in practice. This includes the refusal to combat inflation; the intention to increase emission by at least 60 percent in relation to the plan in the first quarter alone; and the predominance in the cabinet of the lifeless and ignorant ideology of the State Planning Committee and the red economic managers. `Ukrainianization' has crossed the Russian border. "At the same time it is still not too late to halt the slide. I appeal to the president: Boris Nikolayevich! An economic coup is taking place in the country, a backward slide, you are our only hope. The issue here is not just Fedorov, who is always ready to return and fight for Russian interests to the bitter end; the issue is the future of the country which is being decided right now, as we speak. At the same time nobody, I hope, has any illusions that the economy is separate from politics." [Kononenko] Boris Grigoryevich, how did your meeting with the president go? [Fedorov] The president confirmed his offer of the post of finance minister, saying that he trusts me and has no complaints about my performance, and stressing that the formation of a government is a lengthy process and nobody in the government lasts forever, including Gerashchenko. But since the terms for joining the government were the same as before, I refused, saying that I could not work with political enemies. [Kononenko] Who do you mean? [Fedorov] Gerashchenko primarily. I am not particularly concerned about Zaveryukha. He is just the kolkhoz lobby's spokesman. The main reason for my refusing a portfolio in the government as it presently stands is that I did not have sufficient powers to implement my financial policy. The president disagreed with my arguments, saying: "Do not drift away." I do not intend to drift away. I will not leave the country. I will work in the State Duma. [Kononenko] What is your opinion -- why did the expected compromise over your appointment not materialize? [Fedorov] As premier, V. Chernomyrdin is entitled to form his team. And all the indications are that the president has not foisted his will on him. I have not spoken with the premier since last Saturday [22 January]. [Kononenko] So V. Chernomyrdin needs V. Gerashchenko more than he needs B. Fedorov? [Fedorov] It would seem so. And this shows that an economic coup is taking place in the country. [Kononenko] In your view, where is all this leading? [Fedorov] All government statements forecast inflation. This will mean a fall in the population's living standards. At a time when such enormous rates of inflation are already being forecast, there is no way production will pick up. Without a doubt, isolationism will gather strength and attempts to peg the ruble exchange rate to other foreign currencies will get nowhere. The present government has far fewer administrative levers that former Premier Ryzhkov had at his disposal. We will see the bitter fruits for real in May or June, and social tension will increase sharply by the fall. [Kononenko] Is it possible that V. Shcherbakov will fill the finance minister's post? [Fedorov] I believe this will be ruled out since he is not a financier. He does not have his own program. I think they will opt for the gentler scenario of appointing S. Dubinin, my first deputy. If I am elected to any organ in the State Duma, I will work there, but generally speaking we need a "shadow cabinet of ministers" which will monitor the government's actions and put forward its own ideas for resolving state problems. Of course, the economy cannot be extricated from crisis by financial policy alone, long-term work in other spheres also needs to be done. But in order for this to happen, we need a new Cabinet of Ministers since the present government is amorphous and has been unable to refrain from ruining the budget, B. Fedorov stressed in conclusion.
