Of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the general indexes of 14 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, were higher than 121 points. The growth rate of the national general index was 10 percent, and those of Anhui and other seven provinces and municipalities ranged from 30 to 11 percent, higher than the national level. Development in the five major spheres of population, economy, health and medical care, social insurance, and public security was in the lead. Development in three other major spheres, namely science, technology, and education; environment; and culture and sports was lagging behind. A negative growth appeared in the development in the sphere of labor, showing a marked imbalance. The second issue of our magazine in 1992 carried a report entitled "An Effective Move To Promote Social Progress" in which the results of comprehensive appraisal of social development in various localities of China was announced for the first time. The report evoked nationwide concerns and strong repercussions. Now one year has passed. What was the comprehensive level of China's social development in 1992? Had it increased or decreased? Was the development in the 10 major spheres of social life balanced or imbalanced? With these questions in mind, this reporter visited the Social Department of the State Statistical Bureau some days ago and learned that the results of comprehensive appraisal of social development of various localities in 1992 had already come out and there were many new and fresh changes. Wu Jun, director of the Social Department of the State Statistical Bureau, told this reporter that in 1992 the trend of healthy development continued in the general level of China's social development. According to more than 130 indexes in the 10 major spheres -- environment, population, economy, residents' life, labor, social insurance, health and medical care, science and technology and education, culture and sports, and public security, the general index of the comprehensive level of social development in 1992 was 121 points, which was 10 percent higher than that of 1991, or 11 points higher. This fact shows that China's social progress was not divorced from the high-rate economic growth. This is indeed a gratifying fact. Order of General Indexes of 14 Provinces and Municipalities in the Lead Has Changed The 14 localities whose general indexes were higher than 121 points, the national average, were: Beijing (189), Shanghai (179), Tianjin (170), Liaoning (156), Jilin (148), Guangdong (142), Jiangsu (140), Heilongjiang (136), Zhejiang (134), Shandong (133), Fujian (129), Hainan (125), Hebei (122), and Shanxi (122). Those whose general indexes were similar to the national average were: Inner Mongolia (121) and Xinjiang (120). The general indexes of the other 13 provinces and autonomous regions, except for Taiwan and Tibet, whose statistical figures were insufficient for the calculation, were lower than the national average. Compared with the results of the 1991 appraisal, the order of provinces and municipalities whose general indexes were higher than the national average also changed. Of them, Jilin rose from sixth to fifth place, Guangdong rose from seventh to sixth, Heilongjiang rose from 10th to eighth, Fujian rose from 12th to 11th, and Shanxi rose from 14th to 13th, while Jiangsu dropped from fifth to seventh, Shandong from eighth to 10th, and Hainan from 11th to 12th. Zhejiang and Hebei remained in their original places, ninth and 13th. The changes show that there has been a trend of each trying to overtake the other in striving for social progress, economic growth, and harmonious development of the locality, just like "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing his or her special powers." Anhui, Qinghai, and Guizhou Have Roused Themselves To Catch Up Most of the 14 provinces and municipalities whose general indexes were higher than the national average are in the eastern regions, especially the coastal areas. Benefiting from their faster pace of reform and opening up and from their superior economic and geographical positions, as well as their historical and human resources, they are making great efforts to promote comprehensive social progress in their respective localities with the help of the high-rate economic growth. What attracts people's attention is that in 1992 the nation's general index of social development increased by 10 percentage points and those of eight provinces and regions were higher than this. Most of them were localities lagging behind in 1991. Of them, the general index of Anhui grew 30 percent, those of Guizhou and Qinghai grew 23 percent, that of Inner Mongolia grew 15 percent, those of Gansu and Ningxia grew 14 percent, that of Hubei grew 12 percent, and those of Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi rose 11 percent. Compared with the figures published in 1991, we can see that the general indexes of Anhui, Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Jiangxi were all among the last 20 in the previous year. It is indeed great news that these localities have been promoting social progress at a rate much higher than the national average. The development rates of Anhui, Guizhou, and Qinghai are particularly outstanding. The three provinces can be called the three "dark horses" in China's social development in 1992. Development in the Five Major Spheres of Population, Economy, Health and Medical Care, Social Insurance, and Public Security Was in the Lead According to the figures promulgated by the State Statistics Bureau, the level of development in the 10 major spheres of social life in China were fairly high in 1992. The respective indexes for the 10 major spheres are as follows: Environment (12); population (13); economy (17); residents' life (13); labor (12); social insurance (11); health and medical care (11); science, technology, and education (13); culture and sports (10); and public security (11). Compared with the figures of 1991, the development in five major spheres was more attractive in 1992, with indexes growing by more than 10 percent: The growth rate of the population index (comprising 12 specific indexes including the birth rate and the average life expectancy) reached 24 percent, showing a marked improvement in various profiles of China's population quality. The growth rate of the Central Committee index (comprising 17 specific indexes including the GNP and the social labor productivity) was 20 percent, showing a high economic growth rate for the year. The growth rate of the index of health and medical care (comprising 11 specific indexes including health expenses and the rate of acute infectious diseases) was 15 percent, reflecting a considerably big progress in China's health and medical work in that year. The growth rate of the index of social insurance (comprising 13 specific indexes including labor protection and welfare expenses for workers and retired personnel on a per capita basis) was 14 percent, showing an increase, rather than a decrease, in China's social insurance level while developing the economy. The growth rate of public security index (comprising 14 specific indexes including the number of cases concerning public security investigated and handled on a "per 10 thousand people" basis) was 11 percent, reflecting progress in China's public security situation. In 1991, of the 10 major spheres, population, culture and sports, and public security were not developing satisfactorily. Through our efforts in the following year, development in the spheres of population and public security was promoted, but the development in the sphere of culture and sports was still lagging. Development in Spheres of Science, Technology, Education and Environment Was Unsatisfactory, Negative Growth Appeared in the Sphere of Labor In 1991 the development in the spheres of environment, science and technology and education, economy, and residents' life was in the lead. One year later, development in the spheres of environment and science and technology and education slowed down, but the spheres of economy and residents' life continued to develop steadily. The growth rate of the index of environment was 3 percent and that of the index of science, technology, and education was only 1 percent, much lower than the high growth rate of the economic index of the same year, which was 20 percent. As environment, science and technology, and education have an important bearing on the momentum for the long-term economic and social development of a country, the lagging in these spheres should arouse our serious attention. Another striking contrast to the high economic growth was the index of the sphere of labor. It comprises 12 specific indexes including the unemployment rate in cities and towns. In 1992, the growth rate of this index was -5 percent. This shows that some unexpected factors had appeared in the sphere of social labor in China's towns and country, such as social employment and safety in labor. At a time when the economic structure was being changed, the industrial structure was being readjusted, and the economy was developing at a high speed, the appearance of such phenomena is understandable. But it should not be neglected either. In the 10 Major Spheres, Beijing and Shanghai Were in the Lead, and Gansu and Liaoning Were Unexpected Winners Classified according to different categories and regions, Beijing was first in the spheres of environment, residents' life, labor, social insurance, and culture and sports. Shanghai was the first in the spheres of economy, health and medical care, and science, technology, and education. This is nothing unexpected. The two municipalities achieved high scores in many spheres in 1991 and were able to maintain the high scores in 1992. But Gansu and Liaoning were unexpected. The former was the first in the sphere of public security while the latter the first in the sphere of population. If we make a comparison with 1991 figures, we find many significant changes. Some localities rose in certain spheres and dropped in others. For example, in the sphere of environment, Jiangsu rose from sixth to second place, Tianjin rose from 16th to third, Guangdong rose from 10th to fourth, and Zhejiang rose from eighth to fifth. But Shandong dropped from the second place to below 10th, Shanghai dropped from third to eighth, Liaoning from fifth to ninth, and Jilin from fourth to sixth. This shows that the positions of various localities in the 10 major spheres are changing and all can achieve greater progress through their efforts. It is very difficult for the localities whose general indexes are in the lead to take the lead in all the 10 major spheres. It is also difficult for a locality to maintain the leading position in a certain sphere year by year, because many other localities are trying to catch up. After the result of the comprehensive appraisal of social development was promulgated, many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions found their own weak links and increased input in these links. They are doubling their efforts to strive for greater progress. We can find such traces from the 1992 appraisal report. What merits our attention is that in some localities where the economy has been growing continuously at a high rate, the index of development in the sphere of public security is lagging. This has something to do with the large floating population in these areas and the insufficient input in this field. The experience of other countries proves that population flow is a big motive force for economic development. But while providing labor for those localities and promoting economic development there, the floating population has also brought security problems with them. However, after the economy is well developed, these localities will be able to increase input in this field and social security will be maintained. This is common knowledge. Wu Jun, director of the Social Department of the State Statistical Bureau, said: In the overall plan, the statistical indexes used in the recent calculation, except for some minor readjustments, are the same as those used in 1991, so that people can easily make comparisons and find out changes. This work will be continued, because a statistical plan can show its value only through a period of practice. Moreover, time is the only criterion for examining the plan, to see whether it is realistic, effective, and correct. The director continued: The general level of social development in a locality is a result of the long-term interaction of various factors, including historical, natural, geographical, and realistic factors. It cannot be entirely changed in a short period of time. Therefore, if the comprehensive appraisal is used to obtain information for comparison -- a self-comparison and comparison with others, it is certainly useful. But if it is used to compare with one another in position, it will lose its meaning, because there are many incomparable factors in various localities. The more than 130 indexes for appraisal and the general plan are not entirely perfect. They will be improved in the future. But they must also be relatively stable. If they are changed willfully at any time, they will lose their scientific value. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1: General Indexes of Social
