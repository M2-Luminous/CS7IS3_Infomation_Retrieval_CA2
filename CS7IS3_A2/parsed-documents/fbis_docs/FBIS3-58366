Foreign Ministry sources said today that waters 4-5 km west to the Thasos island are not among the disputed regions between the two countries. The Greek Government had announced that it might carry out further drilling activities in the Aegean if the current explorations yield a positive result. Turkey is closely following these activities so that they are not expanded to the disputed areas determined in the Bern Agreement of 1976 on the two countries' continental shelf. Under the Bern Agreement both countries had ended their explorations in disputed waters of the Aegean. Athens had filed a complaint before the International Court of Justice in the Hague and the U.N. Security Council against Turkey which began exploring oil in the Aegean, after Greece. As Greece sought the approval of these bodies to declare the Aegean as a Greek sea, the International Court of Justice had, in 1976, called on for a Turkish-Greek dialogue to resolve the matter. Turkish and Greek officials which came together in November 1976 had taken conciliating steps in resolving the continental shelf matter. The continental shelf issue was aggravated by the new PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government of Greece in 1981 and Premier Andreas Papandreou has ended the talks.
