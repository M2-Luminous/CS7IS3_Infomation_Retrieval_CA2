FBIS3-50325 "dreeu018__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Czech Responses to Minority Demands Noted AU2701113994 Prague CTK in English 1141 GMT 26 Jan 94 AU2701113994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- An article in the independent daily SME looks at letters sent by various Czech ministries in reply to a petition by the Association of Czechs in Slovakia (SCS), and comments that most of the SCS's demands are unrealistic. The SCS petition was adopted at the SCS constituent meeting held on December 4, 1993. The Czech Interior Ministry replied that Czech law does not allow dual citizenship and that it does not stand a chance of being amended in the foreseeable future. Making an exemption for older people would create an unwelcome precedent, the ministry says. The Czech Ministry for State Property Administration and Privatization replied that those Czechs who are permanently resident in Slovakia are not allowed to take part in voucher privatization, but they can purchase privatized property if they wish so. A demand for Czech culture centers in places with large Czech minorities will have to be postponed until after the launching of the Bratislava center, and this will only open when a suitable space to house it is found, the Czech Culture Ministry replied. Other centers will open in Kosice and Presov, both east Slovakia, and Zilina, central Slovakia. The government Radio and Television Council says that the use of long-wave radio broadcasting, heard across Slovakia, will continue to be granted. As for Czech TV, the Council is considering a license for satellite broadcasting as ground-based TV stations do not reach Slovakia. The Czech Health Ministry, citing the law, says that Czech Slovaks are not eligible for Czech health insurance. The Transport Ministry says that reduced railway fees for old-age pensioners cannot be extended to another state's citizens as no reciprocal agreement has been signed with Slovakia, and as for reduced urban transport fees, this lies within the competence of local government. The Czech Education Ministry says, however, that Czechs wishing to study in the Czech Republic are exempt from school fees, SME writes.
