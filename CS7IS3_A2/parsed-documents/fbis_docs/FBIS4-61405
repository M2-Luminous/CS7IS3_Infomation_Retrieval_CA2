We must see that they bring sprouts of revitalisation and not new sufferings to the country," First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets told the newspaper "ROSSIA". His interview is published in today's issue of the daily. Soskovets said that the government had begun to determine what projects should be supported from the budget. It was decided to render government support to the coal industry. It is to get from the budget 3.4 trillion roubles in the first six months of this year. A decision was also adopted to settle in the first quarter of this year the mutual debts of several enterprises of the defence industry, the agro-industrial sector, and the fuel and energy complex. Quotas were fixed for the export of strategic raw materials, as well as customs duties for imported goods. A list of federal programmes that are to be financed from the budget this year was drawn up. All but ready are proposals to effect state control over railway fares and over the cost of electric and thermal energy. "Not all the measures can be regarded as 100 per cent market oriented, but the government is compelled to take them," Soskovets stresses. "In spite of some successes, the economic situation remains unstable," he notes. "Crisis phenomena were not stemmed last year. The situation in the first quarter of this year is characterised by the continuing industrial slump, shrinking capital investments, accompanied by the growth of prices for factory-made products and consumer goods." "The steps taken by the government are still not yielding the expected results," Soskovets states. At the same time, he stresses that "market relations are gaining strength in the Russian economy and measures are being taken to reduce the social burden of the transition period. Steps were taken to curb the inflation. The process of privatisation is proceeding quite dynamically. The non- state sector of economy is gaining momentum. The investment decline was slowed down. The consumer market is being restored. The country's foreign trade balance is favourable."
