This was revealed in a poll conducted by the Inter/View office on behalf of ANP Press Agency and Nova. The figures indicate that both parties would attract exactly the same number of voters, i.e., 21.2 percent, which would give them 33 seats each. Inter/View gave the CDA more of a chance than NIPO [Netherlands Institute for Public Opinion Polls], which forecast the day before yesterday that the Christian Democrats would get only 28 seats. Inter/View says that the divergent results reflect the offices' different polling methods. CDA leader Brinkman was happy with the figures published by Inter/View: "A 10 percent gain in one day, that is what I call an advance," he said during an electoral meeting in Assen yesterday. On that occasion, he criticized his colleagues Wim Kok (PvdA) and Bolkestein (VVD -- People's Party for Freedom and Democracy). Last weekend, the latter expressed their intention to govern with the D66 [Democrats 66] after the elections. A third party, necessary for a parliamentary majority, could then join them. Brinkman says: "I am not going to form a cabinet right now. Let us first wait for the voters' verdict." Lower Chamber President Deetman (CDA) also criticized the present coalition partner, PvdA. Deetman agrees with Prime Minister Lubbers, who blamed the PvdA last week for making a "turn to the left." Deetman discerned the PvdA's more left-wing orientation from statements by PvdA leader Kok. Together with the D66, the latter wants to see to it that left-wing ministers are in the majority in a new cabinet. Yesterday night in Assen, the Chamber president cautioned his fellow party members for a progressive policy. "Social security will fall apart then because, instead of changing the system, all hopes will be placed on better times." Deetman also fears that a cabinet where the "left" will be in the majority will not cut the budget deficit sufficiently, which in his view will be detrimental for employment.
