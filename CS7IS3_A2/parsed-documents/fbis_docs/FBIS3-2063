A regulation that went into effect on Wednesday tightened the regulation of computer systems. It was the country's first regulation pertaining to computer security. Incomplete statistics show that over 500,000 computer information networkers have been installed nationwide in businesses, schools and research institutions. And the number is growing rapidly. But network security is lax and problems abound. Computer crimes have been reported and such cases are increasing, said Lu Xiaobin, an official with the Computer Management and Supervision Department. He refused to give details, but said one case involved 14 million yuan ($1.6 million). Computer viruses are also a serious problem. It was reported that 70 to 80 percent of computers in 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have been hit by infections. According to the regulation, anyone found putting viruses into a network can face fines up to 5,000 yuan ($575).
