In an interview with ITAR-TASS Poltoranin said that the prolongation of the powers of power structures can be discussed on condition that certain guarantees are fulfilled and important problems faced by the Russian people are resolved. Poltoranin reminded of the fact that before the agreement on civic accord was signed, he had addressed lawmakers of the State Duma, suggesting that this agreement be supplemented by commitments made by each branch of power for a concrete period of time. In his opinion, this agreement should include a concrete plan of actions of power structures for the second half of 1994, the entire 1995 and the first half of 1996. Trade unions might have pledged to refrain from strikes during this period, Poltoranin said. The public chamber might assume control over the fulfillment of commitments, including the dismissal of the branch of power which fails to fulfill its commitments. On the other hand, if the economic and social situation stabilises by the middle of 1996, he problem of crime in Russia is resolved and the necessary legislative basis created, the public chamber might initiate the prolongation of the powers of the president, the government and the parliament, since "enough is as good as a feast," as the saying goes, Poltoranin said. Poltoranin believes that a congress of social forces might be convened which would appeal to Russians to hold a referendum which would be a legitimate basis for the prolongation of powers. Having noted that this idea was never realised, Poltoranin added that "being in high posts without making commitments and being detached from Russia's public and social life is, at least, strange."
