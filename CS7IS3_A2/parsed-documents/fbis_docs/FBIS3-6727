We cannot accept it." He then pointed out: "Independent efforts by the private companies are necessary. Even if we decide not to accept it, the United States will accept our decision in its own way." As for the fact that Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, criticized the stand of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], which demands that private industry draw up independent plans, the minister of international trade and industry said, "The government is not in the position of giving compulsory guidance to private industry."
