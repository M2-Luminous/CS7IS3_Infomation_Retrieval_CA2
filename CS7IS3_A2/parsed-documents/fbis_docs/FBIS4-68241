Pryshchepa, instructor at the Department of Air Force Tactics at Chernihiv VVAUL [higher military aviation school for pilots], under the rubric "Reaction": "The L-39 Will Yet Prove Useful. Concerning Some Problems in Training Military Pilots"] [Text] In articles devoted to issues associated with the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, NARODNA ARMIYA has often dealt with the urgent problem of flight personnel training. In particular, the article "How To Train Military Pilots," published on 9 December 1993, focused on the need to create a method system of instruction for students in military educational institution [vnz] and of additional training for officers and on the need to develop training and combat-training airplanes for this purpose. Continuing the discussion on this subject, an experienced professional offers an opportune suggestion. We know that frontline aviation and the aviation of the Air Defense Forces [PPO] are currently in a very difficult situation due to the economic crisis in which our Ukraine now finds herself. Command headquarters is doing everything it can to make it possible for pilots to fly, but, unfortunately, it has very limited supplies of materials and equipment, fuel and lubricants, and its ability to replace aviation equipment is also limited. Nonetheless, there is a solution. During this severe economic crisis, I propose using a new system requiring only modest expenditures for training young pilots for our Air Force and Air Defense Forces. The point of this system is to enable all flight school graduates to complete the new program in one and one-half to two years and attain the level of first-class grade using the L-39 training airplane. There are many of these planes in Ukraine, and the available number of them makes it possible to use them for this purpose for the next few years. The fact that these planes use small amounts of fuel will allow each pilot to accumulate from 80 to 100 flight hours per year. In order to accomplish this purpose, a center for training fighter pilots first class, bomber pilots first class, and navigators first class could be created at the existing Chernihiv VVAUL, for example. The school offers a material base and a trained staff of pilots. The most important elements in fighter pilot training are aerobatic flying [vyshchyy pilotazh], air combat with fighter airplanes, attacking ground targets involving simple and complex maneuvers, and flying by day and by night in clouds in poor weather. Can pilots not be taught all this at low cost on the L-39's? Later, a pilot trained to this degree can be retrained at an already existing base (the same Chernihiv base) on a fighter plane with an additional 15-20 hours for pilot training and combat use of the new sighting mechanism, and the best of them can also be trained to serve as instructors. There will be those who will say that the L-39 is not a MIG-20 nor a SU-25. I agree. But where are we to get the money to train pilots to achieve the rank of airman first class and and airman second class on the MIG-29, which burns as much fuel in one flight as the L-39 during an entire flight shift? I am also relying on my own experience. I received my basic training on the MIG-21 BIS. I retrained on MIG-23's of almost all modifications, the MIG-29, and the SU-17MC without any difficulty and in a short period of time. I regard myself as a pilot with average skills, the kind that make up the majority in Ukraine and the world over. Even a three-year interval during which I did not fly while studying at the academy did not result in the loss of the skills I had acquired earlier. A young officer coming to a unit after training in such a center will not be merely "personnel" ["shtatna odynytsya"]; he will be "combat personnel" ["boyova odynytsya"]. He will need only 25-30 hours of training on a combat airplane per year to retain his form and 20-30 hours on the same L-39. I see no better solution in the present difficult situation.
