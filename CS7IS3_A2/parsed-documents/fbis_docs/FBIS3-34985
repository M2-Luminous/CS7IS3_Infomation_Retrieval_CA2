He told MENA that the first problem concerns the scope, power, and frequencies of transmission. A solution is left to the current negotiations in Taba, he said, hoping that positive results will be achieved in the talks. The second problem, Abu-'Ayyash said, is securing the finance needed to put studies into practice. He said the third problem is the financing of educational and other films and programs with which the television is scheduled to begin its transmission. [passage omitted] Abu-'Ayyash said that many studios are being set up in the occupied territories. The Germans have begun building a radio studio for training, France will provide a television studio with a grant, and Britain will do the same, he said. These donations, he explained, constitute what we call "the basis of Palestinian radio and television." The Palestinian official said that many issues relating to radio and television transmission are being discussed in Taba within the work of the Civilian Affairs Committee. Abu-'Ayyash said Israel understands the pressing need for Palestinian television. The translation of this understanding into something tangible is being discussed, he said. On the budget of the Palestinian radio and television authority, Abu-'Ayyash said he conducted studies on establishing a modern television. The proposed budget, he said, ranges from $30-50 million. He said donations from the European Union amounted to $6 million. He said he will make a Gulf tour after Ramadan to continue discussing donations with some Gulf states like Qatar and others. Asked if radio and television transmission will be confined to Gaza and Jericho or will extend to all occupied Palestinian territories, Abu-'Ayyash said: When we discuss communications, we speak about the Palestinian people and Palestinians everywhere. Communications are not confined to Gaza and Jericho; we want to spread out throughout Palestine first, the world second. This is the aim of communications.
