FBIS4-29066 "dreas115_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 North Korea Radio on Notification to U.S. Radio on Notification to U.S. SK1506122994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1104 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1506122994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1104 GMT 15 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] In connection with the decision of the DPRK Government to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam notified on 13 June U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the trustee of the agency's ratification treaty, of this in accordance with Clause D of Article 18 of IAEA regulations. The letter of notification was correctly conveyed to the U.S. permanent mission at the United Nations through the permanent mission of the DPRK at the United Nations on 13 June. In this connection, the DPRK Government has completed all legal procedures related to its withdrawal from the IAEA. The content of the letter of notification about the withdrawal follows: I recall to mind: By adopting an unjust resolution of imposing sanctions on us through the convocation of the Board of Governors on 10 June 1994, the Secretariat of the IAEA has endangered the highest interest of our country; has gravely infringed upon the country's sovereignty and dignity; and has created a situation in which the normal relations between us and the IAEA can no longer be maintained. In a unique status in which we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the more inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards we have undergone with good will and the more (?contacts) we have made with the agency's Secretariat, the more serious the question has become, far from being resolved. This is a serious lesson and a conclusion that we have reached while undergoing the agency's inspections up to now. All the facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat does not desire an aboveboard resolution of the nuclear issue, but is pursuing its impure political purpose of crushing [apsal] us under the pretext of inspections. The agency's Secretariat has again adopted an unjust resolution in spite of our strong opposition and warning. In this connection, as authorized, I notify the U.S. Government, the trustee country, through you, of the fact that the DPRK Government decided to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June 1994, in accordance with Clause D of Article 18 of the agency's regulations.
