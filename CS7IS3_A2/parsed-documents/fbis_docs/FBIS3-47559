Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said at a press conference, "there remains a gap and both sides have to make efforts to bridge the gap." Subcabinet-level trade officials of the two countries began talks Wednesday on auto trade, a priority sector in the bilateral framework trade negotiations agreed to last July. Okamatsu said he will continue talks with his U.S. counterpart Jeffrey Garten until Saturday and will then have another meeting with him late next week in Washington. The vice trade ministers of the two countries will also discuss the issue again on January 24 and 25 in Washington and on February 3 to 5 in Tokyo, Okamatsu said. It is necessary to have a balanced package accord when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet in Washington on February 11, he said. Okamatsu said the U.S. side is sticking to its call for some sort of numerical target for Japan's purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts, though it has changed its terminology to "indicators" to measure progress and results. Japan rejected the U.S. demand for future benchmarks and instead offered criteria to assess the implementation of measures and policies already taken, as provided in the framework agreement, trade ministry officials said. "Regrettably, we need wisdom to recover a trustworthy bilateral relationship," Okamatsu said.
