His approach, made on the eve of the Alliance summit, is fairly clumsy in that everybody knows that the Sixteen are not really prepared to expand their circle for the time being and that the procedure which prevails in their organization makes provision for them to invite a partner to sit among them; they are therefore not accustomed to welcoming partners on request. However, the initiative taken by Vilnius at least has the advantage of making things clear and showing the Allies that their idea of a Partnership for Peace does not really fundamentally satisfy those to whom it is addressed. And, even if it has failed to shake the conviction of those who want to keep the Central and East European countries waiting in NATO's antechamber for "some time," Mr. Brazauskas' application at least shows that not everybody is necessarily deceived. Having said that, Washington is sticking to its positions. On Wednesday [5 January], Strobe Talbott, number two in the State Department, categorically rejected the application made the previous day by Lithuania. Perhaps some may be surprised by this hasty procedure (as things stand, decisions are made by consensus within the Alliance); but, at least, everybody will have registered the idea that "the subject which we have before us at present is not the consideration of new members..., but the Partnership for Peace." Those who still naively believed that the subject of expansion would be included on the summit's agenda will therefore be disappointed! At the same time, the Kremlin also complained. In response to Vilnius' application, the Kremlin spoke out, once again, against an extension of NATO toward the east. Boris Yeltsin said he is worried "by the tendency to extend the system of blocs." And, while recognizing "an independent country's democratic right" to turn to the Brussels headquarters, he said that the admission into the Alliance of countries which were formerly members of the Communist bloc would jeopardize the end of the Cold War and would lead to "political and military destabilization." In short, the cards are on the table.
