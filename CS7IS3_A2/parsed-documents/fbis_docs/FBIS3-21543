The federal government spokesman highly evaluated the Ukrainian Supreme Council's decision and the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents which cleared the way for Ukraine's nuclear-free future. Ivan Piskovyy emphasized that Ukraine and its leadership now need political, moral, and financial support which would make the implementation of the nuclear disarmament program possible. These purposes, the ambassador said, could be served, among other things, by an international nuclear disarmament bank in Ukraine, an idea which was once put forward by Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk. The German side was handed a draft agreement on setting up such a fund.
