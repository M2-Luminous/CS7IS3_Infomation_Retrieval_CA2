Reporting to the Commons on the NATO summit, the Prime Minister parried repeated demands for air strikes, maintaining he had the political will to order an attack if commanders near at hand deemed it wise. Displaying his customary contempt for the interventionist approach of Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and agreeing with Tory backbenchers who urged caution, Mr Major said it was easy to say "all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and all is well." "It may well not be a wise policy. It may be necessary at some stage, but it is a policy that should be entered into with very considerable caution." The 16 NATO leaders reaffirmed a readiness to carry out air strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo. They threatened force to break the Serb siege of Srebrenica--so that a contingent of Dutch troops can relieve the Canadians--and to open Tuzla airport for aid flights. Mr Major made plain a growing impatience with the warring factions. Co-operation with Serb, Croat and Muslim commanders on the ground was "very patchy indeed," he said. "There is great frustration building up amongst governments, particularly who have troops on the ground, at what does seem to be a complete double standard, with the participants saying they want peace in Geneva and acting in a fashion which denies every single word they utter in the peace negotiations." John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was "intolerable" that a defenceless population in Sarajevo should be shelled so relentlessly. "Repeated declarations which are not followed through risk undermining the credibility of NATO and the UN operation and strengthen the hands of the those who have become adept at defying the wishes of the international community." Mr Smith urged the Prime Minister to put an end to suggestions that British forces might be withdrawn from Bosnia when the winter was over. "Don't we need a commitment to increase ground forces, as requested by the UN to make a greater effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?" But Mr Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to assist with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the security of the British troops working for the UN there." Mr Ashdown said the Prime Minister had been warned on many occasions that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN was at risk on Bosnia and cited President Clinton's words: "If we cannot show the determination to deliver our promises, then don't make promises." Biting back, Mr Major said that unlike Mr Ashdown, he had been careful about making promises. He has shifted and manoeuvered through this whole operation from everything to all-out war to apparently "pulling out immediately." Labour MP Andrew Faulds, decried the "mumblings and bumblings" of Douglas Hurd and other EU [European Union] foreign ministers and asked if Mr Major personally had the will to take military action. "Yes, every head of government had the will," the Prime Minister replied. "What we need to be sure of is that it is wise to do so." Practical decisions on air strikes were best made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand -- and on the sanction of the UN secretary general. [passage omitted]
