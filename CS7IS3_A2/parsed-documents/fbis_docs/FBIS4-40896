Regarding parliament's possible rejection of Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a non-nuclear state, Pavlovskyy replied: "This issue will not be raised. There can be no going back." (As UNIAN has already reported, deputies from the Union of Officers of Ukraine are to address an initiative to parliament on Ukraine returning to nuclear status.) Concerning international assistance in converting facilities of the military-industrial complex, in the opinion of the commission chairman, efficient assistance is that which is directed at specific programs. However, he believes that one can hardly expect such targeted assistance in the near future.
