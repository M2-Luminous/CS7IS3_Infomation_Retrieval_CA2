During early June in Warsaw, Flemish Prime Minister Luc Van den Brande will sign a cooperation treaty between Flanders and Poland. It will probably be followed by a Flemish-Hungarian treaty. [passage omitted] Aid The establishment of the treaty was preceded by many years of preparation and cooperation. Through the New Europe Fund, the Flemish Government invested 200 million Belgian francs in cooperation projects with Poland. The talks were concluded last month. The treaty covers virtually all fields which fall within the Flemish Parliament's competence. It deals with the development of the SME [small- and medium-sized companies] sector, with professional training and labor relations, with evolutions in the field of environment, and with culture. The draft treaty will be submitted to the federal government, which will verify within 30 days whether or not the treaty goes against federal powers. No one is expecting any problems, even though it is no secret that the Belgian foreign minister is not at all pleased with the phenomenon that regions are going "offshore" in an increasingly independent way. After that, nothing else will stand in the way of the treaty's signature, which is scheduled for 6 or 7 June in the Polish capital. Then the Flemish Council will have to approve it. Only then will the Flemish-Polish treaty be ratified and have international force of law.
