A short time historically, but sufficient in order to result in the coming together of a group of persons, which has the same name as that of the poem (stress on the final syllable), confronted by a situation that is an expression of the disintegration of that movement, which had constituted the basis for the realization of the Zionist dream--and its collapse. The founding conference of the "Hatiqva" [the hope] movement was held more than a month ago (6 December 1993) in the Writers' House in Tel Aviv (the location, by the way, is not a casual or incidental geographic detail). Representatives of tens of movements, bodies, and circles that identify themselves as part of the broad definition of the national camp arrived there. Beginning with the "Sky Blue" circle that is at the left end of the right-wing scale, through the youth of the Likud, to the "Peace Guard," which calls for separation of the peoples. All of them came out of a feeling of public abandonment of persons with similar ideological structures, but lacking a unifying roof. Representatives of the parties of the right also arrived, and MKs [members of Knesset] Rafa'el Eytan and 'Uzi Landau even spoke at that event, even though the need for a movement above parties testifies, without doubt, that the institutionalized parties that they represent do not answer the felt need for the unification of the national camp and for much more substantial activity for saving Eretz-Yisra'el than what is carried out today by the parties. The yearning for unification was expressed in the unclear to murky wording of the principles of the movement (see the box), in order to allow the members of the various movements, including those with a narrow definition of affiliation (such as the Circle of Professors for Political and Economic Strength, and the "Follow Me" movement of reserve officers), to find a place under the roof of Hatiqva. The failed attempt of the "One Israel" movement, which was meant to unite the movements of the right, led "Hatiqva" to abandon the idea of unification and to prefer an unclear formula of cooperation, while maintaining the uniqueness of each movement and party that would aid Hatiqva.... The founding conference was preceded by a process of about half a year, which began with a modest meeting of the "Ohalo" circle. The members of this circle come from the United Kibbutz Movement kibbutzim in the Jezreel Valley, the Beyt She'an Valley, and the Jordan Valley, and they regard themselves as the remnants of the followers of Berl Katznelson and Yitzhak Tabenkin, some of the ideological fathers of the Labor Movement. Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, a member of Giv'at Hayyim (Me'uhad) and one of the founders of the Greater Israel Movement and the Tehiya movement, participated in the organization of the "Ohalo" circle, and now in the founding of "Hatiqva." He does not see any reason for amazement about such an initiative on the part of members of the United Kibbutz Movement. Regarding this group of persons he says that "it is not we who have changed our opinions, the kibbutz movement is the one that has changed its opinions." He complains about the loss of activism in the kibbutz movement, and of the backpedaling that borders on denial of the ideas that Tabenkin expressed when he said that the Jordan River is the central avenue of Eretz-Yisra'el. The meetings on the banks of the Kinneret gained momentum. The human circle widened and touched other social circles. In the same period, Prof. Hillel Weiss published an article in HATZOFEH, in which he analyzed the depth of the Zionist crisis and offered ideas about the nature of the necessary solution. MK Moshe Peled, of Tzomet, who is a member of the "Ohalo" circle, made contact with Professor Weiss, a member of Elkanah. "A common language was found immediately, and the natural continuation of the meetings between us was the holding of a meeting between "Ohalo" and the professor." Their meeting was the first in a series of meetings, which were joined later by other persons, such as the author Moshe Shamir, and Shlomo Baum, the second-in-command of the mythological Unit 101, where current problems and problems of the generation were discussed and clarified; the political-diplomatic threat and the spiritual-cultural crisis. The channeling of things to a practical direction led to the recognition of the need for a secular-national movement that would act and would activate this significant segment of the population to thwart the government's plans to give up the Golan and Judaea and Samaria. However, says MK Moshe Peled, what makes the movement unique is not, at least at this stage, the operational aspect, but mainly the ideological aspect, which constitutes the basis for the tone of the movement. Its roots are in the analysis of the national-social crisis, which was defined precisely in the article by Efrayim Reiner (HA'ARETZ, 15 November 1993): "Israel was made into a post-Zionist society--that is, a civil society without a mission, whose sole concern is the concerns of its individuals." Prof. Hillel Weiss, who serves as chairman (temporary, he emphasizes) of the "Hatiqva" movement, regards Reiner's words as an extra-anthropological statement. "As far as I know, there is no such state or society anywhere on the globe, and there also will not be one." He sees in the concept of Israel as a post-Zionist society the troubling spiritual tendency to self-destruction, as it finds threatening expression in the current antinational process, a process that parallels the attempt to establish a different nation. Pathological de-Judaization, which is intended to save the Jew from his Jewishness. In "Hatiqva" they understand that if it is desired to change fundamentally the process of de-Judaization, this involves the creation of an educational and cultural system different from the existing model. The very model whose products the "Hatiqva" spokeswomen Ilana Adam (a teacher of civics, history, and political science by profession, at the Ramat Eph'al high school) encounters daily. Ilana feels the pain of the indifference, the hostility, and the alienation of the youth from the language, the culture, and Jewish sources. "An entire generation has grown up without a mother tongue, without an anthem," she says, bemoaning the failure of the second generation of Israelis, of which she is a part, to pass on to their children what she terms Yiddishkeit. In the secular "Hatiqva," they implement three out of the four principles that Rabbi Kook enumerates and defines in relation to tradition--consciousness, esteem, love, and observance. For the average observant Jew, this phenomenon is grasped at first as an ideological dichotomy, perhaps even somewhat schizophrenic, but as regards the secular Jew, it is understood as an existential dialectic. Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, loosely paraphrasing the words of Our Wise Ones of Blessed Memory About the Sabbath, says: "More than the Jews observed tradition, the tradition preserved them." There also is a bit of the declarative in the appointment of Prof. Hillel Weiss, the only one of the leaders of "Hatiqva" who wears a yarmulke, as chairman of a secular movement. The process of the loss of Jewish identity, they fear, leads necessarily to the loss of Jewish existence. They are interested in preventing the realization and completion of this process. There is a plan to establish an ideological forum and the forming of think-teams that will be composed of intellectuals, professors, and ideological leaders. They will draw up a long-term and comprehensive plan, in several variations, that will include an educational, cultural, and even a political system, which will make possible attention to and deep grappling with the roots of the cultural-spiritual-political crisis. In the shorter term, the goals of "Hatiqva" are to create cooperation between the various factors that are operating in the field--both parties and extra-parliamentary movements--in order to stop the process of making an agreement with the PLO of murderers, to topple the government, and to bring about elections. Even though these goals are clear to the point of being well-worn, and are shared by everyone, the competition between the political parties, and especially between the leading persons in them, makes the matter complicated to the point of paralysis. The need to manoeuver between personal and party ego of the components of the various factions, says one of the founders of the movement, demands a not inconsiderable acrobatic ability in the political circus. On the right, there is a worrying geological tendency to turn a point of disagreement into an obstacle. In "Hatiqva," they hope to change these natural relations and to turn a point of disagreement into a cornerstone of creative competition. On the duality of the potential, Saint Just said: "...you have the ability to build with those very stones either a temple or a burial site." The absoluteness of these alternatives was made concrete for the national parties in the last elections. It is only to be hoped that the process of mourning that was experienced by this public and its elected representatives will lead to the necessary drawing of conclusions, which will aid somewhat in the coming into being of a different personal and political culture, as occurred on the left on the eve of the last elections, when it understood that the fragmentation would lead it to another term in opposition. [box, p 20] The Son of the Slave Woman Shall Not Share in the Inheritance With My Son [first paragraph is editorial comment] The following words were spoken by Miryam Lapid (in the photograph [not reproduced]) at the founding conference of Hatiqva in Tel Aviv, about half an hour before her husband and her son, Mordecay and Shalom Lapid, may G-d avenge their blood, were shot by terrorists at the Harsina intersection in Hebron. "For G-d's sake, for G-d's sake," cries Bialiq in his poem. "About what?," he continues, "Do not ask, wherever it is! About whom? Do not investigate. Whoever has been affected in his heart by the trouble of the nation, the camp will gather him up, let us not make differences!" Words such as those have been spoken here at the conference. But only now, when you heard prose, have I understood that it is not enough to shout for help, not enough to describe the trouble, rather it is necessary, and this is precisely the main thing, to ask about what and about whom. What shall we save and with whom shall we save. For unity alone is but nothing. With the words "Each man shall help his comrade and will tell his brother to be strong," the prophet describes a wonderful unity...that exists among the builders of an idol to worship: one brings the boards, another brings tools.... Should there be unity in order to bring down the government. Is that the message? Is that the goal? Where will the government fall? Into the arms of the movement that carried and gave birth to the Camp David documents? To the movement that invented the "autonomy for angels" (for they are supposed to hover with their wings above the ground, as our genius patriots granted autonomy "only" to them, and not to the ground under them)? For if with G-d's help we topple the government into the hands of the founders of the Palestinian state at Camp David (LEGITIMATE RIGHTS) [peceding two words in English], there will be no greater despair than that. Is it really more pleasant to be uprooted by the Likud than by Labor??? Moreover, if it were envisaged that the talks were halted, the agreement blew up, there is no autonomy, status quo, would the bloodshed cease? Can our eyes not see that the situation today is child's play in contrast to what awaits us tomorrow? That we will never be able to match their rate of natural increase, which is three times ours...even in the area within the Green Line, they will be the majority. We can expect strangulation from within and intolerable pressure from without. If we are indeed coming to give hope, we must reveal what it is. And if we show the people a path and a goal, then it will be easier for us to call to the flag, then we will be able to gather and to topple the government. From every hill and under every blooming tree we must repeat the words of the matriarch Sarah: "For the son of that slave woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son, with Yitzhaq." This is our peace plan, this is the political, moral, humane solution for the two sides. It will bring us all life and peace. True, it is not so simple, its implementation is not imminent, but if you will it, if you indeed believe and will it--it is no dream. [end box] In the labor of translating the short-term goals that were noted above--into action--works Moshe Leshem, a reserve colonel, who was borrowed from the joint headquarters for the purpose of strengthening the movement. He defines his role as director-general as an attempt to bring the movement to rise from an idea to a living and acting entity, and not to turn into another passing episode. A short definition with broad technical-organization significance, both from the office viewpoint and from the viewpoint of activity in the field. Alon Zuntz, a resident of Herzliya, "a quiet citizen who was pulled out of his tranquility by the situation," as he puts it, is the field person, or, more formally put--the chief of the operations branch. Alon--as they say of him--has high operational and organizational ability, spiced with a not inconsiderable charisma. What guides the character of the action is the attempt to activate everyone in the sphere where he wants to act and for which he is suited and not to try to tie citizens to activity beyond their abilities and their desires. "The average resident of Herzliya will not participate in Operation Doubling, but will definitely participate in a demonstration near his home, will get people to sign, and will send postcards...." Alon began to work on establishing a stratified apparatus (regions, headquarters, branches, cells), with his activity mainly in the center of the country, a population in which there is, as is known, a considerable gap between the level of identification (which is rather significant) and the level of action, which is low. In "Hatiqva," they understand that it is not sufficient to run around in the corridors of the Knesset. "It is necessary to return to the effective method of Gush Emunim at its beginning, and to flood the country with home meetings," recommends Efrayim Ben-Hayyim. The realization of the program at the various levels requires a technical and economic infrastructure that does not yet exist in "Hatiqva." [box, p 21] The Principles of the Movement The Jewish Zionist movement is a super-party political movement, that aspires to close cooperation between the public bodies--organizations, parties, and movements--that accept the following principles: 1. The Jewish people have the exclusive right of ownership over Eretz-Yisra'el, which stems from its religion, its faith, and from its historical movement. 2. The movement will insist on the extension of Israeli sovereignty over all the territories of Eretz-Yisra'el that have been in our hands since the Six Days' War--Western Eretz-Yisra'el and the Golan. 3. The movement opposes vehemently an Arab state west of the Jordan, any change in the status of Jerusalem, and the uprooting or moving of settlements. 4. The movement calls for the unity of the existence of the Jewish people, Eretz-Yisra'el, and the heritage of Israel, and will act to instill the values of Judaism and Zionism in social life, in culture, and in education in Israel. 5. The movement calls for the ingathering of the exiles by Jewish immigration from all over the world. 6. The movement calls for mass settlement throughout Eretz-Yisra'el. The movement regards immigration, settlement, and loyalty to the Jewish heritage as the three pillars of Zionism. 7. The movement regards national strength, security, and economic independence as the main guarantees of the existence and future of the State of Israel. [end box] "Hatiqva"--a few weeks old today, a movement in its infancy, with a not inconsiderable number of childhood diseases, an age known to be critical. The problematic exists not only at the technical-economic level, but, as expected, also at the aspect of the human component. Shlomo Baum regards the matter not only as expected, but also as necessary: "We are talking about activists with a dominant personality, will, and ability to influence. If they were lambs, they would go with the flock." The heads of "Hatiqva" definitely are not lambs, and Baum finds himself reminding them that their goal is to tear up the opponents and not each other. He does this out of natural human understanding and cumulative experience, both as a commander (the reference is to human skill and not the technical ability to hand down orders) and in the different organizations to which he belonged over long years of activity. "Voluntary organizations," he says, "do not fail due to arguments over the path and how to follow it. The conditions of the path also are not decisive, rather human problems." And with the skill of an experienced sapper he deals with the human explosive material that threatens more than once to explode. Prof. Hillel Weiss does not see "Hatiqva" as a movement of a restricted circle of initiators. "The public is the hope, in more than one way, and it will determine the fate of the movement. People are waiting for something to happen, that the great message will be heard, but they must understand that it is they who must sound it." Along with the consciousness of the need for a movement of this type, there is a lively awareness among the heads and founders of "Hatiqva" of the impediments and the various factors that can establish the reality of a gap between the need for a movement and its existence. The discussion with those involved on the various levels, all those who are trying to bring about the narrowing of the abovementioned gap, was accompanied not by a tone full of pathos, as might perhaps have been expected, but by a somewhat doubtful hope, which perhaps defines the difference between the concepts of hope and faith. There is more than relevance in the sentence from the Jerusalem Talmud, in the Tractate Berakhot: "Let our hope not be of destruction nor of despair," or, alternately, it should be hoped that "Hatiqva" is the hope.
