On 25 May, William Gray met with Dominican authorities, including President Balaguer, regarding the possible closure of the border. He was accompanied by Dante Caputo. We have since learned that last night, President Balaguer committed himself to completely closing the border with Haiti in order to guarantee respect for the UN embargo against the country. The spokesman for Mr. William Gray, U.S. special envoy, confirmed that President Balaguer committed himself to completely closing the border out of respect for Resolution 917 of the UN Security Council, following a two-hour interview with the head of the Dominican state. Balaguer's government, which is opposed to the embargo, has been accused by some North American sectors of allowing the passage of goods, especially fuel, to Haiti. President Balaguer made no comment following his meeting with President Bill Clinton's special envoy.
