This was not always the case in the past!" Prime Minister Carl Bildt did not hesitate with his answer and did not fail to include a little dig at his predecessors when AFTENPOSTEN asked him what is the difference between Swedish foreign and security policy today and five or 10 years ago. To be honest, he made more digs at the Social Democrats' foreign policy priorities and their greater interest in radical regimes in the developing countries than at the new situation in Europe. For in practice the election campaign is already under way. Bildt has always been interested in foreign policy. And so closely does the prime minister involve himself in foreign policy that you can hear people in Stockholm say that poor Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas has a boss who would ideally like to be doing her job! As Bildt sees it, Sweden will retain its military nonalignment for the foreseeable future, at the same time as Swedish EU [European Union] membership will increase Sweden's security. However, he reiterated as recently as last week in a debate in the Riksdag that it is not as easy for Sweden to become a member of the WEU [Western European Union]. "But Sweden is very interested in being able to follow the work of the WEU as an observer -- something which represents no military commitments, but which offers an opportunity to participate in peacemaking activities, for example," he said. According to Bildt, Sweden will not try to slow down a trend toward common European defenses. But the prime minister's answer is always a resounding "no" when he is asked at EU debate meetings whether a private from Norrland runs the risk of being sent against his will to fight in the Balkans for example, if Sweden joins the EU. And he is keen to remind his audiences that Germany and France, which have been cooperating longest, have so far not reached agreement on a common tank, let alone a common army. The Baltic region and Russia is another topic in which Bildt takes a personal interest. In the three years he has been prime minister -- and the three Baltic countries have been independent -- he has played an unusually active role as a go-between and sometimes even mediator in Baltic-Russian affairs. This week he has again been in the firing line because of the Baltic region -- this time in the Riksdag's Constitutional Committee -- because of his remark a while ago to the effect that Sweden will not sit and look on passively if the Baltic countries' independence were to be threatened. Sweden will lend its support -- particularly political support. Such talk was too much for some -- particularly opposition parties which had not been consulted and which took the view that the prime minister was promising more support than a neutral Sweden could in practice give. The Riksdag committee wanted to follow the matter up and find out whether, in the event of a crisis in the Baltic, Sweden should remain neutral militarily, or make soldiers and aircraft available, as it did in Finland during the Winter War. "We will give political support, and sanctions could become an option. We will not allow ourselves to be forced, as we were in 1940, to betray our neighbors," Bildt said. Why do you give such a high priority to marking support for the Baltic countries? "Because what is happening on the other side of the Baltic Sea has such great significance for Sweden's security and economic policy. There are few things which are more important for peace in Europe as a whole, and for us here in the Nordic area in particular, than the development of the democratic reform process in Russia. We have seen what it was like to be the neighbor of the Soviet Union which was a dictatorship and an overmilitarized superpower. Now we have the chance to get a democratic Russia with a market economy which fully respects three independent nations along the eastern coast of the Baltic," said Bildt, eager to send a signal to the red-brown revanchists in Russia that the Balts have friends who follow events.
