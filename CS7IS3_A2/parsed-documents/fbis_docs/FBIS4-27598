FBIS4-27598 "dreas106_d_94035" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 South Korea Expected To Create Power Shift Expected To Create Power Shift SK3005074794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0659 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005074794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The merger between two splinter parties announced Monday is expected to create a considerable power shift in the nation's political opposition camp. Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Pak Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party held a news conference Monday and formally announced their parties' merger, which first became known last week. It is not yet clear whether their merged party will be large enough to become a negotiating body in the National Assembly. A party is required to have 20 or more lawmakers in order to qualify as a negotiating group in the unicameral legislature. At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and the new party for political reform has one -- Rep. Pak himself. Addressing the issue of the new party's size, Kim Tong-kil said "a clearer picture" will emerge in a few days when current negotiations on bringing in independent lawmakers bear fruit. If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the hitherto main opposition Democratic Party (DP). Some political analysts are predicting there could be a further realignment of political forces. Monday's announcement of the merger, expected to come in June, falls short of expectations for a grand merger of all opposition parties, for which "under-the-surface" negotiations have been going on since last year. A merger of all opposition parties, to be built around the Democratic Party, has been envisaged by many but sources said the negotiations apparently failed because of the DP's "intraparty problems." Monday's announcement, in a way, signifies that the main opposition Democratic Party has lost the initiative to form one large opposition group. If the merged party became "large" by enticing independents into the fold, it would be much more difficult for the Democratic Party to unify all opposition forces under its leadership as the new party would demand a merger on equal terms. In that event, the only possible path left for the DP to strengthen its status as the No. 1 opposition party will be to embrace Rep. Yi Chong-chan, chairman of the New Korea Party, and other prominent opposition politicians as individuals, analysts said. In any event, the Democratic Party is likely to face considerable difficulties if it loses its label as the "only opposition force" -- at least in the National Assembly -- with the emergence of a second opposition party. Realizing the precarious position they are in, many senior DP officials, especially those who had been advocating a grand opposition merger, were said to be urging the party to do some soul- searching, they said. This, in turn, is expected to heighten factional discord within the party, they added. Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party is watching developments and contemplating possible action should the newly merged party become a second opposition negotiating group. DLP secretary-general Yi Han-tong told a meeting of senior party postholders Monday that the party should seriously study a possible tripartite setup in the assembly. As part of the study, the DLP is understood to be contemplating wooing independent lawmakers who had bolted from the United People's Party earlier in order to prevent them from joining the merged party. Among the independent lawmakers the new party is interested in embracing are Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik, Kim Chin-yong, So Hun and Chong Chu-il.
