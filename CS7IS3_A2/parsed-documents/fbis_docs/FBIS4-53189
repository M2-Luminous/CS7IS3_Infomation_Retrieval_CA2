The prime minister said it is impossible to end the conflict in Cambodia through fighting, which would worsen the situation. He urges that diplomatic means be used to solve the problem. The prime minister also confirmed Thailand's policy of non-involvement. [Begin Chuan recording] We have the right to make our opinion known, but we have no right to carry out actions in their country. We are entitled to make comments -- whether we support or do not support any options. We the Thai people, as we already had an experience, we realize that it is difficult to solve national problems by making war. The problem would worsen and great damage would be done to the nation, making it difficult to restore law and order in a short time. We therefore believe that any problem should be settled through political and diplomatic means, which is more appropriate. [end recording] Concerning Cambodia's repeated accusations of Thailand, the prime minister said it is the responsibility of the Foreign Ministry and the Thai Government to clarify things to it.
