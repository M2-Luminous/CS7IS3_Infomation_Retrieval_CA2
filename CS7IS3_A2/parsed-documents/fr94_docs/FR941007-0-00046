FR941007-0-00046 FR941007-0-00012 40 CFR Part 86 [FRL&hyph;5087&hyph;2] Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines: Regulations Requiring Tampering Prevention for On-Board Diagnostic Systems AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Court Decision Regarding Agency Regulations. SUMMARY: This notice is intended to inform the public that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ordered that regulations published by the Agency intended to prevent tampering with vehicle on-board emissions diagnostic systems be vacated. DATES: The court order vacating the agency's anti-tampering regulations was filed on May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Sherwood, Certification Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, Telephone (313) 668&hyph;4405 or Michael Horowitz, Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street S.W. (2344), Washington, D.C. 20460, Telephone (202) 260&hyph;8883. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 19, 1993, the Federal Register published the Environmental Protection Agency's (the Agency's) rulemaking requiring on-board emission diagnostics systems on 1994 and later model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks (58 FR 9468). This rulemaking promulgated regulations that included provisions requiring vehicle manufacturers to install on affected vehicles: ``*␣*␣*␣features to deter modification except as authorized by the manufacturer. Any reprogrammable computer codes or operating parameters must be resistant to tampering and the computer and any related maintenance instructions must conform to the provisions of SAE J2186 ``E/E Data Link Security.'' (SEP91). A removable calibration memory chip shall be potted or encased in a sealed container␣*␣*␣*. Demonstration of compliance with the tampering protection section of the California OBD II requirements shall satisfy the requirements of this section through the 1998 model year.'' 40 CFR §86.094&hyph;18 (the ``anti-tampering regulation''.) Several associations representing aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers, rebuilders, distributors, retailers and automotive service and repair providers (``the petitioners'') subsequently petitioned for review of the rulemaking by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Docket No. 93&hyph;1277). On May 9, 1994, the Agency and the petitioners (``the parties'') filed with the Court a Joint Motion to Remand the Administrative Record to the Agency ``in order for EPA to reconsider the anti-tampering provisions, to address any tensions between these provisions and the access and information availability requirements [of sections 202(m)(4) and 202(m)(5) of the Act], and, if necessary, to promulgate new regulations addressing EPA's concerns about tampering.'' The parties further requested the Court to order that the anti-tampering provisions (and the incorporation of California's anti-tampering regulations) be vacated and be declared void ab initio. On May 19, 1994, the Court ordered that the joint motion for remand be granted and that the anti-tampering regulation be vacated. The Court also ordered that 40 CFR §86.094&hyph;17(j) be vacated to the extent it requires compliance with California's anti-tampering regulations for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II requirements (Title 13, California Code of Regulations, §1968.1(d)). The Court also ordered the remainder of the case be held in abeyance pending further order of the Court. EPA intends to issue a final rulemaking that will officially withdraw the anti-tampering provisions (40 CFR §86.094&hyph;18 and 40 CFR §86.094&hyph;17(j), to the extent it requires compliance with California's anti-tampering regulations for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II requirements) from the Code of Federal Regulations. In addition, EPA is continuing to review its policy concerns regarding tampering, (i.e. modifications made to vehicles in order to, or resulting in, the vehicles' emission control systems being incapacitated, damaged, or made less effective.) EPA may in the future determine that it is appropriate to promulgate new regulations to address its concerns regarding tampering. If the Agency so determines, it will at that time publish a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing these concerns. Dated: September 30, 1994.
