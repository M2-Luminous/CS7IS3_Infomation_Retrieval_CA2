I am especially concerned about the exorbitant speculation that has been unleashed in the country, largely due to a lack of information and control. President-elect Rafael Caldera thus argued his opposition to the IVA in the light of the court decision forcing the government to suspend its implementation. Caldera said: "I clearly informed President Velasquez' administration" of the impoverishing effects the IVA would have on the people. President Velasquez feels committed and forced to maintain the IVA because he views it as a pledge he made at the time of his election. As a concession, he agreed to an exemption in a number of fundamental areas such as food, medical treatment, medicine, and travel. According to Caldera, these exemptions were agreed upon with the promise to increase taxes on luxury items. However, he believes it might be better to adopt a position more like that of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. The tax should be imposed more heavily on sectors that are better able to pay, which would at least partially reduce the fiscal deficit. The president-elect returned to the issue of speculation to point out the current government's "apparent powerlessness" in dealing with it. In view of this situation, he said, the events and reasons that led to the court decision were "obvious. Everyone acknowledges them." Caldera said: I am not prepared at this moment to issue a legal opinion concerning the origins, background, and consequences of this measure, which is quite new in Venezuela's legal history. I would prefer to express an opinion after gaining a clearer view of this matter. Caldera announced that following the installation of the legislature he will introduce a "complete and full proposal to reform the tax system." The idea is to put the burden on those who can really pay the tax.
