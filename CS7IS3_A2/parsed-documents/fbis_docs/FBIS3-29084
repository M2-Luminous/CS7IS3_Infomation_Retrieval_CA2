Speaking at the reception, secretary of the WPK Central Committee Hwang Chang-yop said that we highly estimate the Communist Party of Canada (M-L) which is expanding the basic party organisations among the working class and students and other broad masses, strengthening the centralism in order to defend, expand and strengthen the revolutionary idea, the socialist idea under the complicated internal and external situation and, at the same time, actively conducting the work of supporting and encouraging the Canadian people in their struggle against capital exploitation. He noted: "Our party is happy to have such true friends as you in North America. We believe that the Korean visit of your delegation will strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between the two parties and contribute to the strengthening and development of the international communist movement." Hardial Bains in his speech said that his party was deeply moved to see the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has maintained a firm independent stand, is victoriously leading the Korean people along the road of socialism, and deeply respected him. The struggle of the Korean people who have adhered to the steadfast anti-imperialist stand under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is greatly encouraging the world people for socialism and independence, he noted. "Our party," he stated, "will stand firm on the side of the Workers' Party of Korea which is struggling in defence of socialism against U.S. imperialism under the leadership of the great leader." He denounced all the manoeuvres of the imperialists to isolate and stifle Korea, Cuba and other socialist countries.
