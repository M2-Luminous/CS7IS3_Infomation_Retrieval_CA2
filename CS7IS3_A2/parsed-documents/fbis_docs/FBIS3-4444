Some 275 enterprises with ROK's investment have been set up in the city since 1992. The ROK investors have put in 260 million U.S. dollars in these enterprises. The firms are mainly engaged in industry, agriculture, construction, real estate, transport and services. The greatest number -- some 212 of them -- are in industrial production and have made good profits. The Tianjin Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., a joint venture to produce video-corders, funded by Tianjin Telecommunication and Broadcasting Company and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd of the ROK, went into production in October last year. Its video-corders are the first from China to enter the international market, and the company plans to export 120,000 video-corders this year. In the Tianjin economic and technological development zone, an 1,156,000 sq m site has been leased to ROK investors for 50 years. Land leveling is expected to be finished next year.
