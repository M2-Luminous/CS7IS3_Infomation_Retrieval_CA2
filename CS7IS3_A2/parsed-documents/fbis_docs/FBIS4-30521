With the attention of compatriots in the North and South and abroad and the world, who hope that North-South top-level talks will take place for the first time in the history of national division, which has lasted a half century, at the earliest possible date and, thus, open a new phase in the fatherland's reunification, and with the expectations of the world, Panmunjom was today filled with numerous reporters from the North and South and foreign reporters. Members of our side's delegation led by Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and accompanying officials and members of the South side's delegation led by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, and accompanying officials came to the preliminary contact at 1000. At the contact, the heads of the two sides' delegations each made a keynote speech to express each's position on holding North-South top-level talks. In the speech, the head of our side's delegation pointed out that he was pleased that both sides were holding a preliminary contact today after reaching an agreement on holding top-level talks. He went on to say: We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division which we should no longer pass over. However, the reality facing our nation is grave. Misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation between the North and the South have been intensified, rather than being removed, and they have been even further promoted by outside forces. In such a situation, we were faced with a dangerous phase where even unstable peace would be endangered. Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common destruction [minjogui kongmyorinya], which cannot coexist. At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before. We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks between the North and the South will be an important historic occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation. The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost, successful talks that will give all fellow countrymen a bright hope for national reconciliation and unity and peace in the country and its independent, peaceful reunification. We have consistently adhered to the position of marking the turning point for the start towards achieving the country's reunification through top-level talks without outside forces' interference. The respected and beloved President Kim Il-song personally initiated top-level talks as early as May 1972, when North-South dialogue first began, and since then, has paid special attention to arranging top-level talks, which will be of significance for the country's reunification. Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However, these efforts failed to bear due fruit. It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation lies our common position of worrying over the nation's present and future. We would like to believe that this position is precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength. We can say the success of the top-level talks is guaranteed if the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of national independence because lying in this spirit of national independence is the supreme idea that links the North and the South by one bond--the source of the nation's will and strength capable of shaping our destiny by ourselves--and a sure guarantee for defending the common interests of the nation without playing into the hands of outside forces that make scapegoats out of the interests of our nation. If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the nation's position, the North and the South will be able to achieve reconciliation and unity after easily transcending all differences in accordance with the principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the difficult situation with the nation's united national independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire. The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to arrange, will become the creation of a great new national history where the history of antagonism that continued for half a century in our country changes into a history of great national unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history of peace; and the history of division becomes a history of reunification. It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow countrymen a bright hope for reunification in the nineties and will also regain the great pride of our nation which has outstanding history, tradition, and wisdom. This will also give great happiness to the world's peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the Korean peninsula. The head of our side's delegation stressed the important responsibility of both sides for the successful preparation of the historic top-level talks between the North and South and expressed the following position of ours on the basic issues to be discussed at the preliminary contact. First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in Pyongyang. This is because when the South Korean side's president [taetongnyon] was in the opposition party, the respected and beloved President Kim Il-song already asked him to visit Pyongyang and because the South Korean president repeatedly expressed the will to meet with President Kim Il-song, irrespective of the venue, and visit Pyongyang. Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe that this date is significant because it is around the day when the North and South all celebrate the 15 August [national liberation]. Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the top-level talks between the North and South. We believe that it is reasonable to arrange, right after today's contact ends, a delegates contact attended by a delegate to the preliminary contact and two accompanying officials from each side and discuss working-level issues, except for important issues such as the venue and date. The delegates contact should start from 1 July, and should be able to discuss the composition and scale of the delegation, the itinerary of the stay, dispatch of advance teams, procedures for visits, guarantee of conveniences, guarantee of personal safety, and other working-level issues. Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding the top-level talks. To make the talks, during which the top-level leaders of the North and South will meet, successful, we propose that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts that may cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks. Then, the head of our side's delegation presented a draft agreement of the preliminary contact for North-South top-level talks, a draft agreement that contains the above-mentioned facts. A sincere discussion took place at the preliminary contact, focusing on the venue and time of the North-South top-level talks. At the contact which was held from 1000 until 1750, the two sides reached a consensus of views on all points in the agreement on holding North-South top-level talks, drafted the text, and adopted a formal letter of agreement. The heads of the two sides' delegations each signed the agreement and exchanged the texts. In today's contact, our side's showed sincerity and generosity to hold North-South top-level talks in compliance with all fellow countrymen's earnest desire and expectations.
