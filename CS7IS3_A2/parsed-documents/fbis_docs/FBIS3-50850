The SKNLP, responding to Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' announcement of ongoing divestment plans on Thursday, said it would not be bound by agreements between innocent parties and what it called an unconstitutional regime clinging to power against the expressed wishes of the people. The Labour Party, which is maintaining its call for a fresh poll following inconclusive general elections last November 29, said in a statement Saturday it was committed to using its resources to oppose the process of divestment. It says the Simmonds government has no mandate or other form of accepted authority to divest a substantial portion of the people's inheritance. The party accused the Simmonds administration of reducing the sugar industry to a state which has resulted in a sharp decline in output and considerable lay-offs of workers. Unable to rescue, revive and maintain the viability of the industry, the party statement said, the Simmonds government has taken an unauthorised decision to sell in part the sugar industry to private concerns, whose sole motive is profit. The Labour Party re-affirmed its commitment to the retention of an integrated sugar industry. It said an efficiently managed industry can again be one of the effective earners of a large chunk of foreign exchange. The SKNLP said a concerned government has an obligation to ensure the continued livelihood of citizens in the context of improved wages and conditions of employment.
