How do you, a Kazakh, see this problem, and does a solution exist? [Suleymenov] It seems to me that the statements of such an authoritative writer as Solzhenitsyn are far more dangerous for peace between Russia and Kazakhstan than Zhirinovskiy's provincial [mestechkovyy] imperialism. Solzhenitsyn is a remarkable writer and a distinguished personality, but geopolitics is not his specialty, and he has already proven this. It is hardly likely that the problem of Russians in Kazakhstan can be resolved by reshaping the borders. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] The principle of the firmness of borders now, when the status of Nagornyy Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester region is being decided, is being put to a serious test. The states of Central Asia, where the current borders were drawn in the 1920's rather arbitrarily, have territorial claims on one another, including Russia on Kazakhstan. What should be done about this? [Suleymenov] Every forced reshaping of borders--this is a lot of blood, war, and death. The border problem can be discussed in negotiations, and an agreement can be reached. This is a long process, but it is the only acceptable one, if we want peace. I think that we nevertheless will take Europe's path, where borders are rather conditional. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, and Uzbekistan took a step in this direction, when they eased customs rules. Border questions with Russia can be resolved in exactly the same way. One of the main ones--the problem of citizenship for Russians and Kazakhs in our countries--can be resolved within the framework of a Eurasian Union. This idea is now being worked out in Kazakhstan. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you support it? [Suleymenov] The sore subjects of our societies, in particular of the Russian-speaking population, can be resolved only in the close integration of Kazakhstan and Russia. I do not see in this an infringement on Kazakhstan's sovereignty. Just exactly as I do not see an infringement on the national dignity of Kazakhs in the event that the Russian language receives official language status. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider this practical? [Suleymenov] Why not? The ratio of the Kazakh and Slavic populations in Kazakhstan is almost proportional; therefore, it is quite logical that the two languages should have official status. No sensible person will reject the language that he knows. And practically every Kazakh speaks Russian. Why and to what purpose should we reject the Russian language, which gives us definite advantages in the sphere of culture and international relations? Kazakhstan and Russia are fated to live as neighbors, and it depends on us, Kazakhs, Russians, all citizens, whether it will be at odds or well and in harmony.
