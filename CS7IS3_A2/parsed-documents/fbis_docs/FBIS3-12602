The paper adds: It is illogical for the negotiating process to remain at Israel's mercy, and hostage to its bloody crimes. Likewise, it should be unreasonable for the Arabs to continue to conduct the negotiations on the basis of commitment to the peace process when the Israelis are free of any obligations or commitments. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In its open war, Israel has been engaged in programmed terrorism, in a war of extermination and destruction in the name of peace. The Arabs are always asked not to protest to avoid inflaming emotions, and so that the peace process may not be undermined. To put it bluntly, the Arabs alone are asked to show flexibility, exercise restraint, and receive blows to maintain the momentum in the peace process as if the Arabs alone are the party concerned with this process. The Arabs are perceived as the party that must reward Israel and make concessions that consecrate the usurpation of Arab territories and rights, as well as submission to Israeli dictates and domination. The paper says: Had Israel been in the Arabs' shoes; namely, had it been the victim receiving blows and the target of daily air raids and shelling, in which the most sophisticated weapons are used, and had the massacre struck a Jewish synagogue instead of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque or the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, certainly the reaction of the West, and the United States in particular, would not have been so timid or confined to condemnation and denunciation. Had this been the case, the Arabs would have become the target of a sweeping campaign. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the shocking and horrendous Hebron massacre has turned many concepts upside down and changed many things. Thanks to this massacre, it has become difficult to continue the bilateral talks, or resume them as if nothing has happened. Salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires the application of all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it honor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and conventions, respect human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm settlers, and return to the Arabs all their territories and rights.
