"What is the alternative?" -- asked Mr. Bangemann. "Either we grasp the opportunities before us and master the risks, or we bow to developments, together with all the disadvantages this may entail. If the European Union would be late using new technologies, we undoubtedly would lose competitiveness and destroy employment. Job creation will occur mainly in new services and in the `content' industries such as information services and audiovisual programme production. At the same time, this evolution will help preserve the diversity of European culture." The 1994 European Information Technology conference coincided with two important events: The launch of the fourth framework programme for Community research and technological development and the announcement of the report on "Europe and the Global Information Society" by the high-level group chaired by Commissioner Bangemann. "We must keep up the momentum," said the Commissioner. ``Three specific actions are expected to be developed on the basis of this report during the German presidency: Accelerate the current deregulation of telecommunications; prepare necessary European regulations on domains such as intellectual property rights, privacy and security; and promote experimental applications. ``We are in the midst of a revolution. In such a situation of discontinuity, the costs of inaction are higher than the costs of action. It is for this reason that I look to the European Council meeting in Corfu on 24 June, as the occasion where the necessary mechanisms for action should be set in motion. ``Action means: Adapting existing policies to change. That is what we have done for the area of information technology in the 4th R&D framework programme. And now we must follow a similar approach for other policies.''
