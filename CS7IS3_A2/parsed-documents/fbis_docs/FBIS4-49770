Describing the next seven years as a "crucial period", Wu outlined plans to shift the focus of China's export production, narrow regional economic disparities in the country and complete the construction of a legal framework governing foreign trade by 1997. She made the speech at an international symposium organised by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations. While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous task" of economic development, Wu said progress was being threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for political ends. "Some countries politicise economic issues and follow unilateralism," Wu said in a clear reference to China's long-running MFN-human rights debate with the United States. "They often exert pressures on their trading partners with unilateral measures, which pose a direct threat to the operation of the multilateral trade system and is also detrimental to China's foreign economic and trade development," she said. Despite strenuous objections fom Beijing, Washington has made the renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status in June conditional on progress in human rights. Wu also made it clear that trade disputes with Beijing could penalise other countries, predicting that total imports to China in the next seven years "may well reach one trillion dollars." In a further statement clearly directed at Washington, Wu thanked "most" members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for supporting China's bid to re-enter the world trade body. However, she added that China "hopes that a certain contracting party will really fulfill its commitment and support China's return to GATT with real actions." While the United States has voiced its backing for China's readmission, Beijing has accused Washington of setting overly demanding requirements and allowing the MFN issue to hamper the negotiating process. "I hope our trade partners will adopt an objective and fair attitude towards Chinese exports, earnestly abide by international trade rules and practices and eliminate discriminatory treatment against China," Wu added. China has made enormous efforts to facilitate re-entry to GATT, Wu said, highlighting "remarkable market access improvement and considerable rise of transparency in foreign trade regime." Wu met here Tuesday with GATT secretary general Peter Sutherland, who made it clear that China must provide more concrete assurances on the issues of transparency and market access if it is to rejoin GATT by year's end. She said priority would be given over the next seven years to realising the transition from light industrial products and textiles as the main exports to machinery, and electronic, heavy industrial and chemical products. "We also intend to establish a relatively complete system of foreign economic and trade legislation within a period of three years or so," she said. At the same time, "more attention and support" will be given to inland areas through the adoption of preferential policies that will allow them to close the gap on the economically developed coastal regions.
