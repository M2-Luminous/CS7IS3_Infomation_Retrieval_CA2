Agnes Papp reports on the background to this decision: [Papp] The AVRT has suspended its sales activities and has confined its work until the formation of the new government to preparing privatization deals for decisions. This is what AVRT Managing Director Lajos Csepi told this program's correspondent. He explained his decision by saying that it is clear from the result of the first round of the parliamentary elections that the composition of the new government will be different from the old one and it is conceivable that the new government will choose a different privatization strategy, and potential new sales could limit this new concept. On being asked why he did not respond to similar requests by the large parliamentary parties in the past, Lajos Csepi said that he needs government authorization to do it, and the government and the minister in charge of privatization have still not ordered the AVRT to suspend sales.
