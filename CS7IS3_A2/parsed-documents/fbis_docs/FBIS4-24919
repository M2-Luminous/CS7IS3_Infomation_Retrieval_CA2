This is his second trip to Europe this year following his first visit to Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union regions earlier this year, suggesting once again that the United States is focusing on Europe in its diplomatic strategy. During the eight-day visit, apart from taking part in ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing by the U.S. and its allied forces during World War II, Clinton will visit Italy, Britain, and France, and meet with the leaders of these countries to exchange views on problems of mutual concern. Since assuming office at the White House, Clinton has repeatedly stressed the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to the United States. Some people believe the fact that Clinton attended the APEC forum held in Seattle last November shows the United States. has shifted its strategic priority to the east. However, Clinton emphasized once again that Europe is important to the U.S. global interest and that Western European countries remain U.S. allies. His current visit to Europe is exactly designed to improve U.S. relations with European countries. Since last year, the United States has gotten into a dispute with Italy over Somalia, the "special relationship" between the United States and Britain has greatly weakened, and the United States, on the one hand, and Britain and France, on the other, have been divided over ways to settle the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton will have extensive exchange of views with leaders of these countries on matters of mutual concern to reach an understanding. However, according to a U.S. government official, Clinton does not expect too much of the current trip to Europe. The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now at a crucial moment. Since the beginning of this year, both the United States and Russia have actively helped solved the crisis in their interest, making Western European countries feel they are left out in the cold. Though the foreign ministers from the United States, Russia, and five European countries held a meeting on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva not long ago, the three parties, namely the United States, Russia, and European countries failed to iron out their differences. Recently France proposed to withdraw part of its troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina and this clearly served as a warning to the United States. In France's view, since they have sent more troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina than other countries, they should have more say on the issue. France ardently hopes the United States will send ground forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina to shoulder part of the task of keeping peace and, at the same time, apply pressure on the Muslims so that they will return to the negotiating table. But the United States continues to bring great pressure to bear upon the Serbs, and the U.S. Senate even decided to unilaterally lift the embargo on weapons shipments to Bosnia-Herzegovina and opposed reducing sanctions against Yugoslavia. The media here believe the problem concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina is clearly high on the agenda of this meetings with European leaders. The U.S.-European relationship has undergone a change since the Cold War ended. Europe is increasingly at odds with the United States, but the latter, as a superpower, is still trying in every possible way to control Europe's affairs, though it is not as strong as before. Clinton's current trip to Europe is undoubtedly planned to attain this strategic objective though whether his effort will prove successful or not is another matter.
