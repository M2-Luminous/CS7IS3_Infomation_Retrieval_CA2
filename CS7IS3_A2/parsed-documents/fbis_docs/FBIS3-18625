He did not rule out the lifting of the oil blockade if "Baghdad complies with its international obligations." During a dinner banquet Juppe said: "I believe that Iraq has achieved progress" by accepting UN Resolution 715, which stipulates that "its weapons of mass destruction be subjected" to UN inspection. The minister said that "at another level, we have achieved major progress in the work of the special (UN) committee entrusted with supervising the elimination of its war arsenal. And we are now in a six-month trial period to ascertain whether Iraq is complying with its obligations." Baghdad recently stressed that it now has no weapons of mass destruction and is no longer capable of producing them. Juppe said: "This development should be taken into account step by step," pointing out that, if that proves to be the case, it will be possible to "use 22" [as published] of Security Council Resolution 687, which stipulates that the oil blockade imposed on Iraq be lifted if the country implements the Security Council resolutions relating to its disarmament. However, Juppe pointed to the existence of other Security Council resolutions with which Baghdad has not complied, like the resolution on the inviolability of the border between Iraq and Kuwait. He said it is a "necessary condition" for Iraq's return to the international community. Furthermore, it was learned yesterday from an Arab diplomatic source that Riyad al-Qaysi, director of international affairs at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, will arrive in Paris today to hold talks with French officials. The Iraqi diplomat's arrival has been confirmed by a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry. He pointed out that al-Qaysi, who visited Paris last July, "will hold talks with officials at the ministry." The spokesman added that "we will discuss with him Iraq's position on its international obligations stipulated in the Security Council resolutions in the light of the contacts made by the special committee entrusted with disarming Iraq" under the chairmanship of Rolf Ekeus of Sweden.
