According to the regional electoral commission, only 12.5 per cent of the electorate went to the polls by 15:00, local time, on Sunday (elections are considered to be carried out if at least 25 per cent of the electorate participates in them). Only nine per cent of registered voters went to the polling stations in the regional centre where the bulk of voters live. Taking into account that there is foul weather in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (strong cold wind), the electoral commission granted a right to all the aged to vote at home where members of the electoral commission come with balloting paper boxes. The commission has not recorded for the time being any incidents or election violations. Servicemen are voting at city polling stations for the first time (earlier, they voted at their units). Regrettably, many soldiers and sailors went to the city for a walk but do not go to polling stations. Their argument is reasonable enough: It is difficult to make a choice right away if you arrived to serve on the Kamchatka Peninsula quite recently from another region. Besides, there was no time to follow the election campaign. Orenburg -- a total of six per cent of registered voters went to the polls in the Orenburg region two hours after the opening of polling stations, and the figure stood at 15-21 per cent in the Sorochinskiy, Dombarovskiy, Krasnogvardeyskiy and Aleksandrovskiy districts. Chairman of the regional electoral commission Yuriy Andreyev told ITAR-TASS that he is confident that "the elections to the regional legislature will be held in all 47 constituencies". Chita -- the turnout at the elections to the Chita regional council is very low this Sunday. According to information received by 14:00, local time, voting is active only in several countryside districts where between 40 and 50 per cent of voters went to the polls. Urban residents are in no hurry to vote. In Chita, for instance, only 15 per cent of the electorate participated in the polls by 14:00, while in the city of Krasnokamensk -- only 11 per cent. The situation is quite different in the Aginsky Buryat Autonomous Area which is also holding elections to the Chita regional and area councils. Over 40 per cent of voters went to the polls there by 14:00, local time. Smolensk -- the lowest turnout at the local elections was registered in the regional centre by 10:00. The local administration spared no effort to open snack bars and to stage entertainment shows at polling stations. This notwithstanding, voters are in no hurry to participate in voting. All in all, 820 polling stations opened in the Smolensk region on Sunday for the elections to the local council.
