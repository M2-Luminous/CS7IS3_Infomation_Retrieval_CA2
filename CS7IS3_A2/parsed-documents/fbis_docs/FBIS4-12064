The document does not address the issue of withdrawal from the Golan Heights or its extent in the framework of the arrangement; rather, it examines the foundations of security arrangements between Israel and Syria, such as demilitarizing territories, thinning out forces, setting up early warning stations, and deploying international supervisors. The document was presented to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Foreign Ministry top echelons, and senior members of the defense establishment. The document is based on analyses of research by HA'ARETZ's military commentator Ze'ev Schiff and by Brigadier General (Reserves) Arye Shalev and which examined possible security arrangements between Israel and Syria. Two days ago, Peres held a discussion with his ministry's top officials on an arrangement with Syria. Over the past few days, sources in the ministry have been saying that after completing the agreement with the PLO, "we will race toward Syria." In the discussion, Peres told the ministry staffers to prepare proposals for the development of characteristics of normalization in the arrangement with Syria, such as economic ties between the two countries. Several ideas in this respect have already been raised at the Foreign Ministry. [passage omitted]
