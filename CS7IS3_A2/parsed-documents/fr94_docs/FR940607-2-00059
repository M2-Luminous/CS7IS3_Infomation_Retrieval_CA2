FR940607-2-00059 FR940607-2-00047 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS No. 1662&hyph;94; AG Order No. 1885&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AC30 Designation of Rwanda Under Temporary Protected Status Program AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1254a) (``the Act''), the Attorney General is authorized to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States to eligible nationals of designated foreign states, or to eligible aliens who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in a designated state, upon a finding that such states are experiencing ongoing civil strife, environmental disaster, or certain other extraordinary and temporary conditions. This notice by the Attorney General designates Rwanda pursuant to section 244A(b) of the Act. EFFECTIVE DATES: This designation is effective on June 7, 1994 and will remain in effect until June 6, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald Chirlin, Senior Immigration Examiner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 3214, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. Notice of Designation of Rwanda Under Temporary Protected Status Program By the authority vested in me as Attorney General under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, (8 U.S.C. 1254a), I find, after consultation with the appropriate agencies of the Government, that: (a) There exists an ongoing armed conflict in Rwanda and that a return of aliens who are nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, would pose a serious threat to their personal safety as a result of the armed conflict in that nation; (b) there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Rwanda that prevent aliens who are nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, from returning to Rwanda in safety; and (c) permitting nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, to remain temporarily in the United States is not contrary to the national interest of the United States. Accordingly, it is ordered as follows: (1) Rwanda is designated under section 244A(b) of the Act. Nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, and who have been ``continuously physically present'' and have ``continuously resided in the United States'' since June 7, 1994 may apply for Temporary Protected Status within the registration period which begins on June 7, 1994 and ends on June 6, 1995. (2) I estimate that there are no more than 500 nationals of Rwanda and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, who are currently in nonimmigrant or unlawful status, eligible for Temporary Protected Status. (3) Except as specifically provided in this notice, applications for Temporary Protected Status by nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, must be filed pursuant to the provisions of 8 CFR part 240. Aliens who wish to apply for TPS must file an Application for Temporary Protected Status, Form I&hyph;821, together with an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I&hyph;765, during the registration period, which begins on June 7, 1994 and will remain in effect until June 6, 1995. (4) A fee of fifty dollars ($50) will be charged for each Application for Temporary Protected Status, Form I&hyph;821, filed during the registration period. (5) The fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), now set at sixty dollars ($60), will be charged for each Application for Employment Authorization, Form I&hyph;765, filed by an alien requesting employment authorization. An alien who does not seek employment authorization must nevertheless file Form I&hyph;765, together with Form I&hyph;821, for informational purposes, but in such cases Form I&hyph;765 will be without fee. (6) Pursuant to section 244A(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Attorney General will review, at least 60 days before June 6, 1995 the designation of Rwanda under the Temporary Protected Status program to determine whether the conditions for designation continue to exist. Notice of that determination, including the basis for the determination, will be published in the Federal Register . If there is an extension of designation, late initial registration for Temporary Protected Status shall only be allowed pursuant to the requirements of 8 CFR 240.2(f)(2) which was published as an interim rule in the Federal Register on November 5, 1993, at 58 FR 58935&hyph;58938. (7) Information concerning the Temporary Protected Status program for nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, will be available at local Immigration and Naturalization Service offices upon publication of this notice. Dated: June 1, 1994. Janet Reno, Attorney General. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13796 Filed 6&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;10&hyph;M
