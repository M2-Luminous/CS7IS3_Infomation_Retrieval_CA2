[passage omitted] It is, indeed, at the request of government that we have met here today to report on the devaluation of the CFA franc. In a democratic regime, when there is an exceptional national or international event with very important financial, economic, social, and, of course, economic repercussions, it is normal for the head of government to come and discuss it directly with the National Assembly in order to take its viewpoint into account. [passage omitted] Mr. Speaker, members of the National Assembly, I will not hide the fact--it was widely reported in the media--that officially, Gabon was not in favor of this measure. However, we were forced to consider the fact that our partners were faced--like us, and perhaps more than us--with enormous economic and financial difficulties. It is also in place to say that in this affair the pressure exerted by the IMF and the World Bank, with the support of France was so strong that our country was finally obliged to fall in line with the other partners to avoid the dislocation of the franc zone. Making a different decision would have led us into an adventure with incalculable consequences on the development of our country. I therefore feel more at ease to say at this juncture that there was really no other choice for our country. [passage omitted] It is perhaps useful now to trace the causes of the devaluation. Why was this decision made? This measure that we are obliged to accept collectively is the consequence of the financial and economic imbalances that have been facing all member countries of the franc zone for about six years now. Indeed, the zone has been plunged into an unprecedented recession which has resulted since 1986 in a nominal growth rate of not higher than 1 percent for all these countries as against a growth rate of over 3 percent for the other West and Central African countries which are not members of the franc zone. Such a situation could not continue without very serious damage to the economic and social progress of our countries, especially as we know that the economic takeoff of countries in the franc zone supposes a growth rate of about 5 to 6 percent per annum. Still referring to 1986, it is estimated that for these member countries, the real income per capita fell by an average of 5 percent per annum. In the same period, investments declined to a record level of 6.5 percent per annum. All these indicators clearly show the worsening deterioration in the competitiveness of our countries which have been facing increasing recession for 10 years now. We can even say that some of them are now practically bankrupt. To prove how I have reached this conclusion, it is enough to observe that even in some oil producing countries like ours, civil servants are no longer paid regularly. Fortunately, that is not the case in our country. At the same time, there is a massive flight of capital and the collapse of the banking system in these countries, while the enterprises are faced with increasingly inextricable treasury problems. In such a context, the governments are reduced to only preoccupying themselves with financial imbalances, that is everyday treasury problems, to the detriment of the social sectors and the medium- and long-term development objectives. Furthermore, most of these countries can no longer honor their external bilateral and multilateral commitments. If we must admit that the worsening situation of our economic and social environment was caused by the inappropriate nature of certain macroeconomic policies that resulted in levels of consumption and investment that far exceeded available resources, it is also very valid to note that the unfavorable international context demonstrated by the continuing fall in the prices of raw materials has had a decisive impact on the economies of these countries which is particularly aggravating. May I remind you that the devaluation of the CFA franc happened within the context of acute and general deterioration of the terms of trade and the clear preference of the French franc to the dollar, the currency in which our exports are invoiced. If there was any need to show the importance of external factors on the economy of Gabon, I would simply give some parameters that influence the development of activities in our country. They are startling. From 1986 to 1992, oil prices steadily fell by 61 percent. Last year, Gabon produced about 14.5 million tonnes of oil. With this production level, we earned about half what we earned in 1985-86, when oil production in our country was about 6 to 7 million tonnes. Therefore, 14.5 tonnes of oil today fetches about half what 6 to 7 million tonnes of oil brought us in 1985-86. From 1986 to 1991, the global deterioration of the terms of trade for Gabon was about 50 percent. The same goes for practically all African countries that belong to the franc zone. The figures I have just given also apply to countries like Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon for cocoa and coffee production. In addition to this economically and financially unfavorable context for our country, the overevaluation rate of our CFA franc made it one of the weakest in the area. It was lower than 20 percent for our country, while, for other member countries, it crossed the threshold of 50 percent. It became clear that the cost incurred by maintaining the status quo, namely the former exchange rate, was no longer bearable. Many authorized or less authorized voices made this known in various ways. [passage omitted] Mr. Speaker, honorable legislators, it is no secret for anyone that the Gabonese authorities were against the devaluation. The president of the Republic and I had said this clearly and publicly because we knew that contrary to countries like Cameroon or Cote d'Ivoire, the economic structure of Gabon presents less room for adaptability. However, the devaluation is now a fact and we must live with it. With our partners in particular, we must examine the compensatory measures that were announced and promised in Dakar regarding the amounts of canceled debts. We must also examine the measures for increased mobilization of influx of concessional financing. On this very point, it is legitimate to recall that, thanks to President Bongo's strong action, our country has already been able to obtain some significant measures from France concerning the reduction of the debt burden. We hope more will be done. It appears that some of the doubts can only be cleared after negotiations with the IMF which, as you know, is currently present in Libreville. If we examine the short-term trade prospects, it seems probable that our CFA franc income will increase as a result of the conversion of our export earnings in foreign exchange. It will have a temporary impact on export activities and budget income that are mainly based on the influx of external trade. However, everyone can well notice that the structure of our production apparatus remains particularly dependent on imports that are practically impossible to do away with. It is also established that regarding our export earnings, Gabon, even if it so desired, cannot fully benefit from the volume of production, that is the medium- or long-term increase in quantity of exports that is usually expected after a devaluation for the following reasons: Oil, whose production is controlled by petroleum exporting countries, is, according to the information currently in our possession, at its maximum production capacity. Uranium and manganese are sold in deeply depressed markets that are severely affected by recession in our buyers' countries. To a lesser extent, timber needs huge equipment investment at the both the forest and industrial transformation levels and ecological constraints have now been toughened since the Rio conference. It is therefore for reasons of solidarity that we were forced to fall in line with a high rate of devaluation, too high, perhaps, for the internal data of our economy. We expect this economy to be interpreted by businessmen as being credible and lasting enough in order not to embark on any speculation. [passage omitted] As an immediate step, I have asked that relief measures be taken, as much as possible, to protect economic sectors where the prices of imported goods have increased as a result of the devaluation. New and courageous measures have therefore been taken to significantly reduce the customs duties applied to businesses. To alleviate the effects of the new parity, customs duties on imports will be as follows: 5 percent for essential commodities; 10 percent instead of 15 percent for capital goods; 20 percent instead of 35 percent for intermediate goods; 30 percent instead of 50 percent for consumer goods. With regard to this specific measure, it should be pointed out that the state is sacrificing a lot -- it is forgoing budget revenues amounting to about 45 billion CFA francs. It is doing this to relieve the most vulnerable consumers and to enable businesses to continue buying from outside and therefore to invest under the best conditions. [passage omitted] An interministerial committee has been set up to monitor and complete the relief measures. The ministries concerned have accordingly started extensive consultations with businessmen to jointly assess the trend of prices, profit margins, and salaries. With respect to salaries, I would like to state here that we are faced with certain constraints from the IMF, and our negotiations with them are continuing. It will also be necessary to fix general authorized profit margins for traders. Such margins must incorporate the new parity into the cost price of goods. A decree was drafted and signed to this effect on 31 January. A set of relief measures should be completed very soon, that is, at the end of the ongoing consultations. Despite the added constraints resulting from the depreciation of our currency, I reiterate, on behalf of the government, that every effort will be made, as much as is possible, to reduce the indisputable constraints that the devaluation of the CFA franc will incur for our country. This situation is even more delicate to manage considering that the price of oil is now about $13 per barrel, which roughly takes us back to 1986 rates. Remember that $1 more or less on the price per barrel of oil results in a positive or negative variation of 50 billion CFA francs on our budget revenue. If the price per barrel -- which is now $13 -- goes up to $14, we earn an additional 50 billion CFA francs in revenue. And if the price goes down from $13 to $12, we lose 50 billion CFA francs on our revenue. We can therefore judge for ourselves the considerable impact the price of oil per barrel has on our public finances and hence, on our entire economy. [passage omitted] The devaluation should indirectly -- if it is properly monitored -- lead us to remodel our production machinery by promoting activities that until now could not be undertaken. We can no longer and must no longer continue to be consumers of goods produced abroad. In the food sector, for example, a minimum self-sufficiency is necessary or indispensable, I would say. We and our neighbors finally need to seriously organize gradually but resolutely a true common economic zone that goes beyond our national borders. Instead of us all trying to manufacture the same goods at unavoidably high prices on limited markets, we should perhaps think of some kind of division of labor that is based on the primary natural resources of each country. It is also no longer possible to continue exporting mostly raw materials, especially in the timber sector. I hope timber sector operators are listening to me. Logging permits and other benefits in this sector must first be given to those who process or who wish to invest in the processing of timber. In this regard, the banking system, as well as tax, trading, and monetary policies, must be combined to promote industrialization--instead of being limited to the financing of relatively easy import-export operations. We also have assets in the services sector, but I would rather not go into details about this. In short, the state must do all it can to promote the development of the nation's resources, with the support of the Gabonese people. [passage omitted] I am indeed convinced that the only way that we can overcome the numerous obstacles I have described to you and meet the economic challenges facing us at the dawn of the third millennium is hard work, resourcefulness, the education of our youth, and investments. I am sure that we will all assume our responsibilities, be courageous and patient, and make those necessary sacrifices which will give us a fresh impetus on the path to economic and social progress. It is to meet these challenges together that the nation trusts that it can count on the widest support of the patriots that you are. Thank you. [applause]
