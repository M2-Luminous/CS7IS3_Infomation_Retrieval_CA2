Even though the Danish labor market reforms and the new annual leave system have considerable merit, they will not permanently solve Danish unemployment problems, according to a report on Danish economic conditions written by the EU Commission. "The system of unemployment compensation and the entire social welfare system overall are behind many of the structural problems in the Danish labor market system," it says in the report. The advantages of the Danish labor market reforms, according to the EU report, are that the unemployed are forced back into the labor market at an earlier stage than before. However, Denmark needs to go farther in liberalizing its labor market system, the report says. In general an optimistic note is struck concerning the Danish economy. As an open economy, Denmark has the best opportunity to take advantage of the integrated European economy and thus lower unemployment, according to the report. Should the EU be expanded to include the other Nordic countries and also open closer economic ties to the East European and Baltic countries, Denmark's role as an investment target for foreign companies will increase. As regards domestic consumption, the EU does not see any great opportunities for growth. The Danish economy will grow in future years due to growing Danish exports, according to the report. The weakness of the Danish krone on the European currency market, however, will continue to create problems for the Danish economy. For years Denmark's real interest rate has been much too high (that is, the real price of borrowing money after making adjustments for the effect of inflation) compared to the strength of the Danish economy, according to a survey in the report. If the currency rate of the Danish krone is to be maintained relative to the German mark, that will necessarily be harmful to the growth of the Danish economy, it is stated.
