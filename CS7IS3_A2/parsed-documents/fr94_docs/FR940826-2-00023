ACTION: Renewal of Grant on a Noncompetitive Basis. SUMMARY: The Albuquerque Operations Office (AL), pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), intends to renew, on a noncompetitive basis, it's current grant with Princeton University of Princeton, New Jersey. DATES: Renewal Effective September 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Address comments to the attention of Erwin E. Fraqua, Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185&hyph;5400, (505) 845&hyph;6442. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Based upon a determination, pursuant to 10 CFR Part 600.7(b)(2), which authorizes a financial assistance award to be made noncompetitively if the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE or another federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity, AL gives notice of its intent to renew its current grant with Princeton University under the project entitled ``Multi-Dimensional Measurements and Computations of Engine Flows and Combustion.'' The public purpose to be served by this renewal is to integrate the understanding of fuel injection processes and the fluid mechanics of combustion into current multi-dimensional models. Research in this program includes the development and testing of detailed spray models and the use of practical engines and injectors. The research is a continuation of work performed by Princeton under its current grant with DOE. The renewal period will be for four years. The government's funding of this grant is subject to the availability of funds. Issued in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on August 12, 1994. Richard A. Marquez, Assistant Manager for Management and Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21127 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
