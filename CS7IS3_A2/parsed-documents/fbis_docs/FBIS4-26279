In a speech at a reception given by the New Zealand Treasury this evening, Li said China will also quicken the pace to make its new economic system compatible with international practices and take an active part in the international competition and economic cooperation. "This not only serves the fundamental interest of the Chinese people but also conforms to the common aspiration and fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world," he said. Li, also minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic Reforms, briefed the New Zealand friends attending the reception about the achievements China has made since the start of its economic reform 15 years ago. He attributed the achievements to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. As China is an Asian country, developing and strengthening its economic relations and cooperation with countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part of its overall opening-up policy, he stated. Li expressed China's readiness to actively expand its cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic, scientific, technological and cultural fields under the principle of equality and mutual benefit.
