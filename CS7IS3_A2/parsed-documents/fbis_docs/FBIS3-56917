Lithuania, which is worried about its security, is also looking into other directions. It is aiming to have a union with central European countries, and it wants to have closer cooperation with Baltic and Nordic countries. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas will visit Finland this week. He was interviewed in Vilnius by Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen. [Maeaettaenen] Lithuania announced at the beginning of this month that it is seeking full membership in NATO. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who would have been happy with the Partnership for Peace agreement NATO has offered to several countries, had to give in for internal reasons and partly also because of pressure. Now he justified Lithuania's willingness to Yleisradio [Finnish Broadcasting Company] by taking as an example the Visegrad countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czechs and Slovaks. According to Brazauskas, Lithuania has the same motives with these countries to seek full membership, even though full membership would be very expensive for Lithuania, which is currently suffering economic difficulties. Lithuania would like security guarantees from NATO because of Kaliningrad, which is part of Russia, but Brazauskas is calm. According to him, one should not frighten people with Kaliningrad, which can be also used in an economic way. Of the Baltic countries, Estonia views Lithuania's NATO aspirations with extreme reserve. According to the Estonians, Lithuania thus wants to leave the Baltic security policy cooperation. According to the Lithuanians, as long as there are Russian soldiers in Latvia and Estonia, the step to NATO is the Partnership for Peace agreement, and it looks like Lithuania will also have to be satisfied with that. President Brazauskas will meet NATO representatives in Brussels at the end of this month. Before that he does not agree to say what NATO has offered to Lithuania. Lithuania's current plans include increasing cooperation with the Visegrad countries, possibly joining these countries. And one way towards a more comprehensive NATO cooperation is the joint peacekeeping forces of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The training of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion of about 650 men will start in Lithuania in the next few months. Preparations have already started. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas will arrive for an official visit in Finland 20 January. Like other Baltic countries, Lithuania also wants to have closer contacts with the Nordic countries. Brazauskas sees as one possibility a joint union between the Baltic and the Nordic countries, with the principle three plus five. The idea is a few months old, and it is possible to develop it further, Brazauskas says. He hopes the Finns will take part in energy projects, and he put his hopes on the Via Baltica project. This is a challenge indeed; the problematic customs and passport checks can currently take hours at the borders of the Baltic countries alone.
