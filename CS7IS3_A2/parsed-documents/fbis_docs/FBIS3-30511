Subsequently, the opposition deputies were unable to start discussing their version of the large-scale privatization law. The parliament session might continue on 4 February, following a consultative meeting of the parliamentary parties' officials. It is still possible that the deputies of the ruling coalition will change their decision about not attending the parliament's deliberations until a decision is reached by the Constitutional Court on whether it was legal to deprive parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic of the chairmanship of today's session. As HZDS chairman, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar told TA SR [Press Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Constitution clearly defines the powers of the chairman of the National Council. Therefore, Meciar considers the vote on whether Gasparovic should chair the session to be an informal vote of no-confidence in Ivan Gasparovic and an effort to question his honor. According to Vladimir Meciar, the initiative of the HZDS deputies and some SNS deputies to turn to the Constitutional Court is correct. He stressed that the issue was not the chairmanship of the session; it was the issue of respecting constitutional principles.
