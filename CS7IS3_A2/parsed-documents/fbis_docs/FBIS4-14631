In the opinion of presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, "the principal goal of this agreement among political forces" is to preserve the already existing elements of civil peace in the country. The newspaper quotes Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin as stating that "immediate prospects for Russia's economic development are moderately optimistic." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries a big article in view of the expected signing by government leaders of CIS member-states of an agreement on the mutual recognition of the privileges and guarantees for world war two veterans and the disabled and participants in combat operations on the territories of other states, the families of the fallen servicemen and other categories of persons. The agreement is expected to be signed in mid-April. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that a number of gangs engaging in criminal activities connected with the search of privatised apartments and their resale have been uncovered in Moscow. About 9,000 Muscovites, who have been reported missing, could fall victim to those gangs, the newspaper writes referring to the data of Moscow police headquarters as of January 1, 1994. All missing persons on the eve of their disappearance registered documents certifying the privatisation of their apartments. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) reports a "boom in the illegal production of gold and diamonds" in the country. The newspaper quotes A. Alexeyev, a staff member of the Russian Interior Ministry's main department for combatting economic crimes, as saying that one can now speak about the existence of a veritable industry in Russia for the illegal production, processing and marketing of gold and diamonds. Criminals "are busy actively establishing contacts with state machinery officials and foreign counterparts and arranging channels for the 'export'" of Russian valuables", Alexeyev said. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports a statement by U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who began his five-day visit to Moscow on Friday, that he is grateful to Boris Yeltsin for the success of Russian diplomacy in settling the Yugoslav crisis. At the same time, the newspaper believes, there is no "complete mutual understanding" between the sides, considering the stand of the U.N. chief, who issued an order to launch bombing strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, and the stand of Moscow which, acting virtually alone, prevented that". Neither is the U.N. secretary-general willing to understand Russia's intention to get a U.N. mandate for its peacekeeping force on the territory of the CIS, the newspaper pointed out. PRAVDA gives prominence to a report on a new party, Russia's Choice, which is being created by former Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar. The newspaper believes that this, in all probability, will be the first party of big bourgeoisie, and predicts that the new party will suffer a setback at future elections.
