Rough statistics show that the region has by now drawn six-tenths of China's total investment from the Republic of Korea and one-third of its Japanese investment. The region, with a population of 196 million, includes Liaoning, Shandong and Hebei Provinces, and Tianjin and Beijing cities, covering an area of 491,000 square kilometers. Investors from South Korea and Japan are now showing an increasing interset in the region thanks to its favorable geographic position and abundant natural resources. Investors from the Republic of Korea have invested in 1,550 enterprises in Liaoning, Shandong and Tianjin with a total of 1.1 billion yuan, covering electronics, medicine, textiles and garments and mechanical manufacturing. They have shown special interest in coastal cities in the Shandong peninsula. In Yantai city, 59 Korean-funded enterprises were approved in 1992. But in the first seven months of last year, the city approved 41 companies funded by the Republic of Korea. Tianjin, the third largest city in China, has drawn as much as one-third of the country's investment from Korea. Korean investors are still increasing their investment in the region. With an investment of 30 million U.S. dollars for its first-phase construction, the Korean industrial zone in Tianjin, covering an area of 1.8 square kilometers, expects to draw 200 to 400 million U.S. dollars from more than 100 enterprises. Many major Korean enterprises have come to the region, with their investment lasting as long as 30 years. Japanese investors are also interested in the region. With a total of 1.37 billion yuan, they now have a sales value of 1.2 billion yuan from their enterprises whose exports have reached 100 million U.S. dollars. The Japanese investors show their special preference for Talian, a port city in Liaoning Province. Their investment makes up one- third of the total overseas investment in the area. The Japanese are now setting up an industrial zone in the port city, expanding their investment and drawing more and more major enterprises to the area. The economic and technological cooperation between China and the Republic of Korea and Japan in the region is steadily increasing. To meet the demand of the increasing trade, the coastal cities along the Bohai Sea have opened air and sea routes to the main cities of Japan and the Republic of Korea.
