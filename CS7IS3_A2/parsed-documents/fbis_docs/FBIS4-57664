FBIS4-57664 "drlat099_c_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Mexico Cardenas Denies PRD Internal Power Squabble Cardenas Denies PRD Internal Power Squabble PA2105230994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 20 May 94 PA2105230994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report on telephone interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Mexican presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, by unidentified station announcer in Mexico City on 19 May from the "Outlook" newscast] [Text] Regarding all the problems that have surfaced during the last few days within the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] top leadership, we were able to speak briefly with Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who interrupted his presidential campaign to come to Mexico City for the agreements the National Executive Committee takes to achieve party unity during these very difficult moments in national politics. This is what PRD presidential candidate Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had to say. [Begin recording] [Cardenas] Nothing that I know of, nothing out of the ordinary. As far as I understand, we are working normally. [Announcer] Why did you recently say the media are conducting a smear campaign against you? [Cardenas] Because this is the way we feel. I have noticed a smear campaign in articles and in commentaries. I realize I am only speaking in general terms, but more than one article seeks to run down what the National Democratic Front may represent, which is nominating me, and my own candidacy. [Announcer] I ask because to generalize is indeed dangerous. I suppose you are not referring to us, Radio ACIR? [Cardenas] Not necessarily. [Announcer] Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, yesterday you denied alleged links with arms trafficking operations for the anti-Sandinist contras, sponsored by the CIA in Mexico. There is a book by Terry Reed and John Cummings entitled "Bush, Clinton, and the CIA Involved," which implicates you in gun running operations for the contras. Do you deny this and are you suing these writers? [Cardenas] Absolutely. I can also say this information surfaced in Mexico several months ago and we now see that various media, which one would have thought them to be serious, are reprinting this. [Announcer] Are you going to sue through foreign lawyers? [Cardenas] We are going to seek consultation to see where we stand. If a lawsuit is called for, we shall do just that. [Announcer] PRD leader Heberto Castillo [as heard] said the PRD's situation is very sensitive now and he mentions the possibility of a substitute president or an acting president. All this has to do with the case of Samuel Del Villar's as head of Federal Electoral Institute. What can you tell us about this? [Cardenas] I do not see any major problem. I believe this represents the normal, in-house changes in a party where we openly discuss things for all the public to observe. We do not resolve our problems behind closed doors, but in the open. This may seem odd for a political party. [Announcer] Regarding this same topic, what will happen when it comes down to a debate between a representative of your party, the PRD, and the director of the electoral registry? [Cardenas] It will probably take place. The party will have to consider the terms of the debate, how will it take place, and then decide who will represent the PRD. What is not acceptable is that the Government Secretary should say who will represent the PRD in such a debate. Samuel Del Villar or others may possibly attend. The party's directorate will have to decide this. [Announcer] We were commenting in this "Outlook" newscast of the ACIR Group that some political observers say that the true issue in the PRD's is power squabbling between the several groups that comprise the PRD. How do respond to this? [Cardenas] I believe this is a mistaken outlook; there are no power quotas. All the main posts are already defined so there can be no reason to argue. [Announcer] I thank you very much. [end recording]
