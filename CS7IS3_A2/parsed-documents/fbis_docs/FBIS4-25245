Some 60 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises in Shenzhen were involved in tax evasion. According to statistics provided by the World Bank, a total of $27 billion was channeled into China in 1993, making China the largest recipient of capital in the world. Though both China and foreign businessmen benefit from the investment, the evasion of taxes by foreign businessmen is surprising. It is understood that foreign businessmen evade taxes mainly through diverting their profits, which in fact is nothing secret. Since foreign businessmen have purchasing and marketing rights, they can make enormous profits by importing raw and semi-finished materials at high prices and exporting their products at low prices. The strange prevailing situation is that although foreign-funded enterprises on the mainland only make small profits or operate at a loss every year, they carry on expanding at the same time. Statistics released by the department concerned show the above malpractice of foreign-funded enterprises costs the mainland a loss of several billion U.S. dollars every year, which accounts for about one-third of foreign enterprises' total import-export volume in the same period. Many foreign businessmen also falsely report the value of their equipment. Investigations into foreign enterprises' equipment carried out by a commodity inspection department reveal that most foreign businessmen have falsely reported the cost of their equipment. An appraisal by a certain commodity inspection department of 150 batches of equipment provided by foreign businessmen showed all the equipment had been converted into capital at price 28.8 percent higher than the actual prices. Facts have told the Chinese Government that if the purchasing and marketing rights of foreign-invested or joint venture enterprises are in the hands of foreign businessmen, they would be controlled by foreign businessmen. The Chinese side in a joint venture enterprise in East China producing sporting shoes for a famous U.S. brand was excited at first by the injection of several hundred thousand U.S. dollars by the foreign side, but the management announced six months after the enterprise went into operation that the enterprise had suffered a loss of 210,000 yuan incurred by exporting 100,000 pairs of shoes to the United States. The workers were stunned by the news, but they finally discovered the secret. The selling price for a pair of shoes fixed by the foreign businessmen was $2.16, amounting to 11.23 yuan, but the production cost was 13.4 yuan, so 100,000 pairs of shoes cost the enterprise 210,000 yuan. However, the 100,000 pairs could bring a profit of $1.3 million in the U.S. market. The Chinese side could not but say with feeling: Our own enterprises are not allowed to export products by ourselves, so we have to exploit marketing channels provided by the foreign side. An officer from the Foreign Affairs Taxation Administration under the State Administration of Taxation believes that it is necessary to set up a network providing information on prices as soon as possible. To encourage foreign investment, China has formulated preferential policies. For example, foreign enterprises enjoy tax reductions and exemptions for five years beginning from the day they go into operation. A certain foreign-invested company in Fuzhou turned its two workshops into independent companies so that they could continue to enjoy tax reductions and exemptions when its tax reductions and exemptions were about to expire. Such examples are numerous. Many foreign businessmen also falsely report their personal income to dodge tax. China's tax departments have taken various measures to recover evaded taxes. China's tax departments have reportedly individually examined over the last two years foreign-invested companies and foreign businessmen who have evaded taxes. In the Beijing region alone, 130 persons from 40 companies were required to pay overdue taxes totaling six million yuan and arrears amounting to five million yuan were also recovered. A cadre in charge of the Foreign Affairs Taxation Administration said that by straightening out taxation, the situation regarding income tax payments by foreigners in Beijing had greatly improved.
