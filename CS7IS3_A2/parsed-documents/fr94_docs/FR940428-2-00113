Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50&hyph;333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of Application for Amendment: December 28, 1993. Brief Description of Amendment: The amendment clarifies Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.D.4. Amendment No. 179 to the TS added LCO 3.5.D.4 to permit hydrostatic and leakage testing at temperatures up to 300 ○F without requiring certain equipment, including the automatic depressurization system (ADS), to be operable. However, LCO 3.5.D.4 can be mistakenly interpreted to require the ADS be operable at temperatures less than 212 ○F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic and leakage testing with temperatures below 212 ○F was clearly not the intent of Amendment No. 179. The amendment clarifies LCO 3.5.D.4 to resolve this concern and is considered an administrative change. Date of Issuance: April 6, 1994. Effective Date: As of the date of issuance to be implemented within 30 days. Amendment No.: 209. Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;59: Amendment revised the Technical Specifications.
