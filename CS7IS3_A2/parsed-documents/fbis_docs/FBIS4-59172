God sets forth a parable: A city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place. Yet was it ungrateful for the favors of God. So God made it taste of hunger and terror in extremes closing in on it like a garment from every side, because of the evil which its people wrought. [koranic verses] An appeal to our Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region following the large-scale armed clashes between the Barzani and Talabani groups: O our people who are shackled by the chains of the infidel coalition and the hegemony of the traitors and lackeys; O our good Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region: We have drawn your attention in the past to the fact that those who are tampering with Kurdistan [words indistinct] and its developmental structure which was built by the glorious 17-30 Revolution in recognition of our Kurdish people's national and cultural rights are merely pawns in the hands of international tyranny, which it moves as it pleases to achieve its goals and objectives in the easiest way and with the least sacrifices. Those who chose to follow the infidel foreigner and joined his aggressive plans, with all this submission and humiliation, have severed all links with you about which they used to brag. They have deceived some people and were about to sever all links to land and history. God, however, has turned their evil against them. They are now being exposed before the entire people. Thanks to God's will, one is falling by the fire of the other in an action financed by the evil coalition. They want to set Kurdistan ablaze because they do not want it to return to the motherland, which gave it security, prosperity, and rights. They are setting it ablaze so that no one will pay attention to his rights, development, and progress, and so that the sedition will continue as it continues in Lebanon and Afghanistan. Our honorable brothers in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, disarm the combating warriors of their weapons and then turn the weapons against their leaders because they, by God, are implementing the schemes of imperialism, Zionist, and reactionism and are igniting a fire that will consume everything in Kurdistan. Turn the fire of God against the traitors of the homeland and the people. Chase the enemies of God in Kurdistan and reject their ugly presence because we, by God, are a people who only accept friends from within themselves. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: O ye who believe take not for your friends unbelievers rather than believers; do ye wish to offer God an open proof against yourselves? [Signed] The Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous region, and the representatives of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region at the National Assembly
