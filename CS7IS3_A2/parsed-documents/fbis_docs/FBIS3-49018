In his letter Jadranko Prlic notes that at their last session the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna discussed the political and military situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina with special emphasis on the course of negotiations on the future political system in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The common view is that in the negotiations so far, the Croat delegation has made most concessions and that any further concessions to other sides in the negotiations would not only place the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in an unequal position toward the two other constituent nations but would directly threaten its survival. The Muslim army continues to attack the Croat people, especially in central Bosnia. At the same time top Muslim politicians have openly threatened to pursue their territorial conquest of the centuries-old Croat homes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In view of the above, the Republic of Croatia is called on to reexamine its overall relations with the Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina where -- contrary to its constitution -- decisions are now being made by authorities that are exclusively under Muslim control. The letter also contains a request to annul the document by which the Republic of Croatia recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in view of the fact that since the recognition major changes have been made in the foundations of constitutionality of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the fact that the Muslim side has achieved illegitimate dominance. In addition, we ask the Republic of Croatia to end its participation in the talks on the future organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Muslim side halts its offensive in central Bosnia and provides firm guarantees that it will end its aggression against our people, the president of the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna says in his letter to the Government of the Republic of Croatia.
