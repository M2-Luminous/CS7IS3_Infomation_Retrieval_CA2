Wang Dan held that the living standard of the Chinese people has improved somewhat as compared with the past and that it is time at present to show concern for the rights of the individual. In his open letter, Wang Dan stated that he will unyieldingly investigate the human rights situation of the Chinese people and will, "within the scope permitted by law," "openly" investigate cases involving human rights. He stated that he is mentally prepared for being "suppressed" and will never feel "regret." Wang Dan emphasized that "the democratic movement is not an antigovernment movement and safeguarding human rights is not subverting the government." The full text of Wang Dan's open letter is as follows: Deputies to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and members attending the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee: The Constitution of the PRC stipulates: Citizens have the right to make suggestions and to criticize any state organ. On the occasion of the opening of the "two meetings," I, in the capacity of an ordinary PRC citizen, want to put forward my own views on some issues in the political life of the country for the reference of the deputies and members. I support the reform and opening up policy pursued by the authorities and agree that in the course of reform and opening up the living standard of the people has improved somewhat as compared with the past. It is precisely because of this that I think that in China today the issue of the right to subsistence has been resolved and, therefore, the safeguarding of the political rights and natural human rights of the individual should naturally be put on the agenda of the meetings. Respecting human rights is a commitment of the socialist state. However, it is undeniable that some problems exist in the course of implementation. I make no attempt to conceal the truth that on the human rights issue my views differ from those of the authorities in many aspects, but I do not want to impose my views on the government. I only hope that the government will, in enforcing the law, handle affairs strictly according to law and earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens (including those under detention or serving sentences). Therefore, I am willing to make known to the authorities my activities. I will, in my own personal capacity, carry out detailed investigations into specific cases involving human rights and, with seeking truth from facts and obtaining the approval of the people concerned as a prerequisite, discuss with parties concerned some phenomena of serious infringements of human rights on behalf of the people concerned or their family dependents. If I fail, I will make appeals in a legitimate and open manner. I will adhere to two basic principles in all my activities: 1. Acting within the scope permitted by existing law; 2. Openness. NPC deputies and CPPCC members, I would like to take this opportunity to let you know my basic stance on human rights. Promoting reform and opening up and maintaining social stability are the main themes of the "two meetings" and are also the common aspirations of ourselves and the authorities. I think that promoting social stability and safeguarding human rights are not mutually opposed; on the contrary, energetically safeguarding work on human rights and arousing the enthusiasm of people of various strata is a move which conforms to the wishes of the people and can strengthen China's international position. This is an important requisite for promoting social stability. I fully understand that safeguarding human rights and developing democracy is a gradual and orderly process. Therefore, I do not ask the authorities to do anything at once, but I hope the authorities at least can refrain from anything such as serious infringements on human rights. I think this is in conformity with the initial stage of socialism and can be done at present. Here, I must emphatically point out: The democratic movement is not an antigovernment movement. Safeguarding human rights is not subverting political power. My going around campaigning on specific human rights cases proceeds from humanitarianism. I am concerned with whether or not the rights and interests and the dignity of the individual are protected and respected. The ultimate goal is to maintain social stability and to promote the progress of democracy. My activities are not aimed at the Chinese Government, but at specific problems. I hope my good and honest wishes can be understood by NPC deputies, CPPCC members, and the authorities. At the same time, I am also willing to take responsibility for them. I thoroughly understand that in the political environment in China at present, it is necessary to take some risks in raising objections to the behavior of the government. I am mentally prepared for suppression by organs of dictatorship because of this. However, I will feel no regret. I believe that what I am doing is just and conforms with the three requirements I set for myself when I was discharged from prison in February 1993: Not letting down the people, not letting down history, and not letting down my own conscience. Wishing the two meetings complete success! Wang Dan 10 March 1994 Beijing
