(Telephone calls to these numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This announcement provides information on the general program goals, eligibility requirements, research emphases, availability of funds application process, and review process for the IHS Research Program for FY 1995. A. General Program Goals 1. To support practice and community-based research projects likely to improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) served by the IHS. Projects that are basic science or laboratory research are not considered as conforming to the program goals, and will be returned to the applicant. 2. To develop research skills among IHS and tribal health professionals. The applicant, as the direct and primary recipient of PHS funds, must perform a substantive role in carrying out project activities and not merely serve as a conduit for an award to another party, or to provide funds to another party. B. Eligibility The grant application process affords Indian tribes and tribal organizations which have contracts with the IHS under the Indian Self-Determination Act, 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq. , an equal opportunity to compete with IHS components for research funds. Awards to tribal contractors will be made as grants or cooperative agreements. The IHS components will receive special allotments of funds to carry out approved research activities. C. Research Emphases
