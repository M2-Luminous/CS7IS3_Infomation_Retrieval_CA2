For the third time in almost two years, the Swiss people have voted in favor of being screened off from the outside world. The disappointing result does not just signify a no to the formation of a Swiss Blue Helmet battalion. It also signifies a brusque refusal toward international solidarity concerning security policy. In this way, Switzerland is avoiding a task that has gained in importance since the end of the Cold War, a task that other neutral countries have already been performing for several years. But the strong majority of our people do not seem to care about that. From an internal political angle, it is not good that a new rift has emerged between the German and French-speaking parts of Switzerland, even though this rift is not as wide as it was during the European Economic Area vote. Apart from the two dual-language cantons of Freiburg and Wallis, all the French-speaking cantons spoke out in favor of an opening out to the world in the sphere of security policy. Even there, people are acquainted with the principles of the Swiss Confederation. Cantons containing large conurbations, such as Zurich, Bern, Basel-Stadt, and Basel-Lansdschaft, had a below-average number of no votes. Switzerland was one of the first countries to adapt its security and political ideas to the post-1989 changes, and it was justifiably proud of its leading role in this regard. But today the country still seems reluctant to develop the nationwide strategy formulated in the Bundesrat's report on the 1990's, and prefers to let circles of experts discuss this topic. Detailed examinations will be required to establish individual reasons for the no vote. But it already seems clear that neutrality in its rigid form is more firmly rooted in society than was originally thought. Neutrality is viewed not so much a security strategy as an ambiguous, almost theoretical state slogan that remains valid whatever happens. At a time when everything is falling apart, there has to be something that remains unaltered, many citizens probably say to themselves. People conclude that in the current world political situation, traditional patterns of thought and conduct are not always suitable. The opponents to the deployment of Swiss peacekeeping troops took advantage of this mood. With an avalanche of propaganda that did not stop short of false statements and made a laughing stock of foreign policy moves, they created the impression that by deploying Blue Helmets, Switzerland would be engaging itself in a war. In this way, fears were aroused that made moral and humanitarian calls for solidarity unheard. Nevertheless, the opponents did not succeed in separating the subject of Blue Helmets from our basic relationship toward the United Nations. The dramatic financial situation and the debate on old-age and survivor pensions might have contributed to the negative result. Last but not least, the result might indicate a certain mistrust in the government. What are the consequences of the 12 June vote? The point now is to make maximum use of existing possibilities, which means that unarmed military personnel are to be placed at the disposal of the United Nations also in future. A further development is possible in this sphere. The work of the disaster assistance corps and International Red Cross is to receive continued support, something that the opponents to the deployment of Blue Helmets should be reminded of. During the prevote campaign, they did not tire of telling people that it is these two organizations that require support, and not the Blue Helmets. The refusal to Swiss Blue Helmets hardly effects national defense, but it remains to be seen whether the principle of peacekeeping can retain its credibility if a country with a 400,000-strong army refuses to deploy 600 Blue Helmets. From a foreign policy angle, it remains to be seen whether the international community will continue to be interested in the services of a country that does not want to fulfill a major military-diplomatic task. The terrain for Swiss foreign policy is certainly not going to be easier. It will take some effort to convince our neighbors that a refusal to implement an important political task does not mean isolation, for there is no question that after the 12 June vote, Switzerland continues to rely on international cooperation.
