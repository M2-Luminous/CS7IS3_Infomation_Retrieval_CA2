The new law comes into force on 1 April this year, although, as one of the Seimas members joked, "1 April is not the most appropriate date." Firearms may be legally acquired by persons over the age of 25 who have no court record, do not abuse spirits, are well-balanced, not addicted to drugs, and who are not registered at a psychiatric clinic. It was pointed out at the Seimas session, that the adoption of such a law was a forced measure, since the rise in crime in Lithuania is getting beyond state control.
