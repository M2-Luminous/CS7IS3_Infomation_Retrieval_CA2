In a signed article, Ren Zhongping says that 1994 is an important year for China to speed up the process of establishing a socialist market economic system and extend a package of new reforms. Fostering a main market, improving a market system and upgrading a regulatory system are the three aspects that must be "pushed ahead abreast", the article says, adding that "breakthroughs" must be made on the micro and macro levels of the market economy. The author calls the tasks an uphill battle like "storming fortifications". The present is the optimum time to mount such a battle, Ren says, citing the courage and resolve that are needed to overcome the difficulties. Otherwise, a rare historic opportunity will slip by and a sustained, high-speed and healthy growth of the national economy can not be maintained. Consequently, the next strategic objectives of the national economy and social development will not be able to be realized. Worse still, it would be very likely that China would be lingering in a predicament of inflation and low-speed economic growth, warns the lengthy article. The transition from the co-existence of a planned economy and a market economy to a single-track market economy will deeply touch the interests pattern formed under the old system. What is more, the major transformation from the bottom-up self-initiated reforms and the top-down delegation of power and giving up of interests to the coordinated and organized implementation by people at both ends demand new adaptability, Ren says. Therefore, the authority of the central government should be upheld and a concept of overall interests be formed in order to successfully effect the move from "the advancing of a single program" to "the advancing of overall programs". The article says it is necessary to use legal means to guide the reforms and manage the economy when policy formulation gives way to laws and regulations. The author warns against the tendency among some people to think "reforms are an issue for the government and development is our business". The article says, "we are in the same boat and everyone is involved in the current reforms. We should unite as one to win the battle."
