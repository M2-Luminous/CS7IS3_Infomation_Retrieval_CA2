Vladimir Kumachev, of Russia's Institute of National Security and Strategic Research, told AFP that "according to information we have received, North Korea has nuclear warheads." Pyongyang also had launch vehicles "which had been perfected by the North Koreans themselves to give a longer range" to their missiles, added Kumachev, who is an adviser to the director of the institute, which was set up in 1991 with the backing of the defence and foreign ministries. "We know they have carried out tests in certain African countries under totalitarian regimes," he said. Kumachev said the then Soviet Union learned as early as 1985 that North Korea was starting to develop nuclear weapons, prompting Moscow to recall most of its specialists stationed in the country. Kumachev added: "We established that the Koreans were enriching their uranium more than was necessary for non-military purposes, and we learned that secret underground bases had been set up in the mountains." At the end of the 1970's the Soviet Union sent about 10 conventional missiles to North Korea "to protect its frontiers with South Korea," while further missile deliveries were made via third countries, including Iraq, he said. "We still retain around 15 experts in North Korea to keep us up to date with and to monitor its nuclear programme," Kumachev said, adding that all now worked exclusively in the civil nuclear industry sector. "Our specialists obviously do not have access to all the essential information, but they file regular reports on their activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." Kumachev's comments followed a report earlier Monday by Japan's JIJI PRESS that Pyongyang has developed a nuclear bomb with the help of Russian nuclear experts. Russian researchers told JIJI that the former Soviet Union was engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build a nuclear bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued to provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang. If confirmed, the reports would provide the first proof that North Korea has nuclear weapons. [passage omitted]
