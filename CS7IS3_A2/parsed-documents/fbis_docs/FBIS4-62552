According to Rybkin, Chinese representatives reiterated that "Russia's coordinates are of priority importance in the Chinese foreign policy." He pointed out that during the talks between the Russian parliamentary delegation and Chinese officials there was a broad exchange of opinions on problems of bilateral ties and international politics. Rybkin pointed out a great role played by the State Duma in the formation of Russian diplomacy and the public opinion, which can be seen from recent parliamentary hearings on the entire spectrum of Russo-Chinese relations. Touching upon prospects for trade and economic cooperation between Russia and China, Rybkin pointed out that there is a big potential in this sphere which was not used up. "The chairman of the Chinese of the State Planning Committee put down in his note-book our proposal to supply Siberian goods to nearby Chinese areas. Russian goods are cheaper than those imported by China, for instance, from Canada, are no worse in quality and more accessible, taking into account a short distance between the partners," Rybkin said. "I believe that a joint Russo-Chinese commission will work to mutual advantage. Russia, possessing the necessary technologies and highly-qualified experts, might take part in a competition for the construction of the hydro-power complex Sanxi on the Yangtze river, which is the biggest in the world. The Russian "Elektrosila" plant in St. Petersburg is unrivalled in this field," Rybkin noted. Later in the day, Rybkin laid a wreath at the monument to people's heroes in Beijing.
