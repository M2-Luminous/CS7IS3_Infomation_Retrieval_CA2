[passage omitted] [Correspondent] Here is the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] commander in chief, Paul Kagame. The RPA have captured the Kanombe barracks and the Kanombe airport. What have you accomplished? [Kagame] We have succeeded in capturing two places as part of our efforts to capture Kigali and restore peace to Kigali. This will be the beginning of the restoration of peace throughout the country. This is important because the airport has many uses. We also found a lot of military equipment, which will help us in our work in case talks do not succeed. [Correspondent] Looking at your targets, are you happy with your achievements? [Kagame] We are happy with our achievements. Many people have been killed unjustly. Many have died but we have been able to save many others who might not be alive had we not done the work. We can continue to carry out the job. I think that our victories will allow us to bring the killers to justice. What is necessary is for our force to bring these people to justice. [passage omitted]
