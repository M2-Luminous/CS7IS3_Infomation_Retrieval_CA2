Our correspondent [Leonor Exantus] tells us that children are dying of malnutrition. [Begin recording, in Creole] One or two children die of malnutrition every two weeks in Gervais. Located at about 30 km on National Road Number One, Gervais is in the fifth section of Saint-Marc, which has about 3,000 inhabitants. The population in Gervais is suffering from malnutrition, whooping cough, tuberculosis, malaria, thyphoid, et cetera, which every two weeks kill one or two children. Two years ago, the sanitary department of Saint-Marc held a vaccination campaign which did not seem to have reached the Gervais population. Furthermore, there is no water in Gervais, not to cultivate the gardens, nor for drinking. It is only when it is raining and the river is high that the people in the area can cultivate rice. According to several peasants, they approached institutions including the Red Cross and the City Hall in Saint-Marc, which advised that they themselves are facing difficulties due to the embargo, and cannot help the people in Gervais. The population of Gervais is sending a call to the natives of Gervais living abroad, to Haitians of good faith who might help them. The people ask for urgent action because the children of Gervais are only skin and bones. If no solution or aid is given to the population of Gervais, fifth section of Saint-Marc, the number of children dying everyday will increase. It should be recalled that in July 1990, a slaughter took place there, killing 12 persons, [word indistinct] houses burned, many missing animals. In addition to all of that, the embargo has created a miserable situation for the people of Gervais. From Saint Marc in Lower Artibonite, this has been Leonor Exantus for Radio Metropole.
