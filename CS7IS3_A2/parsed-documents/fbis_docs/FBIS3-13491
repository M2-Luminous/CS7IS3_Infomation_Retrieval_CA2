"We are just waiting for the Russians to specify their proposal [on a second Middle East conference in Madrid]. [Voykowitsch] Did Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev give any more specific information about that during his meeting with Yasir 'Arafat on Friday evening [11 March]. [Qaddumi] No. He wanted to make the Palestinians agree to a resumption of the negotiations with Israel. Our answer was: First, the two co-sponsors of the peace process must make sure that a UN resolution is adopted and that the Palestinians are granted protection. The United States and Russia must come to an agreement on the guarantees they want to give to the Palestinians that events like the massacre of Hebron will not happen again. First, protective measures must be implemented. Then we can resume negotiations. [Voykowitsch] You have been extremely critical of the Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the beginning. What is the document still worth today? [Qaddumi] I have always been skeptical whether the Israelis consider their signature worth anything. I expected they would keep finding new justifications to delay the implementation of the agreement. We cannot continue with this farce. The Israelis have to withdraw quickly from Gaza and Jericho -- and Jericho covers 345 square kilometers. If this does not happen, the agreement is just a piece of paper that does not commit anybody to anything. [Voykowitsch] How strong are the voices in the occupied territories, which demand a resumption of the armed struggle? [Qaddumi] We have never given up our resistance, and it will continue as long as Israeli soldiers are on our territory. The intifadah is a democratic resistance and it has been supported by the large majority of the international community. It is a legal means of self-defense. [Voykowitsch] How much terrain has the PLO lost to Hamas? [Qaddumi] The problem is not one between the PLO and Hamas. We both pursue the same struggle -- we are defending ourselves. But we have different tactics. Our problem consists of the Israelis. They have undermined the peace process. James Baker, architect of the process, said that we must build trust. But the governments of Shamir and Rabin have only sown new distrust. The Israelis have deprived us of our credibility. Only 20 percent of the Palestinians still support the peace process. The PLO feels committed to the process, but it can continue only if the protection of the Palestinians is guaranteed. The massacre of Hebron has shown again that Zionism is some kind of racism. It was a mistake by the United States to rescind this resolution. Israel's security is still the absolute priority of U.S. foreign policy. Israel gets military support from them and increasingly better weapons. The United States, but also Britain and France, which has just signed an agreement on military cooperation with Israel, must give up their double standards.
