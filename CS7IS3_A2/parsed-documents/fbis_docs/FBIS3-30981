At the proposal of the Serb Radical Party [SRS], the Assembly, by a majority, elected political scientist Branko Vojnic from Beli Manastir as its speaker, while Marko Atlagic and Dr. Milan Ernjakovic, Krajina Serb Democratic Party [SDS] candidates, were elected as deputy speakers. Mirjana Rodic was elected as assembly secretary. Thus all assembly officials were elected from the ranks of the Krajina SDS-SRS coalition. At the end of the constitutive session, and at the proposal of RSK president Milan Martic, the assembly adopted a declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the Serb people in the Srpska republic [RS], in the wake of the open threats and the NATO pact ultimatum. [passage omitted] In the declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the Serb people in the RS, and in connection with the NATO pact's ultimatum, it is stated that this Assembly "received the news of the NATO pact Council's decision to deliver an unacceptable ultimatum to the RS with deep disappointment." Such behavior by NATO pact members, the declaration goes on to say, is profoundly unjust. The intention to use armed forces against the right of a people to self-determination runs counter to democracy itself. "The RSK assembly demands of the state executive organs and of the armed forces that they consider air attacks by NATO to be hostile aggression and that they prevent this by all [available] means, and that they assist the defense of the RS in other ways according to their capabilities. The full consequences of an attack on the RS will be borne by the NATO pact members and the United Nations," it says at the end of the declaration.
