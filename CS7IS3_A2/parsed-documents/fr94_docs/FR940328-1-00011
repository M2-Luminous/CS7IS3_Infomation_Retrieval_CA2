Discussion of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated April 2, 1993, (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1217) Indiana submitted proposed amendment 93&hyph;3 to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Indiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions that Indiana proposes to amend are: 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;2 concerning applicability of the rule; 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;2.5 concerning ultimate authority for the Department of Natural Resources (IDNR); and 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;17 concerning record of the director of the IDNR for surface coal mining permits. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 23, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 21693) and invited public comment on its adequacy. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified additional changes to the rules which had not been previously reviewed and approved by OSM. Consequently, OSM reopened the public comment period to provide opportunity for public comment on those rules which had not been identified as amendments in the initial comment period (September 21, 1993; 58 FR 48996).
