Protestants are convinced they have most to lose from the Downing Street declaration, and loyalist hardliners believe the IRA has proved that violence gains polltical advantage. The result has been a surge in loyalist killings. Peace, seen through the distorted logic of paramilitary calculations, equals war. Despite the declaration's promises of reconciliation, paramilitary gunmen have killed 10 more people in the province in 1994 compared with the same period last year. The rise reflects, in part, the volatility caused by the resurgence of the INLA [Irish National Liberation Army], which has concentrated more in recent months on retaliatory attacks on loyalists. Underlying such shifts in republican paramilitary tactics, however, is the fundamental alienation of the loyalist community. Their sense of betrayal was sharpened by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, which formally gave Dublin a consultative role in the affairs of Northern Ireland. Much of the current loyalist paranoia is also linked to the growing fear that the Catholics' higher birth rate will soon undermine Protestant numerical dominance of Northern Ireland's six counties. The results of the 1991 census appeared to reinforce such anxieties. Catholics were estimated as forming between 41 and 43 per cent of Northern Ireland. That represented a considerable advance on the figures of 10 years' earlier, when many republicans refused to take part in the headcount. Proof that such calculations feature prominently in the loyalist paramilitary imagination came earlier this year with the release of a doomsday plan for repartition to ensure a permanent Protestant majority. Using maps published 10 years ago as part of an academic study on political options for the province, the UDA [Ulster Defense Association] suggested the establishment of an ethnically-cleansed Protestant homeland, which would involve the surrender of the equivalent of least two counties to the Irish Republic. Although the plan chillingly contemplated "expulsion, lnternment or nullification" of those Catholics on the Wrong side of the redrawn borders, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, Ian Paisley MP, welcomed it as a "very valuable return to reality." The document also exposed class divisions. Hardline loyalism is predominantly the creed of an impoverished Protestant working class, which feels isolated in its ghettoes. "Sinn Fein's theory that a last-minute deal can be put together with the middle and upper Protestant classes should not be ignored," the report warned. "lt does have validity." Anecdotal evidence of Protestant farmers being shot or intimidated out of their land along the border in Fermanagh and Armagh is also persuasive. The result has been a growing conviction that neither the Government, police or army can be relied upon to deal with the republican menace. Clashes between the authorites and loyalist paramilitaries have become more frequent and violent in recent years. Earlier this month, the UVF [Ulster Volunteer Force] threatened to extend its paramilitary campaign to the British mainland for the first time. Its targets would be republican activists and Irish officials living in London. John Hume MP, leader of the predominantly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, claimed his increased vote in the European elections was proof of growing support for the peace process and the Downing Street declaration. The immediate evidence of Saturday night [18 June], however, lends greater support to those Unionist leaders who have been sounding alarmist warnings that the province is slipping slowly into civil war.
