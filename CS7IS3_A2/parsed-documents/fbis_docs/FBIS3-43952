[Begin Dhlakama recording] The situation is bothersome because both sides are obliged to implement the General Peace Accord. Actually, I am disappointed with the situation. Yet, I am not prepared to cancel the confinement of troops because that would be helping the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] to continue making mistakes. Earlier we said that if by 22 January Frelimo does not give any explanation we would look into the situation. Right now I am being pressured by our generals in the bush. They want to know why Frelimo is not confining its forces. I cannot give our generals a reason because I do not belong to Frelimo. So, the confinement will continue. We will not stop the confinement process. Right now we are working with the international community to see if it can pressure the Frelimo government. I am waiting for President Chissano to return to Maputo from his vacation to explain to me the situation in his capacity as commander in chief of the Frelimo army and head of state. Likewise, Defense Minister Chipande, Chief of General Staff Hama Thai, and Army Commander Tobias Dai should also explain why they are not sending their troops to the assembly points. [end recording]
