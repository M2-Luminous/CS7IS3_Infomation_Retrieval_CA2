He told Radio N@w Zealand a change in the ban was "not an agenda item". On Tuesday Bolger met with the commander of US Pacific forces, Admiral Charles Larson, the first time in nearly a decade that such a high-ranked military figure has been here. After meeting with Bolger he urged New Zealand to re-think its anti-nuclear stance and consider the benefits of resuming full military ties. New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear laws in 1985 which the U.S. says prevents their ships coming here and has resulted in Wellington being frozen out of the Anzus (Australia, New Zealand and U.S.) Pact. President Ronald Reagan prohibited military contacts and all exchanges between high officials but last November Pres@dent Bill Clinton called for a resumption of ties on "a more normal basis". Bolger welcomed Larson's recognition that the two countries had reached different views on the nuclear issue by following democratic processes. It was a U.S. decision to withdraw high-level military contacts with New Zealand following introduction of the nuclear policy in 1986. New Zealand hoped the U.S. would reflect on that decision and there would be a greater degree of cooperation in future. "What we're getting now, I think, is an important opening up of discussion and that's what I welcome in the visit of Admiral Larson," he said. Although a New Zealand government commissioned study had found nuclear propulsion was safe, the public was not willing to accept such ships. "Clearly if New Zealand was to change its propulsion laws that would be quite significant in terms of U.S. attitudes, but at the moment the New Zealand parliament is not about to do that," Bolger said. The political issue had changed a lot over the past decade, Bolger said. The Cold War had ended and nuclear weapons and testing had been reduced. He was "quite comfortable" with New Zealand's current policy. "It's exactly where the public at large want the policy to be." New Zealanders had told the United States they wanted to work along their own route. "That's been a little difficult for some people but that's where the New Zealand public is. And as I say it's not an agenda item in New Zealand at the present time," he said. "What I think is an agenda item is how we can co-operate and work through with others." New Zealand had a close defence relationship with Australia and had worked in a peacekeeping role with the U.S. in theatres of conflict like the Gulf War and Bosnia. New Zealand defence forces were becoming increasingly involved with peacekeeping of a higher risk than in the past. "I think New Zealanders would accept that and say that's the defence responsibility New Zealand can and should take up," he said.
