FBIS4-37529 "drnes120_g_94003" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Sudan Ummah Party Denies al-Mahdi Involvement Ummah Party Denies al-Mahdi Involvement NC2106170094 London MBC Television in Arabic 1600 GMT 21 Jun 94 NC2106170094 London MBC Television Arabic BFN [Text] On the telephone to MBC today, the Sudanese Ummah Party, through former Interior Minister Mubarak Fadil al-Mahdi, denied the Sudanese government's accusations that al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the party and former prime minister, was involved in a conspiracy against President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir. The Sudanese authorities arrested al-Mahdi and two of his aides on suspicion that they and foreign intelligence agencies planned to overthrow the government. [Begin Fadil recording] We believe the arrests were made because the regime is besieged politically, economically, and diplomatically. As the regime approaches the celebration of five years in office in 10 days, it feels the earth being shaken beneath it. It therefore decided to launch this attack on the opposition leadership and on the biggest political bloc in a futile attempt to obstruct the movement for change in Sudan. The accusations and their scenario were prepared in a naive way. Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi will emerge innocent, and we consider this to be a malicious political and security act. This is a political battle that we will wage against the regime until the end. [end recording]
