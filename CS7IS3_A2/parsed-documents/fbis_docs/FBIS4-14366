These remarks were made during an inauguration ceremony of a hospital built by Israel in the Shiite village of Bint Jubayl at the cost of $1 million. Our correspondent Menahem Horowitz reports from the north. [Begin Horowitz recording] [passage omitted] Gen. Antoine Lahd, who met Israeli correspondents prior to the ceremony, said that the SLA has no objections to joining the Lebanese Army in future. Over the last year Israel provided $7 million in civilian aid to the residents of south Lebanon's security zone. In this hospital in Bint Jubayl alone Israel invested $1 million. Israel wants to prove to south Lebanon's population -- mainly the Shiites -- that despite the political negotiations Israel will continue to provide them with all possible aid. [end recording]
