ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from Architectural Coatings, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing, Storage of Petroleum Products, Organic Liquid Loading, and Can Coating. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for this approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to: Daniel A.
