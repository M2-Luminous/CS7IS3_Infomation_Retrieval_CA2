In an article published today, the newspaper says: While the Iraqi leadership's envoy meets with the UN secretary general again to put him in the picture of the situation, he is aware that the UN secretary general knows how far Iraq has implemented its obligations and the nature of the effective cooperation shown by Iraq throughout the past years. The envoy wants to emphasize to the secretary general the importance of activating the performance of the international organization in a manner that ends the pressuring and dictating policy imposed on it. The newspaper says the Iraqi message of facts that reviewed Iraq's commitment to the text and spirit of UN resolutions in accordance with the sequence of paragraphs of these resolutions, and the state of dismay demonstrated by the representatives of Washington and London, have accurately reflected the extent of infraction and insistence on harming Iraq and the Iraqi people. This also showed the extent of hatred and arrogance that is pursued by Washington and its subservient agents. AL-THAWRAH adds it has become visible to all that the first and final objective is a political one, and that the subject is more than a commitment to the spirit of resolutions in spite of the injustice and haphazardness of these resolutions. It adds that briefing the Security Council on the facts and asking it to abide by what it approved has exposed everything. Silence is no longer acceptable, and this has been recently echoed by several permanent members who admitted the positive Iraqi steps. AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing that this new change is based on Iraq's steadfastness, firmness, and the jihad and courage of its people in patiently enduring afflictions. The coming days will bring news about the greatest victory over the tyrant and the collapse of the siege of the unjust.
