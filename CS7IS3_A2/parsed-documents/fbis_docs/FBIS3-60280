It approved several projects that will be implemented in cooperation with the EC and Middle Eastern countries. The Cairo meeting is the first of several planned by the Economic Development Committee during its meeting in Copenhagen on 8 and 9 November. A program called the Copenhagen Work Program was drawn up then. The agreement reached today provides for four agricultural projects to be implemented with the cooperation of Egypt, the occupied territories, Israel, and Jordan. Agreement was also reached to implement a project involving cleaning up pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba and preserving marine life and coral. This project will be carried out with the help of the gulf's littoral countries. Agreement was also reached to carry out a joint tourism project involving Egypt, Israel, and the occupied territories. Dr 'Adil al-Biltaji, chairman of the board of directors of the Egyptian Agricultural Research Center and Egypt's representative at the meeting, told MENA that agreement was reached to establish four networks through which expertise and data will be exchanged with the aim of promoting research in various spheres. Dr. al-Biltaji explained that the first sphere is connected with natural resources, notably desert plants, and ways of protecting them. He said each regional country will make efforts in one particular sphere and all the resulting information on available natural resources will be exchanged and coordinated. He said this project will be carried out through the joint efforts of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey and in coordination with Italy. He added that the EC will provide financial backing for this $125-million project. Dr. al-Biltaji said the second project is connected with the effects insecticides have on the soil. The aim is to minimize the use of insecticides and prevent harm to people, plants, and natural resources like water. [passage omitted]
