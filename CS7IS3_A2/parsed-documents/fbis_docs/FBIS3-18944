The "massive trend" to transfer production to cheaper locations continues in German industry. At the same time, foreign companies have only a limited interest in investing in Germany. Due to high labor costs, Germany has lost 10 percent in world markets over the past few years. Necker welcomed the fact that the costs of the latest wage round in the metal industry are "practically zero." What is worrying, however, is that it was not possible to increase working hours. Necker said that "an incredible amount of legal work disappears in the shadow economy." Therefore, the deductions from wages that are far too high, with taxes and social contributions currently amounting to 46 percent of the gross wages, must be reduced together with the surcharge on companies' labor costs. This is the only way to reduce the "wedge" between legal and illicit work and to increase the opportunities for legal work that exist in many fields. Necker cautioned against considering his meeting with Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politicians as spectacular. "We have not switched to the other camp"; industry has always been open-minded and has always discussed technical problems with all democratic forces. Thus, Kohl, Rexrodt, and Scharping will be speaking at the BDI annual conference on 31 May. In fact, the SPD is still thinking "too much in terms of redistribution." It is not a matter of adding a burden here and reducing one there, but significant cuts must be made in the public sector. The public share must be reduced to the 45.6 percent it was before reunification. Necker expects the economy to show an "upward trend without momentum" in the course of this year. Orders, particularly from overseas, are increasing considerably. Engineering is one sector where the export situation has clearly improved, while domestic demand has further declined from a basis that was low anyhow. In the new laender, there are "clear positive developments in certain fields." These include the construction industry and related sectors, in particular. The development of east German industry producing for local markets is "basically positive." Meanwhile, there are the first positive signs in the "transfrontier sector." The situation is, however, critical in the chemical industry and in large parts of the electrical and engineering industries.
