FBIS3-34144 "drnes024_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 SYRIA Paper Urges Israel To Address `Substance' in Talks JN0302083394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 3 Feb 94 JN0302083394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli discourse on peace in the Middle East and the prospects for achieving it is lopsided. This discourse misrepresents facts, and is full of contradictions. The paper discusses statements by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, in which he said that the dispute with Syria concerns substantive issues, contending that the problem lies in the level of representation in the negotiations. TISHRIN reacts to these statements, saying: If the problem concerns substance rather than form, why then this Israeli determination to continue to raise the issue of representation in the negotiations, particularly since the negotiations should not be an end in itself? As a matter of fact, the negotiations should be a means to achieve an end; namely, the attainment of just and comprehensive peace, which should not lend itself to various interpretations and over which there should be no bargaining. TISHRIN adds: Middle East peace must be just and comprehensive. It must be grounded in the relevant international resolutions. It must also result in the return of the territories to their rightful Arab owners, as called for in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which provide for the complete Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967; namely, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and the Golan, not to mention the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in implementation of Resolution 425. TISHRIN wonders: Why has Israel failed to respond to the ideas and principles reiterated by leader al-Asad at the Geneva summit--the very ideas and principles which were accepted and, indeed, espoused by the United States to accelerate the peace process? The paper says: The United States has also acknowledged Syria's leading role in the peace process. The ball now is in the Israeli court. Israel is well aware that had it, at least, heeded the Madrid conference formula, and sincerely honored the provisions enshrined in the U.S. peace initiative, chief among which is the provision regarding the principle of exchanging land for peace, the peace process would not have run into all these snags, difficulties, and traps. Similarly, the peace process would not have reached a dead end. In one of its articles, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the evasive Israeli policy toward the peace process, saying: Israel, which has flooded the world with sweet words, particularly after the Labor Party assumed power, has concluded the Gaza-Jericho accord with the Palestinians to evade commitment to the peace process as outlined at the Madrid conference. The paper adds: Israel forced its dictates and conditions in the vague Gaza-Jericho accord, the implementation of which has run into difficulties, although it is an Israeli formulation for Palestinian autonomy. Since the conclusion of this accord, Israel has been promoting partial settlements, contending that it needs time to digest the Oslo accord. This shows a desire on its part to evade commitment to the peace process. It is to be recalled that Israel showed a great reluctance to join this process in Madrid in the first place. The paper addresses the Israeli stand toward the Syrian role in the peace process, saying: Israel has rediscovered that it cannot overlook Syria's role and position, which have been acknowledged by the U.S. Administration and the world at large. The entire world community has realized that Syria has a basic and important role to play on all tracks of the negotiations. This role is required if just and comprehensive peace is to be achieved, and if the region is to enjoy security and stability. The paper concludes by saying: Syria has constantly reiterated its stand toward peace, which must be grounded in the relevant international legitimacy resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. This is essential if peace is to be just and comprehensive. Such peace will certainly benefit the region and the world at large.
