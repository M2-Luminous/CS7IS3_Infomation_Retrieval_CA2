This amount represents 0.5 percent of the European budget and is just the tip of the iceberg. Estimates indicate that in fact 10 percent of European subsidies have been improperly allocated, of which a fraction only has been recovered. In the last 20 years, only just over 10 percent of identified fraud in the agricultural budget has been recovered. The principal explanation for these poor results is that responsibility for combating fraud lies in the first instance with the national authorities. They alone have the police services and legal apparatus, carry out checks in the field, and notify the EC of cases of fraud. Although the Treaty of Maastricht expressly states that European states should combat fraud involving European money just as stridently as fraud involving their own money, in practice they put their own interests first. This is especially true as far as subsidies from the structural funds for regional and social development are concerned. In this case, control is exercised by the very same authorities that request the money. Proposals to give the EC more powers in this area have encountered the opposition of member states, primarily Great Britain where politicians are nevertheless frequently given to complaining of fraud in the European Union (EU). The EC's role is thus limited to coordination, support, and encouragement. Whenever an EC official is present on the spot, it is always announced in advance and he is accompanied by a national civil servant. The member states had even planned to trim the EC's antifraud budget, but the European Parliament put a stop to that. This year, as many as 50 experienced investigators may be involved in following up suspected fraud, which is nothing compared to the scale of the problem. The second problem is the complexity of many regulations and directives. They virtually amount to an invitation to find the loopholes. Agricultural policy, which still swallows up half the EU budget, has certainly not been made any more transparent since the reforms. Europe has a budget for everything, from grants for suckling cows up until guaranteed prices for carcasses at a fixed weight, compensation for fallow land included. More limited policy areas, such as culture and consumer protection, are also teeming with subsidy possibilities. To be honest, obscure money transfers do not only occur in Europe. Telephone Number A third problem is the lack of cooperation between national authorities. In order to know whether products really have been exported to a third country, they are dependent on documents from that third country. This is not always a simple matter. But even within the EU member states, the cooperation is far from perfect, and border controls have disappeared. There is no uniform definition of what exactly constitutes fraud of the agricultural budget and sanctions are not uniformly applied. Faced with these problems, the EC is now seeking to appeal to the people themselves. It is planning to set up a free call number where citizens can report on suspected fraud while enjoying total anonymity.
