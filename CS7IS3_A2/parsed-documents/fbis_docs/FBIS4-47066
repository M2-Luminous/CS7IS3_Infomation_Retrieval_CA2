Everything seems to point in the direction of the country's president speech in the Supreme Council being the "No. 1 news item" not only of the past seven days but of all of June. However, Nursultan Nazarbayev's speech in the parliament is only the tip of the iceberg called the economic life of Kazakhstan. A number of events, which also happened lately, point in this direction. While the head of the state was unfolding before the deputies a broad picture of the republic's coming market-democratic prosperity, Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin consulted on the subject of the much-suffering anticrisis program with a group of economic managers and businessmen especially close to the government and formalized as the Union of Industrialists and the Congress of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan. True, neither side heard anything special at this conference. But the intensity of consultations on this issue, so characteristic of late, suggests that the Cabinet of Ministers, if not in June then at the beginning of July, will finally be able to say something concrete on the subject of its program. It remains to be seen, though, whether an agreement on it will be reached in the parliament and among economic managers. During this time the government also managed to set up a commission on operational production and financial matters headed by Mssrs. Zhabagin, Urkumbayev, and Makiyevskiy. Its tasks, as indicated by the name, practically fully coincide with those guiding the similar Russian commission headed by Oleg Soskovets, who is well known in our republic. Whether he was the one to suggest the idea of such a structure to our authorities, or they came to it on their own, is no longer important. The interesting part in this case is that having handed to the "operational commission" (which has practically unlimited powers) the reins of decisions on urgent questions of economic life of the country, the government once again tried to keep a good face while playing not so nice a game. That is, no matter what the president may say about his designs, the current Cabinet of Ministers team will persist in looking for a solution to the global issues of economic reform in overcoming momentary problems and mini-problems, in the sacred belief that this is what strategy of state administration really is. Meanwhile, unpleasant incidents are occurring one after another in the "hope and pride" of the head of state's market transformations--privatization. One day it comes out that State Privatization Fund Chairman Mr. Baishev, together with Mr. Orynbasarov, director of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of State Property] Information and Records Center, permitted a transfer of coupons of some investment funds to the accounts of other funds. And the bureaucrats, caught redhanded, had no choice but to correct the "mistake," along with a disciplinary thrashing. Or suddenly employees of the Zhayremskiy Mining and Enrichment Combine (GOK) learn to their surprise that their enterprise, already converted to joint-stock ownership (and also, as an entity of strategic importance for the republic, due to be privatized through a custom-designed arrangement), had been for all practical purposes sold at the second coupon auction as a simple and very small plant of local significance. To all the puzzled questions of the producers of polymetal and iron-manganese ore, Goskomimushchestvo responds with a solid wall of silence. As for Kazpotrebsoyuz [Kazakh Consumers Union], which became the owner (it was its five funds that very fortuitously and "accidentally" purchased 46 percent of GOK's shares), it is now trying to prove the unprovable, namely, that there was not, and is not, any collusion (bureaucratic and commercial) in this respect. When one learns, however, that precise lists of enterprises going to be offered at coupon auctions are given to investment funds only one hour before the auction opens, one unwittingly starts wondering about the vicissitudes of behind-the-scenes games in the current privatization. Especially considering that the example of the active "creativity" of Mssrs. Baishev and Orynbasarov is still fresh on one's mind. The most interesting part, however, is that an enterprise, which by all laws and state programs is not subject to privatization for at least the next couple of years, belongs (or, to be more precise, belonged) to the state holding company Ak-Sunkar and, correspondingly, to the republic's Ministry of Industry. Now, having lost its potentially mighty piece, the ministry's brass only shrug their shoulders and express extreme unhappiness with the events. Naturally, one could go on fantasizing on this subject, keeping in mind that the former head of Zhayremskiy GOK, who left it not in the nicest way, became the deputy chairman of Goskomimushchestvo. But let other organs do this. Let us rather think: How can it happen that one organization (Kazpotrebsoyuz) could have five (!) investment funds at the same time, which theoretically allows it to buy today any enterprise put up at auction as part of mass privatization. Why then, one wants to ask, did we introduce restrictions on the number of shares of economic entities that can be purchased by one investment fund? In short, there obviously is something to look at both for the Antitrust Committee and other oversight bodies in the republic.
