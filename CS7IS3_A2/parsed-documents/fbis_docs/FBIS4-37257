A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has categorically denied the report carried by the news media of the ruling military regime in Sanaa this evening that our military aircraft raided the city of al-Hudaydah and bombed the electricity-generating station at Mocha. The source confirmed that this report has absolutely no truth and is part of the cheap misleading information for which the stooges of the ruling military regime in Sanaa and their other news media have become famous for. This is known to everyone in the two parts of Yemen and, indeed, in the Arab homeland and the entire world. The responsible source warned that this media report carried by the Sanaa media could be a new pretext to continue the shelling of the economic installations as well as the peaceful residential quarters in the Aden Governorate. The ruling military regime has grown accustomed to this recently after failing to achieve the strategic and military objectives of the war. This is a matter on which we cannot remain silent and it will be confronted with force.
