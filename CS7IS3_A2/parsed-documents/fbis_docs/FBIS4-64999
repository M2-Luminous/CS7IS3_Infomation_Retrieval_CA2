Soares met Eduardo dos Santos after Nelson Mandela's swearing-in ceremony, and he has given details of the conversation. [Begin recording] [Soares] [passage omitted] I had a very positive conversation with Eduardo dos Santos. I can say that it was probably the most useful conversation I have had with him. First, I found him very perceptive, I found him very conscious of the situation, and very willing to move toward a cease-fire. I also think this is the time for a cease-fire in Angola. I also spoke to Butrus-Ghali. President Eduardo dos Santos asked me to speak to Savimbi, which I will try and do. [Unidentified correspondent] Are you going to intercede? [Soares] No, I am not going to intercede, I am going to talk. I am going to try to talk -- it is not easy to talk to Savimbi, I have no direct channel of communication. He is the one who sometimes telephone me. I will see if I can ask him to telephone me. I would like to talk to him because this is definitely the time for peace. [end recording]
