Announcing this on Wednesday, the African National Congress said its members and those of the mass democratic movement had nominated Dr Chikane out of recognition for the contribution he had made in working for a just and non-racial society. However, because of his appointment as a member of the Independent Elections Commission he was not eligible to stand election. The ANC and Dr Chikane had agreed that his name would be removed with immediate effect from all nominations lists, either for the National Assembly or for any of the provincial parliaments, the statement said.
