On the occasion, the head of state delivered a message that he described as "a message of peace and security for all," even if meetings are held during which some people threaten to disrupt peace in Cote d'Ivoire. "No social trouble will be tolerated," Mr. Bedie warned, when answering the speech made by Mr. Jean-Baptiste Angama, the chairman of the PDCI-RDA teachers federation. President Konan Bedie refrained from any lengthy speech on schools with regard to the period of mourning we are observing in Cote d'Ivoire. He nonetheless stressed the essential role played by teachers in the training of the youth, a role the head of state is willing to "support and facilitate any time the need arises and when we have the necessary means to help." In view of the current situation, the president of the Republic called on his visitors to above all "strive to safeguard what has already been achieved and of which peace is the first victory." "Cote d'Ivoire wants to live in peace," he insists. "We should not play with peace. Peace should be an attitude. We should mobilize to ensure peace at all times." He added, "Oh, I know pretty well that a lot of nonsense is now circulating in Abidjan spread by irresponsible people, and what they are saying does not contribute to a sense of peace. We are regularly briefed on their meetings, which take place night and day in Abidjan, with plans to disrupt the peace Ivorians are enjoying.... I can assure you that, before or after the funeral of President Houphouet-Boigny, Ivorians always want peace and a peaceful atmosphere. I would also like to say that no disturbances will be tolerated. Let us suppose that a plot exists in that sense. We would resolutely crush the plotters. We have an eye night and day on these meetings, wherever they are held." In conclusion, the head of state praised the exemplary sense of patriotism showed by the members of the PDCI-RDA teachers federation. [passage omitted]
