Kranidhiotis said the proposal was removed during the discussion. Objections were mainly raised by France, which wants the institutional operational framework to be set first; Germany, which links the issue with Turkey; and Britain, which links the issue with progress in the Cyprus issue. The secretary general added that what we have achieved is that the next expansion phase will certainly include Cyprus and Malta. He said what is more important is that Cyprus' accession is no longer linked to developments in the Cyprus issue. He concluded that the issue of beginning accession negotiations will be raised many times before 1996 in order to achieve a commitment for the beginning of negotiations.
