Nearly 40 percent of the electorate would cast their votes for the party led by Jose Maria Aznar, which would mean a 17-percent increase on the 1989 European elections and winning 26 or 27 seats out of a total of 64. The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] would come second, with 31 percent of the votes and 22 European deputies. Abstention would be less than 15 percent of voters. The escape of the former Civil Guard director general, the "Ibercorp affair," with the jailing of former Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio and former Madrid stock exchange trustee Manuel de la Concha, the Filesa affair -- in short, corruption -- could take their toll and cost the PSOE very dear if the current voting intentions for the European elections persist. According to an opinion poll conducted by "Gruppo" for ABC, citizens' voting intentions have undergone a considerable change since the last elections. Whereas in 1989 the PSOE prevailed with 40 percent of the votes, while the People's Party won 21.7 percent, it would now be Jose Maria Aznar's party which would win the support of 38.5 percent of the electorate, as against the Socialist Party's 31.7 percent. In terms of the number of seats, the People's Party could see the figure from the last elections increased by a dozen, since it could hold 26 or 27 -- the same as the PSOE four years ago -- while Felipe Gonzalez' party would win 22, representing a loss of five European deputies. The other political parties would scarcely change their position. The exception is United Left [IU], which, if the voting intentions shown in the poll persist until 12 June, would double its number of votes and seats. In 1989, Julio Anguita's candidates won 7.3 percent of the votes, which enabled them to hold four seats. The figures indicated by the poll are much more encouraging; IU could win the support of 14 percent of the electorate, which would be equivalent to nine or 10 seats. Convergence and Union would also experience an improvement, although less marked than IU's. Jordi Pujol's party could gain a seat (rising to three from the two won in 1989), thanks to the votes of 4.7 percent of the electorate. The aforementioned four parties could share 60 of the 64 seats which Spanish citizens have to elect. The four remaining seats would be distributed as follows: One for the Nationalist Coalition (comprising the Basque Nationalist Party, the Canary Islands Coalition, the Valencian Union, the Aragonese Party, and the Majorcan Union), and between one and three for PEP (comprising Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity], Republican Left of Catalonia, Comunero Land, and the Castilian Regionalist Party), the Greens, and Andalusian Power. The Social and Democratic Center Forum, with 0.8 percent of the interviewees' votes, would secure no European deputy. According to the opinion poll, only 13.7 percent of citizens have expressed their intention not to vote. Hence the turnout would be quite high, since 57 percent of voters, who have firmly stated that they will vote, would go to the polls, plus another 18.4 percent undecided. In addition, the level of abstention would not differ between men and women (13.7 percent of both sexes), although 3 percent more men than women will go to the polls. Last, abstention will be greatest among the voters who voted for IU in the last elections.
