In July military experts will start to elaborate a presentation document on aspects of Russian-NATO cooperation, Grachev told a news conference at the Defence Ministry on results of his meeting with Joulwan. Some 1994 arrangements totalling 30 will be specified, and plans for 1995 military cooperation will be made more detailed. The Russia-signed framework document of the partnership for peace program and the Russia-NATO protocol to the program with the same name open up diverse prospects for military cooperation, said the defence minister. The meeting agreed to open NATO posts in Russia and Russian posts at the NATO Supreme Allied Command and NATO Command Headquarters, as well as establish telephone communications between the Russian armed forces' general staff and the NATO Supreme Allied Command. In the opinion of Pavel Grachev, bilateral cooperation will also involve fleets and districts "up to military units". Cooperation plans provide for participation of the Russian Defence Ministry's staffers in NATO exercises as observers and negotiations of the Russian armed forces' general staff and the NATO Supreme Allied Command. The main condition of these relations is the account of Russian interests and adoption of well-coordinated decisions, said the Russian defence minister.
