The officials said both Hata and Kohl agreed that regional groupings should be open to maintain free trade. Hata pledged Japan's efforts to keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as a mechanism to supplement the general agreement on tariffs and trade, the officials said, adding Hata supported closer dialogue between APEC and the EU. The 12-nation EU is expected to expand its membership to include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Hata met with Kohl after talking with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel about Japanese and German bids to win permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Hata and Kinkel pledged to cooperate with each other in the UNSC bids, officials said. Hata and Kohl, meeting for three hours, also shared the need for Japan, Germany and other countries to support Russia's reform efforts and maintain equal partnership, the officials told reporters. On North Korea, the two leaders also stressed international solidarity to address Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, although Hata said Japan believes channels of communications with North Korea remain open to achieve a negotiated settlement. Asked by Kohl about China's political landscape in the future post-Deng Xiaoping era, Hata said the collective leadership under President Jiang Zemin is functioning and predicted no drastic change in China's open-door policy, officials said. Hata arrived in Bonn on the third leg of a European trip with previous stops in Italy and France. He will visit Belgium next. In his talks with Kinkel, Hata said permanent UNSC seats for Japan and Germany would benefit UN activities, and Kinkel said Germany shares the same view. Hata and Kinkel expressed their shared concern over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program, urging Pyongyang to dispel suspicions about the nuclear issue, the officials said. Kohl said in the course of his talks with Hata that he gets tired as Japan changes its prime ministers every two years, according to Japanese officials. They said Hata responded, "I will do my best" to stay in power longer than his predecessors. Hata's immediate predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, was in power for only eight months.
