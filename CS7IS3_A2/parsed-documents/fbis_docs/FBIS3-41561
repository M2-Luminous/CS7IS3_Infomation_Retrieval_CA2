The agreement is expected to be signed when a top Japanese Government leader visits China, the sources said. The date of the leader's visit to China has not yet been fixed. Air pollution in rapidly industrializing China is believed to be partly responsible for acid rain in East Asia. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen and other acid rain-causing emissions originate from the burning of fossil fuel, such as coal and oil. Acid rain damages buildings, kills fish by acidifying lakes and rivers, and is believed to be fatal to trees. Japan has sealed similar environmental agreements with the United States and South Korea, but the accord with China is the first to refer explicitly to the problem of acid rain. The government places high hopes in the joint battle against acid rain, all the more since Beijing and Seoul vowed cooperation on air pollution in an agreement in October. ``Together with the Japan-Korea agreement on environment protection we will be able to proceed on a trilateral basis with joint acid rain research and counter-measures,'' an Environment Agency official said. The agreement will also stipulate regular consultations to set up a network of survey stations to measure air pollutants in line with a five-year agency project, which aims at determining how much of Asia's acid rain originates from Chinese and South Korean emissions. China released 160,000 tons of sulfur oxide into the air in 1991, according to the Chinese Government, an amount 15 times greater than that released by Japan. While the Chinese Government concedes that sulfur dioxide emissions will continue to increase with the country's rapid economic growth, it questions whether domestic pollution affects other countries. ``We have a lot of acid rain in China, too, but I don't think that pollutants from China cause acid rain in Japan,'' Xie Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection Bureau, said recently in dismissing such allegations. Jiro Kondo, chairman of the Japan Science Council, welcomed the agreement as ``basically good,'' but warned of a biased approach to acid rain. ``Actually, desulfurization devices and other technological support are necessary. Cooperation will only be fruitful if we avoid viewing Japan as the country suffering from pollution, while terming China the polluter,'' said Kondo. Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) voiced misgivings the envisaged treaty could cause. A conflict of responsibilities among government bodies could arise, if existing MITI projects in China are included in the framework. MITI started environmental dialogue with China's State Planning Commission in April 1992 and supports the country with an annual amount of 6 billion yen for testing of desulfurization and smoke filtration plants and the dispatch of experts. If subject to the treaty, MITI projects would require approval by the Foreign Ministry and the Environment Agency. Officials fear that the time-consuming procedures -- often more than two years from application to the final approval -- would hamper an effective and flexible response to China's environmental problems.
