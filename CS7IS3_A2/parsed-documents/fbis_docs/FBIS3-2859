Addressing a press conference sponsored by the current session of the National People's Congress, Liu said that last year, output of cotton and sugar-bearing crops fell sharply because of natural disasters and poor management of product varieties in some areas of the country. He said that inadequate macro regulations over the grain market, irrational farm crop structure, and many other factors fueled sharp price rises after grain price was set free late last year. This year the Ministry of Agriculture has sent three working teams to major rice producing areas to ensure an overall rational plantation structure in an attempt to keep the grain market stable. Asked whether farmers' income has decreased, he said that the average income for farmers nationwide has not decreased. But he said that growth rate of farmers' income is relatively low comparing with that of their urban cousins. He blamed it on the widening gap between prices of agricultural products and those of industrial products, and on the concentration on the sole business of planting, which cannot provide enough jobs for all workforce in rural areas. According to Liu, the country has a rural workforce of 430 million. Among them, 50 million have left their homes to seek jobs elsewhere. And six million more come after them every year.
