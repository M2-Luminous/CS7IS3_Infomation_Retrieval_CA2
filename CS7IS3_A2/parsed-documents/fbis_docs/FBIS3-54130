In a briefing to military correspondents, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq said that under the IDF's 1994 work plan, the IDF will maintain the same level of alertness on the Golan Heights as it has had for the past few years. The reduction in the number of Hizballah attacks, Major General Shahaq said, is linked to the political process, in which Syria is participating, and there is no doubt that Syria will continue to use Hizballah according to its political needs, as it has done in previous years.
