Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman and Chinese Deputy Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, the United States agreed not to impose the quota reductions of up to 35 percent threatened two weeks ago, while China agreed to take strict measures to crack down on the illegal transshipment of textiles to the United States. Mr Shi said both parties were "satisfied" with the agreement and had pledged to work closely together to ensure such disputes did not arise again. The agreement was in the interests of both China and the United States and would also be of considerable benefit to Hong Kong and Macau, he said. Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade Minister, hailed the agreement as a breakthrough after months of fruitless talks between Beijing and Washington. "The strengthening of our co-operation will not only help to strengthen our bilateral economic and trade relations but also promote peace and world development," Ms Wu told Ms Hillman before the pact was signed yesterday. "We should join hands on cracking down on middlemen and hope for close co-operation to implement the agreement," Ms Wu said. Ms Hillman said she was also pleased to announce the agreement. Under the U.S. trade system, textile trade is controlled by agreements that set export quotas for different kinds of cloth products. The United States claimed that China has exceeded its quota by US$2 billion (HK$15.5 billion) a year, mostly by shipping goods with fake labels through third countries. In a briefing for the mainland and Hong Kong press after the signing ceremony, Mr Shi admitted that China had been using "fraudulent means" to violate the quotas established by the last Sino-American bilateral textile agreement. But he said such fraudulent and illegal activities damaged the interests of both countries and had led to "chaos in the market". Although the United States has agreed not to impose drastic cuts on Chinese imports this year, China did agree to accept some quota reduction but no more than three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally trans-shipped. However, the exact quotas have apparently yet to be worked out. In addition to the trans-shipment issue, China also agreed to major adjustments of some categories of the textile quota proposed by the Americans. MOU was only a prelude to a full bilateral textile agreement, Chinese trade officials said. But China has agreed on a key issue of trans-shipments of Chinese textiles to the United States via third countries. It will significantly step up its inspection of local and joint venture textile exporters to ensure that transshipments are controlled. China will rigorously enforce its own laws and regulations and severely punish those companies found to be engaging in illegal activities, Mr Shi said. Companies will have their export licences cancelled and in certain cases legal proceedings will be taken against the company managers and directors responsible. China also agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to accompany Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile factories on the mainland, providing the factories concerned agreed, Mr Shi said. The deputy trade minister said that both parties had made "great efforts" and each side had made compromises to ensure that an agreement was reached. But while a tentative agreement has been reached, analysts said it would be several months before it could establish if China's promise to crack down on transshipments really was being implemented. "This is obviously an encouraging sign, but it remains to be seen if China can live up to the agreement," a Western diplomat in Beijing said. Yesterday's agreement came just two days before U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's scheduled visit to China. Mr Bentsen will become the highest ranking Clinton administration official to visit China.
