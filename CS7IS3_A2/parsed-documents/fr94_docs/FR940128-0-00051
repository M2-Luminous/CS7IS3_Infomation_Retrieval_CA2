FR940128-0-00051 FR940128-0-00022 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931075&hyph;4012; I.D. 100893A] RIN 0648&hyph;AF47 Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; final apportionments of the 1994 Pacific cod total allowable catch among gear types and seasons. SUMMARY: NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 24 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and issues final regulations to implement the amendment that allocates the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) among vessels using trawl, hook-and-line or pot gear, and jig gear through 1996. These regulations also authorize seasonal apportionments of the portion of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Consistent with the regulations implementing Amendment 24, NMFS also specifies 1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear through 1996. This action is necessary to allocate Pacific cod among specified gear groups to respond to socioeconomic needs of the fishing industry that have been identified by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). It is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Amendment 24 and the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review/final regulatory impact analysis (EA/RIR/FRFA) may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, Alaska 99510 (telephone 907&hyph;271&hyph;2809). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS at 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI are managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in accordance with the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. At its June 1993 meeting, the Council adopted Amendment 24 and recommended that NMFS prepare rulemaking to implement the amendment. A notice of availability of Amendment 24 was published in the Federal Register on October 15, 1993 (58 FR 53497), and invited comment on the amendment through December 7, 1993. No written comments were received. A proposed rule to implement Amendment 24 was published in the Federal Register October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57803). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through December 6, 1993. Five letters addressing eight comments were received and are summarized and responded to in the Response to Comments section, below. Amendment 24 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce on January 5, 1994, under section 304(b) of the Magnuson Act. This amendment establishes FMP authority to allocate the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using different gear types and to seasonally apportion gear allocations of Pacific cod. Upon reviewing the reasons for Amendment 24, and the comments on the proposed rule to implement it, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation and management and implements the following three measures through December 31, 1996, under authority of Amendment 24.
