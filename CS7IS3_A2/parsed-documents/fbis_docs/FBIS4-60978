Due to the sharp restriction in the supply of fuels to the Almatynefteprodukt association and the Munayavtomatizatsiya joint-stock association, the dispatch of fuel to all enterprises and organizations, apart from those directly providing the city's vital facilities, is to be prohibited until special instruction. Tough restrictions on the supply of electricity to consumers have been introduced. In certain districts of the city, the temperature of hot water has been reduced to 40 degrees Celcius. Speaking on republician television, the city's mayor Zamanbek Nurkadilov said that neither the prime minister nor his deputy wishes to discuss the present situation with him. "If the prime minister does not want to meet the city's head," Nurkadilov said, "and if other high-ranking officials also ignore the city's problems, then the natural question arises: Whyt do we need such a government?" The mayor expressed hope that the leadership of those regions which supply the capital of Kazakhstan with coal, petroleum products, and gas will not remain indifferent to the emergency situation that has been introduced.
