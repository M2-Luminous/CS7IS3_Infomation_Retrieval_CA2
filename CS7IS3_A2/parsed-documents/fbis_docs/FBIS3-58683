[Pact for Italy leader] Mariotto Segni and [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi will meet and will probably say "I do." The path has been set out, and fate has determined this final test. As long as it means that he can block the way to the left-wing forces, as long as it means that he can defeat "statism" and -- why not? -- "centralism," Segni is about to accept Bossi's embrace, to sign the pact. The pact was announced the very day of the television appearance by the leader of the moderate front opposite [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto, the leader of the alignment to be defeated. There will be an electoral agreement with the League, Segni told his men at his headquarters on Largo del Nazareno: In order to ensure victory we need to win over the North. Without the League, it will be a futile struggle. So.... But his trials cannot be said to be over: He still has to persuade [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] Martinazzoli to sign the armistice and, above all, to convince Berlusconi that his television venture is better, much better, than his electoral one. Rooting for Italy is fine -- but without Silvio Berlusconi. On the last day of the First Republic Mario Segni explained to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi what he wants to achieve, and with whom. A liberal-democratic alignment in which there is a place for the League, too. Speaking in the Lower House, he said: "There seem to be two opposing lines within the League. One advocates adhering to the old destructive proposal, while the other advocates focusing on the struggle against statism. Whoever is concerned about Italy's future hopes that the latter line will prevail. It is up to the League to choose clearly and definitely whether to remain entrenched in the destructive position or to contribute constructively to Italy's progress." There is no need to ask; the decision has been made. Indeed, the time is almost up for the League. The tough-guy approach has failed, and what is needed now is "reason" and "balance." Bossi said: "If Segni has something to tell us, he knows where to find us; if the potential is there, it will show itself and we will see it in the coming days. We are certainly not yielding the initiative to him: We have been making openings since before the end of the year. There has been no response. Of course, we command the votes in the North...." In any case, according to Bossi, the League is the "cornerstone of a liberal-democratic alignment. Segni has no votes. More than anything, he is a point of neutralization, the center of the compass, a potentially useful image." He paused for breath, then continued: "There is still time for an agreement; there will be time until the day before the lists are presented. Segni only has to call my secretary's office." That was a small lie. Segni has already called him. Bossi admitted: "Within a matter of hours, some of my closest aides will be meeting with Segni or his trusted representatives. What is certain is that we have already made an official commitment to meet." Additional proof that this is precisely the case, that is, that the time is ripe, is provided by remarks made by representatives of the Pact. The Republican, Guglielmo Castagnetti, explained: "We consider relations with the League crucial, because we believe that all the liberal-democratic forces must unite." The enemy can only be defeated through unity: "If the moderates stand divided into two or three lists, clearly a defeat becomes inevitable." In any case, according to [Pact member] Alberto Michelini, "on programs, there is an almost perfect identity of views between us and the League. Furthermore, once the conditions of Italy's unity, solidarity, and the strengthening of local government have been accepted, there are no more problems." Yesterday evening Mario Segni was a guest on Telemontecarlo. Corrado Augias set him against Achille Occhetto. Segni's attack on the progressive leader focused on his favorite topic -- state control. He cited figures, names, amendments, and parliamentary documents. Segni was very well prepared. Augias stopped him and asked: Will you be the leader of a government thanks to votes won by the League? "There must be a political agreement; I would rather lose the elections and remain consistent." Only with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] is there no chance. "We have no dealings with the MSI." The ball was back in Occhetto's court, and this time the issue was Communist Renaissance. What did he have to say about it? "Our only preconditions have to do with matters of policy, not ideology. It is not to be assumed that the government accord that we put forward will embrace all the forces with which we have an electoral agreement." The duel continued. What about Berlusconi? "He is the enemy of the genuine liberal-democratic forces," Occhetto said provocatively. Segni renewed his advice to Berlusconi -- It is better for him not to allow himself to be dragged into electoral contests: "I still hope that he will not enter the arena." His lavish praise for [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli -- "an example of courage and extraordinary consistency" -- revealed his continuing coolness toward Berlusconi.
