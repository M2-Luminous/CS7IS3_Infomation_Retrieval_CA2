Previously, there was a common understanding in society; that is, whenever the CPC propagated unity within the party on a grand scale, it meant that there were problems concerning the issue of unity. Today the CPC is behaving more honestly and has refrained from saying a lot of high-sounding words. In stressing the necessity of unity, instead of using the tune of propaganda, it admitted the existence of differences and disputes. The issue of unity within the party's Central Committee is very serious as well. Deng Xiaoping recently talked about this issue, which reflected that organizational crises also exist in the party and government organs, including the Political Bureau, the State Council, and so on. Jiang Zemin Relayed Deng's Remarks on Unity Within the Party to Senior Officials The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an enlarged meeting, the first in 1994, in Zhongnanhai on 20 and 21 January. Present at the meeting were members and alternate members of the Political Bureau, secretaries of the Central Secretariat, members of the Central Military Commission, state councillors, some vice chairmen of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and some persons in charge of central departments and commissions. At the meeting, Jiang Zemin transmitted to the participants remarks that Deng Xiaoping recently made on the issue of unity while in Shanghai. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "At present, both the domestic and international situations are favorable to us. The question is how we can further emancipate our minds and tightly seize and treasure the current rare historical opportunity to push forward reform, tackle the difficult problems in the course of reform, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth with a view to achieving the second-step strategic objectives of the national economy and social development. I repeat: The crux now lies in the unity of the central leading body. It should be a genuine unity aimed at a common goal. Unity is necessary for the Political Bureau, the State Council, the NPC Standing Committee, and between the State Council and the NPC Standing Committee." Deng also said: "The Communists must always place the party character and the cause of the party and people in the primary position. Review and examination on this issue should be conducted frequently. If the issue of unity is properly resolved, what difficulties cannot be surmounted? What problems cannot be tackled? The political intervention and economic sanction of the hegemonism and the subversion of the antagonistic forces will be totally defeated by us." Deng Xiaoping's remarks are clearly aimed at something. He said in early October last year: "Unity is necessary within the central leading body. Members of the leading body should not think that they are always right and therefore refuse to accept others' merits. Many problems have cropped up because some of them do not pay serious attention to party character and the sense of responsibility for our cause so that they have not been able to forge a solid unity." Contradictions Escalated After the New Body of the State Council Was Formed At the beginning of last December, the Political Bureau made a decision that Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, with the coordination of Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Yang Dezhi, and Gu Mu, should have talks and exchange views with Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing of the State Council and some vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, including Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li Ximing, Chen Muhua, and so on. These people are the leading stars who have been contending with one another to play their roles in the farces. Since the conclusion of the 14th CPC National Congress held in November 1992, tension has surfaced in the new CPC Political Bureau and Secretariat. In April 1993, the contradictions escalated in the wake of the formation of new leading bodies of the State Council and the NPC Standing Committee. They are reflected in the relations between Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing; between Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Bingqian; between Tian Jiyun and Zou Jiahua; between Li Lanqing, Wang Bingqian, and Chen Muhua; between Wang Bingqian and Chen Muhua; between Ding Guangen and Wei Jianxing; between Li Tieying, Wang Hanbin, and Ren Jianxin; and between Tian Jiyun and Chen Xitong. At meetings, they took advantage of discussions on work and policies to criticize and attack one another. The most prominent instances were the attack on Tian Jiyun from all sides and the censure against Zhu Rongji. Zou Jiahua Indirectly Criticized Tian Jiyun for Lacking Party Character At a group meeting during the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Zou Jiahua said: Quite a few tasks have not been performed on schedule. In many cases, it is because the relevant legislation has not been enacted, but in some there were man-made reasons. Some people have talked about the legal system more glibly than others, but what did they do in reality? When the people who are responsible for economic work in the NPC Standing Committee went to the grass-roots units, they often made unrealistic comments as well as open and groundless criticism against other comrades instead of conducting investigation and study or holding discussions with the relevant departments of the State Council and the localities. As members of the Political Bureau, do these kinds of actions demonstrate their party character? Have they not had an impact on others? Did they ask the Political Bureau and the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee for instructions before making such comments? Here, Zou Jiahua referred to Tian Jiyun's speech made during his inspection in Hunan Province, which, in Zou's opinion, "had gone a bit too far." Wang Hanbin and Others Reported Tian Jiyun to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Last October, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li Ximing, and Ni Zhifu, among other people, reported to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection that Tian Jiyun attacked other Politburo members by innuendo when talking with some members of the NPC Standing Committee in the name of Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, that Tian received remuneration for writing inscriptions four times without reporting the matter to the leadership, that Tian's family was engaged in speculative stock activities in Shanghai and Shenzhen, that Tian found an excuse to travel in Europe with a certain delegation using public funds, and so on. Later, approximately 20 state councillors, ministers, and members of the NPC Standing Committee jointly wrote a letter to Jiang Zemin and Deng Xiaoping, saying that Tian Jiyun spread rumors among the cadres in various ministries and commissions to this effect: He is a target to be squeezed out, he has been assigned the position on a temporary basis, and the rising stars in the political arena are Zhu Rongji, Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, and Zhang Wannian. Deng Xiaoping gave his written instruction to the effect that, if people had different opinions, it would be better for them to sit down and exchange their views. Will Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, and Hu Jintao have a talk with Wang (Hanbin), Zou (Jiahua), and Tian (Jiyun)? A source said that Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, and others often wrangled at Politburo meetings, and many times Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Chen Xitong, Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, and so on left ahead of time during the debates at the Politburo and State Council meetings. Li Lanqing Attacked Zhu Rongji Without Mentioning Him by Name At a group meeting of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Li Lanqing assaulted Zhu Rongji without mentioning him by name. Li said: Even though I am a vice premier, I am not very clear about some of the views that the State Council maintains. However, there was such a comrade who issued directives and made decisions the moment he took up his post, and on what grounds did he act like that? I should like to ask whether he did so after collective discussions. We still need principles in giving guidance to the economic work. At present, central regulation and control at the macro level has had a certain effect, but the problems have not been fundamentally resolved. How can we say that the desired result has been basically produced? The central authorities do not hold such a view, and no resolution on this has been made. Li Lanqing's above remarks were directed against what Zhu Rongji and Guangdong's leaders had said earlier. The discord within the Political Bureau and State Council naturally has shocked Deng Xiaoping. Deng asked the general secretary to act as a mediator, and other CPC elders also made their positions known one after another upon being informed of the above situation, hoping that they would turn big problems into small ones and small ones into nothing. Wan Li and Yang Shangkun have aired their opinions in this connection. Wan Li and Yang Shangkun Aired Their Opinions on the Discord Among the Senior CPC Officials When talking with some Politburo members, state councillors, and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee in early December last year, Wan Li pointed out: In my opinion, the fact that senior officials within the party are on bad terms owing to different views primarily originates from individualism, whereby some people drew over others to attack and criticize a certain person at meetings, and went on to engage in a cross attack by writing joint letters after the meetings. By so doing, they have concentrated their energies on the evil affairs and, as things go on, they will be engaging in sectarianism. This is very dangerous and has seriously damaged the authority of the central leadership. During his meeting with a group of former members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection coming to spend their holidays in Zhuhai at the Zhuhai Hotel on 22 January, Yang Shangkun said: The central authorities should resolve the issue of unity in order to maintain the authority of the central leadership. Only by so doing can the party's line be comprehensively and actually put into practice. According to an informed source, Wan Li's view that the internal conflicts within the party "will develop into sectarianism" was not overstated. Conversely, he did not say it bluntly. As a matter of fact, sectarianism has existed because there are a number of people in the Political Bureau and State Council who want to elbow out Tian Jiyun and attack Zhu Rongji. Of course, this is a comparatively outstanding aspect of the contradictions and not the whole of them. It is no wonder that Deng Xiaoping is very anxious about the issue of unity within the party Central Committee. If a solid unity cannot be forged or the contradictions further develop when the old man passes away, can he prevent and stop the outbreak of "disturbances" or "drastic changes" from the nether world?
