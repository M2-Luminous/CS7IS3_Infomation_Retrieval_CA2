The existing agreement calls for the supply of heat to the Sevastopol Naval School by one of a group of Black Sea Fleet technical networks. Captain 2nd Rank Yevhen Rozhnov, in charge of this network, informed the Institute leadership that the heat would be turned off after 30 November in accordance to demands by the Black Sea Fleet Command, explaining that this measure was due to a lack of heating oil for the boilers. The heat network was to be closed up and sealed, to "freeze" the institute. The report pointed out that some thousand cadets were the hostages of this disruption, which occurred despite the fact that the Institute had made full payment for November and, despite financial difficulties had promised to make prior payments. In a subsequent article Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on 25 December 1993 on page two showed the Sevastopol Naval Institute efforts to continue operations in spite of the heat being turned off since the beginning of December. The article disputed the explanation that the disruption was due to a lack of fuel in the Black Sea Fleet. It maintained that the 1760 tonnes of heating oil set aside in the summer would have been sufficient for the winter. But on 16 August a document arrived from the Black Sea Fleet, breaking the 30 July agreement for fuel service to Ukraine's Navy. The article maintained that the Black Sea Fleet took the oil from Ukraine's Navy to settle accounts with other Ministry of Defense units. The report rejects Black Sea Fleet explanations and states that, "This violation of the juridical side of the agreement forced Ukraine's Navy fuel service to appeal to an arbitration court over the disputed material."
