FR940429-0-00178 FR940429-0-00015 (3) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly on vocational institutions. In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received comments supportive of the NPRM. For example, these commenters favored the increased protections for students in the changes to the refund provisions, and approved of the strengthening of the administrative capability and financial responsibility standards. Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates. Discussion: As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations on institutions and third-party servicers, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not just to institutions and third-party servicers but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities. In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as excessive detail in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, thus providing institutions more flexibility to meet a particular requirement in the manner that best suits their needs. The final regulations make it quite clear that the Secretary continues to bear the primary responsibility for enforcing standards and requirements to ensure that institutions and third-party servicers administer Title IV, HEA program funds properly. The Secretary does not believe that the Department's role overshadows those of the accrediting agencies or the States. These regulations not only speak to the responsibilities of each member of the triad, but also establish the Federal requirements for institutions and third-party servicers under the HEA. Therefore, the Federal role in these regulations may appear larger than that envisioned for the States and accrediting bodies, but this appearance is due to the inclusion of the implementing regulations for these responsibilities. Without question, the States and accrediting bodies will exercise their responsibilities by promulgating and implementing standards for HEA program participants, and the Secretary anticipates that any overview of all such requirements by the triad would show that the Federal role has been appropriately established. The Secretary notes that some of the commenters specific concerns are addressed in the Analysis of Comments and Changes section of these regulations. Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this reason, the regulations apply to all institutions. Changes: The specific changes to the regulations are discussed below. Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions Subpart A_General Section 668.2␣General Definitions. Academic Year. Comments: Many commenters argued that the proposed definition of a week in determining the length of an academic year should not be based on the number of days of instructional time for institutions that use clock hours to measure program length. These commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be based on the number of clock hours completed by a student. Some of these commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be defined as 24 clock hours; another commenter suggested 30 clock hours. A number of these commenters suggested that this approach was more consistent with the regulatory requirements for calculating pro-rata refunds, which relies on the number of clock hours completed by students. Discussion: Section 481(d)(1) of the HEA requires that an academic year must be a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time in which a full-time student is expected to complete at least 900 clock hours at an institution that measures program length in clock hours. Thus, the statute requires a minimum of 30 weeks and a minimum of 900 clock hours; both standards must be met. Changes: None. Comments: Many commenters recommended that the Secretary implement the provision in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that provides that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks of instructional time. Many of these commenters suggested that ``good cause'' should be based on educational outcomes, such as placement rates or completion rates. Some commenters suggested the same standard that was proposed for short-term programs in §668.8_a 70 percent completion rate and a 70 percent placement rate. Other commenters suggested that approval by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency or State postsecondary review entity (SPRE) would demonstrate good cause. Some commenters suggested that good cause should be based on whether an educational program has historically provided instruction for less than 30 weeks in previous academic years. Other factors suggested for defining good cause included fiscal stability of an institution, scheduling adjustments due to natural disasters, ethnic composition of an institution's student population, an accelerated or concentrated educational program, and educational programs that offer advanced placement. Some commenters recommended that no reductions in the 30-week minimum should be permitted or that reductions should be approved on an extremely limited basis in order to avoid inequitable treatment of institutions and students. Discussion: The Secretary did not propose specific criteria to implement this technical amendment in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, but instead requested comments on a definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of implementing this provision that addressed the Secretary's concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many institutions to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical amendment through regulation. In an effort to discourage routine requests, the Secretary will grant a reduction for institutions that can demonstrate a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, but will not permit the period of reduction to exceed two years. For institutions that do not demonstrate a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that suggested approval by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency or State body that authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary programs should be considered as factors in determining good cause on a case-by-case basis, but such approval may not be a sufficient reason for granting an institution's request. Other factors that should be taken into account include the number of hours of attendance and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique circumstances that justify granting the institution's request. The Secretary does not believe that placement rates, completion rates or other educational outcomes that may measure the quality of an educational program are relevant in determining whether the instruction offered in less than thirty weeks is sufficient to justify a reduction in the minimum standard. Other factors suggested by commenters may qualify as unique circumstances that justify granting the institution's request, depending upon the context in which these factors are presented in a particular case.
