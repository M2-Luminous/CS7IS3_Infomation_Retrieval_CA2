FR940328-0-00032 FR940328-0-00012 Based on a specimen collected by Lydgate in Niu Valley on Oahu, Hillebrand described Pterotropia gymnocarpa , the specific epithet referring to its entirely free and naked (lacking a covering) fruit (Hillebrand 1888). Sherff (1952) renamed the species Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa and split the species into four varieties (varieties pupukeensis, leptocarpa, megalocarpa , and gymnocarpa ) (Sherff 1952, 1953) that are considered synonymous in the latest treatment of the genus (Lowrey 1990). Other names by which this species has been known include Pterotropia gymnocarpa var. pupukeensis (Degener 1938), Heptapleurum gymnocarpum (Drake del Castillo 1890), and Dipanax gymnocarpa (Heller 1897). Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa , a member of the ginseng family (Araliaceae), is a tree 8 to 33 ft (2.5 to 10 m) tall, either hairless or with fuzzy, short-lived hairs on the young leaves and flower clusters. The leaves are 12 to 22 in (30 to 55 cm) long with 7 to 21 leathery, oval to elliptic leaflets per leaf. Each leaflet is 2.8 to 7.1 in (7 to 18 cm) long and 1.2 to 3.1 in (3 to 8 cm) wide, and is folded upward along the midvein. The flowers are usually arranged in threes or in an umbrella-shaped arrangement. Petals are 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 8 mm) long and usually number 5 or 6 per flower, with an equal number of stamens. The ovary, which usually has 3 or 4 sections, appears placed atop the receptacle (base of the flower) in a superior position, due to the expansion of the ovary disk (outgrowth of the receptacle) and the reduction of the hypanthium (basal portion of the flower). Fruits are purplish, oval or top-shaded drupes, 0.2 to 0.5 in (6 to 12 mm) long, that enclose a papery endocarp and single seeds. Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa is distinguished from all other species in the genus in that its ovary appears fully superior (Degener 1938; Degener and Degener 1962a, 1962b; Hillebrand 1888; Lowrey 1990; Sherff 1952, 1955). Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa was historically known from Punaluu, Waikakalaua Gulch, Mount Olympus, and the region between Niu and Wailupe, all in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (Degener 1938; HHP 1991k3, 1991k12 to 1991k14). Fifteen populations are now scattered along the summit ridges of the Koolau Mountains over a distance of 28 mi (45 km), from the region of Paumalu at the northern extreme to Kuliouou and Waimanalo at the southeasternmost point (HHP 1991k1, 1991k2, 1991k4 to 1991k11, 1991k15 to 1991k18, 1993c1, 1993d2; HPCC 1991e; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). One population in the Waianae Mountains, located on Palikea ridge on the border of Federal and private lands, was last visited in 1954; it is not known whether it still exists (HHP 1991k8). Most populations contain between one and six individuals, giving a total of fewer than 40 individuals for the entire species. However, because T. gymnocarpa is difficult to distinguish from other species when infertile, the total number of individuals may be as high as ``a few hundred'' (J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa is typically found on windswept summit ridges or in gullies in wet or sometimes mesic forests between elevations of 820 and 2,790 ft (250 and 850 m) with such associated plant taxa as 'ohi'a, olapa, uluhe, kopiko, Labordia tinifolia (kamakahala), and Myrsine fosbergii (kolea) (HHP 1991k1, 1991k2, 1991k4 to 1991k7, 1991k9, 1991k11, 1991k14, 1991k15, 1991k17, 1991k18, 1993d1; HPCC 1991e; Lowrey 1990). The major threats to T. gymnocarpa are competition with the alien plant taxon Koster's curse, feral pigs, and reduced reproductive vigor due to the limited gene pool because of the small number of extant individuals. Previous Federal Action Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, Hesperomannia arborescens (as H. arborescens ssp. bushiana and ssp. swezeyi ), Lobelia oahuensis, Melicope lydgatei (as Pelea lydgatei and P. descendens ), and Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa (as T. gymnocarpa var. pupukeensis ) were considered to be endangered. Huperzia nutans (as Lycopodium nutans ) was considered to be threatened, and Chamaesyce deppeana (as Euphorbia deppeana ) and Eugenia koolauensis (as Eugenia molokaiana ) were considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant species named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or threatened or thought to be extinct. The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication.
