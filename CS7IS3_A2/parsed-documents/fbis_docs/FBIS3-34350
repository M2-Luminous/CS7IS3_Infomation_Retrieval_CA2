He added that his party will help this authority to emerge from this status and gain popular and constitutional legitimacy, provided there is goodwill and a true desire to restore normalcy in the country. In remarks to AL-AHRAM, Mehri pointed out that the society's real problems cannot be solved through institutions that lack legitimacy and credibility. Asked if his party will accept any responsibilities or positions in the Transitional National Council (parliament) or in the new Algerian Government, Mehri said the FLN will accept no responsibility in running the country's affairs during the transitional period, adding that the period's political objectives are shrouded in ambiguity. On the national dialogue conference, which the party has boycotted, and his assessment of it, Mehri said: It was supposed to conclude the dialogue that started over 18 months ago but the dialogue deviated from the natural course we expected it to take. He noted that for the FLN, the goal of the dialogue is to agree on comprehensive and political common grounds envisaging solutions for the various security, constitutional, institutional, economic, and social problems and to form a national coalition based on these common grounds. He added: But the dialogue turned into an attempt to recommend the successor to the Higher State Council and extend the transitional period for another three years with the same policy and views applied in the past two years. He noted that this was why his party boycotted the conference, because its results could neither change the political, security, and economic realities in the country nor draft any clear-cut policy to confront these problems. He added that this does not mean that the party rejects dialogue, because dialogue is a necessary means to solve problems, but that what counts is the dialogue's nature. Asked about possible developments, Mehri said that the situation in Algeria is very difficult, noting that emergence from the current crisis will require all the political and social forces to agree on how to end the violence. He added: It also requires taking the appropriate measures to restore full constitutional life based on the 1989 Constitution and to call on the people to contribute to running their own affairs through elected municipal, legislative, and presidential councils.
