FR940325-2-00028 FR940325-2-00006 [C&hyph;533&hyph;812, C&hyph;508&hyph;808] Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigations: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From India and Israel AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie Anne Osgood (India) or Elizabeth Graham (Israel), Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0167 and 482&hyph;4105. The Petition On February 28, 1994, we received petitions in proper form filed by the U.S. Fittings Group on behalf of the United States carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') industry. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.12, petitioner alleges that manufacturers, producers, or exporters of the subject merchandise in India and Israel receive subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''). Injury Test India and Israel are each a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act. Therefore, Title VII of the Act applies to these investigations. Accordingly, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') must determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from India and Israel materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Standing Petitioner has stated that it is an interested party, as defined in section 771(9)(E) of the Act, and that it has filed the petitions on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the merchandise subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, in accordance with 19 CFR 355.31. Scope of Investigation The products covered by these investigations are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent, welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( e.g. , threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Pipe fittings come in several basic shapes: ``elbows'', ``tees'', ``caps'', and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these proceedings is dispositive. Initiation of Investigations The Department has examined the petitions on pipe fittings from India and Israel and found that they comply with the requirements of section 702(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.12. Therefore, in accordance with section 702(c) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13 (a) and (b), we are initiating countervailing duty investigations to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of pipe fittings in India and Israel receive countervailable subsidies. The following programs are included in our investigations. India 1. Rebates Under the International Price Reimbursement Scheme 2. Pre-Shipment Export Loans 3. Post-Shipment Export Loans 4. Advances Licenses 5. Use and Sale of Additional Licenses 6. Sale of Replenishment Licenses 7. Income Tax Deductions Under Section 80HHC 8. Market Development Assistant Grants 9. Export-Promotion, Capital Goods Scheme
