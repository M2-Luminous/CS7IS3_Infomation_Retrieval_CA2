This result, which the Caracol Network has predicted, coincides with figures provided by the National Advisory Center after an opinion poll was taken among 35,000 people. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, with a remarkable improvement, received 14.77 percent of the vote. Ernesto Samper Pizano, 56.75 percent. This result has not accounted for blank votes; had these been considered, de la Calle would have received 14 percent versus Samper Pizano's 53.8 percent. [Begin recording] [Announcer Dario Arizmendi] Dr. de la Calle, good afternoon. [De la Calle] Good afternoon, Dario; glad to greet you. [Arizmendi] Same to you. Congratulations for the result, which is considerably higher than that predicted by the week's earlier opinion polls. [De la Calle] Undoubtedly. I am happy and want to tell you this is a good result. I have been in public life for only one year and think this has been a success, particularly for independent voters. I will write soon a paper that I intend to send to Dr. Samper accepting his victory and saying it was a clean and democratic victory. I will add, however, we are undoubtedly the second largest liberal force, that we will be present in 1998, that in that year I expect to take my ideas of constitutional development, renewal, and change to the Presidency, and that the message for me is one of optimism, gladness, and recognition of the people who have believed in our political proposals. [Arizmendi] Considering this high percentage of votes in the second round, as you said, the fact that you have been in political work for barely one year and [words indistinct], what do you expect in the new liberal organization that Samper Pizano had announced previously? Do you think you can rightfully claim the chance to run for the position of vice president of the Republic? [De la Calle] As I have said many, many times, I have ruled out the possibility of running for vice president. I am sure I must keep after ideals; this is based on principles, ideas, and the renewal process I helped push forward in 1991. I will keep on working. I thank my voters; they can rest assured I will run for president in 1998. Meanwhile, all I want is to recognize Samper Pizano's triumph. All of us liberals should sit down and make a sustained effort to update the party, to push it forward, and to strengthen the liberal platform with the various political inclinations expressed today. My immediate invitation is for Dr. Samper to study these various shades of liberalism, to create a platform incorporating all of them despite their differences, admitting opinion polls have been useful, that there is a process to reinforce the Liberal Party's unity. This unity, as I have said many times, is programmatic rather than arithmetical. I am open to discuss programs and platforms to consolidate a triumphant Liberal Party program. [Arizmendi] Do you intend to work with the same fervor and zest as before, now that you have attained the second highest percentage of votes in the Liberal Party? [De la Calle] I intend to sit down soon with Dr. Samper to discuss this new and revived Liberal Party program, which must include and revolve around renewal, change, participative democracy, and social policy. I think the moment demands a programmatic and ideological process of discussion, which should be the true basis for a true Liberal Party unity. I recognize his victory, but I think it is necessary to go one step beyond the figures. In a few minutes, I will invite Dr. Samper to make this programmatic effort to unify liberalism in depth where the unity is genuine; that is, ideas. [Arizmendi] Very clearly, Dr. de la Calle has admitted Dr. Samper's victory and announced he will address a note to him in a few hours. De la Calle expects to meet with Dr. Samper in a few days to discuss the Liberal Party's future. De la Calle also announced he will run for president in 1998 and that he would never run for vice president on a single ballot with Samper, who came out a clear winner in the Liberal Party primary. Carlos Lleras de la Fuente expresses his opinion on this result. He only participated in the campaign for three weeks but received 7.8 percent of the vote, without accounting for blanks, and 8.22 percent considering blank votes, after the primary was held with 35,862 interviews conducted by the National Advisory Center. Dr. LLeras de la Fuente, good afternoon and welcome to the Caracol Network. [Lleras] Good afternoon; how are you all? [Arizmendi] Very well, Sir. Are you happy and satisfied? Did the result take you by surprise? [Lleras] I am very happy. Although the campaign lasted barely 20 days, I received 8.22 percent of the overall vote; this is more than a success, a success which I believe has never been seen before in Colombian elections. [Arizmendi] Did you expect a percentage this high? [Lleras] I have always been optimistic; so I expected to obtain very good results. The figures confirm the people responded to the call to vote according to their consciences. [Arizmendi] With this result in mind, do you intend to run for the 1998 elections, as de la Calle just announced? Or will you initiate some political exercises of a spiritual nature before making any decision? [Lleras] I think you still remember my spiritual exercises in parks. Beginning tomorrow, I will do spiritual exercises until the Liberal Party convention, when I will make a final decision. This result is very encouraging for anything I may have in mind for the future. [Arizmendi] Will you support Dr. Samper's presidential candidacy for now? [Lleras] Of course. This is the pledge I made when I entered the Liberal Party primary. As I have always said, a gentleman's pledge must be complied with, regardless. [Arizmendi] If Dr. Samper asks you, will you tell him your profile of the candidate for vice president? [Lleras] I do not know what Dr. Samper will ask me. I talked with him last night. I intend to phone him in a while to congratulate him for his victory and reiterate something that had already been said by Dr. de la Calle and that I had already proposed. I am referring to the need to create a permanent ideological platform for the Liberal Party, not one created every time there are elections, rather, one that can be a guide for the next government and the party's future.
