The festive groundbreaking at the tank farm in the refinery at Vohburg in the suburbs of Ingolstadt, from where a 170-km-long oil pipeline will start on the German side, yesterday signaled the actual first stage of work on the movement of oil from Germany to the Czech Republic. The groundbreaking immediately preceded the signing of a Bavarian-Czech agreement on the takeover and sharing of guarantees for so-called uninsurable damages, an agreement which was the culmination of virtually six months of work by experts on both sides to obtain the approval of the Bavarian parliament regarding the approach to the right-of-way through which the pipeline will pass. With a view to the interests of Bavarian landowners, the Munich Government is assuming guarantees for any damages that could occur, for example, as a consequence of natural catastrophes or because of the halting of pipeline operations. The Czech side would compensate such claims with an amount of 80 million German marks [DM], taken from resources of the National Property Fund which it deposited with the Czech National Bank. For the Bavarian side, the agreement was initialed by Michael Schneider, chief of the Office of the Ministry of Economics and Transportation; for the Czech side, by Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund, Jan Princ, first deputy chairman of the National Property Fund, and Karel Siedler, director general of the corporation for the construction operation of the pipeline from Ingolstadt, Mero CR, corporation. Part of the signing also involved a proposal for a letter to be exchanged by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus with his Bavarian counterpart, Edmund Stoiber, according to which the Czech Republic would pledge to fulfill all its commitments, even after the possible demise of the National Property Fund or the Mero firm. Radomir Sabela, Czech Republic deputy minister of industry and commerce, who also participated in the signing ceremony, call yesterday's action an important step toward the independence of the Czech petrochemical industry from Russian oil. According to the deputy minister, the Munich parliament should adopt a law on the pipeline construction and on the possibilities of temporary access to land parcels of property owners who were resisting the project, at the latest by 20 May. T. Jezek several times emphasized the forthcoming nature of the Bavarian side in that connection. Together with representatives of Czech diplomatic circles in Bonn, Jezek expressed his conviction that the German side would issue the building permit to initiate construction of the pipeline portion in the fall. According to the view expressed by a high-ranking official of the Bavarian Ministry of Labor, Reinhard Schug, whose ministry grants such permits, Munich is not planning to take the step until November or December. Even so, the need not be a threat to the deadline for starting test operations of the pipeline, which the Czech side optimistically is counting on for September of next year. More realistically, operations could begin by the end of 1995. The tank farm site, construction of which began as of yesterday, thanks to the preliminary permit issued by the Bavarian Government, is located on 6.5 hectares of land which should soon become the property of the Czech Republic. It will even house a repumping station for oil fed in from Trieste.
