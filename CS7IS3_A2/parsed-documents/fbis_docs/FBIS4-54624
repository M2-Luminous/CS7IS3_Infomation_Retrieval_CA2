According to some calculations, a four-member family living in a 60 square meters household will pay 161,200 zlotys more for thermal energy in April than in March. Subsequent price increases have been planned for: 1 July (by 15 percent), and 1 October (by 20 percent). (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 29 Mar 94 p 7) POPULAR PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM: The Ownership Transformations Ministry informed during a press conference that the Popular Privatization Program currently covers 367 enterprises and companies, with a list of another 110 enterprises being prepared and to be debated by the Council of Ministers' Economic Commission after Easter. Six enterprises are on the list of units excluded from the program. The program is of an open nature so it will be possible to include more companies in it, or -- if the program is successful -- repeat it in the future. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 30 Mar 94 p 7) TIRE FACTORY REPORT: The Olsztyn-based Stomil SA Tire Factory achieved the kind of economic results last year which are a good indicator for the company's future. The company's net profit was over 240 billion zlotys whereas the average salary among the 3,400-person employee crew was 6.2 million zlotys per month. The company exports 25 percent of its products to 10 countries around the world and it has invested $30 million in redevelopment and modernization of production of supplementary types of tires (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 30 Mar 94 p 9) SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES: According to Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Edward Nowak, during its session on 30 March, the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted the idea of establishing economic zones in line with the concept of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. A special team will prepare the final bill by 15 April. The special economic zones are supposed to be established particularly in regions characterized by high unemployment and by economic potential that is not being used (Mielec). KERM recommends that such zones also be established in areas close to the state's borders. Among other things, the bill will ensure maximum tax allowances and exemptions for companies which set up business there. This solution would be initially treated as an experiment and only three or four zones would be established within the next two or three years (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 31 Mar p 5) EXPORTS DECREASING: According to Professor Urszula Plowiec, the balance sheet of the economic policies of the consecutive governments from 1989 is positive because it resulted in a rapid economic growth, overcoming the recession, curbing inflation, and stabilizing the unemployment level; however, all this occurred at the cost of the development of exports. The authors of the report believe that the fact that the share of exports in the Polish Gross Domestic Product in recent years has been on the wane results first of all from one fact: the Polish economy was not adjusted to the requirements of foreign markets and could not be changed before the economy was stabilized. Contrary to optimistic forecasts by the government, this trend will be maintained this year as well. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 31 Mar p 5) MINISTER RETURNS FROM CHINA: Transportation Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki returned from a trip to China where he was heading a Polish delegation. The seventh session of a Polish-Chinese governmental commission resulted in an announcement that the trade ties between the two countries in the year 2000 should reach the level from 1986, that is over $1 billion. The current negative trade balance will be eliminated by the end of 1994. The Chinese owe Poland several dozen million Swiss francs which they will pay back by supplying merchandise (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 2-4 April 94 p 21) BANK STOCKBROKERING PROFIT: In 1993, Bank Zachodni SA reached a profit of 18 billion zlotys on its stockbrokering activities for the first time. The amount constitutes 2 percent of the entire profit earned by the bank last year. This year, the bank will make 30 billion zlotys worth of investments in order to develop its stockbrokering services. The money will be spent primarily on increasing the volume of technical equipment (communications, computer network) and also on extending the premises to cover additional sites. Currently, the bank has 60 branches throughout Poland but just 23 stockbrokering services units (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 5 April 94 p 17) FINANCIAL MOOD IMPROVING: The Main Commercial School's Institute for Economic Development reports in its most recent survey that optimism among Polish families regarding their financial situation and moods, is clearly increasing. The number of families whose situation did not deteriorate in the last three months, is also on the increase. Polish families are still mostly concerned with the big impact of price increases on their situation, despite the fact that according to data by the Main Statistical Office, price increases this year have been much slower than last year. For the first time in many months, a substantial portion of families reported an improvement in the level of consumption of food products. The increase of optimism was as much as over 10 percentage points compared with the previous quarter. Factors shaping the situation of family households are considered to be mainly associated with income levels, savings levels, and optimism level with regard to the future (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 5 April 94 p 14) MARCH ECONOMIC INDICATORS: The indicator of the country's economic situation increased by 2 percentage points in March compared with February. It seems that trends of an economic growth are becoming stable, as demonstrated by an increase in both domestic and export-bound orders, an increase in the productivity indicator (including with regard to export-bound production), a fall in the reserves of ready-made products, and also a decrease in the rate of price increases. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 6 Apr 94 p 7 ) PRICES INCREASES SLOW: According to the Finance Ministry, prices on merchandise and services increased by 1.6 percent in March. Food prices increased by 1.4 percent, alcohol prices -- by 4.4 percent, and prices on services -- by 1.7 percent. The ministry predicts that throughout April, prices on consumption items will increase by 2.1 percent even despite the fact that this year's budget contained a 2.3-percent increase. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17) PHONE EMPLOYEES RAISES: Employees of "Telekomunikacja Polska SA" will receive 1.345 million- per-person raises before the end of the year. This will cost the company about 1 trillion zlotys. The first installment will take effect as soon as April. The company's spokesman denied allegations by Sejm Deputy Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party, that the raises will be implemented at the cost of investment expenditures. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17) HIGHWAY COMMISSION SESSION: A working inter-ministry group for highway construction has held its first session. Individual ministers and local governors have quite a lot of comments on a draft law which is to be debated by the government in May and by the Sejm in June. The program envisages construction of about 2,600 kilometers of highways by the year 2007. In order to implement the program, apart from money, appropriate legislative acts are also needed which would regulate the construction works and the subsequent usage of the highways. With that goal in mind, the Council of Minister's Economic Committee established an inter-ministry group at the end of January, whose task is to come up with all the necessary legal provisions. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 8 Apr p 10) CHANGES IN ECONOMIC POLICIES: During a meeting at the American Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol announced a widening of the scale of state interventionist policies. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was an unofficial guest during the meeting. The minister's speech at the Chamber is widely perceived as very important as a majority of those present took it to be a sign of changes to come in Polish economic policies. Minister Pol said that the branches where restructuring will take place the soonest, are the shipyard industry, steel works, the energy, fuel, and defense industries. Plans for restructuring these ministries have already been prepared. Minister Pol noted that the state will only deal with the restructuring of the most important branches while the others will have to find their own best ways for the future. American businessmen were informed that the Polish Government will not hesitate to introduce protectionist measures, especially in those branches which will be subjected to the restructuring process. Pol also said that he can see no obstacles for foreign investors in Poland and he described the requirement of prior Internal Affairs Ministry approval for purchasing land in Poland -- which has been criticized by American businessmen -- as a "normal procedure and also a protection for the state against awkward situations." (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 13 Apr 94 p 11) PETROBALTIC OIL CONCESSION: Based on an agreement signed on 13 April in Gdansk with the Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry Ministry, the "Petrobaltic" company was granted a concession to excavate oil from the undersea B-3 pool which is located approximately 70 km north of Rozewie. The pool's capabilities will make it possible to conduct oil excavation for a period of 12 years, with an efficiency rate of 500,000 tons per year -- this according to Jan Kurek, "Petrobaltic"s manager. The company is not just interested in the Polish shelf. Currently, it is the only oil company in the Baltic Sea which has the right equipment, experience, and personnel to conduct oil exploration and excavation. Talks are in progress regarding "Petrobaltic"s possible involvement at a site near Kaliningrad. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 14 Apr 94 p 3) TRADE WITH CROATIA: Croatian Economy Minister Nadan Vidosevic paid a visit to Warsaw where he stated that despite low levels of trade exchange with Poland up to now, the situation is getting back to normal. Vidosevic said that one can travel and conduct business without any fear on about 75 percent of Croatian territory, with trade restrictions being in effect only in those regions of Croatia which are supervised by UN troops. During the Warsaw talks, both sides agreed that there are possibilities of increasing trade ties between the two countries in areas like the tourist, textile, agricultural food, electrotechnical, chemical, and petrochemical industries. Four years ago, Croatia occupied the second place among the Yugoslav republics, on the list of countries involved in trade exchange with Poland. In 1993, the volume of exchange between the two countries fell by 30 percent compared with 1990. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 8-10 Apr 94 p 4) ENVIRONMENT PACT WITH GERMANY: Polish and German Ministers Stanislaw Zelichowski and Klaus Topfer signed an agreement in Schwerin concerning cooperation in environmental protection. Both sides will be exchanging information concerning the location of environment-sensitive investments in the border area. Minister Zelichowski said promises contained in the German unification treaty concerning adaptation of East German power stations to European Union standards by July 1996, will not be met. Germany intends to build two new power stations in the vicinity of the border with Poland. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 9-10 Apr 94 p 10) AGENCY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: ARG is a partnership which is entirely owned by the Treasury. On 16 March the state contributed 4.567 trillion zlotys to ARG -- in the form of shares of Universal (2,628,000), Export Development Bank (BRE) (270,000 shares), and Elektrim (1,080,000); the agency will have to pay dividends to the Treasury. In the future, the main source of income for ARG will be economic activity (the government will not give the agency any budget money). The partnership is going to participate in undertakings requiring the investment of substantial capital (construction of highways, development of border-area infrastructure, restructurization of the shipyard industry, or construction of the transit gas pipeline running through Poland). In line with the economic strategy adopted by the government, ARG intends to focus its activity on the promotion of Polish exports. The company wants to wage advertising-promotion campaigns and support small private firms on foreign markets, and share profits with them. (RZECZPOSPOLITA, 12 Mar 94 p 7) MARCH PRODUCTION: Production rose by 16.6 per cent in March as compared with February and it was higher by 12.3 per cent than in 1993, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on Monday. Also, building and assembly enterprises obtained better results in March 1994 than in the previous month, with their output rising by 15.6 per cent throughout last March. The greatest production growth, by 19.4 per cent, was achieved last March by a group of factories manufacturing food, clothes, timber, paper and metal products, machines and installations as well as furniture, medical tools and radio and tv sets. Comparing results in March 1994 with 1993, production increased in enterprises producing food and clothes by 14.8 per cent and in plants supplying factories and private customers with water, gas and electricity - by 2.2 per cent and in building and assembly firms - by 7.6 per cent. In March 1994, mines achieved better results than in 1993 by 4.8 per cent. (Warsaw PAP in English 1558 GMT 18 Apr 94) PARIS CLUB AGREES TO REDUCE DEBT: On Thursday, 14 April, the Paris Club finally accepted a 50-percent reduction of the Polish debt. This decision resolved the problem of the greatest part of the Polish foreign debt, which in 1991 amounted to $33 billion. Until 2009, Poland will pay approximately $1 billion less in annual interest; decreased will also be the amount of basic capital. In April 1991, a 30-percent reduction was confirmed; on Thursday, an additional 20-percent reduction was discussed. This agreement was possible because Poland satisfied the conditions made by the Paris Club. Nonetheless, it is stressed in the press communique issued after the session that the Paris Club reserves the right to change its decision, depending on the implementation of the initial agreement with the London Club. Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki says that such a clause has only theoretical significance. It also concerns other conditions of the agreement, that is, Poland's continuing with market reforms and meeting its obligations. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1) MARCH INFLATION HIGHER: The Central Office of Statistics reported on 15 March that prices of consumer goods and services went up in March by an average of 2 percent -- the Finance Ministry had estimated the March inflation rate at 1.6 percent. In January, the monthly inflation rate was 1.6 percent, in February -- 1.1 percent. Prices in March of this year were 30.2 percent higher that prices in March last year. The consumer inflation rate in February was 29.9 percent. The March price increase was caused, first of all, by prices of non-food goods, which went up by 2.2 percent. The increase in food prices in March was lower than the inflation index -- by 1.8 percent. Prices for services increased by an average 1.8 percent. It was first of all the result of increases in the official prices for gas and electricity, which were originally scheduled for February but deferred until March. The increase in prices for services was limited by the 10-percent decrease in telephone prices in March. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar went up by 77 zlotys (at the National Bank of Poland) and by 44 zlotys at exchange houses. The Finance Ministry predicts that in April prices will increase by an average of 2.1 percent, or even less because of the deferred increase in gasoline prices. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1) KERM ACCEPTS PROGRAM: The Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) 1994-1997 accepted the socioeconomic program as prepared by the Central Planning Administration (CUP). KERM accepted the main points of economic development included in the third basic option, recommended by CUP; state policy is aimed at stimulating investment and export activity, and within the next three years we will witness high, lasting, and balanced economic growth. This option should result in increasing investments, exports, and work efficiency, which, in turn, ought to restrict unemployment and improve living standards. KERM proposed that the Council of Ministers authorize CUP to submit the final version of the program by 15 May; the report should take into account the proposals of the various ministries as well as remarks submitted at the committee's session on Friday, 15 April. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 5) WAGES INCREASING: Even though in March the popiwek -- tax on wage increases -- was still in force, before-tax wages, not including dividends paid from company profits, were 8.8 percent higher in February, it was reported on 16 April by the Central Office of Statistics (GUS). Along with the profit dividends, before-tax wages were 14.8-percent higher. The average wage before taxes in the enterprise sector was 5,418,500 zlotys (along with profits) and 4,993,700 zlotys (without the profit dividends and balance surplus). Real wages (without the profit dividends) increased in March by at least 6 percent. In comparison with March 1993, before-tax wages were higher this March by 37.1 percent, without the profit dividends -- by 35.9 percent. The prices for consumer goods and services increased in the same period by 30.2 percent. The data suggest that the Finance Ministry's forecast that consumer goods and services will increase by only 2.1 percent in April is not very probable. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 18 Apr pp 1, 5) TOLL ROAD CONSTRUCTION: At the beginning of next year, the first licenses will be granted for the construction and maintenance of five toll roads which, within a period of 15 years, will form a 2,571-km network in Poland of modern high-speed highways of great domestic and international importance -- this according to Andrzej Palatas, director of the Polish Highways Agency. Highways mean not just better transportation but also improvements in the general economic situation and in employment, especially in areas adjacent to them. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 15-17 Apr p 4) TOBACCO PRIVATIZATION OBSTACLES: According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, privatization of the very profitable tobacco industry is made difficult by a need to very thoroughly assess the value of the companies involved. During a meeting with businessmen at the Krakow Industrial- Commercial Chamber, Kaczmarek also said that the process includes not just machinery and investment capital, but also a large segment of the consumer market. Bogdan Pek, chairman of the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission, announced during the meeting that if the ministry officially proposes the sale of the tobacco industry, then he will demand that the ministry's leadership be dismissed (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 18 Apr p 3) FOREIGN INVESTMENTS INCREASING: In 1993, foreign capital investment in Poland exceeded $3 billion. The amount was lower by more than 50 percent from a year ago -- this according to the Institute of Foreign Trade Economic Situations and Prices. The Americans have invested the most -- around $1 billion, and they promise another billion in the future. The Italians occupy second place on the list, with about $270 million (they promise $970 million). The Germans, Austrians, Dutch, and Belgians are also in the top ten. The Japanese are last on the list, with about $9 million. This situation is bound to change since Matsushita Battery Co. and the Dutch Philips Co. have just signed an agreement to construct a battery plant in Gniezno. The value of the project is estimated at over $35 million. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 19) LOT SEEKS PARTNER: For over a year now, Lot Polish Airlines has been looking for a strategic partner, which would strengthen its position on transatlantic routes and which would help it survive competition in the skies. All signs are that an alliance will be concluded with one of two big U.S. carriers -- Delta, or American Airlines. To this day, it is not known which one of them will eventually be LOT's partner, and because of new proposals from both U.S. airlines, the talks have continued for longer than expected. Transportation Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki says that selling part of LOT is out of the question; all that is being planned is a close alliance. An alliance with a U.S. partner would create opportunities for LOT to increase the volume of passengers flown across the Atlantic as well as secure access to the huge U.S. market. Right now, LOT has regular connections with only New York and Chicago. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 18 Apr p 14) "GRAY ZONE" 20 PERCENT OF GDP: According to an independent study released on Monday, April 18, Poland's unaccounted-for business activity (also known as the "gray zone") stood at about 20 percent of official GDP in 1993, producing about 340 trillion zlotys ($15 billion) in revenues. The revenue compared with 460 trillion zlotys ($20.5 billion) in official state budget revenues and the GDP of 1,600 trillion zlotys ($71 billion). The Main Statistical Office (GUS) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) said the relatively high level of activity in the "gray zone" followed rapid political and economic liberalization and the accompanying recession since reforms began in 1989. "The gray economy...is a normal element of any system, but its role increases in times of political transition or economic downfall," GUS and PAN have said. The report also said several hundred thousand Poles work illegally and that the real number of unemployed was considerably lower than the official figure of close to 3 million. It is also estimated that illegal imports reduced budget revenues by $1 billion a year because of unpaid customs duties and taxes. The report also said 30 percent of revenue in the "gray zone" was produced by totally unregistered activity. The remainder was produced by registered companies which did not completely account for their business. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in English 19 Apr p 24) BUSINESSMEN SUPPORT BUDGET: Businessmen who are members of the Business Center Club (BCC) held a meeting on 18 April during which they commented on the impact of events of the last few months on the economic situation. "In our view, the restrictive tax system and the increasing fiscal burdens, cannot be the only source of revenue for the state" -- BCC representatives stated. Despite these reservations, the businessmen support the budget as a compromise solution and they are happy that the president decided to sign it. They regard the lack of a deputy prime minister for economic affairs and finance minister, as unacceptable in a situation where reforms of the tax system and a restructuring of enterprises are pending. According to the businessmen, it is too soon to abandon popiwek (tax on excessive wage increases) at this stage. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 19 Apr p 13) BUTTER EXPORTS: Poland received permission from GATT to export 67,000 tons of butter to the countries of the former USSR. According to the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry, Poland is entitled to sell this much butter at any price, without having to observe GATT minimum prices. The deadline for applications to be submitted to the ministry is the end of May, while the deadline for exports to be terminated is the end of August. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 22 Apr p 17) BALANCE OF PAYMENTS: National Bank of Poland (NBP) reports that after two months this year, the deficit of current turnover of the payment balance is $107 million. Last year it was over three times larger -- $372 million. Only in February, was a surplus of $84 million registered in the current turnover, and exports exceeded imports by $50 million. According to NBP, however, this may be accidental -- the dates of the implementation of trade contracts may have coincided and therefore, it is too early to say that this trend is lasting. In the first two months of 1994, the receipts from exports reached the level of $2.127 billion (20.4 percent more than in 1993); imports of goods, after two months, amounted to $2.227 billion, and compared to the same period last year, it increased by 7.9 percent. Thus, after two months, the deficit of commodity payments is $150 million. Compared to last year, the geographic structure of the commodity exchange slightly changed: the share of the developed countries, both in our exports and imports, increased while the share of Central and Eastern Europe dropped. The positive balance of services after two months was $80 million, and increased significantly in comparison with the same period last year (a surplus of only $2 million then). The negative balance of interest payments was at the level of $133 million (a deficit of $112 million last year). Official gross reserves after two months were $4.4 billion, which means an increase of $87 million in comparison with January of this year. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 18 Apr p 13) REGIONAL POLICY: This year it will be possible to spend approximately 4 trillion zlotys on regional policy, not counting other financial resources envisioned in the budget for various purpose funds related to the restructuring of gminas (smallest administrative units) and voivodships. The Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted the Principles of the State's Regional Policy, prepared by the Central Planning Administration (CUP), which envisions a more active regional policy. According to Marcin Rybicki, under secretary of state in CUP, some of the regions will not cope with their problems without the aid of the state. Priorities of the regional policy of European states are convergent with those of Polish regional policy. This creates good conditions for cooperation in this area with highly developed states. This cooperation will also make it possible to use the financial resources of the European Union earmarked for this purpose -- on the condition that our budget must also allocate money for regional policy. This condition is met. The 1994 Budget Law envisions a reserve of 297.2 trillion zlotys for restructuring programs and 573.5 trillion zlotys for infrastructure investments in regions threatened with high unemployment; there will also be money for supporting sector programs in industry; the restructuring is supported by the Labor Fund as well. Aid from abroad includes, first of all, the PHARE (Poland and Hungary Action for Restructuring the Economy) STRUDER [not further identified] -- 60 million ECU and the PHARE of Transfrontier Cooperation program -- 55 million ECU. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 19 Apr p 8) MINISTER ON CHINA VISIT: "Poland will widen its economic cooperation with China. We can count on export contracts in mining, the chemical industry, the energy industry, and the aircraft industry," said Industry Minister Marek Pol on his return from a visit to China. Due to its rate of economic development and an absorbent market, China has been becoming an attractive partner even for the biggest industrial powers. Minister Pol's visit was intended to widen the contacts and to strengthen Poland's position in the Chinese market. The visit took place right after the seventh session by a joint Polish-Chinese commercial commission. According to the commission, the current volume of trade exchange with China is $400 million. Poland also wants to join the program of Chinese economic reforms. Prices can be one of our assets -- they are lower than in the West, with a comparable quality of equipment. The visit initiated talks on a contract for supplying light aircraft and helicopters. "There is a possibility for providing machinery for the mining industry. China has been building 50 new mines recently," Minister Pol stated. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 12) COUNCIL TO DEBATE PRIVATIZATION: The State Treasury still has 5,300 enterprises at its disposal. This huge wealth is not uniform since apart from enterprises with good future prospects and those that need to be rectified, there are also companies that should be immediately dissolved. Disputes among different ministries have also emerged regarding their different powers in the area of ownership transformations. These problems will be addressed by a program of commercialization of companies which will be debated at the next Council of Ministers' session. Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister Andrzej Zebrowski said in an interview with a PAP journalist, that one-time transformations of state-owned enterprises into companies are not called for since many of those enterprises do not meet the requirements of the Commercial Code. A review and a selection process are necessary, after which a "privatization map" would be drawn. It would include three main groups: Enterprises that should be privatized as soon as possible would be in one group; the second one would include those state- owned enterprises that could be commercialized; whereas the third group would comprise those enterprises which have been qualified as to be covered by managerial contracts. State-owned enterprises in need of rectification and those destined to be dissolved, would also be distinguished. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 3) GUS DATA ON HOUSING, BROKERS: The Central Office of Statistics (GUS) has just released a report on the housing market in which it is said that real estate brokers are active only in towns with over 20,000 inhabitants. Half of the real estate brokers' offices are located in Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz, Wroclaw, and Poznan, and out of that amount, one-fourth is in Warsaw but only 8 percent in Krakow which is second on the list. On average, just two people are employed per agency, with only rare instances of offices employing more than 10 or even 20 people -- these are located in the biggest cities. Slightly over 40 percent of the offices also provide legal services, tax counselling, keeping commercial books and accounts, or dealing in wholesale trade. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 14) LOT TO LEASE AIRCRAFT: More aircraft that will complement the fleet of Lot Polish Airlines will arrive before the end of the year. A sixth Boeing 737-500 will come in May, and well as an ATR-72. Since passenger traffic is characterized by a very high "seasonality factor," many carriers try to lease aircraft from other companies for the summer season. For a few years now, Lot Polish Airlines has been cooperating with Air New Zealand, taking advantage of the fact that traffic reaches a maximum level in New Zealand precisely at a point in time when it reaches a seasonal low in Poland. An Air New Zealand Boeing 767-200 will complement Lot's fleet also this year. There are also plans to lease another long-distance aircraft, mainly in order to service the trans-Atlantic route. According to Piotr Ikanowicz of Lot's management, despite increases of expenditures to finance the new fleet, profit from using the modern aircraft fully justifies purchases planned for the next few years. It is still not known though what will happen to Soviet-made Tupolevs which have been withdrawn from service. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 26 Apr 94 p 12) FIFTH CEMENT MILL PRIVATIZED: The Warta cement mill in Dzialoszyn, Sieradz Voivodship, has finally been sold: on 22 April, the protocol of the execution of the preliminary agreement, concluded on 24 February, was signed at the Ministry of Ownership Transformations. It concerned the sale of 75 percent of the shares of this Cement and Lime Company to the German strategic investor -- Polen Zement Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH. The Treasury received 10 million German marks (DM) for the shares on the day the agreement was concluded. The German company committed itself to implement a DM30 million investment program within five years. The employment level is to be maintained for three years, the social benefits will still be paid, and wages will go up. The Warta Cement Mill is going through financial problems due to its high debts and overdue credits, which it obtained in the 1980's. The new owner of the company is supposed to help resolve the problems. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 5) PRIVATIZATION SLOWS: The number of new privatization processes has recently decreased, which could be seen already in January and February. There are many cases, however, of completing the processes that have already been started. According to the preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Ownership Transformations (the final data will be published in the "Dynamics of Privatization"), in the first quarter of the year 20 state-run enterprises were transformed into one-person Treasury partnerships. It is more than in any quarter of 1993. In all, in late March there were 547 one-person Treasury partnerships. There also appeared partnerships transformed not only on the basis of Articles 5 and 6 of the privatization law, but also on the basis of Article 17 of the law on financial restructurization of companies and banks. In the first quarter of this year three such partnerships were established. Three partnerships were sold to strategic investors (in 1993, 47 partnerships were privatized on the capital road). In line with preliminary data, on the basis of Article 37 of the Privatization Law the privatization of 21 companies was started in the first quarter, which is also less than in any quarter of the previous year. On the basis of Article 16 of the law on state-run enterprises, 43 liquidation processes were begun and that is also less than in any quarter of 1993. Fifty one liquidations for privatization were completed -- just as many as a year ago, but fewer than in any of the 1993 quarters. The bankruptcy liquidation is still slow, but something is changing -- 31 processes were completed in the last three months, which is more than in the individual quarters of 1993. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 7) QUARTERLY ECONOMIC RESULTS: It has been known for a few days now that the economic results of the first quarter of the year were very good. This was confirmed by the Central Planning Administration (CUP), which estimates the increase in industrial production in the first three months at 10.5 percent, and the increase in construction production at 7.5 percent. This is accompanied by lower inflation -- from almost 10 percent last year (level of the prices in March in comparison with December) to 5 percent this year. This is the lowest inflation in eight years. The financial situation of enterprises improved; the foreign exchange reserves of banks increased (by nearly 9 percent); the revenues of the state budget are growing faster than expected. Banks are granting more credits. Increasingly more people save their money in zlotys, rather than in foreign currencies. In February, for the first time in almost two years we achieved a positive balance in the commodity turnover in trade. All this occurred despite many unfavorable phenomena in politics ('Solidarity' strikes, Belvedere's actions). On the other hand, however, it is only just the beginning of the road to overcoming the recession. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 23-24 April 94 p 4) MARCH ACTIVITY: According to GUS, in March an increase in the economic activity, especially in industry, construction, and trade, was observed; the decrease in employment was curbed and the number of unemployed decreased slightly. The average employment in enterprises was 0.1 percent higher than a month ago, and 3.2 percent lower than a year ago. The number of unemployed persons dropped by 19,400. The greatest number of unemployed persons (from October) was crossed off the registers (152,000). The average wage, along with profit payments, increased by 14.8 percent; the real wage increased by 12.3 percent and was 3.8 percent higher than a year ago. The prices of consumer goods and services increased in March by 2 percent. The sold production of the industry increased by 16.2 percent and was 12.3 percent higher than a year ago. In the first quarter production was 10.6 percent greater than a year ago. It increased from 23 to 29 divisions of industry -- in 17 by more than 10 percent. The greatest increase was noted in the following industries: cellulose-paper (by 28.7 percent), food (27.9 percent), clothing (21.6 percent), furniture (by 20 percent), rubber and plastics (by 19.4 percent), products of other non-metal raw materials (cement, lime, and plaster) (by 17.5 percent), coke and oil products (by 17.8 percent). The financial results of enterprises improved. In January and February they noted a gross financial result of 18.3 trillion zlotys (10.4 trillion a year ago); earning capacity was 5 percent (3.4 percent a year ago), and profitability (per each 1,000 zlotys of production sold) -- plus 12 zlotys (a year ago -- minus 1 zloty). After three months the state deficit was 19.2 trillion zlotys.

Almost 1,000 such companies are already operating on the market in Poland and most of them achieve relatively good economic results, although they are not as good as in private companies. Employee-owned partnerships satisfy two main requirements in privatization: They still exist, they are much more independent and self-reliable, and they are able to pay higher wages to employees. Social relations are much better than in state-owned enterprises (practically no strikes). The ownership structure is not uniform. The average gross earning capacity is relatively high -- approximately 8 percent, which is two and a half times as much as in the entire economy. The highest earning capacity is achieved by the smallest partnerships, followed by medium-sized and big companies. Favorable are also relations between the net profits and the size of the revenues -- the profitability index is 43 zlotys per each 1,000 zlotys of revenues. These partnerships display considerable activeness in adjusting to the requirements of the market; they use the so-called shallow reserves which do not call for investments. Lack of money for investments is the most fundamental problem of these companies. Another serious problem is that access to credits is very limited (lack of security -- the property that is at the companies' disposal does not yet belong to them). Thus, external capital is becoming increasingly important. Participation of foreign investors in employee-owned partnerships is still an open issue. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 27 Apr 94 p 5) DRAFT REPRIVATIZATION LAW: On 26 April, the Council of Ministers debated a draft law on reprivatization which has been initiated by Sejm deputies. The ministers decided they want to have their own draft law. The chief of the Ownership Transformations Ministry has committed himself to presenting such a draft before 11 May. The government view is that budgetary capabilities need to be taken into account in the process. Once the two draft laws -- one coming from Sejm deputies, and the other from the government -- are compared, the choice will be made as to which option the Council of Ministers will eventually support, Minister Kaczmarek explained. He added that a possibility is being considered of holding a referendum which would not deal with whether reprivatization is to be implemented or not, but to define instead reprivatization's scope and extent, and also the way claims by former owners should be satisfied. According to the minister's calculations, the governmental draft will take into account claims by people whose property was nationalized illegally in the 1944-58 period, as well as claims regarding property beyond the Bug River. Compensations would not be paid out in cash since the budget would not be able to bear the burden which is four times the current budget deficit. That is why the possibility of returning the property in its natural form is being considered in cases where that is possible; awarding substitution property, or awarding compensation in the form of securities is also being considered. The minister said he is aware that such measures will definitely not satisfy everyone.

The current wave of strikes and the uncertain situation with popiwek (salary-controlling legislation) prevent NBP from commemorating the anniversary with a lowering of interest rates. "We will have to suspend the decision on a possible decrease of interest rates until May or even June," NBP Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told journalists on 27 April. Even though NBP was established by a decree of 15 January 1945, it considers itself an heir to Bank Polski which was set up 70 years ago and that is why NBP has plans for widescale celebrations on the occasion.
