At the annual EU meeting, Japan's foreign minister and finance minister were scheduled to talk with EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan on issues such as the country's massive trade surplus with the EU and on its deregulation measures. Japan's prime minister and cabinet ministers have yet to be officially selected, however. The delay in the formation of a new government has led to postponements of visits to Tokyo by such dignitaries as the Egyptian president and Thai prime minister.
