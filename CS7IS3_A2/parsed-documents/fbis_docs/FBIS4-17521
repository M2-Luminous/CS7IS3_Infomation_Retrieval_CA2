In his opinion, it is "harmful" to include the obligations to observe the RF Constitution into the text of the document because "this allegedly gives the right not to observe the Constitution to those who do not sign this document." Popov believes that the draft is saturated "with promises, statements of intent, and declarations" which have much in common with "the CPSU Central Committee appeals on May 1," said Popov. One can voluntarily oblige oneself to temporarily not use the rights granted by the Constitution, for example, the right to urge early elections, only in the case "if it is clearly and precisely stated for what sake the participants of the agreement are abstaining from these or those rights." To this effect Popov noted that the draft document "does not contain any precise or concrete program of actions with determined dates which are also coordinated between major participants of the agreement." "There are practically no concrete obligations in the agreement, namely to lower taxes by so-and-so percent, to ensure such-and-such a rate of inflation, etc.," he said. He drew attention to the fact that "the draft does not contain any obligations of the government to resign and the State Duma's obligations to announce about its self-disbandment in case it fails to fulfill concrete obligations in concrete terms." According to Popov, "the activity around this document disorients Russia's peoples, creating an illusion of progress." He warned that the Agreement "could be a trap into which the president and his advisers are being driven." Responding to Interfax, Popov reported that the majority of the members of the movement's political council which is to finally determine the RMDR position adhere to the same point of view.
