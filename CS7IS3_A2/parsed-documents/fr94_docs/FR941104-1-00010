FR941104-1-00010 FR941104-1-00002 (d)(1) When an individual declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit or fails to reply to an inquiry, under this subpart, and the position meets the acceptable conditions shown in his or her application, he or she loses RPL consideration for all positions with a representative rate at or below that grade. However, subject to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the individual retains eligibility for positions with a higher representative rate up to the last grade held. (2) Also, an individual is taken off the RPL before the period of eligibility expires when the individual: (i) Requests removal. (ii) Receives a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit in any agency. (iii) Declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit or fails to reply to an inquiry, under this subpart, by the employee's former agency, concerning a specific position having a representative rate at least as high, and with the same type of work schedule, as that of the position from which the person was or will be separated. (iv) Separates for some other reason before the RIF separation takes effect (such as retirement, resignation, etc.). An employee who retires the day after separation by RIF, or later, does not lose RPL eligibility. (v) Declines an interview or fails to appear for a scheduled interview only if notified in advance of this requirement and the subsequent consequences. (vi) In the case of an individual enrolled on an RPL for Alaska or overseas, leaves the area covered by that RPL or becomes disqualified for overseas employment because of previous service or residence. (3) When an agency removes an individual from the RPL because of failure to reply to a specific permanent job offer or an inquiry of availability for a specific permanent vacancy, the agency must have evidence to show that a written offer or inquiry was made and received. The written offer or inquiry to the individual must clearly state that failure to respond will result in loss of RPL consideration for all grades or for lower grades, as appropriate. (e) Declination of nonpermanent employment has no effect on RPL eligibility or continuation of RPL consideration. (f) Consideration for all jobs (whether permanent or nonpermanent) is suspended for any individual who cannot be reached by the agency. Submission of an updated application can reinstate consideration, but the period of eligibility is not extended beyond the original time set in paragraph (c) of this section. (g) Eligibles who had agreed to transfer with their function but were separated by RIF from the gaining competitive area are registered on the RPL of the gaining competitive area. 24. In ยง330.204, paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) are revised and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows:
