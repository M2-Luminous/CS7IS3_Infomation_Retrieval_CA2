FR940921-2-00060 FR940921-2-00054 INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;360] Certain Devices for Connecting Computers via Telephone Lines; Notice of Request for Additional Written Submissions on the Scope of a Proposed Exclusion Order AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission seeks additional written submissions on the scope of a proposed exclusion order that may be issued in the above-captioned investigation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth C. Rose, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;3113. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') filed a complaint on October 12, 1993, pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), alleging that certain respondents had violated section 337 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. The Commission published a notice of investigation in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60671). On June 28, 1994, the Commission determined not to review a final initial determination issued by the presiding administrative law judge finding a violation of section 337 in this investigation. The Commission requested written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. See 59 FR 34862&hyph;63 (July 7, 1994). Both complainant Farallon and the Commission investigative attorney proposed that the Commission issue a general exclusion order that ``excluded from entry into the United States,'' devices for connecting computers via telephone lines that are covered by claims 10, 18, or 20 of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579, for the remaining term of the patent, except under license of the patent owner or as provided by law. In connection with recent deliberations concerning the scope of the exclusion order issued in 1984 in Inv. Nos. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;148/169, Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casings and Resulting Product, the Commission became aware that the U.S. Customs Service interprets the term ``exclusion from entry'' differently from a majority of the Commission. The Commission therefore wishes to avoid any ambiguity inherent in the use of this term by stating more precisely in any exclusion order that may be issued exactly what is and is not covered by the order. Written Submissions The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, in particular the U.S. Customs Service, and any other interested persons are encouraged to file written submissions on the scope of the proposed exclusion order and in particular on the use of the terms ``exclusion from entry'' and ``entry.'' Such written submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on Monday, October 3, 1994. Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. See 19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly. All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and section 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.58). Copies of Farallon's and the Commission investigative attorney's proposed exclusion orders and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. Issued: September 13, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23361 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
