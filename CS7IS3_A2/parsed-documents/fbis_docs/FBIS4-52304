Hun Sen told Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata that he is opposed to the idea of holding a meeting in Jakarta or Paris to discuss problems involving the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who refuse to accept Phnom Penh's authority, the officials said. He was quoted as saying such a meeting may give the Khmer Rouge a chance to break the 1991 Paris Peace Accord. He also said the problem should be solved by the Cambodian people themselves. The officials said, however, that it is not clear whether Hun Sen was referring to a roundtable meeting or other international conferences. Hun Sen, in Japan since Monday to attend a meeting of the Socialist International, also said another general election proposed by Cambodian King Sihanouk cannot be held due to Constitutional limits stipulating a five-year term for parliamentarians. Sihanouk suggested last week a new election be held with the participation of the Khmer Rouge to end the fighting. The Khmer Rouge boycotted the U.N.-sponsored general election last May despite its signing of the Paris Peace Accord in 1991. Hun Sen told Hata he is well aware that King Sihanouk is offering various ideas to achieve peace in Cambodia. The Cambodian co-premier also called for a Japanese role in improving Cambodia's relations with Thailand, which have soured in recent weeks regarding the Western town of Pailin, a stronghold of the Khmer Rouge about a dozen kilometers east of the frontier with Thailand. Cambodian Government troops occupied the guerrilla headquarters at Pailin in March but the Khmer Rouge recaptured it in April. Cambodia has strongly protested to Thailand about forcibly repatriating 25,000 Cambodian refugees into Khmer Rouge-held areas without informing Phnom Penh. Hun Sen told Hata although relations with the Thai Government are good, there are some elements in the Thai military and some entrepreneurs who have not stopped business with the Khmer Rouge, the officials said. Hata told Hun Sen he has been telling Thai leaders that friendly ties with Cambodia are important and has been urging them not to obstruct efforts to achieve peace in Cambodia, they said. Turning to bilateral affairs, Hun Sen called on Japanese companies to invest in his country, saying Cambodia's economic development achieved by receiving aid will in turn solve the problems of the Khmer Rouge. Hata was quoted as saying he will call on Japanese companies to invest there but that he hopes Cambodia will make efforts to bring about peace. Japan intends to cooperate as much as possible to that end, Hata was quoted as saying.
