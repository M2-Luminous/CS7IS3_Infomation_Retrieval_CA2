The condition for this is, however, that Solidarity politicians start to listen to him. Walesa stated that he is certain of his victory in the presidential election next year. [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] Walesa feels that low ratings in public opinion poll surveys--in which he is led by several other candidates for the presidential chair--do not negate his chances of a second term in the Belweder Palace. [Walesa] "That is why I am convinced I will win as president." [Sojka] The president does not yet know whether he will sign the neo-popiwek law. He admitted that he sees no reason to hurry with this decision. [Walesa] "Well, not much is taking place. I see certain people who have decent earnings, of 90 million, and these paupers who have a million--and we are so scared of them?" [Sojka] Asked whether he will stand by his invitation to German President Roman Herzog to the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, the president said that he never goes back on his word.
