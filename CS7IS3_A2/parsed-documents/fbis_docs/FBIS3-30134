[Yamagishi] I anticipate the present political parties will ultimately merge into two political parties. Given the diversified values of the people, the present political parties should be merged not into two conservative parties, but into one conservative party and one nonconservative party. I anticipate the realignment of the present political parties will go through a tripolar party structure under which Conservative Party A, Conservative Party B, and one nonconservative party coexist. Conservative Party A is like the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Conservative Party B is a non-LDP conservative party or a new conservative-oriented party. They will be formed by social democrats, centralists or liberal forces. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you elaborate on the nonconservative forces? [Yamagishi] They are the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party, the United Social Democratic Party, Sakigake [the Harbinger Party], the Japan New Party, and reformist members of the LDP. Conservative Party B must be formed on the premise that it does not take a hostile and confrontational stand against the other parties, but cooperates with them and shores up the framework of the coalition government. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you anticipate the political parties will be realigned? [Yamagishi] I think the present political parties will be merged into two political parties late this century or early in the 21st century. It is highly possible that the tripolar party structure will emerge after the next general elections. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the next general elections will be held? [Yamagishi] From a commonsense point-of-view, I think they will be held after next autumn. Next year, local elections and lower house elections will be held. The ruling coalition parties opposed the simultaneous elections for both houses of the Diet as a violation of the Constitution when they were opposition parties in the past. The political parties will be unable to fight in the general elections immediately after the upper house elections because of the limit of their financial capabilities and energy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you think the ruling coalition parties will fight in the next general elections? [Yamagishi] It is better for them to uphold their present coalition framework. They should not fight in the next general elections with their policy differences unbridged. Their coalition might be seen as a common-law marriage [yago]. Two or three ruling coalition parties should aim for high-level electoral cooperation by concluding a policy agreement. They should make utmost efforts to coordinate their views so as to field a single candidate. Political forces that oppose the concept by (Shinseito and Komeito) of forming a new party cannot come to power. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of moves to reshuffle the cabinet? [Yamagishi] The moves are presumptuous. It is said that the cabinet reshuffle is surfacing because of emotional confrontation between Mr. Hosokawa (the prime minister) and Mr. Takemura (the chief cabinet secretary), but I believe the cabinet reshuffle is surfacing after two political forces in the ruling coalition parties clashed. I have high expectations of Mr. Hosokawa as a leader of the liberal forces. Their emotional wrangling will never be a plus for Japanese politics. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What policy will become a watershed for the realignment of the political parties? Yamagishi: The policy must define how Japan should share international responsibility. The policy should also place its priority on people who work by the sweat of their brow. Specifically speaking, the policy should place its priority on the direction of promoting social fairness, decentralization, and democracy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi a leader of the nonconservative forces? [Yamagishi] It is good for the new party to maintain a collective leadership system. There are many candidates for leader: Satsuki Eda (director general of the Science and Technology Agency), Mr. Takemura, Mr. Hosokawa, and defectors from the LDP. It is impolite to call Mr. Ozawa leader of the nonconservative forces because he pursues the new conservatism. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do the policies of those leaders not take on an anti-Ozawa tinge? [Yamagishi] Mr. Yokomichi and other former governors are all qualified to become a leader of the nation. I believe they are able to fashion comprehensive policies and come up with ideologies to prepare Japan for the 21st century. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not time for you to play a role in the political world? [Yamagishi] If I am asked to cooperate, I will cooperate within the permitted limits.
