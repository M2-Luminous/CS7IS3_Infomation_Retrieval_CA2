Efforts should be made to take a two-handed approach toward flood control and drought relief, to make necessary preparations for preventing serious disasters, to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, and to reduce the losses caused by flooding and drought as much as possible. In conducting flood control, we should regard the work of reducing the casualties of personnel in the operation as a prominent task. Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, delivered a speech on introducing the situation at the first plenary session of 1944 sponsored by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters today, in which he said: Although the action taken by various localities for the preparatory work of flood control this year has been relatively satisfactory and the relevant departments under the State Council have earnestly made preparations for flood control in line with the duties assigned by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, we are still facing a severe situation in the flood control work this year because the standards of flood control work set for large rivers and by urban areas are generally on the low side; difficulties in applying the areas to relieving or blocking the flooding flows are large; measures to allocate the operation of flood control are backward; institutions in some localities in charge of flood control and drought relief are not sound; funds for flood control and drought relief are short; and the term-shift changes of personnel in charge of commanding the operation of flood control and drought relief are large, which have caused the large number of new hands who lack the experience of commanding and allocating the operation in the work. Therefore, it is necessary for us to make greater efforts in this regard. During the plenary session Chen Junsheng urged various localities and the state departments concerned not only to ensure the safety of large rivers and lakes during the flooding period but also to attach great importance on the flood disaster along medium-sized and small rivers and streams, around the medium-sized and small reservoirs and towns, along the main traffic lines, and around the important industrial and mining enterprises; as well as on the mountainous disasters of torrents and landslide caused by the tropical storm. It is imperative to accelerate the formulation of fore-plans for serious flood control and to enforce the responsibility system with the duties undertaken by the administrative leaders as the core. By no means should we allow the recurrence of vicious incidents. Various localities should establish or improve the organs in charge of flood control and drought relief, increase the funds for these purposes, and upgrade the capability of personnel at all levels in carrying out flood control and drought relief. Various departments concerned should realistically perform the duties and obligation imposed on them for flood control and drought relief and follow the spirit of safeguarding the whole situation to support the work of flood control and drought relief. Chen Junsheng pointed out: In order to realistically do a good job in the work of flood control and drought relief this year, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters recently organized six inspection groups of flood control to carry out inspection prior to the flooding period. These groups led by the head or deputy heads of the state headquarters carried out inspections among Chang Jiang, Huang He, Hai He, Huai He, and Taihu Lake, as well as among the key cities that are chiefly assuming the work of flood control and among the mountainous areas that are prone to more disasters. They also conducted jointly with the local people's governments the official work on the spot and dealt with the existing major problems in a timely manner. Chen Junsheng emphatically said: Currently, the flooding period has come. Some provinces in south China have prevailed flood and disaster situations in succession. Governments at all levels should attach great importance on them and realistically enhance their leadership over the work. Departments at all levels in charge of flood control should go into action immediately, take up the work that they should do, fulfill their duties, and be ready to meet every possible flood or drought disaster at all times.
