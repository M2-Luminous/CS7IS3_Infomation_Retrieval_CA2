Visibly exhausted by futile attempts over the past five days to establish communication between the belligerents and create conditions for talks, Akashi said on Tuesday afternoon the conference might be continued in Sarajevo and in Pale. The international mediator is currently meeting for the third time in a single day with vice-president of the Moslem-Croat Federation Ejup Gapic to persuade him to accept a platform on a four-month general ceasefire proposed by the contact group on Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb delegation has indicated it may accept the platform, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated that an agreement to that effect may be reached by the evening. The start of the talks was delayed for four days because the Moslems claimed all armed Serbs had not left the three-kilometre exclusion zone around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia as set out in U.N. Security Council Resolution 913. The Moslems on Monday attempted to seize the territory around Gorazde from which the Serbs had withdrawn, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo said on Tuesday. The plenary session of the Bosnia peace talks has had to be postponed for three times because the Moslem-Croat delegation remains firm in its position that a ceasefire can be signed for a maximum of four to six weeks.
