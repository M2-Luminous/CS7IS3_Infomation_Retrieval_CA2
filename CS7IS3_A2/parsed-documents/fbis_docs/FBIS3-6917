This is a provocative step to drive the situation into extremes by screwing up the tensions on the Korean peninsula. Out of an intentional scheme to create an atmosphere of confrontation against the DPRK, the United States totally reversed the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the U.S. at the New York contact on February 25 and broke off the DPRK-U.S. talks and now has become all the more undisguised in its military threats and pressure against the DPRK, saying the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises would be resumed. Clinton's order of the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is a grave threat to the DPRK, and it clearly shows that the United States is pushing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.
