The technology calls for separation and purification by filling the inside of a doughnut-shape molecular structured aromatic organic compound ring with C60 molecules. Ninety-nine point 8 percent high-purity C60 can be produced at 1/20 the cost of the conventional method. Since low cost mass-production of the C60 is possible, application efforts for semiconductors and catalysts are expected to accelerate. Research will be further conducted to facilitate commercialization as early as possible. The new technology was developed by the Shinkai Chemirecognics Project (Director, Professor Seiji Shinkai of Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu University) team of the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology Operation Project, JRDC. Prof. Shinkai and his team discovered the precipitated substance in a solution while conducting research on compounds (``karikkusu)/arene'' derived from a circle of 8 benzene rings which are useful as solvent for the C60. Observation by nuclear magnetic resonance device of the precipitated substance showed the C60 being placed completely inside the compound ring. In order to obtain high purity C60, first low purity C60 containing soot was dissolved in toluene. Then karikkusu/arene was added. Soon C60 entered the inside of the ring and a light green substance precipitated. The precipitated substance was taken out and dissolved by chloroform. The chloroform pushed the C60 out of the ring. The C60 which was pushed out of the ring precipitated into a black substance, which completes the separation. The purification experiment achieved 99.8% high purity C60 at a yield rate of approximately 70% by using about 60% low purity C60 as a starter.
