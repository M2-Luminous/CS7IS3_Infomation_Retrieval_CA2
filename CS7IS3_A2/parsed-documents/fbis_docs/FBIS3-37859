Its Drafting Now Hampered by the Russia-West Problem of Nuclear Commodities Export"] [Text] An important part of Andrey Kozyrev's talks with his counterparts from three European countries -- the former, present, and future EC chairmen from Belgium, Greece, and Germany -- is the drafting of an Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union [EU] based on the eponymous declaration signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin with EU leaders in Brussels last December. At present, stressed Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign minister, it is necessary to specify the principles incorporated in the declaration. There are a number of obstacles along this road, however. One moot point in the drafting of an agreement is the export of nuclear materials; another is the problem of Russian legislation in the banking sphere. According to G. Sidorova, Russia is assuring its Western partners that the second moot point could be resolved in the nearest future. The problem of selling nuclear materials appears more difficult. There are a number of states fearing Russian import in this sphere. They want to assign to Moscow rather low quotas although this item of export is one of the most profitable for it. Russia is naturally unhappy with this, and is arguing for the removal of any restrictions in this area of trade, proceeding from the fact that other countries trading in nuclear materials are not restricted by quotas either under GATT or other international trade agreements. The West still continues to fear competing with Russia on the nuclear products market. Moscow, however, is hoping to sign an agreement with the EU in this sphere in the coming six months, even before the termination of the chairmanship of Greece, which has assured Russia that it would facilitate this in every way, something that was stated by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou when he received Kozyrev in Athens. During the talks in Athens, the Russian minister and his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias discussed, in addition to international questions, those of bilateral cooperation. Kozyrev invited Papoulias to visit Moscow this coming April. It is perhaps then that a number of Russo-Greek documents regulating, among other things, consular relationships will be signed.
