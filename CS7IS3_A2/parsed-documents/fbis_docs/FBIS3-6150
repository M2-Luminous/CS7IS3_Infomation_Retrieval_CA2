For this current dry season, 112 ha can be planted with second rice crops, in addition to six hectares of land for vegetable gardening. The purpose of the establishment of this integrated rural development project is to provide farmers facilities to plant two rice crops per year.

The facilities should allow farmers in the project area to generate more income, thus their living condition can be improved. The project also provides water for drinking and makes rural communities more accessible.
