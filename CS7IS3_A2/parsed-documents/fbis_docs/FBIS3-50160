If they want to continue to escalate the tension, then they have to be prepared to face the state power. No provinces will be established. You and we are the guaranties that it will not happen.... This state does not intend to give up an inch of its territory. This would provoke a conflict in Europe," Prime Minister Meciar said at a meeting with Defense Ministry officials in Bratislava yesterday. In this connection, the prime minister explained his opinion on the signs in communities with an ethnically mixed population. He said that the government demands that the names of communities be given in the ethnic minority's language as a translation from Slovak. He did not agree with the Castle's [the president's] opinion, according to which the ethnic minorities can chose their own names. He said that the minorities enjoyed rights that are higher than standard, and even President Clinton expressed, during a meeting with him, his rejective stance on collective rights. Because of that, Prime Minister Meciar expressed his hope that the Slovak-Hungarian treaty that is being drafted will also contain a passage on the inviolability of the borders. "Slovakia accepts the opinion that Europe should be safe for all of us. We want to build a unified Europe and we must not allow Europe to be partitioned according to the spheres of interest," the prime minister continued. He expressed satisfaction over our participation in the Partnership For Peace project, despite the fact that "some people forgot to mention the Slovak Republic in connection with this initiative or assumed that Slovakia would not join the initiative." The prime minister added that should Zhirinovskiy come to power in Russia, a new fascist regime would be installed there representing a threat to the whole of Europe. In this connection he stressed the need of additional intensive military ties with NATO. Vladimir Meciar said that one of the demands is for the Army to introduce tougher discipline, radically intensify training, introduce an army structure different from that based on the divisions, and establish civilian control over the Army. He said that the Slovak Republic Army has a budget of 10 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] this year, which is more than last year. Next year, the Army will receive even more. He said that as repayment of the Soviet debt, the Army should receive technology worth $180 million. (Slovak Republic Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said after the meeting that, in this case, spare parts, and not new weapon systems, would be delivered--Editorial note.) From the viewpoint of the military development, the prime minister described 1994 as a year of government efforts to stabilize its position and that of its political partners, so as to be able to face political forces that hold different opinions. He said that the government expects the economy to rebound this year, but the social system will be one or two years behind, if for no other reason than because the state will have to repay a debt of Sk31.3 billion by 1995, which represents Sk24.4 this year, while it was only Sk7 billion last year. In 1990, the Army was depoliticized. This means that soldiers and officers must not be members of any political party, and they must not perform any activity for any party, Vladimir Meciar said. "Some political parties have data on the Army, and this is unacceptable. The state is above the Army and is not interested in political disputes within the Army. This would pose an enormous risk," the prime minister stressed. At the news conference that was supposed to take place after the prime minister's speech we wanted to ask which political parties have planted their spies within the Army. Prime Minister Meciar, however, got rid of the journalists roughly. His aide, an officer, was given this task and ordered the journalist out of the hall. He said that they had 10 minutes to take photos, and then they were to wait in a nearby lobby. Most of the journalists did so. When the prime minister came, the journalists did not react to his call for questions for about three minutes, as some of them were still looking for their places. Suddenly, a voice said: "Since there are no questions, the news conference is over." Then, Vladimir Meciar and his escort left the hall. However, we believe that he will return to the problem of spies within the Army....
