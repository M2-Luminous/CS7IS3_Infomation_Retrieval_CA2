He briefed them, along with the sons of this homeland, on the great pressures and responsibilities that Jordan has borne and is still bearing. No other country could have remained steadfast while facing these pressures and responsibilities and at the same maintained its principles and its security, and continued carrying its message. With the right words, his majesty reviewed the pan-Arab and courageous role Jordan had played in rescuing the major part of Palestine, and the position it adopted in 1967, without which Israel would have occupied both banks [of the Jordan River]. Twenty years ago, Jordan tried to warn of the vacuum that would result from viewing the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, not for ambitions or intentions it was harboring, but to give the country from which the land was snatched the opportunity to regain it before giving it back to its owners. But the Rabat summit decision was adopted at that time, and the vacuum of which Jordan had warned occurred. When Jordan decided to disengage links with the West Bank, it sought to cede the land to the Palestinians and not the Israelis. However, developments and recent agreements did not fully lead in this direction. A new situation surfaced with which Jordan tried to deal with the highest possible self-restraint, and declared that it accepts what the Palestinian leadership accepts. Nevertheless, the brothers in the Palestinian leadership began to keep away from coordination, which aims in the first place to safeguard their authority on their soil and to realize the hoped-for objectives of ending the occupation and attaining independence and sovereignty. Since the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, Jordan has been aiming to reach an understanding with the future authority in the West Bank and Gaza and not with the authority that is occupying them. Jordan has been hoping that its eagerness to maintain the Arab nature of the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem in particular would be met with eagerness by the brothers in the Palestinian leadership to expedite bolstering future Jordanian-Palestinian relations on sound political and economic bases that reflect the cohesion between the two fraternal peoples--cohesion that no one can end or shatter. Therefore, Jordan has the right, amid the successive developments in the region, to ask the brothers in Palestinian leadership to expedite reaching an understanding and to coordinate with Jordan in order to establish sound and healthy relations that will be in the interest of the two peoples, and in order to prevent the occupier from benefiting from any confusion that may strike these relations.
