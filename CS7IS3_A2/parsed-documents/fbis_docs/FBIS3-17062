With unusual speed, and not without help from certain news agencies, rumors that the president's state of health had deteriorated and that V. Chernomyrdin probably went to the Black Sea coast to seize power in the country started to circulate in the capital. Although a little later the president's administration and the government apparatus put out explanations to the effect that everything is in order as regards the president's health, while the need for Chernomyrdin's trip to Sochi was prompted by the fact that the president has to sign an amended draft federal budget to enable the State Duma to begin its discussion as soon as possible, Monday morning passed off fairly nervously in many of the capital's political lobbies and corridors of power. Meanwhile, rumors of an imminent coup d'etat again started to circulate in political circles last week. Matters have reached a point whereby a coup scenario has been actively circulated in the State Duma and published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Thus, there is every reason to believe that last week's main event was that no coup took place in our country. Of course, the appearance of the latest putsch scenario should be regarded as nothing but a common political provocation, most likely undertaken with the aim of causing a split in the executive branch's ranks. But we cannot fail to notice a certain ordinariness in the situation. In several recent years, starting in approximately 1988, the country has regularly been rocked every few months by rumors of imminent coups and putsches. Whereas there have been only two real putsches -- in August 1991 and October 1993. Therefore we cannot fail to ask ourselves: Why does the putsch problem arise so persistently over and over again? Moreover, it arises in Moscow at the highest echelons of federal power, at the same time as the rest of Russia quietly lives its own life. Recent observations of the dynamics of the development of relations in the federal power system allow the detection of an obvious regularity: Fuss and nervousness always begin at the moment when the president is either absent or not engaged in energetic political activity. The reason for this regularity is no mystery: The Russian state structure's stability does not rely on democratic institutions or on a balance between the branches. The current regime's weakness lies in the fact that it has gotten stuck halfway between totalitarianism and democracy (or the other way round). Under this regime the state of all democratic institutions depends on the actions (or inaction) and the state of health of one person -- the president. When applied to Third World countries an analogous situation a customarily called a personal power regime. We are witnessing a paradox: A strong executive branch ensures stability in the state given an opposition parliament, which cannot upset this stability. But at the same time the executive branch itself, namely the federal executive branch, is starting to discover signs of its own unstable state. It is no longer a secret to anyone that the president, especially in recent months, has been "in the shadows" much more often than is warranted by the situation existing in the country. Discussion of the reasons for this remains a taboo topic for the public and mass media. Such discussions have been declared unpatriotic. Whereas extremely vigorous debates about this are being conducted in various corridors of federal power. The president has only to provide just a little extra fuel for these conversations (by going on leave, for example) for a fuss to start in political lobbies and corridors of power and the level of nervousness to reach the highest reading. We have had an opportunity to observe all this during the last week. Deputy V. Isakov's apparently quite unexpected statement about the possibility of electing the president by a kind of Assembly of the Land was immediately followed by a statement from the opposite flank. M. Poltoranin proposed that presidential and parliamentary elections be postponed until 1998. Almost simultaneously, as if on command, two movements -- "The Realists" and "Accord for Russia's Sake" -- were established in Moscow. In actual fact they are preelection blocs. A noteworthy detail is that the blocs' policy statements say nothing about participation in the election campaign now under way for local organs of power, although much is said about presidential and parliamentary elections. It is logical to ask why. Because elections to federal organs of power are not due to take place for another two years. At last the latest putsch scenario has appeared. The evolving situation is surprisingly similar to that which arose in Russia at the beginning of last summer. Then, let us recall, all political forces threw themselves into preparing for early parliamentary elections. This was at a time when both the Supreme Soviet and the Congress, which were naturally against these elections, were functioning. A constitution preventing the holding of them was in force. In short, at that time early parliamentary elections objectively seemed an unrealistic possibility. BUT THEY TOOK PLACE! True, the route toward them lay through the bloody events of September-October. It is hard to say how exactly the development of the current situation will repeat last year's situation. There are many similarities. But besides this there is one really striking fact: The president's edict on early presidential elections on 12 June 1994 is in force. It is all the more surprising that the president rescinded dozens of laws and edicts after the new constitution was adopted. But not this edict. It can be assumed that the ruling nomenklatura and leading politicians are perfectly well aware of this. Their behavior gives strong grounds for concluding that their actions are based on the realistic possibility of an early presidential election. It cannot be ruled out here that they are banking on the fact that this election will take place in the not too distant future. Although nobody is saying this openly. The actual prospect of an early presidential election makes the ruling nomeklatura extremely nervous and compels it to commit acts which are not always well thought-out. Acts, for instance, like the statements on the possibility of canceling or postponing the general presidential election. Here, voluntarily or involuntarily, Poltoranin and Isakov presented a united front in support of the ruling nomenklatura, which is extremely alarmed by the possibility of a politician like V. Zhirinovskiy winning the election, because this would inevitably bring in its wake the replacement of the nomenklatura bosses. For his part Zhirinovskiy -- like, incidentally, other political leaders -- is strengthening his party ranks with increasing vigor. The appearance of the putsch scenario does not look accidental either. The possibility of an attempt to solve the problem by means of force should apparently not be discounted. However, while a president who has demonstrated, contrary to all rumors, that he is healthy, energetic, and completely capable is in power, we should most probably not fear such a scenario of the development of events. There are two mutually complementary methods of avoiding the distinct possibility of a serious political crisis. Above all the president should obviously make maximum effective use of the assets he has available thanks to the new constitution, primarily a strong executive branch, in order to stabilize the situation in the economy. At the same time, although it is an extremely difficult task, the state's democratic structure must be strengthened. Within the framework in which the existing constitution allows this to be done. Specifically, a Law on the Constitutional Court must be adopted as soon as possible and all participants in the political game forced to fulfill all constitutional provisions unconditionally and strictly. Strong presidential power is without any doubt capable of stabilizing the economy. But a strong state, which everybody is talking about at the moment, which does not have support in a developed civic society will always be threatened by palace coups. Therefore, once stability in the economy has been achieved there must be further constitutional improvements in the area of the democratic state structure and in the direction of strengthening the representative branch and achieving a balance between the branches, which will indicate the strengthening of ties between the state and civic society. But in conditions of economic instability (and three months' experience of the State Duma's activity proves this convincingly) a weakening of the executive branch in favor of the representative branch will most likely lead to anarchy and then to seizure of power. By taking these steps the president could lead the country to the next presidential election and lay the foundation for a new Russian democratic tradition: the legitimate primacy of state power. Otherwise, if the trend of preserving the situation (and consequently preserving the democratic transformations and economic reforms) is maintained, there will be a permanent threat that the country will roll backwards. Just like the threat that a most acute political crisis will arise. For example, in the event that the election is won by a candidate unacceptable to the highest political and state nomenklatura, events could develop on the pattern of those which took place in Algeria two years ago. When Islamic fundamentalists won the parliamentary elections and the ruling regime annulled the election results and declared a state of emergency in the country. The state of emergency in Algeria is still in force.
