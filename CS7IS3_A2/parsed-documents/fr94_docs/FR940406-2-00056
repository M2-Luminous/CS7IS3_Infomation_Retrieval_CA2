ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Roussel Bio Corporation to register the pesticide products K-Othrine SC 5.0 and Deltamethrin Technical, containing active ingredients not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: George LaRocca, Product Manager (PM) 13, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 204, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6100). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued notices, published in the Federal Register of July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29311) and November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54402), which announced that Roussel Bio Corp., 170 Beaver Brook Road, Lincoln Park, NJ 07035, had submitted applications to register the pesticide products K-Othrine SC 5.0, and Deltamethrin Technical, (EPA File Symbols 432&hyph;TAG and 432&hyph;TAE), ~containing the active ingredients deltamethrin (s)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(1 R ,3 R )-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate at 4.75 percent and (1 R ,3 R )-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid (S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester at 98 percent respectively, active ingredients not included in any previously registered products. ~~~ On ~March 2, 1994, EPA approved two new products (one end-use and one technical) as follows: 1. K-Othrine SC 5.0 (EPA Registration Number 432&hyph;763) for use in and around residential, industrial, institutional structures, and their immediate surroundings. 2. Deltamethrin Technical (EPA Registration Number 432&hyph;762) for formulating purposes only. ~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of deltamethrin, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use of deltamethrin when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. More detailed information on these registrations is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on deltamethrin. A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805).
