FR940912-2-00019 FR940912-2-00016 Financial Assistance Award; Energy Efficiency Export Council AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Region I Support Office, through the Golden Field Office, intends to award additional funds for two additional tasks to be completed under an existing grant to the Energy Efficiency Export Council (EEEC). The grant provided funding for a series of tasks related to export promotion of U.S. energy efficiency products and services. The EEEC efforts are on behalf of and in collaboration with the Committee on Energy Efficiency Commerce and Trade (COEECT). COEECT functions as the Federal Interagency Working Subgroup on Energy Efficiency established by section 1207 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, H.R. 776 (EPACT). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The two additional tasks, which were negotiated with the DOE, Office of Technical Assistance (OTA), establishes funding to place two specialists in financing of energy efficiency/demand side management projects at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The specialists, who will be accessible to the U.S. Director at EBRD, will help U.S. companies obtain financing for energy efficiency projects in Europe and the former Soviet Union. The completion of these tasks should result in an increase in exports of U.S. energy efficiency products and services. Total additional funding is $66,025. Noncompetitive financial assistance to EEEC is in accordance with the justifying criteria presented in 10 CFR 600. The DOE/OTA has determined that EEEC has exclusive domestic capability to represent and interact with the U.S. energy efficiency products and services industry, and, is, therefore, uniquely capable to fulfill many aspects of the mission established for the COEECT by section 1207 of EPACT.
