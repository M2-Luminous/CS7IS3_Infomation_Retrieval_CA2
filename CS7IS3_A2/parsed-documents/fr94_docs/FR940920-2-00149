FR940920-2-00149 FR940920-2-00089 Program Standards and Assessment Under existing legislation, States have developed systems of standards for the evaluation of both vocational and adult education. Research suggests that these standards are not widely used for program improvement. How can the reauthorization encourage the use of program standards and assessment to improve the quality of vocational and adult education? How can valid program standards, meaningful assessments, and the use of both in program improvement, be instituted in vocational and adult education at the national, State, and project levels? Is it feasible to develop national standards for either program or core standards that apply to both programs? Distribution of Funds Both the Adult Education Act and the Perkins Act include funding formulas that specify how the Department of Education allocates vocational and adult education funds to the States. The adult education formula is based on the number of adults, 16 years of age and above, who are not required to be in school and have not received a high school diploma or its equivalent. The vocational education formula, under the 1990 amendments to the Perkins Act, remains essentially the same as under the original Vocational Education Act of 1963; the two main elements of the formula, a set of population factors and an income factor, have remained unaltered for over 30 years. Neither formula includes incentives for States to develop successful, innovative programs or to increase their financial support for vocational or adult education. The Department intends to review the current allocation formulas for vocational and adult education programs and seeks comment on how those allocation formulas might be changed or how the distribution of funds might otherwise be improved. For example, what methods of distribution, other than formulas, could be designed? If formulas are retained, what bases, other than population, years of schooling, and income, might be used to allocate Federal funds? What other specific changes are desirable? For example, should the adult education formula be modified to reflect the fact that many clients, particularly those enrolled in English-as-a-Second Language courses, already have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent? To consider the impact on State allocations of the in-school population count? Should the vocational education formula include need-related factors such as the State unemployment rate or dropout rate? In general, should funding allocations to States, under either program, be more targeted? Corrections Education The Adult Education Act, the National Literacy Act, and the Perkins Act contain three separate provisions for providing educational services to incarcerated individuals. Section 326 of the Adult Education Act requires a State to reserve at least 10 percent of its adult education allocation to fund education programs for criminal offenders in corrections institutions and other institutionalized individuals. Literacy Programs for Prisoners, section 601 of the National Literacy Act, authorizes discretionary grants to establish and operate programs that reduce recidivism through the improvement of life skills and functional literacy. Under section 102(a)(5) of the Perkins Act, States are required to set aside at least one percent of their allocations for vocational education programs for juvenile and adult criminal offenders. Are these three separate authorities effective at meeting the vocational and adult education needs of incarcerated individuals? Would this population be served better if these authorities were combined into a comprehensive education program for criminal offenders? If so, should there continue to be a set-aside in the Adult Education Act for institutionalized individuals? If so, should it also address the needs of non-incarcerated criminal offenders, such as parolees and probationers? State Plans and Responsibilities Are any aspects of the State organizational and planning responsibilities under the Adult Education Act or the Perkins Act overly burdensome? If so, which provisions of the Acts should be revised or deleted to ease any administrative burden they cause? To encourage comprehensive State plans, should any of the State organizational or planning responsibilities under the Acts be modified to require linkages to other Federal education planning requirements, such as those in Goals 2000, the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act? Professional Development Both the Adult Education Act and the Perkins Act include provisions for encouraging educators' professional development, but a more comprehensive system of Federal support for professional development may be required. Section 353 of the Adult Education Act requires that at least 15 percent of a State's allocation be reserved for demonstration projects and teacher training activities; at least two-thirds of this reservation must be used to train adult educators. Under the Perkins Act, States and local service recipients are authorized to use Basic grants and Tech-Prep funds for professional development, and the Act also authorizes support for professional development through other, currently unfunded authorities. Despite these provisions, adult education research has found that few instructors are certified adult educators_only 18 percent of full-time staff and 8 percent of part-time staff. According to the recent National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE), both secondary and postsecondary vocational teachers have less formal education than academic teachers, while virtually all academic teachers and faculty members have at a least a bachelor's degree, 12 percent of secondary vocational teachers and 15 percent of postsecondary occupational faculty do not. What steps can the Federal Government take through the reauthorization to ensure that vocational and adult educators possess the knowledge and skills necessary to be effective and teach to high standards? How can resources under the Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act be used to (1) Support professional development strategies that States will develop under the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and (2) ensure that educators learn and apply the principles of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, so that schools accomplish real integration of academic and vocational skills? Data Collection In the course of collecting data for the National Evaluation of Adult Education Programs, the Department's contractor found weaknesses in the information management systems of many local programs. Many programs that participated in the study did not know how many different clients they serve during a year nor the number of students they serve on a given day. In vocational education, NAVE researchers found data inconsistencies across local tech-prep programs, and national data collection efforts in vocational education have long been problem-plagued. Yet, data collections can be extremely important because they can, if properly conducted, yield valuable information on program outcomes and can help drive funding and policy decisions at both the State and Federal levels. What role can the Federal Government play to ensure that data collection activities in vocational and adult education programs yield meaningful information that can be used to improve programs and, ultimately, benefit the learner?
