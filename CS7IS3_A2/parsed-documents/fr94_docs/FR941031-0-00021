FR941031-0-00021 FR941031-0-00008 4. Source Eligibility Alabama has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that: (1) Operates in Alabama; (2) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (3) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (4) Is not a major stationary source as defined in Titles I and III of the CAA which means the potential to emit for the source is less than: a. 100 tons per year (tpy) of any criteria air pollutant; b. 10 tpy of any toxic pollutant; or c. 25 tpy of all toxic pollutants; (5) Does not emit 50 tpy or more of any regulated pollutant; and (6) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. Alabama has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants; and (3) A process for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the Department determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. Final Action In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994. However, if notice is received by November 30, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
