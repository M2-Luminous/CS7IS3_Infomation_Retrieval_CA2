The opportunity emerges from the political context of the current sociological and political situation and from the capability of attaining the difficult forging of a constitutional consensus. This consensus emerged in 1994. It would not have been possible to arrive at this consensus without the preceding 10 years of democracy. This honorable Constituent Assembly is the epitome of that democracy, and it will be the point of no return between the Argentina of fundamental disagreements and the Argentina of definite agreements. History has taught us that basic agreements are the major force behind the progress of institutions, while fundamental disagreements have led to periods of deterioration or regression. We can affirm that a system's political stability is directly proportional to the degree of agreement reached by its political and social forces. The degree of this agreement is what we will write into this reform, and history will be implacable when judging certain achievements or errors. This honorable assembly has been convened on the basis of a popular mandate, a popular mandate that became more and more consolidated during the past decade, and it now has been given the opportunity of changing history, of making us a participant in the most important pages of that history. The opportunity arises today and we cannot overlook it. Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: You have been elected by the Argentine people to reform and bring up to date the law of laws in order to unfold the reform's contents. You have been elected by the people to consolidate, through an enlightened debate, a debate of ideas, the values of freedom and the instruments of democracy. You have been elected as protagonists of a time in which history is being written, a time of institutionalization, and I repeat: a most important time of institutionalization in this century. But you have not been elected to think about present times, to remain standing in this historical time, nor have you been elected to think about this century. You have been elected to think of the future, to think of the Argentina of the 21st century, to give the state the necessary judicial and institutional instruments with which it can thrive in the times we are living and in the times in which we will have to live. History will judge your responsibility. If you succeed in your performance, if you can place the interests of the fatherland above and beyond any other type of motivation, and if you overcome current disagreements by placing the common welfare in the forefront, then the future will look upon you with the same pride and respect with which today we look upon the constituent members of 1853. I do not doubt that this will be so. I do not doubt that each and every one of you have alighted on the banks of the Parana River, on this river that is a witness to heroic actions like that of the Vuelta de Obligado, and are aware of your responsibility, of the responsibility given you by 35 million Argentines. I know that on this side of the river, you will be illuminated by the spirit of Pancho Ramirez. I know that on the other side is the remembrance of Estanislao Lopez. Due to their passion for federalism, both of these caudillos were fundamental pieces in the building of Argentina. The people hope and confide in the revival of that patriotic spirit. They hope the democratic system will be consolidated with this reform and the balance between the powers of state will be perfected; that the organization and functioning of justice be strengthened; that the organs of control be strengthened; that the federal system be strengthened to enhance the economic development and progress of the provinces and regions; that Latin American and continental integration be favored. They hope, and they have faith, in the debate on the points that have been approved by Congress for this honorable assembly. They hope a consensus will emerge that will be the noblest of our juridical and political culture. Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: As president of the Argentine nation and in the name of the people I represent and to whom I must respond, I wish to thank all the political parties that, above and beyond the position each of them defends regarding the reform, made possible the creation of this honorable assembly. I wish to thank each of you for the civic courage you demonstrated when you assumed such an important historical responsibility, with the certainty that you will rise to the occasion. If the current reform process concludes successfully, then the future development of the new institutions and the best balances of power will bury the last vestiges of our historical disagreements. It up to this honorable assembly, it is up to you Messrs. Assembly members to provide an adequate framework for Argentina's entry into the 21st century. Now, I can only ask, as politician and Gen. Justo Jose de Urquiza did, that the light of heaven and your love for the fatherland illuminate you. God bless you. Thank you very much. [applause]
