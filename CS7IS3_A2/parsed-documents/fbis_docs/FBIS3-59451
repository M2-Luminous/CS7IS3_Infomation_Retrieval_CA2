Furthermore, Belgrade is constantly at work on refining its plans for the further militarization of the country. The embargo against Serbia on the import of weapons and on the acquisition of new weapons and military technology most certainly will contribute nothing toward lessening of tensions in the Balkans. The interest of the Serbian political leadership in the defense industry increased after the partial withdrawal of the army from Bosnia in June 1992. The bulk of the former Yugoslavia's arms industry was concentrated in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Belgrade succeeded in relocating parts of this industry across the Drina River, including some plants from central Bosnia and important divisions of the "Sokol" aircraft manufacturing firm from Mostar. However, it failed to gain control over key defense industry capacities in Bosnia, including plants such as the infantry ammunition factory in Konjic, the explosives factory in Vitez, the military equipment factory in Bugojno, and some other defense plants in Tuzla, Zenica, and Gorazde. As a result, Serbia faces mounting problems with the production of infantry ammunition. It turned out that manufacturing ammunition at the Titovo Uzice plant is too costly. They solved this problem by resorting to foreign trade operations run through the affiliated company "Jugoimport" from Belgrade. This trade is flourishing despite the embargo. Working through Jugoimport, Serbia is exporting M-84A tanks, missiles, guns, 6O to 12O-mm mortar shells, flamethrowers, air defense and anti-armor guns, various types of all-terrain vehicles, communication systems, electronic systems for G-4M Super Galeb aircraft, and so forth. In exchange, Serbia receives from Greece ammunition made by manufacturers in Western Europe, according to the Montenegrin weekly MONITOR. Meanwhile, Belgrade continues to work on improving its 1,000-km range missiles. The Yugoslav Army's highest ranking officers concluded several agreements regarding "defense" strategy at a secret meeting in Belgrade on 9 June, however, they focused most of their attention on the improvement of long-range missiles. Zivota Panic, the Serbian chief of General Staff, visited Iraq in March and is said to have visited Russia before that. During these trips, a group of his associates probably drafted and finalized plans for the transfer of technology and know-how to improve the range of the Serbian missile systems, which are quite similar to the Russian and Iraqi missile systems. Vojislav Seselj, a chetnik leader, who was apparently very familiar with these dealings, made public statements in Europe and, in particular, threatened Croatia and Slovenia with long-range missiles. He might have received the data on the new missile systems, which they are still working on feverishly to improve, from the then chief of the Counterintelligence Service who was later replaced because of his contacts with the Chetniks. Military analysts in Belgrade think that the Serbian army does not yet have such long-range missiles, which does not mean that it will not have them shortly. There could be problems manufacturing special types of propellant. These problems, however, are not at all unsurmontable. It is certainly not possible to interpret the improvement of missile capabilities as an effort to establish peaceful relations. There is also ever increasing talk that the institute in Vinca is working on the "cold fusion" process, which would be used to fit the 1,000-km range missiles with nuclear warheads. All these activities are causing quite a stir among observers in Belgrade. Various rumors are spreading -- whether substantiated or not -- asbout imports of "cold fusion" technology. We have learned that Genadij Sikin, Russian ambassador to Belgrade, visited FRY President Zoran Lilic on 9 December. Brief press agency releases reported that they talked about illicit nuclear materials trade in East Europe. Then in the middle of December, the Belgrade Sava center hosted a symposium titled "Aviation 93." The ongoing development of a Yugoslav supersonic aircraft (NA) was the topic of one unofficial session. This project began in the early 1980's. In June of last year, the Serbian political leadership, working through the then Air Force commander Bozidar Stevanovic, began the process of acquiring legal title to the Aviation-Engineering Institute in Zarkovo near Belgrade. This institute has various capacities, including wind tunnels to carry out various experiments, e.g., to reach a velocity of Mach five. It is also capable of manufacturing supersonic jets. It is not yet known whether Milosevic has secured an export market for these planes. This would be the only way to make this project economically feasible.
