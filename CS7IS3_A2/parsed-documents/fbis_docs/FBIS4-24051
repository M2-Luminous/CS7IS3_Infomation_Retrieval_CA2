The issue: Should Ulundi be the capital or should it be Pietermaritzburg? The cabinet has agreed to hold a referendum on the question within 18 months and to set up a special commission to determine which city should be the interim capital. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Fawzia Moodley] Today's agreement comes in the wake of a major public row between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which favors Ulundi, and the ANC, which wants Pietermaritzburg as the capital. There appears to have been some tough talking during the seven-hour session, but KwaZulu/Natal's interests seem to have won in the end. This was underlined by an agreement to alternate legislative assembly meetings between Pietermaritzburg and Ulundi, while the special commission's report is pending. [KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose] The referendum will be the one to decide where the capital is going to be. Now for the sake of having a referendum naturally we must have a voters' roll, which will indicate who are the residents of KwaZulu/Natal. [Moodley] ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma said a referendum was the way forward. [Zuma] The discussions with our colleagues today have made all of us to agree to the way forward that we have agreed. [Moodley] The agreement should ease tensions, which reached dangerous levels after both IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC MP Peter Mokaba entered the debate recently. The first sitting of the provincial legislature due to have been held in Ulundi next week has been postponed to late July or early August. Dr. Mdlalose said bills which were to have been debated hadn't yet been drafted. [end recording]
