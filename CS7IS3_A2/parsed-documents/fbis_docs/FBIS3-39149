He insisted that although the reports are not part of the confidence-building measures package, they include promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side by the UN secretary general and UN experts on the benefits to the Turkish Cypriots when the measures are implemented. He told ANTENNA: "Naturally, we will take whatever is included in the reports that will benefit the Turkish Cypriots. Nobody can tell us `Don't touch.' We will not throw away the reports. They include indications of what we can achieve through the confidence-building measures. "The reason the people agreed to the talks is certainly related to what can be achieved. How can we say that the reports are invalid? Of course they exist and of course they are a tool that we will use." The Turkish Cypriot leader said the reports were prepared by the experts to be used. "Otherwise, he said, there was no reason to prepare them." He continued: "If the reports were irrelevant, there was no reason to spend the experts' time and money on us. They have spent hours working with us. So, why do you, Greek Cypriots, avoid them? I do not understand." Discussing the time frame for Nicosia Airport to reopen and Varosha's residents to return to the fenced off area, Denktas said this will depend on developments. He said: "Don't forget that the reports refer to 18 months for Nicosia Airport to reoperate and two to five years for Varosha." Finally, the Turkish Cypriot leader said this week's meetings aim to prepare an agenda for the proximity talks which will begin on 17 February when Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, will be in Cyprus. Denktas said: "Clark will arrive in Cyprus on 17 February or a few days earlier, and will be with us for a few separate meetings. He will then leave us with Gustave Feissel."
