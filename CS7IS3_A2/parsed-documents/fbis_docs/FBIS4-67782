Not because Dinesh Singh is less competent but that is India's way to telling the world that despite the massacre of Muslims in Kashmir and elsewhere in India (the latest was Bombay), it has no animus against the Muslim. For one thing, having a few Muslim quislings on its side keeps the facade of Indian secularism alive and for another, people like Khursheed and Farooq Abdullah can always be relied upon to be more loyal than the king. After having shot down every proposal that Mr. Talbott made for peace in the Subcontinent, the Indians it seems used the opportunity to convey to the U.S. their desire to be recognised as a mini-superpower with all its concomitants -- nuclear weapons, large army, etc. That Mr. Talbott was predisposed to buy that can be gleaned by some of the observations he made. Referring to India's ``strong democratic tradition, its size, its growing economic strength,'' he said that it ``is a leader well beyond the confines of this region.'' Let us compare that with what Mr. Khursheed said. He said that a fresh ``geographic definition of the region,'' was called for because India's ``concerns go beyond Pakistan.'' Having accepted that premise, Mr. Talbott went on to place India at par with Germany and Japan in their claims for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council [SC]. Yet neither Germany nor Japan is, as of now, in occupation of a disputed territory, nor has either been accused of massive human rights abuses, nor has either waged a war against a weaker neighbour. Both are in favour of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. India's claim to eminence rests on its refusal to accept UN Resolutions or any mediation in its disputes with neighbours, has a well-documented record of human rights violations and is opposed to disarmament and NPT. And yet such is the allure that its potential market has for the United States that the United States arm-twist Pakistan to give up its major security concerns because these could come in the way of India's march to a mini-superpower status. So far as a permanent SC seat to anyone other than the big five is concerned, the claim of the Muslim bloc of over 50 countries is as good as anyone else's. The American case, it seems, is that Pakistan should give up its nuclear plans while the Indians retain their, Pakistan should not get the warplanes it has already paid for, or the missiles to counter the Indian stockpile, because it would slightly reduce the advantage that India has against everyone in the region and to regain that advantage India will have to divert its precious economic resources. Mr. Talbott presumably did not get the opportunity to ask Mr. Khursheed how much of its precious resources it is already diverting in order to keep an overwhelming advantage against its much smaller and weaker neighbours. The highly persuasive point that Mr. Khursheed makes is: ``Sophisticated weapons acquired by Pakistan have been used only against India.'' True, but where has India used its highly sophisticated weapons, of which it has far more? Logic, unfortunately, is not India's strongest forte, where its hegemonic ambitions are concerned. The United States too has, it seems, to address concerns of realpolitik and not political morality.
