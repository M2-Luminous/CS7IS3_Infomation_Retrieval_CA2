In Preparation for World War III"] [Text] New York -- Pentagon Chief William Perry made a gloomy forecast in the middle of April this year as he was touring South Korea: The DPRK "will be able in a few weeks to develop at least four atomic bombs" with all the attendant consequences. A month later CIA analysts concluded that as of early June Pyongyang would have between one and two atomic bombs. In a recent brief interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant U.S. secretary of state for Asian affairs, said that North Korea "has stockpiled enough plutonium to develop at least one nuclear device, and this process is proceeding fairly rapidly." Washington's concern at the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula is still growing. The nuclear reactor in the Korean village of Yongbyon, which was to act as a plant for the development of "a deterrent weapon," was unloaded very rapidly. It had been thought that it would take the DPRK several months to remove 8,000 radioactive fuel rods from the reactor given that it had just one transporter. Today the situation is extremely delicate. On the one hand, Pyongyang is clearly resisting U.S. pressure. On the other, a permanent member of the UN Security Council -- China -- may not respond appropriately to pressure from Washington. "Mr. Hubbard, under these conditions does it look as though Russia's idea of holding an international conference on Korea is the only way of settling the problem?" I asked the U.S. State Department representative. "Needless to say, this suggestion cannot be entirely ruled out today. But, believe you me, there is no time to be lost."
