After eight years of effort, the program has covered 85 percent of China's counties. Some 25,000 projects have achieved evident social and economic returns. The symposium was held to explore possibilities and ways for rural economic and technological cooperation. The exhibition is also expected to help promote technology transfers, product exports and establishment of joint ventures. Abebe Ambatchew and Romulo Garcia, two officials from the UNDP, praised the Spark Program highly, saying that the program has played a great role in boosting local economy through science and technology, and the experience can now be studied by other developing nations. In addition, they say that the program has helped China in fighting against poverty, in environmental protection and in enhancing steady development of the rural economy.
