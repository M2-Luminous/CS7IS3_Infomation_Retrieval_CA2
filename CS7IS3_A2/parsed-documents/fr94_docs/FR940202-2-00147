ACTION: Notice of availability of funds. SUMMARY: The Corporation for National and Community Service announces the availability of up to $3 million for grants to support the Summer of Safety, an AmeriCorps project, that will focus on enhancing public safety. These funds must be matched with non-Corporation funds, and will provide opportunities for more than 1000 Americans, especially young people, to serve full time in community-based collaborative efforts to respond to the problems of crime, violence and fear. DATES: The deadline for the submission of proposals is Monday, March 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Corporation for National and Community Service, (202) 606&hyph;4949. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 21, 1993, the President signed into law the National and Community Service Trust Act (the Act), which created the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service that addresses the nation's educational, public safety, health, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service. The Corporation is a new federal agency that encompasses the work and staff of two existing independent agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps, service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and the new National Civilian Community Corps, and also engage in efforts to improve the quality of service programs. In addition, the Corporation will continue to support the Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA) program and the senior volunteer programs previously sponsored by ACTION. The Act authorizes the Corporation to support summer service programs directly (such as the Summer of Safety) and indirectly, in conjunction with the States. Programs that operate during the summer offer an excellent opportunity to experiment with new approaches to solving community problems and to bring new resources and participants into community service efforts. Program Objectives ``Summer of Safety,'' the Corporation's 1994 summer service program, is being launched to respond to the growing fear of and frustration over the levels of crime and violence in every part of the country. The 1994 Summer of Safety will demonstrate the potential of national service to respond to these urgent needs by unleashing the talents and energies of Americans of all ages and backgrounds, especially young adults. Summer of Safety will specifically address the public safety needs of communities by achieving the following objectives: _Make direct and demonstrable impacts on crime, violence and fear by identifying and meeting public safety needs; _Build new partnerships and collaborations for safety that capitalize on all of the community's resources; _Demonstrate that every citizen_especially young people_can help make communities safer; _Provide seed support for innovative service programs that address public safety needs; and _Stimulate public interest in national service as a means to respond to America's problems. Program Overview The Corporation will directly fund Summer of Safety programs in up to 20 locations, both urban and rural, for the summer months. Summer of Safety programs will be run by partnerships that may include law enforcement, other public agencies, non-profit and community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and the business community. Participants will engage in service activities directly related to enhancing public safety. Permissible program activities may range from assisting police officers in community policing initiatives, to escorting seniors in high-crime neighborhoods, to working in victim assistance programs, to supervising recreation activities for children and youth that incorporate safety and violence prevention education. A program may establish terms of participants to carry out a range of different public safety-related activities during the summer, or place participants individually or in small groups in core assignments for the whole summer. Participants will be selected by local programs, and they must receive training appropriate to their service assignments. Participants will receive living allowances of at least $147.00 per week during their service, and, upon successful completion of the program (and a minimum of 381 hours of service), a postservice benefit of $1000 which may be used for support of higher education programs, certain vocational training and school-to-work programs, or repayment of student loans.
