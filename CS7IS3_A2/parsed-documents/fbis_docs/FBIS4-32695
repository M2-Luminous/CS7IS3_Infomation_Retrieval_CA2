As Miklos Duray stated at a subsequent briefing, the aim of the coalition agreement is the formation of a political alliance that will be able, in a political struggle, to develop the law-governed state and strengthen democratic forces. The coalition partners agreed on close postelection cooperation in and outside parliament, as well as on the establishment of joint committees for the coordination of policies in the spheres of self-administration, economy, and education. According to Vojtech Bugar, the agreement is a preparation for postelection scenarios and is designed to meet the expectations of Hungarian voters. The agreement is subject to ratification by the supreme bodies of both political entities. Both chairmen stressed that the political part of the agreement would be published in full, while the publication of its other parts, as well as the number of parliamentary clubs, will still be subject to talks. As the MKDH chairman went on to say, the agreement provides for the possibility of another partner entering this coalition; talks on the possibility of expanding the coalition with the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] opened yesterday. In the event of agreement with MOS, a new coalition agreement will be signed, which will also contain a section anchoring "very close cooperation. Such cooperation is necessary because we know that, during the two years of the Hungarian coalition's existence, there have been various attempts to break it up," the MKDH chairman added. Responding to the demand of MOS Chairman L. Nagy for a 25-percent representation of his party on the common slate of candidates, as this corresponds to the number of "Hungarian" votes MOS won in the last elections, Vojtech Bugar said that proceeding from the results of two years ago was unthinkable. Miklos Duray even qualified this condition as ridiculous.
