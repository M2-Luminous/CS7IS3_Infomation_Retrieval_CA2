Reporting on this sensational development, the British publication FINANCIAL TIMES noted that Brian Fall, Great Britain's ambassador to Moscow, was handed a letter drafted in Smolensk Square. The document emphasizes that the consent of all countries having an outlet to the Caspian Sea is required in order to begin implementation of the "oil" project. Thus, on the eve of the signing of an agreement between the Azerbaijan Government and a consortium of Western companies marking the start of the "project of the century," with a total cost of $7 billion, Moscow declared it had rights to the richest oil fields--Azeri and Chyrag, which the Western countries and the United States had acknowledged as belonging exclusively to Azerbaijan. Taking into account the reliability of the publication that publicized Moscow's demarche on this issue (it is well known that the reputation of FINANCIAL TIMES in the West is so great that important government decisions are sometimes made based on information reported by the newspaper), one may draw the conclusion that the struggle between the Russian oil giant Lukoil and Western companies to control rights to Azerbaijan oil is entering its decisive phase. It is not by chance, it is felt, that London was informed of Moscow's position on the "oil" question. After all, the British company British Petroleum (BP) obtained priority rights from Baku to develop the Caspian oil fields, while the British Government assured President Geydar Aliyev that it was prepared to be the guarantor of fulfillment of BP's obligations as envisaged by the contract. From the very beginning of talks with the Azerbaijan Government on the question of oil extraction, the Western capitals were not euphoric about the "project of the century." Experts predicted that Russia, considering itself the legal successor to the collapsed USSR, could hardly be expected to renounce its rights to the Caspian oil. Perhaps this is not so much an economic issue as a purely political one. Over the course of seven decades, it has been in Moscow that decisions were made as to what volumes of Caspian oil should be produced and for what needs it should be utilized. The lion's share of the profits from Baku oil settled in the USSR budget, but not only did Azerbaijan not derive any benefit whatsoever from this, it also received as an inheritance from the former USSR the so-called "Karabakh problem." Now the republic, weakened by six years of war and with a quarter of its territory under occupation by Armenian troops, had gotten an opportunity to independently manage Caspian oil. According to preliminary estimates, even in the first years of development of the Azeri and Chyrag oil fields by the Western consortium, total production volume would amount to approximately 30-40 million tonnes of oil per year, which would mainly be exported to European countries. According to the calculations of Azeri specialists, petrodollars would turn the republic into one of the richest countries of the former USSR, even before the end of the present century. Consequently, the war with Armenia for the right to control Nagornyy Karabakh would be concluded in Azerbaijan's favor. The prospect of emergence of a Transcaucasus country that is independent from Moscow in a financial respect evokes serious anxiety, from all appearances, not just in Yerevan. Officials in the Russian capital also realize the possible consequences of implementation of the "oil" project. One possible way of maintaining influence over Azerbaijan consists of reestablishing Russia's military presence in this Transcaucasian republic. Moscow is insisting on immediate introduction of its peacemaking forces into Azerbaijan. However, the West is suspicious of the Kremlin's military preparations. It is no accident that Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev admitted during the course of a meeting with U.S. Senator Sam Nunn: "We are being accused of neoimperialism, the assertion being made that a political agreement must first be signed, and only afterwards can peacemaking forces be sent to Karabakh." Moscow's demand addressed to the West that Russian Federation consent be obtained for implementation of the "oil" project is based on the theory that the status of the Caspian Sea is indeterminate. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the Caspian a border lake and believes negotiations must be held among all the Caspian countries with respect to dividing the Caspian water area into sectors. In this regard, Baku rejects Russian attempts to place in doubt the fact that the Azeri and Chyrag oil fields belong to Azerbaijan. Incidentally, Baku has not received from the Russian leadership a copy of the letter sent to the British side. Nonetheless, the leadership of the republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to Thomas Yang, Great Britain's ambassador to Azerbaijan, that attempts to impede the signing of the "oil" contract were without foundation, since in November of last year during the course of a visit to Baku, Yuriy Shafranik, Russian Federation Minister of Fuel and Energy signed a protocol with the Azerbaijan Government confirming that Azeri and Chyrag belonged to Azerbaijan. Simultaneously with its demand for determination of the status of the Caspian on an international level, Moscow intensified efforts in another direction as well. The secretary general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was sent a letter containing the oblique demand for diplomatic pressure to be exerted on Ankara with the aim of not permitting shipping restrictions in the straits of the Bosporus and Dardanelles. Moscow accuses Ankara of violating the Montreux Convention of 1936. The struggle for the straits is closely linked with the project for extraction and transportation of Caspian oil discussed above. In restricting movement in the straits, Ankara is letting Moscow know that it does not support Russian Federation intentions to use the Bosporus and Dardanelles in the near future for transporting oil out of Central Asia and Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean Sea.
