Experiments with the joint-stock system in foreign economic and trade enterprises should be carried out under leadership, by choice, and in a planned way. When carrying out experiments with the joint-stock system, foreign economic and trade enterprises should act in strict accordance with provisions promulgated by the State Commission for Restructuring Economy and other organs, including "Provisions Governing Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System," "Suggestions on the Standards for Joint-Stock Limited Companies," and "Suggestions on the Standards for Limited-Liability Companies." Departments in charge of foreign economic relations and trade at all levels should take pains to organize and guide their own enterprises to experiment with the joint-stock system and should refrain from rushing headlong into mass action. 2. In order to strengthen leadership over experiments with the joint-stock system in economic and trade enterprises, this ministry has decided to set up a "Leading Group for the Experiments With the Joint-Stock System in Economic and Trade Enterprises" (for the names of group members, please see the appendix). The primary tasks of the leading group are: 1) To study and draw up principles and policies concerning economic and trade enterprises' experiments with the joint-stock system; 2) To examine, discuss, and comment on applications and feasibility studies submitted by enterprises directly under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) to be reorganized into joint-stock enterprises; 3) To provide guidance to local departments in charge of economic relations and trade, and help them do a good job in experimenting with the joint-stock system; 4) To study and draw up policies and management methods for planning, quotas, permits, personnel, and finance which suit the needs of economic and trade joint-stock enterprises; and strengthen professional management over economic and trade joint-stock enterprises; 5) To do a good job in the propaganda, guidance, and explanations concerning experiments with the joint-stock system in economic and trade enterprises; and 6) To sum up and exchange experience gained by economic and trade enterprises from experiments with the joint-stock system, and bring about healthy development in the economic and trade enterprises that experiment with the joint-stock system. Offices will be set up under the leading group. 3. Issues concerning foreign economic and trade enterprises engaged in experiments with the joint-stock system -- such as their necessary conditions, establishment formalities, and the issuance of stock to the public -- should be dealt with according to relevant stipulations, including the "Provisions Governing Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System," "Suggestions on the Standards of Joint-Stock Limited Companies," and "Suggestions on the Standards of Limited Liability Companies." 4. When they are reorganized into joint-stock enterprises, foreign trade and industrial-trade enterprises in all localities and under different departments, as well as production enterprises that have been granted autonomy in foreign-related economic and trade operations, should subject their operational scope to reexamination and reevaluation by the MOFERT, and go through the necessary reorganization formalities in accordance with relevant stipulations. When applying for autonomy in foreign-related economic and trade operations, newly organized joint-stock enterprises first should obtain the consent of the MOFERT before going through examination and approval formalities according to relevant stipulations. Please submit any questions and opinions rising during the implementation of this circulations promptly to the "Office of the Leading Group for Experiments of the Joint-Stock System in Economic and Trade Enterprises" under the MOFERT.
