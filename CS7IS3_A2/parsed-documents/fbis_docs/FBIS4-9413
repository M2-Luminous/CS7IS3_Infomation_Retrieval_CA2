Commenting on the fact that Jacek Kuron refused to be a candidate for the leadership of the new party, Mazowiecki expressed his regret. "I know that the comments on this matter will be unfavorable. I tried to persuade him to put his candidacy forward, but he did not want to do it. However, this fact does not change our respect for Jacek Kuron," he emphasized. When asked whom the Freedom Union would support in the presidential elections, he said that the UW would definitely not support a candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance or the Polish Peasant Party, and that the attitude of the UW towards the present president was critical. He stressed that, for the time being, his party would not comment on the matter "in order not to attract any blows. However, the time will come when we shall make a statement." It is not yet known what the logo of the new party will be. It has only been established that it will be blue.
