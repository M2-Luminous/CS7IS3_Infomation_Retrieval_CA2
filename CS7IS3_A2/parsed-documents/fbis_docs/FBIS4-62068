The appeal, in particular, states the following: We, the Ukrainian people's deputies united in the Center group, propose to other deputy groups and party factions to create a parliamentary bloc of centrist orientation. We believe that a union of forces taking realistic constructive stands is quite possible since the majority of deputies, including those from political parties, participated in the elections with close or similar programs. People hope that the new Supreme Council body will be able to consolidate itself around creative and constructive tasks, as well as take hold of the situation in advance and turn it around for the better. We have no right to disappoint them. We see the primary task of the bloc as the prevention of a crisis of power. We have to form working and permanent Supreme Council bodies and a government in an efficient and civilized way; without losing time and effort, to begin legislative work; to subject our influence to the processes of state development; and to establish reliable parliamentary control over all sectors under the powers which were granted to the Supreme Council by Ukraine's Constitution. The first great accomplishment of the new Supreme Council could be the quick completion and adoption of a new Ukrainian constitution -- a clear determination of what kind of state we are building and where we are headed. Second: It is very [word indistinct] to find ways out of the economic crisis and to immediately begin the implementation of balanced market reforms which can be understood and supported by society. Our urgent need is to accomplish economic restructuring, fundamentally revise and liberalize tax policies, and reform monetary and credit policies, as well as the banking system. It is necessary to take resolute steps toward the quick overcoming of the payment crisis and the prevention of a threatened halt in production. In particular, the active support of basic industries is necessary. Third: [Word indistinct] correctives have to be introduced in the state's social policy. People cannot suffer any longer from the striking inconsistency between prices, on the one hand, and the level of wages, pensions, stipends, and other payments on the other. It is necessary that every able-bodied man be able to secure a decent standard of living for himself and his family by way of his own work, while the state should take care of pensioners, invalids, large families, and the other most vulnerable sectors of society. Finally, fourth: It is a task of extreme importance to strengthen the peace and accord between different segments of society, regions, and people of different nationalities and beliefs. It is the patriotic task of all political forces to preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. A particular urgency has been acquired by the problems connected with the course of events in Crimea and the situation surrounding the Black Sea Fleet. They are to be resolved on the basis of Ukraine's Constitution and current laws. The above considerations can become the basis for unifying deputy groups of centrist orientation in a parliamentary bloc. Understandably, they can be specified in the process of agreeing on positions. They can be the basis for working out a concrete course of action.
