The Russians asked the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo; the Serbs fulfilled the Russians' wish, while pretending at the same time not to have accepted the NATO ultimatum; the UN representative declared that the warring factions had fulfilled all the requirements and the strategists in Aviano called off the bombing flights. In the meantime, the Russians, in "blue helmets," arrived in Grbavica, defused the time bomb, and left NATO "swimming in an empty pool," thus asserting in grand style their return not only to the Balkans, but also to the international scene. Moscow celebrated this action as its great diplomatic victory. Yeltsin's headquarters made it known that not a single shot had been fired, not a single life had been threatened, and not a single kopeck had been spent. Russia had regained its historical role in the Balkans and had showed the scope of its influence in Europe and in the world. Surprised and to some extent offended, the Americans officially thanked the Russians for their skilled action. However, there prevailed the view in the United States that Russia had suddenly changed the Sarajevo scenario on its own. It was claimed that Russia had sent its UN troops to Sarajevo without informing the United States, that it had reached an agreement with the Bosnian Serbs in order to satisfy its nationalists, that it had helped the Serbs to preserve their honor, thus presenting the United States with an accomplished fact. All other opinions and assessments lie between these two standpoints. One hears the view that Russia has not only saved the honor of the Serbs but also that of the Americans and NATO, and even its own, since, for a long time, it has given in to the West over the Yugoslav crisis. According to the opinion of some, they had offered their support to the Serbs, while, according to others, they had forced them to accept the ultimatum by using persuasion instead of threats. In Pale, where Russian soldiers were welcomed with bread and salt, the Moscow move was interpreted as a guarantee that the Serbian population around Sarajevo would be protected and that there would not be a change in the strategic balance on the battlefields after the heavy weapons have been withdrawn. Russia had also brought the necessary balance into the peace process and had reestablished the confidence of the Bosnian Serbs in the UN and the international community in general. The view was also expressed that future relations between Russia and the United States might be defined in Bosnia. There is no doubt that Russia succeeded in reducing the pressure that had built up all over the world as the deadline for the ultimatum drew near. Russia opposed the ultimatum and announced a great diplomatic initiative aimed at securing permanent peace in Bosnia. Taking into account that Russia has not formulated its own concept for resolving the Bosnian crisis since the outbreak of the civil war two years ago and that it has only followed the proposals of the Geneva peace conference and the UN Security Council, the announcement of a diplomatic initiative is already a sign that Russia is ready to participate actively in the peace process in former Yugoslavia. It is immaterial whether this more active role on the part of Russia is a consequence of internal pressure or stems from the view that ultimatums must not become a normal solution to complex international problems. The initial reactions indicate that Russia has showed that it has the status of a super power again, at least in the Balkans. In addition, it is stated that Russia has always been powerful when it has been a force in the Balkans. The Russians have shown the West, primarily the Americans, that they will not accept the status of an unequal or simply obedient partner and that their cooperative attitude has perhaps been interpreted in the wrong way. They does not want their good relations with the West, primarily with the United States, to deteriorate, but they indicate that disagreements could serve as a warning to both countries that the balance in international relations must be reestablished, especially between "influential partners," as this is euphemistically expressed by Russian diplomacy. It seems that the new Russian initiative, which was announced by Kozyrev, and which was probably discussed during the meeting in Bonn, is a part of Yeltsin's proposal to discuss the future of Bosnia at a summit involving the "big five": the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. Most of these countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council; China's place was offered to Germany as the most influential country in the European Union. At the same time, Russia has announced that the European or the U.S. peace proposals for Bosnia are not the only ones that exist. Russia, for example, does not think that "the Sarajevo model" can be applied easily to other towns, which seems to be a broadly accepted attitude in the West. Not only because they oppose a series of ultimatums, but also for practical reasons: The additional massing of UN peacekeeping forces is very expensive. Regardless of how the return of the Russians to the Balkans might be assessed, it is true that they have taken away the war toy from NATO strategists and obliged international diplomacy to reconsider all options, except for the bombing one. It can hardly be imagined that bombs could fall on Serbian positions around Sarajevo if Russian "blue helmets" are stationed there. Decisions about possible new ultimatums will also not be passed that easily. It is not clear what will happen on the diplomatic scene. Will the UN, which has so far been dominated by the United States, realize that its reputation has been enhanced with the help of the Russians, as UN officials claim? What is the role of the Geneva peace conference in the context of the Russian proposal to hold a "big five" summit, given that Owen and Stoltenberg did not participate in the Bonn meeting? The Russian action and their return to the Balkans will be discussed for a long time, but a difference will be made between tactics and strategy, once the surprise and euphoria have subsided. Two very important components -- the economic and the military -- are still missing for a real return of Russian influence to this part of the Balkans. The scope of the first cannot be established on account of the transformation process in Russia, on the one hand, and the blockade of Yugoslavia, on the other. The military component, if "blue helmets" are excluded, is simply inconceivable. This means that, apart from romanticism and tradition, there is only diplomatic and political influence: The Russians have a dialogue with the Serbs based on mutual trust, which no other international power has. The United States and most Western countries are ignoring Serbia as a necessary element in the search for a solution to the Bosnian and Yugoslav crisis in general. The most important question now is to what extent will Russia, with permission from the West, develop into a strong diplomatic mediator, that is to say, into an influential power.
