That is the only specific accord reached during the work of the Russian-Japanese commission on the problem of liquid radioactive waste. A statement to that effect was made by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the Maritime Kray Administration Natural Resources Committee and member of the Russian-Japanese commission, on his return from Tokyo. Prior to Tokyo the commission, under the cochairmanship of Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, and Amano Yukiya [name as transliterated], head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Nuclear Energy Department, visited Vladivostok, then the city of Bolshoy Kamen which, as is well known, is where old navy tankers full of radioactive water stand moored at the Zvezda Plant, and also Sysoyev Bay. The latter is the site of a support center, the so-called sedimentation ship division and the base where Pacific Fleet submarines are cut up for scrap. The Maritime region was included in the itinerary solely at the Japanese side's insistence, which is perfectly understandable. Since the problem of recycling liquid radioactive waste is going to be resolved using resources allocated by the Japanese Government, it is clear that it is time to put an end to the secrecy and display the potential sites for the construction of the reprocessing complex. No one doubts that one is needed today. After all, even though the process of cutting up nuclear submarines is still going on at the Zvezda Plant, all the liquid radioactive waste tanks are full and there are approximately 2,000 cubic meters of radioactive water stored there at present. According to the specialists, the most logical thing of all would be to set up the complex for the recycling and reprocessing of nuclear waste right here at Zvezda. But the inhabitants of Bolshoy Kamen opposed this method of resolving the problem and the Russian-Japanese commission decided to look for another solution. Without coming to any definitive or irrevocable decision, the commission has arrived at two preliminary options. Option one is the construction of a mobile complex for the recycling of liquid radioactive waste, in other words a floating installation capable of moving freely at sea and taking waste products from ships and from shore-based storage facilities. Such an installation could be produced in six months, according to the assurance given by the Japanese. Option two includes the construction of additional fixed containers for liquid radioactive waste and a shore-based reprocessing complex in Sysoyev Bay. The containers could be built in three months, the complex in a year. It will become clear by mid-May which of these is the preferred option. By that time representatives of the Crown Agents, a British firm of consultants who took part in the commission's work, have pledged to produce an estimate of the cost and economic expediency of each option. When the final choice has been made it is proposed to put the best plan out to tender. In the commission's opinion the contract will go to whoever can guarantee to fulfill all the necessary technical and economic conditions at the lowest cost. Anyone will be allowed to tender. It is presumed that this will mean Japanese, Russian, and U.S. firms above all. So, if everything goes according to this plan, it may be hoped that within about four months the ill-starred and ramshackle TNT-5, the subject of much discussion for six months now, will finally be separated from its liquid radioactive cargo. But what about now? After all, if the Maritime Kray Administration is to be believed, this vessel is only notionally seaworthy because it could spring a leak at any moment or sink to the bottom without warning. To avoid protest actions by local inhabitants on the one hand, and problems in dealings with neighbors in the Sea of Japan on the other hand, the commission came up with what it believes is a compromise solution: The TNT-5 will be towed further away from the Bolshoy Kamen protesters. It is hard to guess right now just where that will be and how it will be done because the tanker is dilapidated and was written off two years ago. Perhaps it will be towed out into Sysoyev Bay.... Here is an interesting detail. For the first time in the history of this question, the very highest Russian authorities gave the Japanese permission during the commission's work not only to visit the Zvezda Plant but also go aboard the legendary TNT-5. However, the prudent visitors declined to visit the TNT after they had checked it with their personal dosimeters and registered a reading considerably above the radiation background. I wonder what was felt at that particular moment by those people who, by the whim of an evil fate, were unlucky enough to be doing their fixed-term service aboard this dangerously radioactive tub? Perhaps the sailors and commanders of the illustrious Pacific Fleet feel that for six months they have been guinea pigs who have helped to show the effect of the prolonged exposure of the human body to small doses of radiation.
