The Majles held an open session yesterday with Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Jewish religious minority and the cities of Kashmar, Kohnuj, Ramhormoz, and Zarand of Kerman made preagenda speeches condemning the recent crimes of the Zionist regime. The speaker of the Majles also condemned the Zionist crime of killing the Palestinian worshippers. The Majles then went into session. We call to the attention of our honorable readers the details of the discussions. Statements of the Speaker of the Majles In today's open session of the Majles, condemning the grave and unprecedented crimes of the Zionist regime in killing the Palestinian worshippers in the court of his holiness Ebrahim, Mr. Nateq-Nuri emphasized: One should stand up and fight against force; justice will eventually be victorious. The divine maxim is that justice will achieve victory. We believe that one must not retreat in the face of the oppressor. In fighting oppression, one should not speak of discussions, negotiations, relations, and peace. The nature of domination is to dominate. This is also true of the United States, which is the most criminal of all. He then addressed the leaders of the Islamic governments and said: Whenever there is one step in retreat in the face of criminals, the enemy takes a step forward. If 'Arafat and his agents had not accepted the disgraceful Gaza and Jericho Treaty, we would not have witnessed such a crime. The speaker of the Majles also added: Unfortunately, these criminals did not even act and will not act in good faith on the basis of this disgraceful agreement. Then, the trade leaders who claim to be the leaders of Palestinians and the PLO and other organizations sell the honor and dignity of the people of this land, and then the treaty will not have any results but crimes and treason. Today, while U.S. propaganda and U.S. talk of peace is heard in the Middle East, why do you think that such horrible crimes are committed? The Islamic countries, their leaders, and the Muslims should not be deceived by the foolish and deceptive explanations of the Zionists, who claim that this crime was committed by a few extremist Jews or soldiers with psychological problems. This is not true. For anyone to accept that a few extremist Jews did it and the Israeli Army and the United States had no hand in it would be extremely naive. This was certainly preplanned. Mr. Nateq-Nuri also added: Although usurping Israel does not see an organized army of Arabs before its eyes, it does see before its eyes a strong, aggressive, and brave wave of people, which has been formed there as a result of the Islamic revolution of Iran and our movement. We see the horizon as bright, and in the near future they will see the fruits of their movement. Hence, the rooted resistance of the Palestinians and the children of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot be endured by the United States and Israel. I believe that this crime is the start of a new treacherous and oppressive movement toward ethnic cleansing and destroying the resistance of the people in occupied Palestine at the hands of the Israelis. The speaker of the Majles considered this Zionist action in conformity with the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbs and said: The fact that the world is silent with regard to these crimes can be endured. What is important is that these crimes are neither the first nor the last. But what must be underscored is how the champions of human rights are silent with regard to such a crime. The human rights (organization), which sends its mercenary agent Galindo Pohl to Iran and quotes the reports of the Hypocrites and condemns Iran for having a prison or mistreating a Baha'i or changing the Baha'i cemetery in Tehran into a green area, those who profess their concern for human rights, think about this and spend so much to say: Why did you do such-and-such? However, in regards to such crimes, neither the United Nations nor the supporters of human rights raise their voices. Their silence in regards to these crimes is like their silence in regards to the Serbs. Of course, in a sense, the more of these crimes that occur, the more the waves in the occupied lands and in Bosnia and Herzegovina will increase; and the waves and blood, God willing, will dislodge usurping Israel, the United States, and their other supporters and increase the motivation to fight in the children of Palestine and in non-Palestinians. It should be mentioned that after the speech of the speaker of the Majles, the shouts of "Death to Israel" resonated in the Majles. Mohammad Reza Khabbaz, Deputy From Kashmar The first preagenda speaker was Khabbaz from Kashmar, who offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the birthday of Imam Hasan and, condemning the actions of criminal Israel on the previous bloody Friday, he thanked the people, the officials, and the deputies of the Majles for their presence at the funeral ceremonies of Hojjat ol-Eslam Qoddusi, the representative of the great leader in the Science and Industry University. Stating that our revolution is based on three foundations of ideology, leadership, and the people, he said: Unity between these sacred foundations has so far brought us the great blessing of independence, freedom, and the Islamic Republic; and the continuation of these blessings and the ability to reach the peak of spiritual and material progress are possible under the auspices of the unity of these three divine gifts. God forbid that any harm should come to any of these three foundations, which would affect the other two. He added: It is our duty to make every effort to preserve these three virtuous elements and not allow certain economic pressures to befall our benefactors, that is, the people who have given martyrs. The deputy from Kashmar then pointed out: One of the issues that causes the people to suffer is the uncontrolled and irrational inflation that puts pressure on the oppressed in our Islamic society. Even though the serving government has taken long strides toward the self-sufficiency of the country, the speed of economic modification is very rapid, and the oppressed in the society cannot endure these modifications. He added: The elimination of subsidies is not in our interests at all. I, therefore, request that the government slow down the speed of economic modification. Otherwise, the weak people will not reach the desired destiny. Also, measures to prevent chaos in the market must be introduced as soon as possible. Who is responsible for prices? Do you know of any place in the world where there are no controls over or awareness of the price of goods offered to the people? In less than one week we have witnessed an increase in the price of meat of 100 tumans, and there is no one to answer for it. In a few months, the rate of foreign currency has gone from 160 tumans to 240 tumans, and no organization takes responsibility, and the violators are not dealt with decisively. Khabbaz emphasized: Is the need to control prices not felt in the Islamic society? The greatest pressure is on that class of people with fixed incomes, such as employees, and those with low-level jobs. For example, until a few months ago, with the 160-toman dollar, the salary of an employee earning 15,000 tumans a month would be worth $93, but today he can only buy about $62 worth of goods with the same salary. In other words, not only have the salaries of employees not increased in proportion to inflation in terms of cash or material, but they also have decreased by about 30 percent. Instead, a small number of people in society who neither support the revolution nor have faith in the progress of the country, those whose God is money, have gained astronomical wealth with this windfall money. How long must these leeches suck the blood of the people of this country who have offered martyrs? We, therefore, ask the Ministry of Commerce to put the supervision and control of prices at the top of its agenda, to provide the grounds for nonoil exports, and to eliminate the obstacles to the export of nonoil products in order for the economy of the country to be cut loose from the umbilical cord of oil. Second, why do some economic terrorists still evade taxes 16 years after the victory of the revolution? Why, after identification, are the just taxes on their unimaginable wealth not collected? As a result, the weak worker and small business owner must pay for them. The deputy from Kashmar asked the government to treat these individuals in such a way as to make up for the past and to take their debts of several years from them, even by force, and render them to the Treasury. The speaker termed the uncontrolled population increase one of the important economic problems of the country and said: We ask the government to confront this deadly phenomenon with proper and serious programs and guidance. Even though since the Islamic revolution the government has rendered a great deal of service even to the dear villagers, and despite the economic embargo, the imposed war, and the destroyed country inherited from the cruel monarchical regime, the government has been able to implement several times the number of developmental projects of the past in the most remote areas of the country to eliminate the problems of the country. In conclusion, he asked the minister of roads and transport to give priority to the strategic Borsekan-Sabzevar road and mentioned to the minister of petroleum the implementation of the Kashmar natural gas project next year. Kuros Keyvani, Deputy of the Jewish Minority The deputy of the Jews condemned the horrible crimes of the Zionist regime in al-Khalil. The next speaker was Keyvani, the deputy of the Jewish minority, who spoke briefly and said: Since several thousand years ago, when his holiness Abraham bought a cave in the area of al-Khalil in which to bury his wife and it later became the tomb of his holiness Abraham as well as Isaac and Jacob, this place has been the most sacred place of pilgrimage for Jews. The Association of Iranian Jews strongly condemns this barbaric crime and the massacre of the fasting, defenseless worshippers. He continued: Especially given that all monotheists believe that eventually the existence of a single faith and common beliefs will result in peace and sincerity, this horrible crime and the disrespect shown for this sacred place are intolerable, and the perpetrators of this crime deserve curses and damnation. Certainly, the Government of Israel, which according to international agreements is responsible for the security and safety of the occupied lands and for preserving respect for this sacred place and its worshippers, has a grave responsibility in this tragedy. Keyvani continued: The Society of Iranian Jews demands that all the necessary investigations be carried out thoroughly and impartially in order that the perpetrators of this crime be punished. On behalf of the Society of Iranian Jews, in the wake of this tragedy, I offer my condolences to the grand leader, the families of the martyrs, the oppressed people of Palestine, our beloved compatriots, and the whole of humanity. Gholamreza Mo'tamedinia, Deputy From Kohnuj The next speaker was Mo'tamedinia from Kohnuj, who offered his congratulations on the birthday of Imam Hasan Mojtaba and condolences for the martyrdom of the oppressed Palestinian worshippers. He continued: Since the victory of the Islamic revolution, the global oppressors headed by the Great Satan have not for a moment stopped their hostility against Islam and the revolution and have fought the revolution and Islam openly and secretly. The speaker continued: By the grace of God and with the prophet-like guidance of the late Imam and the great leader, our regime continues rapidly on its path, and with each day the despair and hopelessness of the oppressors increases. The enemy accuses us of supporting terrorism. Perhaps the people of the world know how we and our nation have suffered at the hands of the terrorists who are protected by the oppressors. The best children of this land were assassinated at the hands of the same terrorists who continue their disgraceful life under the auspices of the oppressors. In continuation, the speaker added: The hypocrite minigroup that is today accepted and protected in the official and nonofficial circles of the Europeans and Americans has martyred many Friday imams in prayer niches and placed bombs in public places. Why do they allow them in their countries, listen to their lies, and support them? Stating that the false claimers of antiterrorist sentiments are themselves terrorists and nurture terrorists, he said: The human rights that we are accused of violating have been violated more than everyone else and before everyone else by the oppressors. Nowhere in the world and in no international legal system is respect for the rights of humanity as strong as in Islam and the sacred Islamic regime. Mo'tamedinia continued: The Islamic legal system that is practiced in our country today is the most perfected of all legal systems in the world. Then, in connection with the valuable services of the government in the 15 years of the revolution, given the tricks of the oppressors, the deputy of Kohnuj said: (The government) has gained great success in the area of development and fundamental work. To be fair, no one can accuse the government of not having worked hard. If at times some people make despairing statements, they are either ill-intentioned or uninformed. We have a duty to inform the people of the work of the government, but we must also mention the flaws. In connection with the uncontrolled high prices that worry the people to a degree, the speaker said: While the government must pay special attention to the vulnerable and low-income strata in the society, I suggest that the government fix the prices of goods and services as soon as possible and carefully supervise them in order to achieve trade based on proper and just Islamic rules. Mohammad Reza Bahmani, Deputy From Ramhormoz Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an unforgivable sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it. As another preagenda speaker, Bahmani, the deputy from Ramhormoz, strongly condemned the barbaric crime of the Zionists in the shrine of Abraham and said: Will the rulers of some Islamic countries relinquish friendship and support for the enemies of Islam? Past experience has shown, and this time will be no different, that all the constituents of the oppressors and the Great Satan will overlook the events. He added: The United Nations and the Security Council, too, will merely condemn the action and will not punish the perpetrator or perpetrators. Based on the Geneva Convention, the security of the residents of the occupied land is the duty of the occupiers, and the Zionist regime must accept the responsibility for this crime. The regime occupying Jerusalem, by compromising with 'Arafat, has targeted all of Islam. Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an unforgivable sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it. He added: Muslims must by thoroughly understanding the tragedy and display a calculated reaction, because the West has made its choice between the Islamic world and the Zionist regime for years, and naturally the Islamic world must also make its serious choice. He referred to the services of the Islamic Republic in the area of fundamental investments and said: Despite the population growth and the decrease in the price of oil, the country has been able to continue its services. Nevertheless, in terms of devising a budget and plan, it appears to have problems that should be mentioned. The operation of the First Five-Year Plan, in accordance with the ratification of the Majles, was supposed to have been presented to the Majles by the government, which unfortunately was not done. In many interviews there is constant talk of growth above and beyond the expectations of the Plan, sometimes up to 300 percent, yet there is no talk of the shortcomings and backwardness. In regards to the annual budget, he said: Note 29 of the national budget is a note that every year deals with foreign currency issues. The content of this note, even though it strongly effects the economy, is rarely evaluated carefully in order that the deputies understand how the system has been working. For example, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget states that the Central Bank must operate so as to ensure that at the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], the total obligations resulting from the operations of the current account does not increase in proportion to the investment account of the previous years and the foreign currency reserves at the end of 1372 are less than the foreign currency reserves at the beginning of that year. Hence, the foreign currency policies in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] must have two characteristics from a budgetary point of view. A) The foreign currency obligations of the country should not have increased compared to those at the end of 1371 [20 March 1993]. B) The foreign currency reserves of the country at the end of 1372 should not be less than the year's figure. [sentence as published] The deputy of Ramhormoz then emphasized: Why have Paragraph A and B, which were mentioned, not been achieved? Why has the rial been devalued so much? In practice, how did some amounts, which were earmarked for accounting, actually aid the budgetary accounting? How do we evaluate the operation of the sale of foreign currency in 1372? How did the committee cited in Note 22, Paragraph A, Part 3, operate? How much of the foreign currency purchases of the country have been converted into rial purchases? Why is the rate of foreign currency in the 1373 budget lower than the rate of the dollar in the official markets? If the rate of the dollar in 1373 is anticipated to decrease, we must note that at the present time, the rate of the dollar on the open market is higher than the floating rate. The speaker continued: The 1373 budget must reduce the likelihood of new crises. Also, the budget cannot be economically justified. Hence, the inflation rate projected in this budget must be stated. To what level will it bring the cash flow? How will it regulate the gross national product? He then said in regards to the management of heavy industries and mines and metals: These days, the people are witnessing the serious increase in the number of vehicles in the country. The Ministry of Heavy Industries, which enjoys such significant legal privileges as tax exemption, must saturate the consumer market through increased production and lower prices. Not only has it played no role in lowering prices, but it has been an important factor in increasing prices. Before the ratification of the law on accounting and the collection of customs duties and commercial taxes and taxes on various kinds of vehicles and road building equipment and the manufacture of their parts on 02/10/1371 [23 December 1992], the implementation of which on 27/11/1372 [16 February 1994] on all domestically produced and imported vehicles with consideration for the laws at the time and the legal codes of the budget of the years prior to 1372, some amounts were collected as taxes on imported and domestic vehicles and other taxes and deposited in France. The difference in these amounts in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] was about 3.7 billion rials [R] and in 1372, R170.5 billion. For example, prior to the implementation of the 1371 tax law, the Peugeot-405 GL was R19 million on open sale, and the tax paid was R5 million. After the implementation of the tax policy, this figure decreased to R800,000, but the price of the car increased to R30 million. 'Ali Motahhari, Deputy From Zarand of Kerman The last preagenda speaker of the open session of the Majles yesterday was Motahhari from Zarand of Kerman, who offered his condolences and condemned the Zionist crime of the slaughter of the Palestinian worshippers in the city of al-Khalil, asking for the widespread participation of the people in the march on Jerusalem Day. Stating that our revolution is a revolution of values, the speaker continued: If in a regime liberal ideology has abstract concepts such as the relationship of the people with their deputies, the deputies with the parliament, the government with the executive and judicial branches, and the like, these are alienated relationships, because in such systems the relationship of all sectors with the parliament, especially the relationship of the people with their parliament, is limited, noninclusive, and nondynamic. However, with the blessing of the Islamic revolution, our Majles has found an exalted place, as the first manifestation of the ideals of the people and the embodiment of the virtues of the nation. Continuing, in connection with the Majles, Motahhari said: The great founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran presented the Majles as the true house of the nation and the result of the calls of "God is great" by the people. The grand leader of the revolution also said that the Majles, in the true sense of the word, is the manifestation of the will and rule of the people. If we accept that the Majles truly holds such a position in the whole regime, then how can a brother who up to a few days ago was the governor of Kerman make such unjust remarks about the position and status of the Majles? In this connection, I ask for permission to inform the deputies of a few points. 1) He says that one of the deficiencies of our Constitution is that the government and the Majles do not have comparable importance. While the Majles can impeach the government, the government must also be given the right to dissolve the Majles. Indeed, has the time not come for this dear brother, even for one time, to carefully study the foundation of the regime and note that our sacred regime gets its legitimacy and the guarantee of the rule of God from the absolute rule of religious guardianship and the guarantee of the rule of the people in current affairs from the people. Therefore, when there are strong reasons for the eternal power of the regime, there is no room for the simpleminded. 2) He said that according to our Constitution we have given the central position to the Majles, that this deficiency has become evident and in several years may be corrected. The question is whether he has noticed that the balance of power, the distinguished position of the leader, and relations between the branches are based upon the ideals of the Islamic revolution and the approval of the nation and the people in form of the Constitution. Contrary to his opinion, I must emphasize that, thank God, the relationship between the three branches in our sacred regime is based on the guarantee of achieving the goals of the revolution and the ideals of the people, with the thoughtful and remarkable direction of the Imam. 3) He says that our problem in the first years of the victory of the revolution was that we thought management meant company, or somewhere else he says, it is an erroneous tradition for every group that gains a majority in the Majles to put pressure on the executive system. Of course, perhaps if the majority existing in the Majles were that that he wished it to be, applying pressure would be no problem, according to him. It is perhaps for this reason that he tolerated the problem in the past. In continuation, he said: What has to be said here is an expression of sorrow that he does not note that the deputies are the voice of their constituency and are considered the eyes and ears of the regime. Why should an executive official in our sacred regime not appreciate ponderous words from the mouth of the people and not pay attention to the eyes and ears? Is it not that the continuation of support and efforts of millions of people and the strength of this sacred regime is due to the respect that this regime places on the votes and words of the Muslim nation? Is it an unpleasant thing for this solidarity between the wishes of the people and those of the executive officials to exist? If they take a step for the people, do these officials not want to them to participate willingly in their destiny in the cities and villages? Is it better to choose unacceptable governors and officials with questionable reputations to run the affairs? If the law has given you the authority to select the governors, do you not want to make use of this authority to get better results, to carry out reforms, and to satisfy the people? Has the history of certain actions not clearly proved that it is not in the interest of our revolution to condemn and question anyone who does not agree with our personal and factional views and tastes, and to justify pressures? The deputy of Zarand of Kerman also added: I hope that his honor, who was ultimately honored to serve alongside the distinguished personality of the revolution, the trustworthy captain of the executive ship of the country, the beloved president of the Islamic nation, God willing, will be the source of useful and effective service in the future, and such judgments and tendencies in him will end. Motahhari then said: Yesterday, we were informed that a group of directors general of the offices of the province came as a group to Tehran. As the deputy of the people, I request of the related ministers sincerely that they ask their directors about the motive behind their trip in this situation and in the blessed month of Ramazan. Was this a personal or political trip? And, from what source were the expenditures of the trip provided? In conclusion, he said: I request of the honorable minister of interior and pioneering revolutionary that in order to put the minds of the brave and patient people of Kerman at ease and make them content, the necessary care be taken in appointing new governors, and that it be noted that these people are the capital of this regime and the benefactors of all of us. Ratifications The Majles rejected the attachment of the National Grain Organization to the Ministry of Agriculture. The Proposal To Separate the Grain Organization From the Ministry of Commerce The first item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles was the continuation of the examination of the first round of discussions of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Committee concerning the rejection of the proposal to separate the National Grain Organization from the Ministry of Commerce and attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, the general points of which were not ratified and were rejected. Among the reasons for the rejection by the above-mentioned committee: A) From the viewpoint of the bylaws and the goals establishing it, considering that the goal in establishing this organization [was]: 1) Provisions (purchasing surplus products of the producers of domestic grain, if necessary, from abroad). 2) Storage. 3) Distribution. 4) Regulating the grain market. 5) Commercial, industrial, research activities and related services. The above-mentioned activities are mainly in connection with the ratified duties of the Ministry of Commerce. Even though an insignificant percentage may be related to the Ministry of Agriculture, which is natural and essentially inherent in the organization's goals and duties, a percentage is related to other organizations. B) In terms of governing policies: Because grains are a strategic commodity, and in the past 60 years, due to their grave significance, attention has been paid to them, and during the periods when they were in the agricultural or cooperative and rural affairs branches, they did not have a significant return, inevitably, in 1352 [21 March 1973-20 March 1974] they were attached to the Ministry of Commerce. In the past 20 years, thank God, despite the war and internal crises, grains have had no critical problems, and since the revolution we have witnessed the relative increase in production of wheat and other grains. During the times when they were dependent on other ministries, due to incompetence, they frequently caused the fall of governments. C) In terms of organization: It seems that, as it has been decided that the general organization of the country should be reviewed, the discussion on the separation and attachment of an organization or an institution to some ministry would not be logical or worthy of the Majles, because it would waste the precious time of the honorable deputies on details. If the management of an organization acts weakly, the organization cannot be dissolved or moved. The operation of the organization must be examined, and the reason for the weakness must be found. These moves not only do not solve any problem but also add to the problems. There are many organizations, such as the Grains Organization, which, if we only look at the production aspect, we must move. Production [should be] in its own place and purchasing and distribution in their own place. The continuation of the committee report states: Now that the honorable minister of commerce has recently received a vote of confidence, it is not expedient to daily raise the issue of separating an organization from the Ministry of Commerce. Let us see its operation in the future and engage in such actions. Bill on the Establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of the Cities of the Country The next item on the agenda was the amendment by the Councils and Internal Affairs Committee regarding the bill on the establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of the cities of the country (returned from the Council of Guardians), which was ratified by the Majles. The text of the amendment of Article 1 by the committee: Article 1: In order to implement comprehensive and coordinated traffic policies and to improve the management of all affairs related to the issue of traffic, such as the design, planning, organization, coordination, guidance, supervision, and control of traffic in the cities, the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of the counties of the country, which will be called from here on the Supreme Council, shall be comprised of the following members: 1) The deputy minister of interior (president of the council); 2) The deputy of roads and transport; 3) the deputy minister of housing; 4) the deputy minister of post, telegraph and telephone; 5) the deputy director of the Plan and Budget Organization; 6) the director of the Environmental Protection Organization or his deputy; 7) the commander of the law enforcement forces or his deputy. The ratifications of this council shall be mandatory for implementation, upon the approval of the minister of interior. Amendment to Article 4 Article 4. The ratifications of the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of the cities of the country, which must be within the framework of the laws and regulations of the country, are mandatory for implementation for all ministries, establishments, government organizations, institutes, and public and private establishments. Proposal To Amend the Registration Law The last item on the agenda was the urgent report of the Judicial Committee concerning the proposal to amend Articles 16 and 20 of the law of the country on documents and property registration, of which the general points were ratified. The examination of its details was postponed to the next session. It is noteworthy that Article 16 specifies the procedures for application for registration and protests against it, and Article 20 discusses the procedures for protest to the property boundaries, for which an application has been registered and submitted.
