Is this now the end of Gorazde? [Kinkel] I am just as unhappy as the people who are watching what is going on here, this stranglehold of the Serbs on Gorazde. At the moment, I cannot say whether it is the end. I hope not. The situation is the following: Air strikes have become difficult, because one would have to carry them out against the 60,000 Muslims surrounded by the Serbs and in part also against UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] soldiers, who are in the town or at least have been there up to now. On the ground no country is willing to send soldiers for combat missions. And I cannot blame anyone for that. [Wickert] Air strikes should perhaps have been carried out a few days ago. [Kinkel] Well, air strikes were indeed carried out but they were always directed against weapons aimed at UNPROFOR. These were the demands of the UN, and this was done. The air strikes against the town itself would necessarily always have been aimed at the civilian population. [Wickert] You yourself now demand that the Russians intervene more and exert more pressure, but Russian special envoy Churkin says that talking with the Serbs is over, as they are just abusing us. [Kinkel] Yes, this is a sad sign for me. The Russians have the strongest influence on the Serbs, and if this influence is now lost or decreases, then the situation will become even more difficult. Therefore, today in Luxembourg, we, the 12 foreign ministers of the European Union, have decided to try once again to bring together the United States, the Russians, the Europeans, and Owen and Stoltenberg, and to make another try. [Wickert] Well, you can bring them all together, but the Serbs are quite obviously laughing. [Kinkel] They are obviously determined to do everything. This is the bad thing. [Wickert] Well, then something has to be done. U.S. President Bill Clinton wants to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims. What do you say to that? [Kinkel] There is no majority for that in the European Union, and I understand that. Clinton does not have any ground forces there. The French have 6,000 men there, the British more than 2,000, the Danish and the Belgians, too. They have the duty to care for their soldiers. They have had many, many deaths. I also tell the citizens in the FRG, who keep demanding combat missions: Are you willing to send your own sons there, to such a war? [Wickert] Then the only thing one can do is to withdraw the UN troops. [Kinkel] No, this would not be the right thing either. We cannot let the people in the besieged town in the lurch in this situation. Today, we, the European foreign ministers, were of the opinion that this should not be done and that, unfortunately, the only thing we can do in this difficult situation is to keep trying. [Wickert] What does keep trying mean? [Kinkel] Well, we have achieved quite some things in the political peace process -- Sarajevo, the opening up of Tuzla.... [Wickert] Okay, but these are things that you did not achieve by talking but by threatening with the use of force. [Kinkel] No, no, this only applies to Sarajevo. The other things -- the cease-fire in Krajina, the opening up of Tuzla -- were achieved without any direct NATO threats. [Wickert] But that was achieved at a time when one still could talk. Sarajevo was achieved by military pressure and Gorazde could probably also have been saved by military pressure. [Kinkel] No, Gorazde is in a different situation geographically speaking and is obviously far more difficult than Sarajevo for military reasons. However, Sarajevo was also prepared in political talks, in diplomatic talks. This is forgotten so easily. It was not only military measures. I must say again: Who is supposed to go there? Our German sons? We cannot go there. We cannot go there because of our constitutional situation. We are damned bad advisers to others, and we should restrain ourselves. Am I supposed to tell the British, the French, the Belgians, and the Danish: You have to send your sons there and let them bleed to death, also on our behalf. We always say that we are safe on our constitutional side. We cannot go there, also because of the historical situation. We should restrain ourselves. I can only say: Be careful. There is a good purpose in the fact that no combat troops have been sent in so far.
