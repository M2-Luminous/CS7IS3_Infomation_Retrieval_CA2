FR940617-2-00016 FR940617-2-00009 [A&hyph;823&hyph;805] Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Silicomanganese From Ukraine AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Alley or Donna Berg, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5288 or (202) 482&hyph;0114, respectively. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from Ukraine is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on December 2, 1993, (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events have occurred: On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified us of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value. On January 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent to the Embassy of Ukraine the antidumping questionnaire. (The antidumping questionnaire was divided into three sections. Section A requesting general information on each company, section C requesting information on, and a listing of, U.S. sales made during the period of investigation (POI), and section D requesting information on the production process, including specific amounts of each input used in manufacturing silicomanganese.) We requested that the Embassy of Ukraine forward the questionnaire to all Ukrainian exporters and producers of silicomanganese and ensure that complete questionnaire responses were submitted on their behalf. During the week of January 31, 1994, representatives of the Department met with officials in Ukraine to provide further explanation regarding the antidumping questionnaire and to answer outstanding technical and procedural questions. The two Ukrainian producers/exporters, Nikopol Ferroalloys Plant (Nikopol) and Zaporozhye Ferroalloys Plant (Zaporozhye) submitted responses to section A of the questionnaire on February 18, 1994, and section C of the questionnaire on March 14, 1994. Responses to section D of the questionnaire were submitted by Zaporozhye and Nikopol on March 31, 1994, and April 8, 1994, respectively. Petitioners submitted deficiency comments on April 22, 1994. The Department requested clarifications regarding the responses from both respondents on May 6, 1994, and additionally from Nikopol on May 13, 1994. Both respondents submitted these clarifications on May 26, 1994. On March 2, 1994, the Department determined that this investigation was extraordinarily complicated due to the dramatic changes occurring in the Ukrainian economy and, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)(II) of the Tariff Act of 1930, extended the preliminary determination until June 10, 1994. On March 15, 1994, the Department requested comments concerning appropriate surrogate countries for Ukraine from all interested parties. Only petitioners submitted comments. Because this investigation involves a non-market economy (NME), on May 4, 1994, the Department sent Nikopol and Zaporozhye supplemental questionnaires to elicit information necessary to determine whether either company merits a separate antidumping rate. To date, neither respondent has submitted a response. On May 20, 1994, petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine. Pursuant to the Department's request, respondents submitted shipment data on June 1, 1994. Petitioners provided surrogate value information on May 27, 1994, and on May 31, 1994, submitted comments to be considered for the preliminary determination.
