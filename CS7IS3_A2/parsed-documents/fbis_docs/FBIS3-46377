She said that to strike a rough balance between exports and imports is China's basic principle in foreign trade and economic co- operation, and it intends to realize the balance through expanding exports rather than reducing imports. Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Press Office under the State Council that China's foreign trade and economic cooperation continued to maintain a strong growth momentum last year on the basis of its rapid development over the past few years. The foreign trade volume last year reached 195.72 billion U.S. dollars-worth, an increase of 18.2 million U.S. dollars over 1992. Exports were worth 91.77 billion U.S. dollars and imports were worth 103.95 billion U.S. dollars. Thus the increase of imports was 21 percent higher than that of exports, leaving a deficit of 12.18 billion U.S. dollars. Wu attributed the slow growth of exports to the high-speed growth of the domestic economy, large scaled investment, robust demand, price increases and lack of supply of some commodities, especially primary products. Meanwhile, she said, imports of raw materials, energy and equipment needed for economic development increased rapidly. Statistics show that last year imported commodities, whose import volume exceeding one billion U.S. dollars include aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished oil, fertilizers, industrial chemicals and complete sets of equipment. Wu said that this indicates once again that China is a large market with great potential.
