FBIS4-35445 "drnes105_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 20 May 1994 ISRAEL Israeli-Palestinian Police Cooperation Described Israeli-Palestinian Police Cooperation Described TA2805070594 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (LESHABAT supplement) in Hebrew 20 May 94 pp 14, 15 TA2805070594 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (LESHABAT supplement) in Hebrew 20 May 94 pp 14, 15 Hebrew BFN [Report by Roni Shaqed] [Text] "Salaam 1 to Salaam 2, how are you doing, over and out." "This is Salaam 2. All is well. What do you want?" "Salaam 2, overtake me, we are entering a road under Israeli jurisdiction. According to regulations, you are supposed to lead the joint patrol on this road." "Salaam 1, thank you. Am overtaking, follow me. Over and out." This conversation in Arabic was held over the "peace" network in northern Jericho Tuesday [17 May] morning. Salaam 2 -- an Israeli Border Police patrol jeep, and Salaam 2 -- a patrol jeep of the PLO's al-Aqsa Brigade -- jointly patrolled road No. 90 from Jericho to al-'Awja'. The conversation was received in the joint PLO-Israeli operations room located on a military base in the Vered Yeriho junction, and was duly logged by the Palestinian duty officer. The same conversation was received in the al-Aqsa Brigade operations room in Jericho and the Border Police company's operations room in the Vered Yeriho junction. The Salaam 2 jeep was commanded by a Border Police subinspector. Three policemen occupied the back seat -- two from the Border Police and one from Israel Police. They were carrying M-16's and wearing bulletproof vests. An orange flag -- the joint patrol's emblem -- was flying on the jeep's roof. The Salaam 1 jeep -- a khaki-colored Palestinian Toyota -- was occupied by five solders and a lieutenant. Their appearance was much less uniform. The driver wore light khakis, the officer and three soldiers -- olive drabs. Each had different shoes on. As for the fifth soldier, he wore camouflage and a red beret. They were all cradling Kalashnikov rifles in their arms. Just like the Israeli jeep roof, theirs had an orange flag, but also a large Palestinian flag. This week Jericho looked as if the messiah had already come. Yesterday's enemies were now pals. A peaceful honeymoon seemed to have followed the cross, grating wedding in Cairo three weeks earlier. 'Arafat and Rabin are cross, but in Jericho, Palestinian and Israeli soldiers -- perhaps still in shock at the first encounter -- managed to cooperate this week. And quite well, too. Inspector Salah Khatib, a Galilee Druze Border Police officer, is the Israeli commander of the joint operations room. "I never dreamed of such a situation. The same man, who could have been at the other end of my gun a few days ago, is now sitting next to me. We shake hands. We have coffee together. We work in full cooperation. I am really enjoying every moment. Although it has not been long, there is a feeling of real friendship. We feel as if we have been working together for a long time." Lieutenant Jum'a Marwan from the al-Aqsa Brigade is sitting next to him. He, too, is beaming: "Thank God, we are sitting together after 40 years of enmity. It is a dream. Sitting together in the same room with an Israeli officer, working on a joint security task -- it's a dream. We spend many hours together. We eat together. We talk. We cooperate like brothers. I hope all the agreements signed by Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will materialize." So far, thank God, there have been no serious events to put the cooperation to a test. This idyll (or nightmare for pessimists) may evolve into a crisis soon enough. There are enough friction points both in Jericho and Gaza. A stone thrown at a Na'ama settler's car, hitting a child, or gunfire at a Qatif Bloc settler's car are an example of real-life events. Not to mention the formidable land mine created by the Shalom 'Al Yisra'el synagogue. By the way, the fuse of this Jericho bomb may have been ignited this week. The settlers came to the site carrying weapons. The Palestinians fumed. "They cannot bring weapons to prayer in a synagogue," Jericho military commander, Isma'il al-Hajj, grumbled. Faysal al-Husayni warned that the Hebron event is liable to recur in the Jericho synagogue. Under the agreement, an Israeli may carry licensed weapons when entering autonomy territory. "The agreement does not state that armed settlers may enter a synagogue," al- Husayni told the U.S. secretary of state, asking for his intervention. But the settlers remained adamant. To their dismay, the agreement limited their presence at the synagogue to the time between 0900 and 1800, in a group not exceeding 30 worshipers. This week they demonstratively ignored the Palestinian soldiers. "We will not obey their orders," they declared. The security cooperation was the result of the need to imbue complicated agreement clauses with content. The security responsibility distribution between Israel -- which is in charge of foreign security, settlement security, and the security of Israelis -- and the Palestinian authority -- which is in charge of internal security and public order enforcement in autonomy territory -- requires close cooperation between field soldiers. To enable that, the sides established the JSC [preceding abbreviation in English], the Joint Coordination and Cooperation Committee, in which officers exchange information and guide the three DCO's [preceding abbreviation in English], the District Coordination and Cooperation Offices, which have been set up in Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Jericho. The three coordination offices operate 24 hours a day as joint commands. The offices guide the joint patrols and the joint stationary patrols. Patrols are carried out 24 hours every day along autonomy roads used by Israelis and the length of the shore opposite the Qatif Bloc. The joint patrol includes an Israeli jeep and a Palestinian jeep. The patrol is led by an Israeli vehicle on roads under Israeli jurisdiction and by a Palestinian one on roads for which Palestinians are responsible. In addition, six joint mobile units have been deployed in the Nisanit junction, Netzarim junction, Kfar Darom junction, Sufa-Morag junction, Vered Yeriho junction, and in the vicinity of the Elisha' Nahal Brigade presettlement in northern Jericho. These units are the alert force. The operations room of the Jericho regional coordination office at the military base near the Vered Yeriho checkpoint was inaugurated last Friday. "Authorized Personnel Only," its door says. The trailer is partitioned into three sections: the Israeli command room, the Palestinian command room, and the joint operations room between these two. Two officers -- an Israeli and a Palestinian -- sit behind a large desk. The table accommodates a telephone, a radio, logs, and maps. The wall features a large 1:200,000 map of the autonomous areas. The map is in Hebrew and Arabic. The main traffic axes are prominently marked in purple. Another wall features a chart of the joint radio network in Hebrew and Arabic. "Salaam" (peace) is this extensive network's code name. All the checkpoints around Jericho, the Allenby Bridge, the joint patrols, and the troop commanders are linked up to it. A list of duty officers and aides hangs on another wall. On the day we visited, the lists said: On the Israeli side, patrol commander is Lt. Amir, on the Palestinian side -- Lt. Hisham. Stationary force in Elisha': Israeli Lt. Bini and Palestinian Lt. Ashraf; in Vered Yeriho, Palestinian Lt. Anis and Israeli Lt. Dash. Lt. Hani 'Iyad is sitting in the Palestinian operations room. He says his family are refugees from Zefat. He is quick with a smile, plump and bespectacled. The East Jerusalem daily AL-QUDS lies on his desk. Two soldiers sit on a bench in the corner next to him. They hold Kalashnikov rifles. "I have served in the Palestinian army since my youth many years ago," he says, then turns away to listen to a report on the radio network. "Where are you from?" he asks. "From YEDI'OT AHARONOT," we reply, and he laughs. "I am familiar with it, you know. I read your newspaper. Even in Iraq, we used to get translations of your newspaper." [Shaqed] How is the joint work with the Israelis going? ['Iyad] Very well, thank God. There is no wall between us. We eat together, drink together, sit together. How are the Israelis? Ordinary people. They received us as a matter of course. Our coordination is built on understanding. We have not trained together yet, we are merely starting our cooperation. Regarding joint training and exercises, you should ask the command. I do not have the authority to answer that. [Shaqed] What are your open-fire orders? ['Iyad] The matter is clear to us. Any problem that arises should be solved quietly and amicably. Like brothers. In the Israeli areas, the solution of problems is up to the Israeli jeep, while in the Palestinian areas it is up to our jeep. God willing, there will be no problems. We have received orders to solve problems quietly and amicably. [end 'Iyad] The Palestinian soldiers working in the regional coordination office are still accorded the "full board" treatment, which includes meals in the Israeli mess hall. The Palestinians have somewhat of a problem in this respect. They have a dining room in the administration building. Cooks, too. But they have no food. Funds pledged to the policing force have not arrived yet. In the meantime, Jericho residents are the suppliers of food and meals. A 16-member committee representing various major local families was established in the city to collect donations for the al-Aqsa Brigade. During the first week, they received free gasoline from a local gas station owner. Colonel 'Ofer is the Israeli commander of the Jericho regional coordination unit. The Palestinian side is represented by Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji, deputy commander of the al-Aqsa Brigade. A civilian-clad Brig. Gen. Naji secretly arrived in Jericho a week prior to the evacuation. He spent the nights at the home of 'Abd- al-Karim Sidar, the Fatah chief in Jericho, who briefed him about the city and its problems. He spent the days with Col. 'Ofer and other senior officers. He studied the roads, the various problems of the Jericho area, coordinated various necessary issues, and prepared the patrol troops induction. The preliminary preparations helped the joint force to perform efficiently from its first hours. Col. 'Ofer: "There is a lot of goodwill on both sides, great willingness to listen, hash things out -- a definitely positive spirit. No social ties, though. We are two different sides, and we are here to do a job. No joint training is scheduled and none has been done so far." Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji is wearing a red beret and commando shoes. There are no decorations or emblems on his uniform, just a small metal Palestinian flag on his chest. He has a small two-way radio and a red attache case. He drives around Jericho in a Mercedes 230 loaned by a city resident, who has volunteered to chauffeur him around: "The synagogue is the most sensitive friction point we have in Jericho," he says as we drove to the site. When we got there, about 30 settlers, including Knesset Member Hanan Porat, were inside. The settlers ignored him almost completely. It was Brig. Gen. Naji's first-ever encounter with settlers. He, too, seemed to be experiencing a kind of a first-encounter shock. He made an effort to focus on security problems. "They are here in accordance with the agreement. I hope they are here to pray, not to stage a provocation. I further hope the problems will be solved through persuasion." Brig. Gen. Naji was astounded to see weapons on the settlers' shoulders. Captain Muhammad Lutfi, the Palestinian security officer at the synagogue, did not exactly know what the instructions were. "The settlers are armed. I must be given instructions. Should they be allowed in with their arms or not?" he asked. A brief conversation with Col. 'Ofer solved the problem. "According to the agreement, they are allowed," he told his PLO counterpart. The first mini-friction occurred last Friday. A group of 10 Kakh members snuck into the synagogue after dark. The Palestinian soldiers summoned the joint patrol which evacuated the Kakh men from the area. Procedures worked. However, the real tests still lie ahead. The joint patrol makes its way along Route 90 on an average of once every half an hour. The Palestinian vehicles occasionally change. Their car pool is still small, and consists of 10 Toyota and 8 Land Rover jeeps. The Land Rovers were given them as a gift by King Husayn when he bid farewell to the soldiers two hours before they entered Jericho. On the first day of the joint patrols it was the Israeli jeep that had problems. The Palestinian officer knew something about mechanics and helped repair it. Moshe, a blue-uniformed Israeli policemen, regularly takes part in the patrols: "I do my job according to instructions, exactly by the book. The feeling is good. Personal relations have not yet emerged but, in my opinion, personal relations are not necessary in this job. They are serious in their attitude. They know how to speak on the radio in order to conduct the patrols properly. In this respect, they know their job." We met Wa'il Muhammad Subhi in the Palestinian jeep. He comes from Kafr al-Labad near Tulkarm. He left the West Bank in 1967 and joined the Palestinian Liberation Army. As soon as he gets his first leave he will visit his relatives in the village. At the moment, his wife and four children are still in Jordan. After three days of joint patrols Wa'il Muhammad manages to see the half-full cup: "We ate together, we smoked cigarettes together. It is 70-80 percent all right. We talked. They asked us about our past. We do not frighten them, and they do not frighten us. If only it remains this way."
