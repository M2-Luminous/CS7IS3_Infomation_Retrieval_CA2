We, therefore, believe constitutional reform is essential for today's Venezuela. At the same time, however, we admit and proclaim that the success of constitutional reform must be based on whether it manages to understand and address the concerns, aspirations, desires, and needs of the nation. This is why prominent academic institutions are insisting on the need to discuss all topics related to this fundamental problem. It is essential that this be done in order that the idea of reform can thrive. This will also enable the reform to revitalize and strengthen the democratic institutions that were confirmed when the Venezuelan Constitution was approved on 23 January 1961. At times, I confess, it seems as though this topic is absent from the overall larger issues that trouble the people. Also, the issue of constitutional reform is frequently precluded by the questionable aspiration to convene a Constituent Assembly. This issue has to be seriously and objectively studied. We must look at prior cases and examples that can guide us in reaching a decision. We must take into account the fact that our country's historic experiences clearly indicate that every attempt that has been made to resolve Venezuela's problems by breaking its institutionality have led to situations, and frequently very quickly, that were sometimes worse than the ones they tried to correct. This is the situation that must be confronted today. In this sense, we must also remember and remind the Congress of the Republic that it must base its conduct and actions on two indispensable pronouncements: Reforms must be necessary and timely, and they must correspond to the Venezuelan people's larger concerns within the context of today; also, according to the text of the 1961 Constitution, the overall reform of the Constitution has to be submitted to a popular referendum, and the people have to be the ones who decide whether it is approved. Therefore, Congress is not the arbiter of those institutions that must be reformed when the reforms are prepared solely in accordance with Congress' own views and interests. In terms of constitutional reform, Congress must interpret the people's will. The reform that has been discussed, prepared, and adopted in the legislative chambers, through the complicated process stipulated by the Constitution, must be submitted to the people for their approval and ratification. I sometimes have the impression that legislators lose this perspective. In turn, I believe it is necessary for them to remember the fact that the work they are going to carry out is completely useless if the people decide not to approve it. They have to adopt a position that truly represents the people's concerns, aspirations, and wishes. When we assumed the task of preparing the reform bill, accepting the legislative chambers' mandate that established a unicameral commission, we strongly endorsed this position. We did this because the initial proposal to approve a new amendment--a third amendment to the Constitution--gradually changed to an overall constitutional reform, primarily because of the dynamic march of events in the country. We have emphasized this to the legislators, and we want to do this again now. I sincerely believe this task is unpostponable. My modest opinion is that we should continue the initial process started during the previous constitutional period, because the Constitution establishes that once the reform process has been initiated, it must follow all of the procedures established for the approval of laws. Therefore, once the process, required by the Constitution, starts....
