The "action Japan" program is aimed at creating a partnership between Japan and Britain both at the governmental and private- sector levels to make British products more competitive not only in Japan but in global markets, British Trade and Industry Minister Richard Needham said at a news conference in Tokyo. The British Government has selected 10 industrial sectors with the most growth potential as focusing areas under the export campaign, Needham said. He said the program will center on trade missions, trade fairs, seminars and marketing research, all to be conducted jointly with the Japan External Trade Organization. The 10 designated sectors are health care, auto parts, marine equipment, power generation equipment, construction, giant global projects, electronic components, environmental equipment and services, food and beverages, and lifestyle-related areas such as clothing, textiles and retailing. Britain wants to expand Japanese-bound exports to 3.5 billion pounds a year from the current 2.6 billion pounds within two or three years, Needham said. As a way to create larger business opportunities for British firms, needham stressed the need for the Japanese Government to ease its control on rules and regulations. Needham said he recently presented to the Japanese Government a list of industrial sectors where Britain wants to see deregulation. The sectors are financial services, legal services, telecommunications, oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, liquors, food and beverages, autos and marine equipment, the trade minister said. It is necessary for British firms to compete with Japanese counterparts "on a level playing field," Needham said. Needham is visiting Japan as part of an export-promoting tour of five Pacific rim countries. "Action Japan" is the third program of its kind that Britain has formulated, following "opportunity Japan" in 1988 and "priority Japan" in 1991.
