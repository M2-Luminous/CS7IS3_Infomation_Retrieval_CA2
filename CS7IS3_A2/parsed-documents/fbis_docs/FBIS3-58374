[passage omitted] [Martins] For the first time in its history, NATO has enabled its military and logistic structure to be at the service of the WEU, so that in the context of military operations, the European allies can implement their common defense and security policy. [Cavaco] There is, therefore, a major change taking place in NATO. The WEU is the political arm of the European Union for the implementation of the defense policy. But at the same time it is NATO's European pillar. NATO as a whole is interested and strongly committed to strengthening this European pillar of NATO. [Martins] Above all, because we are to witness a reduction of the U.S. presence in Europe, the allies should from now on have a more active role in their own security. This situation pleases Portugal, moreover, because it will reinforce the importance of the Lajes air base [Azores]. [Cavaco] The Azores are today, and increasingly, seen as Portugal's contribution to peace in the world, because you should also bear in mind that this summit has reaffirmed the possibility of operations outside the area, with the involvement of NATO troops in association with troops from non-NATO countries. [passage omitted] [Martins] If you were not the Portuguese prime minister but the prime minister of Hungary, Poland, or even Slovakia, would you feel satisfied and safe with what is written in the final communique? [Cavaco] I would have to be realistic. But I am not surprised that the leaders of Poland, or Czechoslovakia [as heard], or others, would like the community or the alliance to give more concrete and precise steps toward enlargement, but I think this would be a mistake.
