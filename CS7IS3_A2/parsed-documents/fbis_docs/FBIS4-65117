Judging from the show he offered the country, we can expect some fine displays of seduction in the coming months. With inimitable talent, the old star has begun casting its last rays of light. Visibly, the president has determined to leave behind him an image as flattering and as affable as possible, in contrast to his real nature, which may be inferred from his partisan past. Now that the end of his mandate is near, the activist ideologue of the seventies and eighties, whose overt goal was to change society, has now been replaced by a shrewd man who has had an opportunity to gauge time, people, things, and probably also his own ability to influence history. Truth be told, Francois Mitterrand's pride has been sorely tried over the last few years. What is left of his appetite for glory, if not the deflated dream of Socialism triumphant, a few grandiloquent building sites, and the crumbs of shared authority? It is no accident that the only issue about which he came across forcefully yesterday is that of nuclear testing; he had no other topic through which he could show he still had some power. What was new was the fact that he did not systematically resort to the one other power he made such liberal use of in the past: sowing the seeds of discord. Such cordiality was out of character, barely tinged with what irony was needed to show he remains nobody's fool. But indeed, why fight when there is nothing at stake, no more prize to be won? So Francois Mitterrand quietly leaves the melee of current history. Already, all he has to do is observe its games with amused aloofness and controlled nostalgia. So he indulges in mild jesting, and politics is reduced to a conversational topic. And Francois Mitterrand is very eloquent. Ah, if only the program could have lasted one or two hours longer! And his mandate two or three extra years! But it is way too late now. Francois Mitterrand's end will not be tragic. He was no born hero. Had he been endowed with a little less pride and intelligence, he would have preferred the image of a nice and harmless old man. One has the feeling that, in the twilight years, the temptation is there.
