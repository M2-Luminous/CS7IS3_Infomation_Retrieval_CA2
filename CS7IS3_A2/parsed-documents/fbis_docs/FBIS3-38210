It is impossible not to be dismayed by such a concentration of decisions, both aberrant on the intellectual and financial levels and dramatic on the human level. The creation of a new currency in an upside down economy is certainly aberrant. A national symbol, the currency is the incarnation of a country's financial image. When the country is starting out from zero and the currency is created from thin air, its fate is settled in advance: it only means a fall. What is most serious seems to be the role (or rather, the lack of it) played by Western economic advisers with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], with the European Union in the lead, which allow--even approve of and finance--such absurdities. These measures are also dramatic on a human level because they condemn all the populations concerned to galloping inflation and a vertiginous drop in their standard of living. Only the happy possessors of strong currencies (the dollar and West European currencies) are the winners, building fortunes from an elementary, if not savage, business. Thus, with the emergence of liberalism, most East European people are living much worse than before, particularly wage earners, professionals, and, still more, retirees. Hence the understandable attraction exerted by extreme rightist and neocommunist parties advocating a return to an acceptable and desirable order, as recently manifested by Russian voters. While there is no miracle solution for such a problem, certain measures ought to be taken. In economic issues, the first priority for any country is the currency. The currency of a country such as Russia, Poland, or Romania is worth nothing--on an international level, of course--if it is not a convertible currency. A Western company planning to do business in Russia would then attempt by all available means to obtain contracts in dollars or marks; alternately, it would accept a compensation/barter system with all the risks this entails. This situation considerably restricts foreign investment in East Europe. True, the solution is radical: East European currencies ought to be abolished and replaced by a real currency. For various reasons, we believe it would be opportune to retain the ECU as a common currency for East Europe, notably from a geopolitical perspective. This solution is radical because it means carrying out a veritable financial transfusion by replacing at a given time the country's monetary mass with its equivalent in ECU's at a rate set in an authoritarian way, exactly as West Germany did for the former East Germany. This transfusion would have the dual advantage of limiting the growth of the money supply (which would no longer be the result of the printing presses), hence to stabilize prices and create an attractive new market for Western investors as long as local consumers pay in hard currency. A really productive economy would thus have a chance to develop among our Eastern neighbors and local people would benefit from a real purchasing power. Obviously, the loss of monetary sovereignty in the countries concerned would be a disadvantage. But this is what awaits all of us, the signatories of the Maastricht Treaty, in a few years. On the contrary, this might be an excellent occasion to promote the ECU by exporting it to the East in a progressive manner (for instance, through a test in a country like Bulgaria, or Hungary, or Uzbekistan). The 1 January 1994 installation of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt comes at the right time to promote such an experiment....
