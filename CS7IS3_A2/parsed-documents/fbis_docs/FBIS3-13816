Sources close to the foreign ministry said the Tunis meeting could lead to a meeting Thursday in Paris between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) chief Yasir 'Arafat. A delegation led by chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq will discuss the deployment in Hebron of Palestinian police under Israeli authority and an international presence there, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's office said. The four-man team, was to leave for PLO headquarters after the weekly cabinet meeting, to discuss how to restart talks on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, suspended since the February 25 massacre. Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, who is one of the delegates, said on radio that Israel was fully responsible for the "safety of Palestinians" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. "There is a demand to deploy an international force as stipulated in the (September) Declaration of Principles and we hope to put it into practice," Savir said. "These two points can serve as a good basis for satisfying both parties and make progress toward peace." Israeli state radio said the government would accept a temporary international presence in the West Bank town of Hebron. Rabin said Saturday he hoped negotiations with the Palestinians as well as with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan could resume after Passover in early April and Israeli Independence day on April 14. The other members of the Israeli delegation are Rabin's political advisor Jacques Neria and the foreign ministry's legal advisor Yo'el Singer. The PLO in Tunis Saturday welcomed Friday's UN resolution on the Hebron massacre as a basis for protecting Palestinians and restarting the negotiations to launch self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. "UN Security Resolution 904 is a solid basis for immediately starting the necessary measures to protect Palestinians in the territories and for assuring the restart and success of the negotiations," it said in a statement. Besides meeting the Israeli delegation, the PLO leadership will also consult in the next two days with senior envoys from the United States and Russia, the sponsors of the Middle East peace talks. The meetings will focus on "practical measures" to apply Friday's resolution calling for a temporary international or foreign presence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a PLO official said. A decision on whether to resume autonomy negotiations will be taken later based on talks involving "all parties, particularly Israel," he said. By calling for an armed international observation force to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, the PLO has been asking for more than Israel is willing to give.
