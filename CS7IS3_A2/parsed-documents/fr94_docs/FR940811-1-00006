FR940811-1-00006 FR940811-1-00004 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 43&hyph;3&hyph;6270; FRL 5029&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD) AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from organic liquid loading facilities. The intended effect of proposing approval of this rule is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated the rule and is proposing to approve it under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105&hyph;3901. Please refer to document number CA 37&hyph;10&hyph;6201 in all correspondence. Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report of the rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region 9 office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Applicability The rule being proposed for approval into the California SIP is Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District's (SBCAPCD) Rule 346, ``Loading of Organic Cargo Vessels.'' This rule was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to EPA on January 11, 1993. Background On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included SBCAPCD. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238, 52.222. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above district's portions of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991, for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. 1 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Santa Barbara County Area is classified as moderate; 2 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed Post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 2 SBCAPCD retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on January 11, 1993, including the rule being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SBCAPCD's Rule 346, ``Loading of Organic Cargo Vessels.'' SBCAPCD adopted Rule 346 on October 13, 1992. The submitted rule was found to be complete on March 26, 1993, pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V 3 and is being proposed for approval into the SIP. 3 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). Rule 346 requires bottom loading and vapor recovery systems for the transfer of non-gasoline organic liquids from facilities into cargo tanks. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rule was adopted as part of the district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for this rule.
