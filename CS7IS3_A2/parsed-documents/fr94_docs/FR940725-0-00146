FR940725-0-00146 FR940725-0-00019 The NPRM requested comments on the issues of whether or not work in IDLH atmospheres should ever be permitted and on what control measures are necessary for the protection of employees working in IDLH atmospheres. In the preamble to the NPRM, OSHA recognized that atmospheres containing flammable vapor concentrations greater than the UEL for a particular vapor do not present a fire or explosion hazard to employees because the atmosphere is too rich in flammable vapors or gases to burn. However, OSHA expressed concern about employees who work in such atmospheres because such atmospheres may contain chemical exposures from the flammable vapor that are above the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for the particular chemical creating the vapors. Only one commenter supported OSHA's proposal to allow work in IDLH atmospheres. The American Waterways Shipyard Conference (Ex. 6&hyph;23) stated that OSHA should not put a time limit on ``short duration'' and that the proposal was appropriate, as follows: Due to the vast differences in vessel design, it would be extremely difficult to define an ``emergency work'' situation. Similarly, a time limit for ``brief duration'' would be difficult to ascertain since the work to be performed differs in every situation. By instituting a time factor for work of brief duration, shipyard employees may be required to skip safety steps in order to finish the work in the required time frame. Work in atmospheres in the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) should not be prohibited. The work done in an UEL atmosphere is done on a very infrequent basis, but it is work that could not be done otherwise such as entry of a cargo tank during tank cleaning operations to set a cargo suction hose. By contrast, many other rulemaking participants believed that work in IDLH atmospheres is unnecessary and should be prohibited, either under all conditions (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;15, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;31) or under all but emergency conditions (Ex. 6&hyph;7, 6&hyph;8, 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34, 6&hyph;37, 6&hyph;38). Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;24), presented the following arguments against work in atmospheres above the upper explosive limit for a flammable gas or vapor: The paragraph 1915.12(d) should be deleted for the following reasons. (a) There is no way to keep the atmosphere above the upper explosive limit (UEL). If entry to the tank is required, it follows that there must be a region where the tank atmosphere mixes with the outside atmosphere. In this region the concentration of gas will be in the explosive range. (b) The equipment used to measure gas concentrations above the UEL is not usually available. (c) All ignition sources cannot easily be eliminated. There remains possible ignition due to static electricity. It has been my experience that owners and operators would rather clean or otherwise make safe a tank or compartment even if the work required in the compartment is of the briefest duration. NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) addressed work in IDLH atmospheres as follows: NFPA does not believe that work in IDLH atmospheres should be encouraged, except for the purposes of emergency rescue. NFPA does not support the proposal of working in UEL atmospheres. The potential hazards associated with ignition sources, such as static electricity, and the introduction of air to bring an atmosphere above the UEL within the flammable range, are significant and difficult to control. The additional testing requirements would also be significant. NFPA 306 only permits such a practice in the case of inerting for flammable compressed gas as described in 2&hyph;3.8. In this case now work is permitted on the tank or pipelines. OSHA agrees with the commenters who stated that working in IDLH atmospheres or in atmospheres containing concentrations of flammable gases or vapors above their UEL is very hazardous. The limitations on maintaining an atmosphere above a gas's or vapor's UEL, as noted by Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc., are severe indeed. If a mistake is made in such an atmosphere, an explosion will almost certainly result. Atmospheres that are IDLH because of toxicity also present a very serious danger to employees. A failure of the respiratory protective equipment protecting an employee in this type of atmosphere could quickly lead to his or her death. OSHA further believes that conditions somewhat less hazardous than those posed by IDLH atmospheres pose unnecessary dangers for shipyard employees. The generic permit-required confined space standard, in ยง1910.146(b), defines a hazardous atmosphere, in part, as follows: Hazardous atmosphere means an atmosphere that may expose employees to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue (that is, escape unaided from a permit space), injury, or acute illness from one or more of the following causes: (1) Flammable gas, vapor, or mist in excess of 10 percent of its lower flammable limit (LFL); * * * * *
