FR941125-0-00022 FR941125-0-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 9 [FRL&hyph;5108&hyph;2] OMB Approval Numbers Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this notice displays the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations, Final Rule, as published in the Federal Register on June 27, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kent M. Helmer, Regulation Development and Support Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48105, phone: (313) 741&hyph;7825. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements promulgated under the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations, Final Rule which appeared in the Federal Register on June 27, 1994 (59 FR 33042). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR Part 79. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320. The ICRs were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 9 Environmental protection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: November 14, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator.
