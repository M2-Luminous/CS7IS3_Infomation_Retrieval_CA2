Syrtlanov under the rubric "Military Reform: In the Air Forces of Commonwealth Countries": "The Virgin Skies of Kazakhstan"] [Text] Judging by the constructive solutions to economic and social issues, the Republic of Kazakhstan intends to make intelligent use of its skies as well. The first steps in the emergence of the national army already testify convincingly to the steadfast attention that is being devoted in the republic to the formation of their own air forces. This process is being conducted on the basis of the realities of the current day and experience that has been obtained--both their own and that of the leading aviation powers of "near" and "distant" foreign lands--and is, most importantly, figured for the long term. "We have to solve difficult problems in the course of military reform. But knowing my people, I am convinced that we can manage it," was the opinion of the first commander-in-chief of the Air Forces in the history of the resurrected nation, Deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Aviation Major-General of Aviation A. Volkov. At the beginning, you will agree, faith in oneself and one's subordinates is a factor of no small importance in achieving success. Recall what is happiness for a commander--when you rise up to attack and don't have to look around. There is another circumstance deserving of respect that cannot fail to be mentioned when analyzing the process of military reform in the republic as a whole. Having gained the genuine right to sovereignty, Kazakhstan has not rushed to affirm itself at a forced pace with the break-up of old structures or the complete rejection of the gains of the past. Everything that is valuable and useful has been taken up here with the zealousness of the far-sighted master. Taking into account the fact that they had to begin the creation of their own armed forces in parallel with defining the "outlines" of the future military doctrine and the conceptual framework for military organizational development, this stance appears to correspond the most to common sense. The Air Forces of the republic will include units and subunits of bomber, fighter/bomber, fighter, reconnaissance, transport and army aviation from the composition of the Air Forces of the former USSR. The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in accordance with that decision, has already worked out the principles for the creation of the services dealing with pay, food and clothing, and has thought out ways of upgrading the aircraft inventory in the future. On the agenda are making the structure of the Air Forces more efficient, concluding agreements for the delivery of combat hardware and its repair, and interaction with other nations of the CIS that have signed the "Collective Security" Treaty. Then it will obviously be possible to discuss the training of national cadres for the Air Forces. It would be incorrect, by the way, to assert that the difficulties of an economic nature that have come up in all the republics of the former USSR have bypassed Kazakhstan. But here they have been able to overcome the evil costs of the stagnant order despite everything. Life sometimes dictates its own terms when determining the expediency of this or that solution. When it was necessary to replace engines that had used up their service lives on some combat aircraft, they had to make barter deals with the Air Forces of a neighboring republic that at the time had an acute need for airfield servicing and support vehicles. One need not be an authority on marketing to define something like that, I would say, as vulgar entrepreneurship in the sphere of military organizational development. But where do you go if there is no other way out, and one is not seen in the foreseeable future? The problems being discussed are far from simple ones. Deliveries of assemblies and spare parts, as well as fuel, have been cut back as a result of the disruption of production and other ties. While they are getting out of the situation somehow with parts, the lack of fuels sometimes forces them to plan flight shifts only in amounts that barely support the maintenance of the proper level of training proficiency of the crews. The question of manning many aviation units and subunits with personnel remains unresolved. The chief of staff of the Air Forces of the republic, Major-General Yu. Shanin, who has served 15 years in Kazakhstan, elaborated that certain military collectives have a shortfall of officers of roughly 10 percent, and of warrant officers of up to 30 percent. Add to that about seven hundred in line to obtain housing, and it becomes clear how important it is to maintain those people with a good word, to demonstrate concern for them. We can thus understand the commander of the Air Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Major-General of Aviation A. Volkov, who has been looking after the social protections of the servicemen and inveighing for an expansion of housing construction at the aviation compounds since the first day he took up his position. Even in Moscow before my departure on the trip, I read in a newspaper about the supposedly oppressed situation of the Russian-speaking population living in the republics of Central Asia. I do not know about elsewhere, but Kazakhstan does not deserve such a frankly provocative reproach. Dispassionate statistics confirm, on the contrary, that the republic must provide for an influx of specialists of the indigenous nationality into the army even today. It is one thing that the local youths used to enter the military schools or warrant-officer schools unwillingly. It is another thing--and this must finally be frankly acknowledged--that even those who linked their fate with military service rarely received the right to serve in their own land, and even more rarely had the opportunity to make a military career. Even though the zealous attitude of Kazakhs to the fulfillment of their service obligations is well known to all, some had to share with them the burden of military service. I want to be understood correctly. The attraction of Kazakh youth to take part in the defense of their homeland is not an end in itself. The presence of national cadres not only in the Air Forces, but first and foremost in them, will sooner or later ensure the stability of the military policy of Kazakhstan and eliminate the negative consequences of migration processes, which have already started whether we like it or not. Whence the tasks of military-patriotic indoctrination of the youth and propagation of the combat traditions of their countrymen that are being advanced to the command of the units and subunits by Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan Colonel-General N. Nurmagambetov. The leadership of DOSAAF, which is continuing to devote the most steadfast attention to the development of air clubs, also sees a role for itself in this important cause. Yes, when gathering the first harvest, one must already be thinking about tomorrow--so as to cultivate worthy successors to the aviation glory of the republic, successors to front-line soldier and two-time Hero of the Soviet Union Talgat Begeldinov and other aces of military times. The considered approach of the leadership of the republic to the realization of the program of military reform confirms that the upturned virgin lands of the Kazakh skies, protected by mighty wings, will provide good shoots without fail.
