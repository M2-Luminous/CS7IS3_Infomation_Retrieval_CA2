Technical and economic factors suggest that in the early years of the program, the renewable oxygenate requirement will be met primarily with ethanol. According to a study prepared by the Department of Energy, 18 if the 30 percent renewables requirement is met by either using ethanol produced in current-technology ethanol plants in winter RFG, or ETBE in summer RFG, the overall fossil energy consumed in RFG production and use would be smaller than would be the case if nonrenewable MTBE (the other oxygenate currently expected to capture a large share of the RFG oxygenate market) were the only oxygenate used in RFG. 18 ``Analysis Memorandum: Energy Requirements and CO 2 -Equivalent Emissions of RFG,'' prepared by Margaret Singh, Argonne National Laboratory, for Barry McNutt, U.S. Department of Energy, June 6, 1994 and March 17, 1994 (draft). Other comments and studies were also provided to EPA claiming vastly different energy and global warming impacts than the DOE report. However, these other comments tended to focus on comparisons of ethanol and ETBE-blended RFG with conventional gasoline, instead of focusing on comparisons of ethanol and ETBE-blended RFG with MTBE-blended RFG. As a result, the DOE analysis contains the most relevant information regarding the impact of today's rule on fossil energy consumption and global warming emissions. The renewable oxygenate program will also help to diversify the country's transportation energy supply away from fossil energy (predominantly oil and natural gas) towards renewable energy by stimulating production of renewable fuels such as ethanol and renewable methanol. This program will have a large impact on the renewable energy industry in general and the ethanol industry in particular because the amounts of renewable fuels involved are large relative to historical production levels. The energy benefits of this program become more pronounced in later years. Improvements in the energy efficiency of ethanol production, achieved through such means as the use of cogeneration or waste products to provide process energy, will further reduce the fossil energy required to produce ethanol. Additional gains can be achieved by reducing energy consumption and fertilizer use in corn farming through changes in farming practices, using more energy-efficient equipment, increasing per-acre crop yields, and decreasing fertilizer use. Comments submitted by the Department of Agriculture and others, as well as previous studies by DOE and EPA cited in the proposal, indicate that as new feedstocks for ethanol such as cellulose are commercialized, and as renewable methanol production becomes viable, the fossil energy benefits of this program would increase substantially relative to nonrenewable MTBE use. By providing a secure minimum market for renewable oxygenates, today's program will help provide the certainty needed to encourage private investments in modern, high-efficiency agricultural practices and renewable oxygenate production technology. 2. Environmental Benefits a. Summer Ozone-Related Benefits. In addition to the energy benefits cited above, EPA believes this program has the potential to provide environmental benefits in the near term, with the potential for even greater environmental benefits in the future. These potential benefits stem from the incentives this program creates for the use of ETBE in summer RFG. Short-term limitations in ETBE capacity suggest that most of the near-term program requirements will be met through the use of ethanol blended into winter RFG. In the short term, summer RFG will not be affected by the program except to the extent that (1) renewable MTBE is substituted for nonrenewable MTBE, and (2) small amounts of ETBE capacity become available. Replacing nonrenewable MTBE with renewable MTBE would not alter the emission benefits of the RFG program. However, ETBE use helps assure that the VOC emission reductions sought by the RFG program are achieved or exceeded in-use. Since ETBE production consumes ethanol, ETBE use in summer RFG is likely to reduce direct ethanol use in summer RFG. (Even though ethanol used in summer RFG would not receive credit toward the 30% renewables requirement, such use is still permitted under the RFG program.) Ethanol's commingling effect discussed in section I tends to increase VOC emissions, so conversion of summer ethanol to ETBE (which does not have a commingling effect) should reduce VOC emissions. Replacing summer ethanol with ETBE may yield other benefits as well. ETBE-blended fuels with a given Reid vapor pressure (RVP) produce less vapor (and hence smaller nonexhaust VOC emissions) when heated above 100 degrees Fahrenheit than do ethanol fuels with the same RVP. A large fraction of summer VOC emissions are generated when gasoline is heated beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit, so replacing ethanol or MTBE with ETBE in summer reformulated gasolines may yield additional VOC emission reductions. These reductions, which are related to the front-end distillation properties of different oxygenated fuel blends, have not been included in EPA's Simple or Complex Models for reformulated gasoline since sufficient data to quantify accurately the size of these reductions is not yet available. However, sufficient data is available to confirm expectations based on scientific theory that such reductions would occur.
