Castro, who is also second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, made this statement during a tour of three integrated farms administered by the Youth Labor Army (EJT) in Havana Province. Raul Castro visited the the Kent Martyr labor unit in Artemisa Municipality, and the Calderon-El Cedro and La Flor de Cuba units in Alquizar Municipality, where he showed interest in crop yields, production costs, labor productivity, and rational use of fuel and other resources. There, the pass system used by the young soldiers, their discipline, and the new organizational methods that have been introduced -- such as working in blocs (the concentration of manual labor and resources in one unit of land), which permits an increase in productivity and the saving of resources -- were all explained to him. The Armed Forces minister congratulated the EJT members, as well as the civilian agricultural workers who assist them in their tasks, for the good results obtained, and he urged them to continue their efforts to overcome the difficulties caused by the lack of fertilizers and fuels.
