Chapter 2 -- The Management of Extra-Budgetary Funds in Administrative and Institutional Units Article 12 -- The extra-budgetary funds of administrative and institutional units includes administrative fees and institutional charges that are not included in the state budget, as well as the various types of foundations (funds) received or retained in accordance with the relevant state and provincial regulations by state organs, mass organizations, and whole-people ownership institutional units. Article 13 -- Administrative and institutional fees and charges should be based on laws, rules, and regulations. The specific charges and fees, including their range and levels, should be reported and approved in accordance with the following stipulations: 1) The administrative and institutional charges established by the various departments of the provincial people's government shall be examined and approved jointly by the provincial financial department and the provincial pricing department. The formulation and readjustment of the range or level of the charges will be jointly examined and approved by the provincial pricing department and the financial department. Major charges and the levels of these charges will, after being jointly examined and verified by the provincial financial and pricing departments, be reported to the provincial people's government for approval. 2) Prefectures, cities, counties (districts) and townships (small towns) are not permitted, on their own accord, to establish local or regional charges. In cases where it is necessary to establish such charges, after the proposals have been jointly examined and verified by the provincial financial and pricing departments, they will be reported to the provincial people's government for approval. In respect of those administrative and institutional charges which have been approved in accordance with the stipulated procedures, the charges, their range, and their levels shall be publicly announced. Article 14 -- A licensing system will be implemented for administrative and institutional charges. The departments and units levying the charges should take the approval documents to the specified pricing department to obtain their charge-levying licenses. In the levying of administrative and institutional charges, unified receipts which have been printed by or printed under the supervision of a financial department must be used. The charges, their range and their level must be in accordance with what has been stipulated or approved. Charges that are levied without charge-levying licenses or without unified receipts printed by or printed under the supervision of a financial department will be considered illegal levies, and units or individuals that are subject to the charges have the right to refuse to pay. In response to illegal levies, any unit or person has the right to make a report to the financial and pricing departments. Article 15 -- Under conditions where ownership rights and use rights do not change, the extra-budgetary funds of administrative and institutional units shall be managed through deposit in special financial administration accounts. The extra-budgetary funds of administrative and institutional units will be managed by each unit by opening income and expenditure accounts in a bank and managing income and expenditure separately. Apart from where the state has other applicable stipulations, administrative and institutional units may only open accounts in one bank. The extra-budgetary funds deposited in special financial administration accounts will be paid interest in accordance with state stipulations, and the interest will be credited to the unit's account. All units should make quarterly reports on their plans for using such funds and, after examination and approval by the financial department at the same level, they can use the funds under the supervision of the bank in which they have opened their accounts. When there is a need to utilize funds in special circumstances, approval can be granted immediately following the report. Without the examination and approval of the finance department, the banks in which the accounts have been opened are not permitted to pay out funds which have been deposited in special financial administration accounts. Financial departments at all levels should simplify their examination and approval procedures. When it is appropriate for units which have special deposits to use their own funds, the financial departments must guarantee that they will not shift responsibility, delay things or adversely affect the use of funds by those units holding special accounts. The banks in which the accounts are held should, when expenditure permission is granted by the finance departments, pay out the funds in a timely way and must not use excuses to hold up payments. Article 16 -- Financial departments at all levels, on the precondition of guaranteeing normal funds use by units with special accounts, may use funds between special financial administration accounts and adjust funds so that surpluses in one place can be used to meet deficiencies in other places, so that production and institutional development can be supported. However, they must not use such funds to establish banking organs, development companies or for capital construction investment. Article 17 -- The extra-budgetary funds of administrative and institutional units must be used in accordance with stipulated avenues. In accordance with a state-stipulated range, a portion can be used to supplement administrative and institutional charges, while the balance must be used in accordance with state regulations.
