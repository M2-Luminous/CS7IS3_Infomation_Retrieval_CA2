In animal husbandry, Tibet was able to maintain the main targets set for 1992. Township and town enterprises and other economic undertakings developed quite fast. The per capita income of peasants and herdsmen was about 515 yuan, or an increase of 5.1 percent over that of 1992. Industrial and communications enterprises had noticeably higher returns. Foreign trade and tourism maintained the good developmental momentum. New progress was achieved in bringing in outside resources and establishing ties with other parts of the country. The urban and rural markets became even more prosperous. All social services developed quite rapidly. New victories were won in the struggle against splittism. In 1993, Tibet's economy continued to develop, its political situation was more stable, people of various nationalities are more united, and new progress was achieved in all fields. The situation was good as a whole. [passage omitted] At the tea party, Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub, vice chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, spoke on bahelf of the regional CPPCC committee.
