In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday before his departure from Moscow where he was on a three-day visit, the Dalai Lama said he remains hopeful that he will return to China one day and step into the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and the Potala, the former palace of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after bloody clashes between the Tibetan population and Chinese police in 1959 and has been living in India ever since. He said that Tibetan culture is on the verge of extinction and confirmed his readiness to hold talks with China on the basis of the principle "one country -- two systems" proposed by architect of chinese reform Deng Xiaoping for Taiwan and Hong Kong. He believes this principle could also be applied to Tibet. The Dalai Lama was in Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Mankind. He held informal meetings with Russian parliamentarians and Moscow officials and public figures, and took part in a seminar on global security and conflict settlement. On Friday [20 May], the Dalai Lama attended an international prayer for peace which he served together with representatives of the Russian Orthodox, Islamic, Judaic and Buddhist clergy. Kindness is the basis of human being and people of Russia must remember this, the Dalai Lama said. He called on the citizens of Russia to believe in themselves and not to abandon their hope for a better future. The Dalai Lama said he was impressed by changes in Russia and the greater openness of society and people who eagerly joined in conversation with him in the street, asked questions and did not try to hide their opinion and emotions. He believes Russia should come up with something new in the economic sphere in order to avoid the flaws of Western economies. The Dalai Lama flew back to India today.
