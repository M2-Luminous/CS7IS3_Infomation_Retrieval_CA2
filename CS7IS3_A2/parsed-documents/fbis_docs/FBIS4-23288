He was addressing a press conference at Defence Force headquarters in Pretoria. Outlining his vision of a Defence Force "out of the people and for the people" Gen Meiring said recruits who did not make the grade for admission into the Defence Force proper could become members of the service brigade. They would acquire skills in areas such as building houses and digging trenches as part of the Defence Force's contribution to the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Gen Meiring said that in the past the Defence Force had helped with drought relief and civil construction projects in townships. He foresaw a similar role for the service brigade. Replying to questions, Gen Meiring said the process of integrating statutory and non-statutory armed forces into a single Defence Force would take about three years. He outlined a "colour blind" Defence Force in which the best person for the job would get the job, regardless of his or her colour. He said positions from the rank of lieutenant-general upwards were filled by decision of the cabinet and he hoped political pressure would not be brought to bear on these appointments. Over the next three years there would be bridging courses for soldiers with a background in non-statutory forces such as the African National Congress' armed wing Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], but these would not qualify them to hold high rank in the SANDF. He said the SANDF would grow by about 30,000 members as personnel from other forces were taken in. Over a three-year period, however, it would be trimmed back to the size it is now. About 10,000 volunteers would be drafted in 1995. He said the defence budget had been scaled back by 47 per cent since 1989 and had reached a point when it was not feasible to cut it further. In fact, the defence budget would increase. He did not see the SANDF playing a major role in African peace- keeping efforts at this stage. Its first priority was towards South Africa and its next priority was to work in conjunction with the states of southern Africa. On the integration of members of the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA], Gen Meiring said no APLA members' names appeared on the list agreed to in the constitution for inclusion in the SANDF. However, APLA members could be accepted in their individual capacities. They were not automatically members of the SANDF. He said the SANDF would continue with internal policing in support of the South African Police Service. But this was not a role it chose for itself and he hoped the political situation had changed in such a way that the SANDF's presence on the East Rand would not be necessary for much longer. He said Defence Minister Joe Modise had a working team studying the implications of a civilian ministry of defence.
