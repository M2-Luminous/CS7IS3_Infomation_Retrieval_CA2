Rabin tells settlers that there will be no Palestinian state, that the settlements illegally established in the occupied territories will not be dismantled, that there will be no withdrawal from occupied Jerusalem, that Israel will not abandon its racism, and that Israel will not recognize the Palestinian people's national rights. AL-BA'TH adds: At the same time, Rabin is being generous to the world public opinion by giving it some analgesics by saying that 1994 will be the year of achieving peace in the Middle East. AL-BA'TH says: Rabin came with his party majority to the Knesset under the banner of peace to replace Shamir, who obstructed, hampered, and froze the peace process, and brought tension to U.S.- Israeli relations with his crude rejection of U.S. proposals. It is known that the most important promises Rabin gave to Israeli voters -- who are sick of the policy of wars, military invasions, occupation of others' land, rebellion against international legitimacy, and rejection of several initiatives to establish peace in the region -- was his commitment to deviate from Shamir's method and to cooperate with the United States to reactivate the peace process and to enable it to achieve its objectives. The paper says: Had it not been for the Geneva meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its positive results which paved the way for embarking on new attempts to resume the peace talks, these talks would have remained frozen, not to say halted. The paper clarifies: Every time Syria removes an Israeli mine from the road of peace, Rabin's government plants new mines. Every time Syria makes a step to push the peace process forward, Israel takes several steps backward. These steps have forced it to leave the peace process and its talks in Washington for the corridors of secret talks in Oslo. The paper holds Rabin and his government fully responsible for obstructing and foiling the peace talks in Washington and for planting mines on their road. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Unless the Israeli obstacles are seriously and decisively surmounted, the peace process will continue to be exposed to further erosion, destruction, and collapse, and the talk about peace, stability, and security in the region will be sheer imagination and deception. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israeli officials often resort to making provocative and skeptical statements to play down the importance of the peace process and to give pessimistic impressions about the possibility of reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. They try to draw a very dark and melancholic picture for the future of the peace process in order to achieve their objective of making others believe that peace can only be achieved in accordance with the Israeli concept, namely, that the Arabs should relinquish their land and rights and accept partial solutions and separate deals tailored in accordance with Israel's expansionist objectives. The paper quotes a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Madrid in which he described the peace talks as being a bazaar and a commercial deal. AL-THAWRAH says: If this is Yitzhaq Rabin's concept of the talks, no one can be optimistic about the approach of peace. Neither can anyone claim the peace talks are proceeding in the right direction. The paper clarifies: Peace, in its humanitarian sense, cannot be compared with a commercial deal that is subject to compromise and blackmail and which can take place at the expense of one party. Such a description shows a backward mentality that is not in harmony with the contemporary international trend that considers peace a pressing need necessitated by security, stability, and justice in the world. Concluding, the paper says: If Rabin attacks Syria due to its insistence on the need for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, due to its rejection of partial solutions and separate deals, and due to its commitment to restoring the occupied Arab territories in full, he should realize that Syria's policy will continue to be clear and firm, and that no one can divert it from its objectives and principles.
