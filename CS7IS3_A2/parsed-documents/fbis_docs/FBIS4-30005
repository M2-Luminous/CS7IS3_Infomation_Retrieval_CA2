During the meeting, the chairmen agreed on the point that dissolution of the House of Representatives and holding of general elections should be avoided. With regard to the question of when to hold general elections they expressed the view that "the general elections should be held under a new electoral system after a bill on demarcating the current constituencies is enacted in the Diet," and also confirmed that they would put forth the view as a consensus of the business community to both ruling and opposition parties. They released their views in the form of a document of agreement. The business leaders made clear their stance against assertions by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan that they would not hesitate to push for an early dissolution of the Lower House [LH] and an early holding of general elections. Their stance has attracted attention. The meeting was held to congratulate Shoichiro Toyoda after he was named as the president of Keidanren, and to exchange views on the current political situation. Attending the meeting were Toyoda; Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren; Kosaku Inaba, chairman of Nissho; and Massaru Hayami, chairman of Keizai Doyukai. The document of agreement released at the end of the meeting notes that "it is indispensable for Japan to push for political, administrative and economic reforms" to build itself into an affluent economic society in the 21st century, and urges the Diet to come to grips with these reforms. According to an attendee, Mr. Inaba said during the meeting "we must be cautious to make the expression of the document of agreement fair to both ruling and opposition parties." The four business leaders, however, agreed to incorporate in the document of agreement their opposition to dissolving the House of Representatives and holding general elections under the multi-seat constituency system. In the past, the leaders of the four economic organizations regularly held such meetings to exchange views on the LDP leadership, but they have not held such a regular meeting since the coalition government came to office. The meeting held on 21 June was the first ever since they met a year ago to discuss how to make political contributions in the closing days of the Miyazawa administration.
