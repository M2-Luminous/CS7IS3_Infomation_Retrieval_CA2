The spokesperson added that Jorge Pinto, a former member of the party's political commission, assumed Valle's post three days ago. The MNR, the Democratic Convergence, and the former guerrilla movement Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front make up the leftist coalition participating in the run-off presidential elections that began this morning. The MNR ran by itself in the 20 March elections for deputies and mayors and lost. Valle said that many obligations, which he did not specify, prompted his resignation. Today, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist coalition, called Valle's resignation an act of treason and blamed it on the defeat the MNR suffered in the March elections. None of the candidates of the parties participating in the run-off elections received the required majority in March -- half of the total votes cast plus one -- to win the presidency. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal convened a second election between the two leading presidential candidates. Thus, Zamora and Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, are today competing for the presidency for the 1994-99 period.
