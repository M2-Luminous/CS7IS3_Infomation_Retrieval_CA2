Portal held a news conference during which he referred to the causes for the abrupt increase in the number of power outages in Havana, where electricity was available for only four hours in most neighborhoods this Tuesday. The situation is even worse in the countryside, especially because the available electricity is used for harvesting sugar cane (from December to April) on a priority basis. According to Vice President Carlos Lage, this activity will continue until May of this year. Portal explained that a lack of foreign financing and technological dependency on the former Socialist bloc -- most of the country's electric plants came from the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia -- have led to a serious delay in the national electricity network's maintenance schedule. As of 1989, the plants were able to generate power at 80-percent efficiency with the remaining 20 percent out of service due to damage or for technical maintenance, which is normal compared to international practices, the minister stated. The minister added that the country used to work with reserve stations, but that option is no longer available to us. Up to May 1993, the industry was able to maintain a certain level of response to growing demand, Portal said, adding that the mechanical condition of the plants deteriorated during July and August. On the positive side, Marcos Portal announced that 900,000 tons of the 2.6 million tons of oil required to generate electricity the previous year was national crude oil, which allowed the country to save its meager convertible foreign exchange. Due in part to greater availability of domestic crude oil and the foreign credits that have been obtained, Cuba will be able to allocate resources for the repair of thermonuclear plants and reach the second half of 1994 operating at 50 to 60 percent of capacity, the basic industry minister stated. This would allow us, Portal said, to significantly reduce power outages during the day, but we would have to continue them at night, when the most electricity is used.
