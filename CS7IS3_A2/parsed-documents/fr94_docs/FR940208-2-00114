FR940208-2-00114 FR940208-2-00075 Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the differences in the distribution fees payable by a Fund to the Distributor attributable to each class pursuant to the 12b&hyph;1 Plans adopted and proposed to be adopted by the Fund, or differences in fees payable by each class under a Shareholder Services Plan that may be adopted and operated in the future in the manner prescribed by condition 16 below; (b) each class may bear different Class Expenses which shall be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees (including the incremental cost of monitoring a CDSC applicable to a specific class of shares), (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) SEC and blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of share, (vi) trustees'/directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares, (vii) accounting fees and expenses relating to a specific class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (c) each class will vote separately with respect to a Fund's 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (d) each class may have different exchange privileges; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. 2. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees which are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 3. The Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will approve the subsequent creation of any additional class of shares. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of the Fund regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approval necessary to implement the Multi-Class system will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders. 4. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts of interest among any outstanding classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or service of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or service of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
