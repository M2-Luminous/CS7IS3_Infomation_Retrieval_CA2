The statement welcomes the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and says that "even though it would have been much better for the successful continuation of negotiations and attainment of a final political solution if the sides had reached agreement on a permanent peace, or at least on a long-term cease- fire, this agreement can serve as an impetus for ending the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis." The statement goes on to say that full compliance with the one- month cease-fire is important, because only then can this short period of time be used to make progress in the negotiations. It is necessary that the international players attentively and objectively follow further developments on the ground and sanction each attempt to violate the cease-fire, irrespective of the source. As for the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it has on a number of occasions expressed its orientation toward peace, continuation of dialogue, and cessation of all hostilities. The forthcoming one-month period must be used in the best possible way for finding a final, just, and permanent solution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regardless of the fact that it is not one of the warring sides, the FRY is ready to make a maximum contribution to realizing this goal, the statement says.
