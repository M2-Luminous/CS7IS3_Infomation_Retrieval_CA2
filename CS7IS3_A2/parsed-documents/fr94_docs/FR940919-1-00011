FR940919-1-00011 FR940919-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model 382 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine fastener placement. The proposed AD also would require repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of insufficient distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser, which can adversely affect the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing due to fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser. DATES: Comments must be received by November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Support Company, Field Support Department, Department 693, Zone 0755, 2251 Lake Park Drive, Smyrna, Georgia 30080.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The FAA has received reports that certain outer wing assemblies on Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes were manufactured with insufficient distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser (between outer wing stations 29.0 and 36.0). Insufficient distance between the fastener and the riser edge adversely affects the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly due to fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser. Such fatigue cracking, if not corrected, could result in structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing assembly. The FAA has reviewed and approved Hercules Service Bulletin 382&hyph;57&hyph;74 (82&hyph;688), dated January 31, 1994, which describes procedures for an ultrasonic inspection of kingpin riser number 18 on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine the distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser. In addition, for fasteners positioned outside certain limits described in the service bulletin, the service bulletin describes repetitive ultrasonic inspections to detect cracks in the kingpin riser, and repair, if necessary. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require an inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine fastener placement; and repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The repair would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. There are approximately 20 Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $220 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
