Its Material and Technical Department, hitherto located at the metropolitan Pekin Hotel, seems to have been plagued by...cockroaches, mice, and other rodents which have proliferated in great numbers. The FCS is no less concerned about the deplorable physical condition of the "guest house:" In many places the peeling plaster threatens to fall right onto one's head. Aware of their responsibility for the Motherland, the management of the famous hotel decided to close down for a major renovation and sanitation cleaning. Therefore the FCS had to look for a new place. This time the intelligence people took a liking to the Mir hotel [across from the U.S. Embassy] where not an extra speck of dust can be found, let alone cockroaches! The conclusion of a secret 10-year leasing agreement is in the final stages, whereby the FCS Material and Technical Department will have eight floors in the Mir -- from the fourth to the 11th.
