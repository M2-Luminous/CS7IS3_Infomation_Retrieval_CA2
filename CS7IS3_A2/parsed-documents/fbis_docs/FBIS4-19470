He is the person who is mainly responsible for the Serbian attacks on Bosnia. Apparently, while attempting to have the peace agreement between the Bosnians and Croatians implemented, the United States has yielded to the blackmailing activities of the Serbs to convince them to participate in the peace talks. The UN officials moved to force the Serb troops, which besieged Sarajevo, to withdraw some time ago. Meanwhile, they warned the Serb armed units to lift their blockade against other Bosnian cities, one of which was Gorazde. Later, that position was completely abandoned. The Serb units shelled Gorazde's suburbs with artillery guns for many days. The aggression coincided with the arrival in Sarajevo of Serbian commanders to hold talks with the Bosnian and Croatian representatives. The Croatian, Bosnian, and Serb representatives were finalizing the cease-fire agreement when exploding artillery shells resounded from the direction of Gorazde last night. Obviously, the Serbs employed the tactic they have used right from the beginning of the war in Bosnia. Apparently, their principle is to occupy as much territory as they can before a cease-fire agreement is put into effect. In fact, they have gained from that approach within a short period of time. The Bosnian Serbs, who have taken over 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina, wish to use the question of territory as a trump card when they finally agree to hold talks with the Bosnian majority for a federation. They hope to use that trump card to maintain an advantage in the talks that will be held on the establishment of a federation and to demand concessions for each and every inch of territory they will give back to the Bosnians. Whether or not the Serbs used chemical arms against Gorazde was not established when this column was written. However, it is a fact that the Islamic population in Bosnia has been subjected to a major attack. Turkey drew the international community's attention to the developments in Gorazde during the past week. The Belgrade Administration, which has moved to establish a high-level dialogue with Turkey, was also cautioned on the matter. However, the world preferred to seal its ears once again, and Turkey was right again. The way to bargain with an aggressor force is to employ similar tactics. William Perry gave the "green light" to the massacre by saying: "I will not allow even a single U.S. aircraft to take off for Bosnia in the future." Let us wait and see how he will account for that.
