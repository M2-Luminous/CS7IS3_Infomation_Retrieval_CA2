If someone wants to meet them, he is investigated at several levels. Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of the Libyan newspaper AL-BALAGH, is the first person who had a lengthy talk with them and got information from them about the crash so that a way could be found to relieve Libya of the problems it is facing because of these two persons. The goal was to satisfy the United States so it would lift the restrictions it has imposed on Libya. However, these two persons did not cooperate with him during this interview and kept talking to him about other things. Later, al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit sent a message to Mr. Ibrahim, the editor, unexpectedly and told him that they were both very perturbed and wanted to meet with him immediately. They said that they wanted to meet with him to resolve this issue with his help. The editor told him to wait for a few days as there might be a better solution. Mr. al-Amin's mother died during those days and she could not bear to be separated from her son. Finally, Mr. Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of AL-BALAGH, went to meet 'Abd-al-Basit in his home in Tripoli. He was waiting for him at the door of his house and smiled when he saw him. He told the editor that he was used to sufferings, but he did not know why he was accused of this crime. He said that he had faith in God and that He will protect him and watch over him. The whole story is clear to God like a bright day. 'Abd-al-Basit is about 41 years old and al-Amin is the same age. 'Abd-al-Basit said that God had arranged for people to be kind to each other in this world. Some people spend their lives in happiness and in the end they leave all their desires and plans and enter the valley of death. Some leave this world early and some spend a lot of time here; however, all their wishes are not fulfilled. One's life is never long enough for one's desires and plans to be fulfilled. Ibrahim taped the whole interview. During tea, 'Abd-al-Basit's younger son 'Abd-al-[name incomplete as published] came into the room and said that his daddy and uncle al-Amin were falsely accused of these crimes. They have forced these two to spend their lives like nomads. They cannot live peacefully and quietly. Both of them suggested during this interview that they would present their case in the Libyan Supreme Court so that "we can explain our side to the world and the people can decide what is wrong and what is right. Who is following the right path and who is wrong?" Whenever these two talk, the first thing they say is that the real criminal is being ignored and they are being made scapegoats. They are very depressed and look very sad. Their wives say that Tripoli with its breadth and length has become very cramped for them. "Ever since our husbands were accused of this crime, we have been carrying this heavy burden in our minds. We are in a strange situation. We can be considered neither dead nor alive. We feel great vexation. Whenever we meet each other, we ask why we are living? In which world are we living? What is the use of leading a life full of fear? At times, there are articles about us in newspapers, magazines, and journals. Some encourage us and some deflate our fortitude." 'Abd-al-Basit has been a student of science in prestigious American universities and also has higher education in geography. When he returned home after finishing his education, he was appointed chief administrator of the education department. Mr. al-Amin worked for Libyan Airlines. He receives a stipend from Libyan Airlines now. They were asked in this detailed interview why did they refuse to go to the United States or Great Britain if they claim to be innocent and consider themselves wrongly accused? They answered that truth has its place. "We are being accused falsely; there is not truth in it. We are innocent. However, how can we trust them to be our well-wishers and make a just decision and not spite us. The United States and Britain have already declared that they do not need any court to make a decision about us. All they want is al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit. They will not be satisfied with anything less. They do not want to get advice from lawyers and follow up on the facts as these surface. They have already given their verdict on their televisions. How can we expect justice from them?" At the end of this interview, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl emphasized to them that the accusation being levied against them about destroying the Pan Am airplane by the United States and Britain appears to be true, because these two countries do not trust their own legal systems and do not want another impartial nation to investigate this case and give a decision. Meanwhile these two declare themselves to be innocent and refuse to accept any blame. In such a situation no one can be a criminal just because someone calls them so. Some people say that these two are living like kings and enjoying themselves. I have visited them and observed them closely. In my opinion, no other person is so sacred and in danger in Tripoli as are these two. Al-Amin's home is on one corner of Tripoli where he lives like a bird in a cage. He cannot go anywhere openly and spends his time within a limited sphere. The situation of 'Abd-al-Basit is not any different. They both said that this accusation has influenced their family lives greatly. "We are totally cut off from society, and our wives and children are also suffering because of this crime. We are suffering mentally because of it. Perhaps this will not end even after we are dead. We are suffering from the crime of innocence. We pray to God all the time to bring the real criminal in front of the world so that the facts--the identities of those people who have accused them and the facts about those who have been accused--are revealed." Both of them emphasized that they will not bow down to the unfair demands of the United States and continue to call the U.S. accusation wrong. "How the United States always has double standards about everything is clear from this example. It attacked an Iranian airplane and downed it. It admitted to this action; however, no punishment was given to it, and it is not even willing to be punished for being involved in this crime. A similar situation has occurred in many countries, but no action was taken against other countries. What reason can there be for this attitude, other than that the people who live in Libya are Muslims and the Unites States is a strong enemy of Muslims and Islam." Al-Amin Fuhaymah described a personal sorrow and said, "What has bothered me the most all this time is that my beloved mother died during this period. Her eyes were open even at the time of her death waiting for me. Alas, I could not see my mother because of the barriers created by the U.S. efforts. I am spending my life like a nomad. I am here today and will be hiding in another place tomorrow. Some time here and some time there. I spend the day here and night in another place. I could not even fulfill her last desire. I will be greatly repentant all my life about it. This shock is very difficult for me to bear." Both al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit expressed great happiness at meeting with the editor. This was the first time that an Arabic language journalist had paid attention to them and considered them worth interviewing. "We are glad that we could share our inner thoughts with you and explain our side of the Lockerbie accident in details. This is a great honor for us and it makes us happy. We have a lot of experience with journalists, and we have learned a lot during our meeting with journalists. We also know how to answer journalists' questions. Meeting with journalists is an interesting experience, and now they seem to be members of our own family. Our hearts beat for each other and they understand us even when we do not say anything. Anyhow, in order to get the facts about the airplane crash and to put this thing aside, we want to join our voice with the voice of other people, and declare forcefully to the whole world that the United States should give up its stubborn attitude. It should allow a third and neutral nation to investigate this affair. That country should listen to both sides and make a decision. The United States is not willing to do that. It shows that it is not sure of its stand and knows about its weakness. However, since the United States is the world's greatest power now, it wants to make its mistake to change into truth. That is why it is pressuring Libya and accusing two of its citizens. It wants Libya to extradite these two citizens and send them to the United States so that they can be hanged. The Americans should pay attention to their government's style of operation and how it is destroying their nation's prestige. We do not want to accuse anyone. We do not even want to say anything in our defense at this time. All we want to say is that we should be treated fairly." "Five years have passed since the airplane crash. We have spent this whole time like being impaled on a stake. We do not have the words to describe the pain and agony we have gone through. Our time of being tested has not passed yet, and we do now know how this suffering will continue. Many airplane accidents took place before this one, and many more accidents will take place in the future also. However, it never happened before that someone was accused without any investigation. The whole world knows the U.S. method of operation. The action that the United States took in its arrogance as a powerful nation after the Pan Am crash was just to pressure Libya. It used some tricks and imposed economic sanctions against it so that Libya would kneel down in front of it in submission. However, bravo to Libya! It is standing firm and is not willing to bow down to the United States. You tell us with your hand on your heart if this is the standard of U.S. justice and fairness? What will the United States do if another nation treats it like this?" "Our position in this whole situation is like another side. We know what we did, what we did not do, and what wrong allegations are against us. We are not willing to allow the United States, Britain, and Scotland to make any decision they want and impose it on us. We are willing to accept the decision made by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Tunisia."
