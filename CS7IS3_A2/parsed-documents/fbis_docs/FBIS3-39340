Madrid says the four applicants are all likely net contributors to the EU budget and that the resulting cash payments should go to the poorer member states, including Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The intervention has dismayed other EU states who fear a budget row might sink the chance of meeting the March 1 deadline required for enlargement to go ahead in January 1995. The accession negotiations in Brussels are finely poised, with hard bargaining taking place over regional aid and special assistance to Nordic farmers. An internal budget row could wreck an early conclusion of the talks. Estimates of how much the Swedes, Finns, Austrians and Norwegians are likely to contribute to the EU's ECU70bn budget are still preliminary. Some figures suggest cash transfers might range between ECU2bn and ECU4bn a year, depending on their economic output. The UK and Germany are already restive about the amount of money the EU sends to southern Europe. British estimates range from ECU7m daily to Greece and Portugal, and ECU13m a day to Spain. In December 1992, Spain withheld its support for early enlargement negotiations until it won backing from its partners for a "cohesion fund" for special transfers to the EU budget from the rich north and centre to be funnelled to the south. Last week in Brussels, Spain indicated it would like its partners to agree on the principle that all net contributions from applicant states should be used to "top up" the cohesion fund. Some EU delegations were left with the impression that Spain wants an agreement on the exact level of individual contributions from Nordic and Alpine states. "That would scupper any chance of meeting the March 1 deadline," said one Brussels official. A Spanish official declined to confirm or deny the country's position on the applicant countries' net budget payments. Spain has taken a consistently tough line in the enlargement negotiations, partly because it is worried that the momentum toward European integration is moving decisively northward. Last year, Spain insisted that the applicants be left out of the Maastricht treaty's mechanisms for setting up a single European currency. It still says only the 12 should be considered eligible for European monetary union.
