Ever since their rise in the late 1970s, township enterprises have contributed handsomely to the country's economy growth. In 1993, their output value totalled 2,902 billion yuan ($330 billion)--71 percent of the output value in rural areas. Their export value reached 235 billion yuan ($27 billion), about 45 percent of the country's total . However, in the current transformation of the nation's economy, from a centrally planned to a market economy, the development of township enterprises has been increasingly hampered by ambiguous property rights. Who really owns township enterprise is a burning question which must be answered. In rural enterprises sponsored by local communities, such as townships or villages, the property right belongs to the whole community, but no individual in particular. As a result, the community leadership randomly interferes with the enterprises' internal management, thus preventing the workers themselves from bringing their initiative into full play. The production factors of different regions, trades and ownerships cannot be transferred, let alone be used efficiently. "To solve these problems, township enterprises must speed up reform of property rights," said Lu Yongjun. To promote property right reform and to ultimately establish a modern enterprise system, the Agriculture Ministry recently issued a non-mandatory document giving advice on how to conduct shareholding co-operative reform in township enterprises. Dividends Township enterprises which have adopted co-operative shareholding generally perform better than those which have no shareholding system. According to Lu, shareholding co-operative enterprises refer to those enterprises formed by at least two investors, who, on a voluntary basis invest either money, materials, technologies or land use right in an enterprise. As shareholders in the enterprise they can receive dividends according to the performance of the enterprise in relation to their percentage shareholding. Shareholders should have a voice in advising the management of the enterprise. According to Lu, the township shareholding cooperative enterprises comes into being in three different ways. First, some of the self-employed and private businesses establish enterprises themselves. Secondly, some township enterprises introduce the shareholding co-operative system themselves to achieve better management, performance and profits. Thirdly, there are some newly opened enterprises which adopted the shareholding model from their very beginning. "Up to 1993, co-operative shareholding enterprises amounted to 10 per cent of the country's township enterprises," said Liu Zuyin, another official from the Ministry. The increasing pressure of market competition and sometimes the die-hard prejudice against private enterprises, have been two driving forces for the formation of shareholding co-operative enterprises which are collective in nature. To implement property right reform, an effort should at first be made to define and clarify it, so as to make possible its transference through sales, merger, bankruptcy and auction, inheritance and donation. "At present, the most important thing is to evaluate enterprises' assets. This assessment should be realistic, scientific and plausible, in line with the related standards, procedures and methods stipulated by the State," said the Ministry. Township authorities should invite specialists and representatives from the community and workers from the enterprise to attend assessment work in order to carry out careful planning, full investigation and accurate assessment of the value of property. Based upon the clarification of the ownership of property right, shares can be made available to townships, individuals, social institutions and overseas investors. In certain selected areas, markets which trade in property rights should be established. In principle, property rights should be held by original investors. The owners can manage the property, maintain and increase its value, and benefit from the progress. But there is still some ambiguity concerning the shares belonging to the townships. "For the sake of boosting productivity, enterprises are encouraged to explore whatever ways are necessary to solve ambiguities," Liu said. Han Jun and Zhang Qingzhong, two researchers from the Rural Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, offer three options to solve ambiguities. They suggest that the shares of township enterprises be transformed into prior stock, so the local authorities can only gain extra dividend from their shares, but have no say in the enterprises' management. Another option is to cut up the cake. This would involve canceling collective shares and converting all the enterprise's stored property into shares completely owned by the individual employees. Modification However, certain articles of the State's codes governing township collective enterprises stipulate that the property of the collective enterprise belongs to all members of the township. The researchers call for a change of such irrational articles of State, because they only provide local authorities with a legal basis for interfering in the management of enterprises. The third option is to auction the property of the township collective enterprise to employees, social institutions and individuals. Income of the shareholding co-operative enterprise should be distributed according to the performance of the worker and it should also be in proportion to the volume of shares they hold. A percentage of profits should be turned in as tax and a contribution to the accumulation fund. Part should also be used to balance any operational deficits from previous years. Any remaining profit might be shared out as a dividend among shareholders. Revenue from the sale of township shares should be used for the enterprises' further expansion, social welfare, or to fund agriculture in the environs of the enterprise. They should not be used to cover the township government's administration fees, said the Agriculture Ministry's directive. Local authorities should not interfere in any administrative sense with co-operative shareholding companies. Instead, they should try to provide management guidance and services. Enterprises must of course, listen to the supervision of the local authorities and observe their social obligations. Liu said that this directive is non-binding. "The shareholding co-operative system was actually invented by farmers. What we are doing now is trying to collect valuable experiences from the co-operative shareholding system so they can be passed on to other township enterprises." Liu acknowledged that the research of the shareholding co-operative system lags far behind their traditional role in the economy of blazing new roads to prosperity. In Zhejiang Province, the number of township enterprises is 80,000; in Shaoxing County alone there are 506 of them, with 1.2 billion yuan ($138 million) in capital. Liu said that when workers become real owners of their enterprise, they will surely try to improve their internal management. But whether or not they select boards of directors or call meetings for shareholders depends upon the enterprise employees themselves. Liu emphasized that while encouraging the cooperative system, the government also supports enterprises to be contracted, leased or merged so long as they can become efficient.
