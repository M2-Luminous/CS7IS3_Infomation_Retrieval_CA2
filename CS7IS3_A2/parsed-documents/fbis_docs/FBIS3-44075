In a radio communique issued after its sitting of 12 January, the cabinet announced this important decision to the people of Benin and expressed its fear of abusive price increases, which will seriously erode the purchasing power of our hardworking people. On his return from Dakar on 12 January, the head of state explained in detail the reasons for the decision taken by the heads of state and government and invited all economic actors to be circumspect and show solidarity in order to spare our people the negative effects of the devaluation. It should be recalled that since the 1980s, African countries in general and the franc zone in particular, have been facing an unprecedented economic crisis due to the collapse of commodity prices. Instead of carrying out economic adjustment programs, they unfortunately preferred to become indebted. Wages became disproportionate and budget deficits became staggering. At a time when trade barriers are disappearing, especially in Europe, an overvalued currency is a serious handicap to development. Aid donors, France in particular, understood this so well that they decided to be firm with franc zone countries, in order to encourage devaluation as the last possible solution. The message was perfectly clear. The heads of state meeting at Dakar understood it as well -- the African peoples also understood it. Unfortunately, it is regrettable to observe that some traders, businessmen, and industrialists -- eager for easy and immediate gain -- have tried to take advantage of this situation to bring our hardworking people to their knees. Anarchical price hikes and the closure of some shops can be observed in all our major towns, in spite of the government's preparedness to hold discussions with the business community. Nothing justifies the 50, 100, and even 150 percent price increases over the prices prevailing before the devaluation, except the desire to get rich quick by riding on the backs of our people, who have already been hard hit by the world economic crisis. This is a bitter observation, because the advent of democratic renewal has ushered in an era of trust between the government and the business community. The anti-nationalistic adjustments made by some members of the business community today strengthens the conviction that democracy can only be maintained and developed by the organization of a relentless fight against a nostalgia for dictatorial power and the enslavement of the people. This is why the cabinet, concerned about the legitimate interests of the people and desirous to maintain the social balance needed for the pursuit of its structural adjustment program, has taken today the following conservation measures: 1) The banning of price increases in Benin by decree dated this day; 2) the freezing at 11 January levels, throughout the country and until further notice, of the prices of the following essential commodities: rice, sugar, cement, tinned tomatoes, milk, bread, school supplies, pharmaceutical products, khaki, locally-made toilet and household soaps, locally-brewed beer, and edible oil. It must be stated that state offices and companies like the Benin Water and Electricity Corporation, the National Petroleum Products Marketing Company, the Joint Benin-Niger Railway and Transport Organization, the Cotonou Autonomous Port, the Posts and Telecommunications Office, and the SONAR [expansion unknown] are of course complying with the prevailing measures on prices and stocks; 3) the systematic control of prices and stocks of the products concerned in commercial houses and marketplaces by joint teams composed of workers from different public administrations. To mitigate short-term inflationary effects and reduce unemployment, the government has decided on the following compensatory measures: 1) Tariff reform, which will be implemented in conjunction with members of the business community; 2) essential commodities will be supplied in the country, to the tune of 2 billion CFA francs; 3) the budgetary credit initially set up under the primary school rehabilitation scheme will be doubled; 4) procurement of textbooks for schools and colleges will be carried out; 5) half the amount of the duties and taxes paid on goods which arrived at the port before the devaluation will be reimbursed upon presentation of the relevant documents; 6) the setting up of a social fund of between 1.5 and 2 billion CFA francs, with French financing for labor-intensive urban works, a school dropout resettlement program, an urban sanitation program at Porto-Novo and Cotonou; 7) a salary increase has been decided upon in principle and the terms of its implementation will be discussed by the ministers of the civil service, labor, and finance with the workers; and 8) the agricultural sector will be boosted to benefit its prime actors -- the peasant farmers. The minister of rural development is authorized to pursue the execution of the emergency plan that he submitted to the cabinet and to implement that plan over the short and medium term. To enable the inhabitants of our towns and villages to be well informed on the ins and outs of the 50 percent CFA franc devaluation, the cabinet has requested: 1) The ministers of trade and tourism, health, finance, interior, security and territorial administration, and rural development together to organize working sessions in those districts with prefects, subprefects, and mayors; 2) that all its members inform their respective personnel concerning the objectives of the devaluation and the various measures arising from it; 3) that the minister of culture and communication instruct the General Directorate of the Radio and Television Corporation with a view to the correct presentation by local language announcers of the contents of this communique on radio and television, stating clearly that the CFA currency symbols have not changed. Finally, the cabinet instructed the ministers of trade and tourism, the interior, security and territorial administration to see to the active participation of the district trade structures in the effective implementation of measures barring a rise in prices.
