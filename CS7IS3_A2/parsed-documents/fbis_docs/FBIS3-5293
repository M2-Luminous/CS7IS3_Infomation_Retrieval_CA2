"I request (the passage) by the end of March," Saito told a regular press conference. He was referring to reports of a possible delay in tax cuts because Diet deliberations may be tied up by the opposition parties led by the Liberal Democratic Party. Under the tax scheme, the government plans to give half of the scheduled cut in national income tax in the pay packets containing the annual summer bonuses, and the other half with the year-end tax adjustment. Saito said that implementation of the tax cuts should be done as early as possible to help the economy recover. Concerning the continued rise in long-term interest rates, Saito repeated that he would watch "for a little while" to judge the trend and its economic impact, stressing "overall levels are still low." He also indicated his intention to watch the trend in Japan's current account surplus. "We can't judge only on single month...And the downward trend in volume remained intact," he said, referring to the politically sensitive surplus for January that showed signs of resuming an upward trend. The January surplus posted a rise from a year earlier for the second straight month, advancing 30.9 percent in dollar terms. The yen-denominated figure increased 16.8 percent to mark the first rise in six months.
