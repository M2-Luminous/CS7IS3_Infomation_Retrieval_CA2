It has been ascertained that the case had incurred an economic loss of 68.22 million yuan to the state as calculated by grain departments after making an inventory and check of their stockpiles and capital. A total of 412 persons have been punished according to party and administrative disciplinary actions and criminal law or through economic sanctions; and 11 persons against whom lawsuits have been filed will be tried in the near future. Changtu County is a renowned grain producer in the country, which purchases about 1 billion kg of grain every year. Dozens of materials in large amounts, such as straw mats and stripes, are needed in grain storage. Due to poor management, grain departments of the county committed a large number of law breaches during purchases of the materials since 1990. Beginning September 1993, cadres and policemen of the Tieling City Procuratorate and the Changtu County Procuratorate made all-out efforts to investigate the case based on the reports by the masses and the written instructions by the principal leading comrades of the city party committee. In the process of handling the case, the standing committee of the Tieling city party committee heard reports on the progress on many occasions and gave timely support and guidance. This case also drew the extremely great attention of Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial procuratorate. Zhao Dengju, deputy chief procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, came to Changtu County to hear reports on the case, which signified a great encouragement to the procuratorial cadres and policemen. Neither moved by money nor interfered by personal relations, the cadres and policemen surmounted numerous difficulties and managed to expose the case which, centering on Gui Bingquan, former director of the Changtu County Grain Bureau, involved some leading cadres and personnel of party and government organs, public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments, law-enforcing administrative departments, and economic management departments, who traded power for power, money, personal favor, and sex and cheated the state of a tremendous amount of money to line their pockets. According to Wu Zhicheng, chief procurator of the Tieling City People's Procuratorate, the city and the county procuratorial organs have put on files for investigations 54 persons involving in serious and major offenses, such as embezzlement, bribe-taking, speculation, profiteering, dereliction of duty, extortion, misuse of public funds, swindling, and tax evasion, and two of them are cadres at deputy county level. Xu Lianzhong, former vice chairman of the county committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Gui Bingquan, former director of the county grain Bureau, and 12 others were arrested and brought to justice. Eleven serious offenders at large were listed as wanted, and some others were bailed out waiting for trials. As much as 32 million yuan of illicit money was seized. Judging by the criminal facts exposed, the case was a shocking one. The large number of departments and persons involved, the great loss incurred to the state, and the evil means adopted by the lawless elements made the case a rare one in Liaoning in recent years. According to the investigations, the overwhelming majority of the 36 grain depots violated laws at varying degrees during the purchases of materials. Gui Bingquan and others abused power to give written approvals wantonly for some persons to sell materials regardless of the needs of the grain depots, through which they took bribes or enabled their relatives and friends to make huge profits. Persons obtaining the approvals then forcibly sold materials to grain depots to reap staggering profits. Some lawless persons used the approvals to collude with relevant personnel of grain depots in making false receipts and certificates of the storage of the materials, cheating the grain depots out of money without even selling the materials. Moreover, Gui Bingquan's written approvals were directly sold. A written approval with some dozen poorly written characters was sold at tens of thousands of yuan at the lowest, the highest price being 135,000 yuan. A relative of Gui Bingquan earned more than 200,000 yuan from selling the approvals. Some women even sold their bodies in exchange for the approvals. This law-violating case brought a tremendous economic loss to the state. The price for materials the county's grain departments bought were 16.9 million yuan in 1990, and it showed a sharp increase to 90.86 million yuan in 1991, and was increased again to 123.76 million yuan in 1992. Some grain depots spent as much as over 11.7 million yuan to purchase the materials, such as straw stripes, which could be used for 20 years, thermometers, which could be used for 40 years, and wire rope, which would not be used up for 100 years, creating large stockpiles. There were also a great amount of fake and inferior goods among the materials. Some ratsbane was colored rice, some thermometers were empty glass tubes, and some straw mats and stripes were far below the standards to "look like cushions and belts" as the masses put it. Even goods like this were purchased at the prices several times, ten times, and even dozens of times higher. Wire ropes that costed four to 10 yuan per meter were purchased at the price ranging from 85 to 105 yuan, earning lawless elements enough money to buy a Santana car after selling two bundles of wire ropes. Thermometers costed 0.45 yuan each in the market, but they were purchased at 1.50 yuan each. Ratsbane costing 10 yuan per 500 grams were purchased at 470 yuan. A report on the inventory of the property and capital of the grain departments of Changtu County showed that the county lost 68.22 million yuan in three years due to stockpiles of the materials, the high-priced low-quality materials, and the speculation in the purchases. However, some lawless elements earned their ill-gotten wealth totaling several hundred thousand yuan and even more than 1 million yuan. While they were spending freely the tremendous amount of money they appropriated from the state, some staff members and workers of grain depots faced the difficulty of overdue pay, and many peasants got only IOUs after a whole year's hard work. In view of this, many people reported the criminal activities of Gui Bingquan and other people in the past few years. After the case was exposed, the vast number of cadres and the masses clapped and cheered. They voluntarily helped procuratorial organs investigate the case. There were a half sack of letters reporting the crimes. Punishment of corruption also rallied the efforts of the party and the people, making the county enjoy social stability and economic development. While investigating and handling the case, Tieling city party committee and government also summarized lessons. They made inventory of the property and capital of all the grain departments of the city to avoid new losses to the state. This newspaper will publish relevant reports after the trials of the criminals to fully expose the details of the case and the process of cracking the case.
