The chairs of the two candidates who did not come to this debate are empty. We thank the parties and candidates who did understand the need to debate and openly discuss their plans. Today we begin the first of three debates with this subject: economic measures of the next administration during the first 100 days in office. Here today are Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, presidential candidate of the Authentic Christian Movement [MAC]; Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence [FMLN-CD] coalition; Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate of the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, presidential candidate of the National Solidarity Movement [MSN]; and Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate of the National Coalition Party [PCN]. We welcome you and thank you for responding to Canal Doce Television's invitation to debate and openly discuss your plans of action. To the two candidates who are not present here this morning, I hope you will watch the program and listen to the statements made here today. The debate will be in three parts. During the first part of the program, each candidate will have five minutes to present his economic plan; that is, his economic plan for the first 100 days in office. The speaking order was decided prior to the program by a drawing. Poll results have no bearing on the order of the speakers. During the second and third parts of the program, the candidates will discuss and comment on the programs presented. We invite listeners to call the studio -- the telephone number is 88-0309; it will be appearing on your screen -- and ask any question you may have for the candidates. Our first speaker will be FMLN-CD presidential candidate Ruben Zamora. I do have one question for all the candidates. If you were to become president of the Republic, what economic measures would you implement during your first 100 days in office? How will you confront the country's economic problems. The voters believe that the country's biggest problems continue to be unemployment, inflation, and poverty, among others. You have five minutes to answer. [39-second break in reception] [Zamora] ....that we sit down and draft a basic agenda for the country's economic development, establish what is and what will be the framework of this agreement, and decide on basic policies for investment, employment, and wages in El Salvador. Second, and based on this agreement among the various sectors, I suggest a renegotiation of the conditions of the foreign debt. Based on the new boost we will give the country, I will approach the U.S. Government, the World Bank, and the IMF to discuss the terms of our foreign debt to ensure that our domestic social debt will not continue to grow. I will also talk to the U.S. Government about the situation of our fellow countrymen in the United States and ask that they not be declared illegal. I will attempt to show that my government recognizes the role of foreign countries, but I will also make it known that Salvadorans will make the final decisions. The third main topic we will broach will be financial policy. I will not devaluate our currency, but I will meet with the Central American presidents [eight-second break in reception] and too indiscriminate for our national production. I will not nationalize banks. Banks will continue to remain in private hands, but we will immediately do two things: First, we will reduce the current difference between interest rates paid for assets and those charged for liabilities. The difference is too great and does not contribute to the reactivation of the economy. Second, we are going to confront and immediately solve the agrarian debt problem. The fourth main measure to be implemented in the first 100 days in office is directed at unemployment. We are talking about [four-second break in reception] productive investment, especially for small and midsize producers, which are the two sectors that create the most jobs. We must also encourage foreign investment. For the past year I have been working on this with a group of U.S. investors who want to invest in our country. We are going to implement these types of actions. We are also going to ensure that state funds deposited in private banks will be used to promote development and job creation. That is the fourth measure I would implement. The fifth measure is to confront this government's shortcomings in terms of the peace plans. We will solve the land problem that has not been solved. We will compensate former soldiers and national policemen with programs for their reintegration into the country's economic life. We are going to handle the problems faced by the war disabled from both sides. We will allocate the necessary funds to develop the institution that has been created for them. Those are the first and most important measures we will adopt. In sum, I will prove during my first few months in office that we are going to make changes, but changes that reflect an intelligent combination of modifications and continuity. [Funes] Dr. Zamora, you still have a minute. You have presented a concise plan for the first 100 days, but I would like to ask you another question. There is a real problem, the root of which is governing. The economic measures to be implemented in those first days also calls for a process of agreement among the various sectors, particularly the economic sectors. How will you accomplish this? You represent a coalition of leftist parties. One of the biggest doubts the various sectors have is whether the left is capable of achieving a modicum of understanding among the different groups in light of the country's current situation and whether the left is capable of governing. [Zamora] If there was ever anyone in this country who worked toward an understanding [26-second break in reception]. [passage omitted] [Funes] Thank you very much. According to the drawing, Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, National Solidarity Movement [MSN] candidate, is next. [Rodriguez] The MSN proposes several measures. The first is related to the structural adjustment program. We would request a meeting with the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] to adopt measures related to the problems caused by our country's structural adjustment. We are worried, because we know there are private meetings going on now between the World Bank, IDB, IMF, and the government to discuss a possible devaluation that would be implemented after the elections. Second, we would seek international cooperation, especially for land transfer projects. We would seek international cooperation at a donors meeting to expedite the obtainment of financial resources of approximately $275 million, which are required to comply with this part of the peace agreements. Third, we would seek a consolidation of budgets; that is, the merger of regular and special budgets under the sole control of the Finance Ministry instead of maintaining separate budgets, as is currently being done, because this could lead to corruption, inefficiency, or a mishandling of the nation's money. Fourth are tax collection and fiscal evasion. We have noticed the Chamber of Commerce's statements regarding contraband. We would try to improve the fiscal collection mechanisms and enforce the law against fiscal evasion. This is pursuant to the call by the Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce and Industries to apply severe corrective measures to prevent contraband and apply the full force of the law against any official involved in contraband in our country. We all know there is much contraband that is not being combated at custom posts and border areas, because the government is not firmly committed to doing so. Fifth, we would review interest rates; that is, review the financial system's interest rates to ensure they match the inflation rates which supposedly exist in our country and which are between 9 and 12 percent. The gap between active and passive rates is too wide, and we think they must have a coherent relationship with the national inflation rate. In international trade, we will adopt a mechanism to promote the union of private enterprise and unions to take advantage of the SGP [Generalized System of Preferences] and the Caribbean Basin Initiative regarding investments and technology in order to prepare our country for achieving a future competitiveness within the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. This means we must strengthen El Salvador's international negotiation team with international law experts who can solve international legal problems concerning NAFTA's adoption and implementation. One of our priorities will obviously be to expedite the economic integration process at the regional level, particularly with the Central American economic market. Another important measure for us is that the investment of family remittances should become a productive investment; in other words, we will design a financial system program that encourages the beneficiaries of family remittances to invest in the production sector, in mini and small enterprises, to help generate riches and distribute the economic surplus. We will establish consortiums between mini and small businessmen and big businessmen so these two sectors can integrate, through an exposure to business dynamism, to improve production and exports. [Funes] Excuse me, Doctor. Only 30 seconds more, please. [Rodriguez] We will strive to make a long-term strategic investment with the IDB and the World Bank for the recovery of the country's hydrographic basins, the reconversion of its industrial sector, the protection of its ecology, and the maintenance of its aquiferous strata. I conclude here, although three or four measures are still pending. I think we can discuss them later in the debate. [Funes] Dr. Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate of the PCN [National Conciliation Party]. You have five minutes to outline what would be the first measures you would take. We are also defining a specific time for the adoption of decisions and for the implementation of these measures--we mean emergency measures--during the first 100 days in government. If you are elected, what would you do in the economic sector? [Escobar Garcia] Thank you for the invitation, Mauricio. I believe the importance of this program derives from the ideas and specific measures we may provide to counter urgent problems, leaving middle- and long-term problems for a later date. In this regard, we cannot concentrate on social and age composition, employment, consumer population, but we must look to the working public, because we all know work is a very serious problem. We are dealing here with a very important and delicate issue; that is why I met with my economic team led by my partner on the ticket, Mr. Marquesin, and we have discussed certain measures divided into three large groups. The first measure refers to the recovery of the agriculture sector; the second refers to industrial recovery, the third to massive public works. Regarding the recovery of the agriculture sector, we believe we can start working fast on the fiber issue, such as cotton, [word indistinct], and sisal. We can also begin working on intensive cattle raising, particularly in the northeastern part of the country, and nontraditional products, particularly those being sold to the United States, such as watermelon and melon. We can also perhaps work on marine products. Regarding industrial recovery, we will undoubtedly devote our attention to assembly plants, because they require smaller investments; in addition, the training of assembly plant workers is not really difficult. Furthermore, we will work to export those products we are more capable of exporting, such as pharmaceuticals and chemicals, which, at this time, rank third among Salvadoran exports. Furthermore, in this area we will give special attention to the metalworking industry, which is even producing spare parts for national consumption. Regarding the area of massive public works, we must pay immediate attention to roads, airport expansions, pier expansions, and large-scale constructions of schools. We believe these measures can be perfectly implemented in the first 100 days of government. Even though their effects may not be perceived immediately, the measures taken in a timely fashion upon assuming the government and even before would make it possible to resolve the immediate problem I stated at the beginning. [sentence as heard] The medium- and long- term measures will come later. [Funes] Thank you, Doctor. To conclude this first round, Christian Democratic Party candidate Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena will now speak. [Chavez Mena] Thanks, Mauricio. Congratulations on taking this initiative. We deplore the absence of Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] official candidate. We think he is wrong to refuse to participate in the debate with the other candidates so the people can have a better idea of our respective views. We believe there are three important aspects: Crime, lack of jobs, and price policy. I will split this five minutes into three blocks. First, measures to ensure governability. This is essential. We are convinced we are the only ones who can give this country a framework of governability, that we are the only ones capable of leading and carrying out a political and economic project according to the reality and the correlation of existing forces. As soon as it is known we were the elected candidates for president and vice president, we intended to create a climate of confidence, which is essential for the business sector. Our model of social and market economy rests on entrepreneurs, who are the dynamic motor of economic activities. They must have the psychological element of confidence and security. Therefore, our first action will be to meet with the most representative entrepreneurial sectors to set the rules of the economic game and to say very clearly that our government will befriend entrepreneurs, and is willing to create, expand, and stimulate business. Then, within this concept of participation, we will immediately stimulate the creation of a national congress with delegates from the business and labor sectors as well as experts to discuss the economic strategy to be implemented during our government. Third, we will reactivate the economic reorganization forum -- this is essential in fulfilling the peace agreements -- to present a national emergency plan for attaining a social truce in six months, during which time we will present our initiative to freeze the price of staples, establish a salary policy consistent with stability and the prevailing fiscal situation, and determine the measures to be immediately taken to combat poverty and the problems derived from structure adjustments. In addition, we intend to create a National Agricultural and Livestock Council to stimulate agriculture with the direct participation of the country's various agricultural sectors so they can define, stimulate, and supervise those policies. Given the importance of Central American integration, it is necessary to create a commission to start negotiating Central American integration. Also, it is necessary to create a National Women's Association to incorporate women more effectively into productive activities. Mini-, small-, and medium-size enterprises, as well as agricultural sectors, will immediately be incorporated into the state institutions directly linked to their respective sectors. A very important criterion will be the gradual application of economic policies and the search for a consensus before establishing these economic policies. Finally, we think it is very important to reach a basic political agreement among the country's political forces as a part of governability so this governability can allow for the stability and the security that the state needs. The second block would consists of measures to begin resolving the most pressing economic problems. The first block deals with governability of the economy. Now for the second block. First, the immediate reactivation of the country's hospitals network. Essentially, this is a social subject, but, given its relationship to economic problems and the country's human problem, the existing hospitals and health centers network must be reactivated. Second, we intend to create approximately 120,000 jobs in six months through productive basic infrastructure projects to be financed with the $465 million currently available, of which only 25 percent has been disbursed. We have appointed a group of experts so these projects, which are essentially productive and focused on the areas in conflict and where the most serious poverty exists, can be initiated immediately. We will be prepared to disburse at least $200 million. The government has been inept in handling these disbursements. On the other hand, we plan to draft the 1995 budget, we plan to present a foreign cooperation policy on the subjects of ecology, drugs, migration, the problem of disbursements for production activities and the case of (?residents) in El Salvador. We propose to eliminate the value added tax on staple products, elements necessary for production, and raw material necessary for the pharmaceutical and other similar industries. [passage omitted] [Escobar Garcia] We insist on the agricultural sector's recovery because, based on the government's experience in this area, we know it can be reactivated quickly. For example, when we talk about fiber and cotton, we are talking about a product produced the same year; in other words, foreign exchanges obtained with cotton exports are received immediately. Naturally, there will be some questions about the relation between cotton and the environment, but that depends on production techniques and the number of manzanas used in El Salvador for this activity. Therefore, when we talk about the recovery of the agricultural and livestock sector, we are talking about the country's northeastern region, which has been quite affected. During our visits to that area, Ocicala, Sesori, and other areas affected by the conflict, we have seen interest and it is possible to quickly develop the cattle industry almost immediately. Right now, when we tour those areas and review agricultural activities, we realize the great efforts that are being made. Therefore, it is just a matter of giving the sector the encouragement and incentives it needs. We are also working on some nontraditional products. Although some Fusades [Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development] programs have not been successful, we have gained some experience in exporting nontraditional products. As you can see, all these measures focus on sectors that are currently facing more difficulties, but which are capable of recovering in a short period of time, as I just said. This group, of course, includes the reformed sector. The configuration of landownership has changed, and consequently we must pay more attention to cooperatives and [word indistinct]. The cooperatives problem, which are now facing a very difficult financial situation, could be resolved or eased through special plans. As for the political aspect of your question -- criticism about the concentration of wealth -- I would like to say that if we analyze policies that existed 20 or 30 years ago, those policies could seem inadequate today even though they were correct at that time. Therefore, we can say with absolute certainty that during its government, the PCN achieved significant economic growth, social development, and to some degree paved the road for the political development we now have. These criticisms are groundless and seem to respond more to political interests than to real situations that clearly and specifically belong to the past. [passage omitted] [Funes] We have a question for Rodriguez. You mentioned tax evasion and you proposed treating it as a crime. Specifically, how could this practice be eliminated; what specific measures would you implement during the first 100 days of your government to eradicate the problem of tax evasion in order to collect more revenues for the state? Would you be willing to use 10 percent of the taxes for the renovation of jails and in that way reduce crime? [Rodriguez] We believe guaranteeing compliance with our laws is a matter of political willingness. We believe it is possible to obtain additional income for the state through more efficient, productive, technical controls of the Salvadoran general tax system. For example, we believe there is a shortage of personnel and real capacity to handle the value added tax, VAT. We have also said we share the idea that the VAT should be eliminated from foods, staples, electricity, and potable water. We believe an adequate VAT on luxury items could substantially increase fiscal revenues, thereby reducing the impact on products that are basic for the majority of Salvadorans. We believe it is possible to improve tax collection through state reforms, better training, human development, and technology. There are many ways to improve it. We believe this is something we must do immediately after assuming the government. [passage omitted] [Funes] Colonel, you were demobilized and know the armed institution very well. I am surprised that your first 100-day program does not mention measures guaranteeing the productive reinsertion of demobilized military personnel, taking into account the current situation. I suppose the television viewer has referred to the fundamental issue, which has been raised recently, on compensation payments to demobilized Armed Forces members and guaranteeing their productive reinsertion. Specifically: What do you offer demobilized Armed Forces' personnel and how can you guarantee the productive reinsertion of these men, who only fought during the war, therefore they have no production capacity? [Escobar] Thank you Mauricio, and I also thank the person who posed this question because it gives me the opportunity to refer to a sector that is linked to my own feelings without taking into account the patriotic role they played during the recently concluded conflict. This is certainly one of the most difficult issues to deal with, as is being observed in the very application of the reinsertion of both sides' former combatants. This is a decision that does not solely depend on the government; it also depends on the will of the people who would benefit from these measures. In this regard, the programs the government established are currently being implemented. I do not know if they are being implemented speedily or broadly enough but they have already been set up. Once I take office, however, the reinsertion program's basic points would have to be totally reviewed. Numberless criticisms and many commentaries have been made on this subject, therefore the basic points would have to be reviewed to determine the people who are going to be reinserted and in what areas. I had not thought of this issue as an emergency measure. As I said at the beginning of my participation, I tried to narrow my comments down to what you had specifically requested, immediate measures, that is shock [preceding word in English] measures. In reality, the demobilized program should continue within the government, but is not necessarily a shock program that will reactivate the economy and partially resolve the unemployment problem. I definitely did not take or we did not take this issue into account as part of the immediate measures to be implemented. This program must be continued; it must be reviewed and assessed if the basic reinsertion budget and conditions respond to the reality of this specific issue. I would like to make it very clear that we have not excluded the demobilized from our priorities, rather it is because these programs, in our opinion, do not correspond to the government's first 100 days. [Funes] Thank you very. Now Mr. Chavez Mena, here are several questions, however, I will ask you to be brief as we are short on time. Here is a question. I imagine it is from a businessman. As one of the emergency measures to be implemented in the first 100 days of your government, you have proposed price controls on basic products. Doesn't price control recall the ghost of state intervention that plunged the Christian Democratic government during Napoleon Duarte's administration to discredit and defeat? How do you intend to implement this price control, and won't this price control discourage investment? [Chavez] We have not talked about price control. We have talked about price freezing though...[pauses] only of the family basket food products. This is to be combined with a salary policy with economic measures to combat poverty, of course. Where would this measure be discussed? This would be discussed precisely at a forum, as I stated previously. I am glad this question came up as it gives me the opportunity to explain matters. It is precisely through market mechanisms and a six-month period, which we call a social truce, that we will implement this price freezing process. This goes hand in hand with removing the VAT from family basket food products. This measure is precisely to reduce the increase generated by the VAT to family basket food products' costs and prices. Therefore, we believe it is very important to implement this price freeze, as the result of a consensus, as was done with great success in Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina, and recently in Chile with regard to taxes. This can be achieved by making a difference; that is freezing prices, establishing a salary policy, establishing certain measures by consensus as a result of a social accord, a social agreement. This is what I am referring to. This is a matter of justice; this is a matter that responds to an economic need and truly responds to the people's feelings. The people in this country cannot support the cost of living. A time gap, a social truce must be implement. This is the reason for the price freeze. I would also like to take this opportunity to make a brief comment on the ability to govern issue addressed to me. We insist that a leftist government, from former guerrillas in this country, would not make the nation governable nor stable. It would have problems owing to the mistrust the business sector may feel; something that would generate even greater difficulties and contribute to a level of regional instability. In this respect, we feel the country is not prepared from a historic and political standpoint to have a government headed by the FMLN-CD. As for the business PARE [expansion unknown] Dr. Zamora referred to, it was essentially a political PARE. The PDC defended the country's economic system; it defended the economic system. It began a process of democratization. In addition, it began a process of international cooperation. I want to state it in this manner because the ability to govern topic is essential, and we must say clearly it. There is a lot of mistrust. We are proposing trust, that is, generating a climate of trust within the business sector. We have talked to them. My relations with business sectors are very good. We have clearly outlined our criteria for gradual steps and consensus, or rather the search for consensus prior to adopting major economic policies instead of adopting them without consultations. In this respect, I want to refer to Mr. Rodriguez' remark, who seems to have been truly swayed by the ads. We had a debate prior to all those economic measures. There really was political motivation behind the ads of a group of politicized businessmen who entrenched themselves and joined the ARENA ranks. In addition, we had a war, and the economy was constantly being sabotaged. The economic and electricity infrastructure was damaged, and this really caused an economic problem that was extremely delicate. We have to put ourselves in that historic situation. In conclusion and in thinking of the future, what we have to have is, that in order to be able to govern, to be able to implement a political program, we need to have a political program. For one reason or another, the Pope correctly said that neoliberalism has been a failure wherever it has been implemented. In Brazil with Collor de Mello, in Honduras, in Costa Rica, where there were problems because of neoliberalism, in Venezuela,.... [Funes interrupting] Allow me to interrupt you, but we have a time limitation, and every candidate has four minutes. [Chavez] I just want to conclude by saying real socialism has disappeared. The ability to govern problem is essential, and I wanted to refer to it. [passage omitted]
