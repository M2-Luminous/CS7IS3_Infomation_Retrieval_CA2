The first survey (448 respondents) was conducted one month prior to the elections, the second (439 respondents)--three days prior, and the third (511 respondents)--immediately following the elections. A comparative analysis of the results of the first and second surveys shows that election campaigning had virtually no effect on increasing the interest of voters in the elections of representational organs of authority. A certain reduction in the interest level was even seen. According to data from the poll conducted three days prior to the elections, only 17.8 percent of Almaty residents (one month prior to the elections this figure was 17.6 percent) were very interested in the coming elections, more than half of those surveyed--52.6 percent (55.1 percent for the poll conducted one month prior) were interested in them to some degree, and 29.4 percent (27.2 percent) expressed complete indifference. Nor was there any change in the number of respondents who had decided conclusively not to participate in the elections--26.9 percent (26.3 percent one month prior to the elections). Three days before the elections, 24.6 percent still had not decided whether to take part (26.8 percent--one month prior to the elections). A certain increase was seen in the number of voters deciding to participate in the elections--48.1 percent (44.2 percent--one month prior). Results of the postelection survey showed that 64.6 percent of the Almaty residents polled took part in the elections (62.8 percent of the electorate voted according to data of the Central Electoral Committee). The most energetic voting activity was observed with respect to pensioners, 89.5 percent of whom went to the polls. Also active on election day were military servicemen (75 percent), engineering-technical personnel (74.4 percent), the creative and scientific intelligentsia (69 percent), and workers (65.9 percent), who comprise 33.9 percent of the total number of those voting. Less energetic were teachers and doctors (61.5 percent of their number voted), students (50.9 percent), entrepreneurs and businessmen (50 percent), and employees of law enforcement organs (41.2 percent). The low percentage of the latter group is perhaps related to the fact that militiamen predominate here (of mid-level and junior rank) who were actively engaged in maintaining order during the elections. The degree of participation by age in the elections was directly proportional to the ages of voters. The greatest activity was observed in the category of middle-aged and elderly people: 87.5 percent--for those over 60, 73.1 percent--ages 50 to 59, 74.8 percent--ages 40 to 49, and 59.4 percent--ages 30 to 39. The least degree of election participation was observed in the electorate of the 25-29 age group--49.2 percent of them voted. At the same time, there was no substantive difference between election participants categorized by ethnicity--61.3 percent of Kazakhs and 69 percent of Russians cast ballots. As one can see from these figures, the Russian population of Almaty was somewhat more active than the Kazakh population. What were the reasons motivating almost two-thirds of Almaty residents to take part in the voting? Over half (55.8 percent) explained their decision by virtue of civic duty. Some 22.5 percent of the politically active citizens explained their participation through a concern for the democratic development of society, and 19.7 percent of participating city-dwellers were influenced by the need to develop and perfect legislation. Fourteen percent of those voting cited a need to protect the interests of their nationality as being among the motives for their decision (13.9 percent of Kazakhs and 17.2 percent of Russians were thus motivated to participate). The need to elect a professional parliament as a counterweight to the executive branch of power was cited by 13.3 percent of respondents in explaining their decision. Only 7.6 percent based their reasoning on enthusiasm for a certain candidate (6.2 percent--one month prior to the elections). The low percentage seen here illustrates the obvious lack of political figures who are well known and enjoy the prestige of Almaty residents. Only 1.2 percent of the city populace explained their reasoning by virtue of sympathies for a certain sociopolitical organization. What is interesting is the motivation that led more than a third (35.4 percent) of Almaty residents to decide not to participate in the elections. The overwhelming majority of those deciding not to vote (70.3 percent) explained their nonparticipation through a belief that the election results would not change anything; 69.2 percent felt that those desirous of acceding to power would be elected all the same. Some 9.2 percent of those not voting explained their decision citing indifference as the justification, while the same percentage cited lack of information as the reason. Another 9.1 percent believed their own personal problems were more important than the elections. Responses to a question regarding political sympathies of respondents on the threshold of the elections showed the low popularity of sociopolitical associations of the republic. This is explained evidently by the fact that the process of formation of the multiparty system in the republic is in its early stages, and it is still too soon to be talking about the formation of party-political structures of any durability, or about a clear demarcation of political forces. On the eve of the elections, 12.1 percent of respondents showed a preference for the People's Unity Alliance of Kazakhstan (one month prior to the elections--14.5 percent), the Communist Party--9.6 percent (9.8 percent), independent candidates--9.1 percent (3.1 percent), the Democratic Committee for Human Rights--8.9 percent (5.1 percent), Union of Veterans--8.9 percent (6.5 percent), the Slavic movement Lad--3.9 percent (11.6 percent), People's Congress of Kazakhstan--3.6 percent (4.5 percent), Socialist Party--2.1 percent (1.1 percent), the party Zheltoksan--1.4 percent (0.5 percent), Republican Party--0.9 percent (0.9 percent), the Kazakhstan civic movement Azag--0.7 percent (0.9 percent), Independent Center of Trade Unions--0.7 percent (0.9 percent), and the party Alash--0.5 percent (0.9 percent). Some 22.7 percent of Almaty residents polled had not determined their political sympathies three days prior to the elections (one month prior to the elections this figure was 39.5 percent). Results of the second survey showed that three days before the elections 39 percent of city residents were unfamiliar with the campaign programs of sociopolitical organizations (one month prior to the elections this figure was 45.1 percent), 22.8 percent were insufficiently familiar with them (25.9 percent), 22.6 percent were roughly familiar (21 percent), and just 13 percent of city residents were familiar with them (6.7 percent). Despite the increased percentage of voters who had familiarized themselves with the campaign programs of sociopolitical organizations towards the end of the campaign period, survey results revealed that political parties missed the good opportunity afforded by preelection activity to broadly advertise their programs. This can be seen in the third place finish achieved by independent candidates. Only the Democratic Committee for Human Rights and Union of Veterans increased their standings appreciably. The standings of the remainder either decreased or remained at their previous level. Despite the fact that the Communist Party was not registered as of election day, the Communists have a fairly solid electorate--consisting mainly of people whose standard of living dropped sharply as a result of the reforms conducted. A significant reduction was seen by election day in the number of supporters of the Slavic movement Lad (one month prior to the elections, 11.6 percent of those polled supported Lad; three days prior--only 3.9 percent). Analysis shows that the reduction was due chiefly to workers, who constituted more than half of the Lad electorate at the outset of the campaign. Whereas one month prior to the elections, 16.4 percent of all workers supported the movement, three days prior this figure was 4 percent. By ethnic category, an almost threefold reduction was seen in support for the movement on the part of Russians--who comprised the overwhelming majority of its electorate and apparently believed Lad would not stand up for their interests with sufficient decisiveness. Kazakhs, who constituted 11.5 percent of the Lad electorate prior to the elections, stopped supporting the movement entirely. As opposed to the Russians, Kazakhs obviously felt the reverse was true--that the Lad program proposed too radical a resolution of ethnic problems. As to the question of criteria guiding the voters in making a determination of their representatives, the following results were seen from the third survey. Almaty residents focused their attention firstly on the competence of candidates for deputy (15.7 percent of those polled), 13.7 percent showed a preference for the independence of position of the candidates, 12.7 percent--for their moral qualities (incorruptibility, trustworthiness of their word...), 8.6 percent were influenced by the attractiveness of candidates' campaign programs, 7.6 percent--by the manner of communication, education, and intelligence of candidates, 7.2 percent found the patriotism of candidates important, 6.3 percent were influenced by a candidate's affiliation with a particular sociopolitical organization, and only 6.1 percent of survey respondents were guided by the ethnic affiliation of the candidates. Preelection survey data on the degree to which Almaty residents were informed about candidates prior to the elections show that only one-fifth of city residents (20.8 percent) knew the candidates registered in their electoral districts, 23.3 percent knew roughly who they were, and 44.6 percent knew nothing at all about the individuals campaigning in their own electoral districts. Some 29.4 percent of surveyed city-dwellers made their selection beforehand. More than a third of respondents (35.8 percent) decided at the polling station. The following results were obtained for a question asking what influenced the respondent's choice if he had no previous knowledge regarding the candidates: type of work of a candidate was the deciding factor for 16.4 percent of city-dwellers surveyed; occupation--for 15.9 percent; information about a candidate's nomination--9.6 percent; party, movement, or union affiliation--7.1 percent; nationality of a candidate--5.9 percent. Indicating a certain degree of tension in interethnic relations was the fact that 15.1 percent of respondents voted only for a candidate of his own nationality (17.3 percent of Kazakhs and 18.5 percent of Russians voted in this manner)--41.6 percent of these made their selection beforehand, while 55.9 percent determined their choice at the polling station. Thus, survey data show that the random element played a significant role in the elections of deputies. What do Almaty residents expect from their new parliament? According to data from the third survey, more than half the voters--52.7 percent (one month prior to the elections the figure was 53.1 percent) nurture definite hopes in connection with the newly elected parliament. Some 29.6 percent of survey respondents expect professional work to be done on legislation (one month prior to the elections--28.1 percent), while 18.8 percent (17.1 percent) believe the new parliament will change the existing situation in society. Only 4.3 percent (7.1 percent) think the highest legislative organ will act as a counterweight to the executive branch. More than a fourth--28.2 percent (26.8 percent) of surveyed voters expect nothing at all from their new parliament. A comparative analysis of results of the first and third surveys shows that the election campaign did not increase the prestige of the highest representational authority in the eyes of Almaty residents. Proceeding from the data presented above, we may draw the following conclusions. The study shows that preelection campaign activity--restricted within a rigid provisional framework, its inadequate financing, low activity level of the candidates for deputy themselves, weak support on the part of sociopolitical organizations for their own candidates, inadequate clarification of the election campaign in the mass media, and the absence of new, bright political figures all worked to produce virtually no increase in the interest of the electorate with respect to the elections. Analysis of the data obtained during the course of the third survey shows that the element of randomness exerted a significant effect on the result of the elections in the city of Almaty, this being related to the absolute lack of information on the part of over half (53.7 percent) of the city population that went to the polls. The elections show a growth of political passivity on the part of Almaty residents as reflected in the refusal of more than a third of the electorate to take part in the voting, explaining their nonparticipation by virtue of a belief that nothing will change for the better as a result of the elections and that those desirous of acceding to power will be elected all the same. The election campaign exerted no significant influence on the process of establishment of a multiparty system in Kazakhstan since, as opposed to Russia, the republic's political parties failed to take advantage of the marvelous opportunity afforded by elections to the Supreme Council and local organs of power to make a statement about themselves and about their political programs. Results of the three surveys show that only two parties at present--the People's Unity Alliance of Kazakhstan and the Communist Party--have established a fairly significant and solid electorate, on whose support they can today rely. The results obtained during the course of the three surveys show that the social consciousness of Almaty residents is gradually crystallizing, and that it is becoming increasingly independent, freeing itself from precepts of political conformism, i.e., from the subconscious readiness to accept any and all decisions of the state authority.
