The Jilin provincial party committee and the provincial government recently held a mobilization meeting at the corporation at which they declared the project has been listed as the province's "priority project," and they pledged to have it completed and put into operation by the end of this year. The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery industry. Requiring an area of 218,000 square meters, the project will have internationally first-class equipment. When the first phase of the project is completed, the production line will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The total investment for this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When the second phase of the project is completed, the company will be able to turn out 300,000 sedans a year. When the entire project is completed, the company will become China's largest modern sedan manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf sedans. After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and foreign design and construction units which carried out design, construction, installation, and production debugging simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment has been completed. A modern sedan production base with four large buildings has taken shape. Adhering to the principle of carrying out construction and production simultaneously while striving to increase the rate of self-sufficiency in the automobile industry, the Volkswagen company under the First Automobile Group I/E Corporation organized the production of sedans in 1992 by putting up a temporary production line. By the end of last year, it had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta sedans for sale on the market. It also set up more than 100 special service facilities throughout the country.
