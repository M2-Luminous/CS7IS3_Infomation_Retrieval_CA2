The protest march that has taken place in this city began one hour late, and participants included the National Trade Union Federation of Honduran Workers (FESITRANH), Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (FITH), and the United Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH). In addition, San Pedro Municipality representatives such as SITRAUNAH [Trade Union of National Autonomous University Workers of Honduras], SITRAMEDYSH [Trade Union of Medical, Hospital and Related, Workers], and SITRAIHSS [Workers Union of the Honduran Social Security Institute] also participated in the event. Peasant and teachers organizations such as the Peasant Women Joint Development Committee (CODINCA) and COLSUMAH [Professional Association for the Improvement of Teaching in Honduras], among others, also participated in the demonstration. During the march, the workers complained about the high cost of living and demanded a general increase in salaries. They also demanded the so-called moral revolution heralded by the government result in in-depth agrarian reforms to the benefit of the peasant sector, not only a minority as occurred during prior administrations. FESINTRAH President Mario Quintanilla has said this march was just the beginning of further actions the working class will take to demand solutions to their grievances. "President Reina has made specific promises on fundamental issues such as voluntary military service and the education system, and we are demanding the fulfillment of these promises," the union leader has said. He has said workers feel ignored, because there are inequalities between earned wages and the cost of the basic food basket. "We need positive answers from the government of the Republic. We want a general salary increase," Quintanilla has said. He added the Liberal administration is obligated to provide answers to this popular movement. In this respect, he has urged all his fellow union members to strive for real price controls, "because this country's business sector does whatever it wants with the prices of goods, and the government says nothing." In addition, Quintanilla mentioned the problems confronted by residents of the community of Lopez Arellano as the result of the irregular manner in which the Social Housing Fund (Fosovi) intends to collect delayed housing payments.
