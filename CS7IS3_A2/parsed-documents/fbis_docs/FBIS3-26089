He said that the Chinese Government had long prepared against the possible disruptive and undermining actions by the British Hong Kong authorities and had adopted corresponding countermeasures. The official said: Britain unilaterally violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration and flagrantly denied the existence of agreements between the two governments. This fully showed that Britain was not willing to return Hong Kong to China and was still attempting to continue its colonial rule by playing the political card, the economic card, and the international card during the remaining three years. The British Hong Kong authorities are fostering a batch of pro-British people who oppose everything China advocates and does, trying to make them Britain's future proxies in Hong Kong, through whom Britain may continue to influence the future special administrative region [SAR] government to resist implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy and to create political disputes. This is the crucial point of the issue. He added: When doing this, the British Hong Kong Government made a totally wrong assessment of the situation. China's determination to recover Hong Kong is firm. China will never barter away its principles. We will rely on the vast number of Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and love Hong Kong and unite all forces that can be united, including foreigners who want to seek development in Hong Kong, to jointly maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese Government will continue to adopt policies to maintain Hong Kong's stability. The sources also said that an authoritative person in Beijing law circles recently said that China may consider changing the time and method of recovering Hong Kong if the following situations occur: First, Britain plans to change Hong Kong into an international political city and a center of international political disputes. Second, Britain introduces other foreign forces to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs, thus turning Hong Kong's affairs into international affairs. Third, Britain fosters a pro-Britain and anti-China political force to create trouble in Hong Kong and helps it enter the local power structure. Fourth, Britain encourages the pro-Britain and anti-China political forces to disrupt order and create political incidents in Hong Kong. Fifth, Britain supports collaboration between the pro-Britain and anti-China force in Hong Kong and the international anticommunist forces in creating political incidents in Hong Kong. Sixth, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities stir up political turmoil in the late transitional period to oppose the Chinese Government, oppose the Basic Law, and oppose the end of colonial rule. Seventh, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities deliberately create financial and monetary disorder in Hong Kong Eighth, in the late transitional period, if the Hong Kong Government is paralyzed, while riots occur and the situation goes out of control. Ninth, if Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities collude with Taiwan in turning Hong Kong into a self-governing political entity or a semi-independent entity.
