Under the "entry and exit" law, exit is restricted for those convicted of crimes, under investigation, or drafted for military service, as well as for persons under obligations not to divulge state secrets. Three types of external passports have been approved: civilian, service, and diplomatic. The law on identity cards for citizens of the republic calls for two types of identity cards: for those under 16, and for those past that age. The plastic cards will include the name in full, nationality, age, marital status, eligibility for military service, and a photograph. All the information on the cards will be put in a unified bank of data about the country's citizens open for use by the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The introduction of identity cards will be financed from the budget at a total cost of nearly six million manats. All passports of the former USSR are supposed to be replaced by identity cards before the end of 1996.
