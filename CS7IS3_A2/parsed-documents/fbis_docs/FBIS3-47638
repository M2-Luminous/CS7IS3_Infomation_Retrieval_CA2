On 13 January, Yun Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, who is the chief North Korean delegate to working-level contacts with the IAEA, said that North Korea would respond to the IAEA demand soon and that its response was delayed because there were many things to review carefully due to differences in basic positions [kibonjogin ipchang chairo] between North Korea and the IAEA. He also hinted that North Korea will not completely meet the IAEA demand despite an agreement with the United States, stressing that there is no change in their position that the nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations between North Korea and the United States.
