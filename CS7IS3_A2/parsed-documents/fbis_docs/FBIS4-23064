M. Arakelyan, Yerevan State University, Vladimir Polytechnical Institute] [Abstract] This article examines two problems in the propagation of laser radiation in a distributed feedback system: noise conversion and determination of the conditions in which it is possible to take quantum nondisruptive measurements (with Bragg diffraction) and experiment with the induction of hydrodynamic instabilities by light convection (Rayleigh-Benard) in an anisotropic liquid (classic examination). Emphasis is placed on the possibility of observing these fundamental states in the field of high-coherence stable continuous lasers. This is important in the development of optical computers and biocomputers. References 56: 41 Russian, 15 Western.
