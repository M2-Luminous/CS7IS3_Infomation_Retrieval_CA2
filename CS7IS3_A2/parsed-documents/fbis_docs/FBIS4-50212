Since then, 700,000 corruption and bribery cases have been accepted and heard, of which, 400,000 have been filed for investigation and prosecution, and 8 billion yuan worth's embezzled money and goods have been recovered. From 1982 to 1993, seven cadres of provincial and ministerial levels, over 300 cadres of department and bureau levels, and over 7,000 cadres of county and section levels, who were guilty of corruption and bribery, were placed on file for investigation and prosecution by procuratorial organs throughout the country. Since the convocation of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's anticorruption work has begun to be implemented in line with the legal system. The restored and reorganized procuratorial organs have actively conducted the work of dealing blows to economic irregularities, including the work of opposing corruption. Particularly since the CPC Central Committee adopted the decision of profoundly launching the anticorruption struggle in August 1993, procuratorial organs have given full play to their functional role to emphatically investigate and punish the corruption and bribery cases committed by working personnel of party and government organs, judicial departments, law-enforcing administrative departments, and economic management departments. Procuratorial organs have also concentrated their efforts on investigating and cracking a number of major and appalling cases, thus achieving remarkable results in the anticorruption work. From September 1993 to March 1994, procuratorial organs filed 22,220 corruption and bribery cases for investigation, of which, 9,948 cases involved an amount ranging from 10,000 yuan to 100,000 each, 789 cases involved an amount ranking from 100,000 yuan to 1 million yuan each, and 37 cases involved over 1 million yuan each. At the same time, 904 cadres at or above the county and section levels, who committed the crimes of corruption and bribery, were investigated and punished (of whom, 71 were of department and bureau levels). A total of 13,019 cadres guilty of corruption and bribery were brought to the people's courts for prosecution. While launching the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial organs have established crime-reporting centers, perfected the crime-reporting system, and successfully created the effective method of mobilizing and depending on the masses to struggle against corruption and bribery during the new period of not carrying the mass movement. According to statistics, since the establishment of crime-reporting centers, the crimes reported by the masses have become the major source of the corruption and bribery cases filed by procuratorial organs for investigation. From 1988 to 1993, procuratorial organs throughout the country accepted a total of 750,000 clues for solving corruption and bribery cases. During the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial organs have gradually given rise to a mechanism of opposing corruption and investigating corruption cases, in which higher levels are combined with lower levels and organizational operation is rapid, thus pushing the anticorruption work to the new path of regularized and modernized development. At present, procuratorial organs throughout the country have an anticorruption and investigation contingent of 38,000 people.
