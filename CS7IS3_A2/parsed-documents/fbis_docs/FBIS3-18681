During a Bundestag question session on the government's position on NATO military missions -- the session had been called for by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] deputies Duve and Glotz gave assurances that a SPD-led government would not have acted differently. The PDS, on the other hand, said that the participation of German troops in AWACS flights was a "clear-cut" violation of the constitution. Ruehe said that the shooting down of "Serbian" combat aircraft had sent "an unmistakable signal." The war in former Yugoslavia painfully shows that even after the end of the Cold War, peace cannot be guaranteed on a lasting basis without the possibility of employing armed forces when necessary. The Bundeswehr, assured Ruehe, would continue to make its contribution to helping people in need. Until now, 874 flights had delivered 6,950 tonnes of relief supplies to Sarajevo and, in addition, 325 nighttime missions had dropped 1,800 tonnes of supplies over eastern Bosnia. Ruehe said he was pleased that the SPD had approved of the missions and that in the future, there should no longer be any differences between German soldiers and their comrades from alliance states. Foreign Minister Kinkel said it was hard when violence could only be stopped with violence, but that is reality. If the alliance had not been so united, then the Serbs would not have moved their heavy weapons away from Sarajevo. The "German attitude of restraint has served us well, and we do not want to give it up," said Kinkel and, at the same time, demanded a rapid clarification of questions pertaining to German constitutional law. Like Ruehe, Kinkel said it was inaccurate for the SPD chairman to say that there were no differences between the government and the SPD on foreign policy. With their latest party convention resolutions, Alliance 90/the Greens had "completely broken with political reality," said Kinkel. And like Defense Minister Ruehe, Kinkel also stressed Russia's positive role. Speaking for the SPD, Deputy Duve said that if it had not been for the shooting down of the aircraft over Banja Luka, the Washington agreement would not, perhaps, have been possible. The Vance-Owen plan has finally been put aside, although that does not mean that peace has been guaranteed, it has been given a new chance. SPD Deputy Glotz said that shooting down alone was not enough, the international community finally needs a political concept. Deputy Ullmann (Alliance 90/the Greens) expressed regret that it had taken a year before NATO had enforced the flight ban.
