The sources said Jordanian efforts in this regard came about following Western news reports of Israeli excavations searching for antiquities in the Qumran area north of the Dead Sea. The Qumran area is believed to be the home of important historical scrolls that date back to the first century A.D. The sources indicated the Qumran area is Jordanian territory that Israel occupied in the aftermath of the 1967 war. The Israeli occupation of this territory is believed to be listed on the agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli peace negotiations, in order to ensure its return to Jordanian sovereignty.
