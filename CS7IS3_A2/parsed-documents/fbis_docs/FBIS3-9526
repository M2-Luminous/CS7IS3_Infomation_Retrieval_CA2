"I believe the conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Middle East call for more frequent contacts between Romania and Turkey, two large states in the region," Demirel said in an address broadcast live on state radio from the Cotroceni Palace, where he met with Romanian President Ion Iliescu. Iliescu said Turkey and Romania were key countries for stability in the Balkans. Demirel's visit is the second by a Turkish head of state since 1989, the year the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in a bloody revolution. In addition to the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the two sides discussed their increasing trade ties since the demise of communism. Turkish firms are involved in 2,649 ventures in Romania, the fourth largest number of any country. Turkey ranks ninth among countries in overall foreign investment in Romania since the 1989 revolution, at about 32.3 million U.S. dollars. Demirel's visit coincides with the opening of a Romanian-Turkish bank in Bucharest. He also is expected to visit the port of Constantsa on the Black Sea, home of most of Romania's ethnic Turkish minority.
