Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said that this was too bad. He reaffirmed that the Chinese Government sincerely wishes the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate with the Chinese side. He said: It shows that the Hong Kong Government is not willing to cooperate with us if it does not send officials to Beijing. When asked whether or not this action was too politicized, Lu Ping stressed that it was certainly not politicized, because these regulations were not comprehensible to everyone and it was absolutely necessary to invite Hong Kong Government officials to explain them so that they could answer questions directly raised by members of the Preparatory Work Committee [PWC]. Lu Ping did not agree that this practice bypassed the Sino- British Airport Committee. He explained: China and Britain consult and negotiate with each other on the airport issue mainly through the Airport Committee, but before the talks are held, the Chinese side has to listen to all kinds of opinions; hence, we are asking the PWC to discuss it first, hoping that we can listen to all kinds of opinions through the PWC. However, questions raised by PWC members cannot even be answered by the Chinese side, therefore, we want the British Hong Kong authorities would send officials to Beijing to give explanations. Regarding the regulations on the airport administrative organ, it has been very clearly stated in the Memorandum that both sides should consult each other on these questions and that the views of the Chinese side should be listened to. Hence, in the future, we must still consult with the British side through the Airport Committee. Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said when attending a forum: As far as the consultations on the "draft regulations on the Airport Corporation" is concerned, we hope that it is real consultation rather than "doing it perfunctorily." As this question, which straddles 1997, can be discussed in Hong Kong, why can it not be discussed in Beijing? Zhang Junsheng said: Problems straddling 1997 must be discussed by the Chinese and the British sides and every question related to the new airport should be handled according to the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. The issue of the airport corporation has been raised by the British side, which must be submitted to China and Britain for discussion. In addition, the Chinese side can also publicize its suggestions to seek advice from the Hong Kong people. Zhang Junsheng said: Now that the British Hong Kong Government has published the "draft regulations on the Airport Corporation," I hope that this will be real consultation and that they will listen to others' opinions and take these opinions into consideration rather than what we describe in the mainland as "going through the motions." Responding the issue of the PWC having to study the draft and invite Hong Kong Government officials to Beijing to brief them on the situation, Zhang Junsheng said: These are issues related to Hong Kong's transition and issues to be studied by the PWC. Under this situation, why can they not invite British Hong Kong Government officials to Beijing to explain these regulations? Zhang Junsheng said: Not only the Airport Committee has to study the issue, but so does the PWC. It is all for the smooth transition of Hong Kong, why can they not do so? I do not know what the British Hong Kong Government intends to do regarding the smooth transition of Hong Kong? Why cannot we invite them to Beijing to have discussions? Why can the issue be discussed in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? Why discussions are acceptable in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? This is unreasonable. When asked by this reporter why the Chinese side did not discuss with the British side the issue of the transition of senior Hong Kong civil servants, Zhang Junsheng replied: The issue of the transition of senior civil servants has been clearly stipulated in the Basic Law, this is China's own business as well as the future business of the special administrative region government. British will end on 30 June 1997. This is completely different from the issue of the airport corporation which we are now talking about.
