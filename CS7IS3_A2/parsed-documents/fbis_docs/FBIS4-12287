Washington seems bent on undercutting His Majesty King Husayn's courageous stand!! A meeting was supposed to have been held at the U.S. State Department last Thursday to review the Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, but was put off the day before, lest a lifting of the siege be preceived as a reaction to his majesty's position. It seems very unlikely Washington will set a new date for the review before 17 April to make certain we will show up at the waters conference in Muscat. This is a challenge we must come to grips with, seeing that the U.S.-imposed blockade is to force us into a particular course of action advancing Israeli interests in relation to the peace process!! The Port of al-'Aqabah blockade was not a UN decision; it was undertaken unilaterally by the United States. The blockade has no connection with the UN Security Council sanctions imposed on Iraq. Both Turkey and Iran have seaports and both maintain more substantial economic ties than any such relations Jordan may have with Iraq. Why, then, does not the U.S. Navy inspect Turkish and Iranian ports? In the matter of the blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah, then, there is more at stake than ensuring Jordan's compliance with the Iraq sanctions resolution. At stake is a drive to impoverish us and force us to our knees and then incorporate us into Israel's strategic reach and transform us into a buffer between the Zionist entity and each of Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon and an extension of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho! In any case, the so-called multilaterals do not seem to be getting anywhere. With Syria and Lebanon not putting in an appearance at talks supposedly tackling such issues as the environment and waters, what is there to talk about? These talks are zero; they are little more than symposiums comparable to many gatherings held at Amman hotels. There does not seem to be much point in the multilaterals beyond the fact that they are convened in Arab capitals. The idea behind them, then, is to serve as gateways for Israeli teams and television crews, no matter how much we or our kinsfolk in the West Bank and Gaza may resent it. Initially, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland were chosen as venues for the multilateral sessions. Israel demanded that they be held in Cyprus. Washington, however, decided that they should be hosted by Arab capitals. Why do we attend such talks at all? Is it because Washington wants us to? If that is so, what about our national and pan-Arab interests? And, why should we oblige Washington while it points a gun at our head? We call on the government to take its cue from his majesty the king. If the blockade is not lifted by 17 April, we should not send a delegation to Muscat. We will not go along with a peace settlement that sets out to impoverish us. Are we supposed to become as impoverished as the West bank and Gaza strip population before we become eligible for peace?
