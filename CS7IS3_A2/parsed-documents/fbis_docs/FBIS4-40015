He congratulated Russian citizens on the occasion and said that "Russia has been, is and will alway be a great power. It has an enormous potential. It will overcome difficulties, and its revival is sure to come." He pointed out further that the Russian and Moldovan nations have a long record of friendship and cooperation, and he is sure that those relations will be continued. It is not accidental that the first legal act, adopted by the Moldovan parliament after the proclamation of independence, was the treaty on bilateral relations with Russia. Speaking about the conflict in the Dniester region, Luchinskiy said that the problem emerged, when the USSR was still in existence. Russia and Moldova inherited it together with a Russian army, deployed on the left bank of the Dniester River. The political make-up is rather complicated in Russia today. "We have mutual understanding with the Russian leadership. However, there are political forces in Russia which support separatism in Moldova," he said. The chairman of the Moldovan parliament pointed out that people in the Dniester region were tired of hostility. They do not want to be hostages of adventurers. "The region has been turned of late into one of the strongholds of international terrorism. By the way, I am quoting the words of Russian General Aleksandr Lebed, the commander of the army deployed there. He is urging the local population not to trust the Tiraspol leadership, which is steeped in stealing and corruption," Luchinskiy said. A favourable moment has come for settling the problem of the Dniester region. Tremendous changes took place in Moldova, especially after the latest elections the the public opinion poll. People no longer trust extremists. In the opinion of Luchinskiy, nothing binds people better that common interests and a common market. We should bring down the politization of our relations, should give a chance to the economic agreements, signed within the CIS framework, to start working. We need a free movement of goods, capital and workforce. Moldova is tied to the Russian market. We should cooperate, if this is advantageous for both countries.
