He maintained that the country will only be able to generate electricity at 60 percent of its capacity by December. Speaking on television to a panel of journalists, the minister described the prolonged cuts as one of the gravest problems facing the country. There may be solutions but there can be no miracles, Portal said. He added that there is currently no stable generation of electricity due to a lack of spare parts [aseguramiento material] for the thermoelectric plants. The minister said that 66 percent of the electricity is generated in plants from the former Soviet Union and former Czechoslovakia, which disintegrated, and this led to an interruption in the procurement of spare parts in the past three years. Portal also cited a lack of foreign currency, due to the current economic crisis, among the factors that have worsened the situation in this sector. He reported that $3 million were allocated to the purchase of spare parts for the thermoelectric plants and $7 million to the generation of electricity in 1994. Two small plants will be operational by end of year, one in eastern Cuban and the other near the capital, the minister added. Portal said that limitations in this sector will not impede further implementation of development plans promoted by Cuba to overcome the serious economic problems currently facing it. We have a new and powerful electricity system, he said, after pointing out that most Cuban plants were installed less than 25 years ago. Portal thinks that the use of national petroleum, a heavy crude with high sulfur content, is not the cause for breaks [roturas] at the hydroelectric plants, because its use only causes problems with the gas pipelines. The use of national petroleum will save about $360 million this year. This represents 30 percent of total electricity consumption.
