DATES: Written comments and suggestions must be received no later than May 30, 1994. The final PEIS will be prepared after receipt of public comments. ADDRESSES: Copies of the DPEIS, ``JTF&hyph;6 Activities Along the U.S./Mexico Border (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California),'' are available upon written request to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, CESWF&hyph;PL&hyph;RE, P.O.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Questions regarding the DPEIS should be directed to Mr. Eric Verwers, Environmental Resource Planner, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, CESWF&hyph;PL&hyph;RE, telephone (817) 334&hyph;3246, or P.O. Box 17300, 819 Taylor Street, Fort Worth, Texas 76102&hyph;0300. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Statutory Authority This Notice is being issued to interested parties in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Public Law 91&hyph;190, and Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, 40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508. These Regulations allow for a 45-day comment period from the date the DPEIS is submitted to Environmental Protection Agency and the Notice of availability is published in the Federal Register . That date was April 15, 1994. Background JTF&hyph;6 was activated on November 13, 1989, at Fort Bliss, Texas, by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the President's National Drug Control Strategy. The thrust of this program is the use of Department of Defense training resources in the support of agencies responsible for the fight against illegal drugs. The mission of JTF&hyph;6 is to plan and coordinate military training along the U.S. Southwest Land Border in support of counter-drug activities by Federal, State, and Local LEA's, as requested through Operation Alliance and approved by the Secretary of Defense or a designated representative. The JTF&hyph;6 Program provides operational, engineering, and general support to LEAs operating within the Southwestern United States which have drug interdiction authority and allows the LEAs to conduct their missions more efficiently and effectively. The actions performed by JTF&hyph;6 personnel are quite diverse, ranging from reconnaissance operations to the building and renovation of roads and radio towers. The JTF&hyph;6's primary area of concern is within a 50-mile-wide corridor along the U.S./Mexico Border from Port Arthur, Texas, to San Diego, California. The INS is responsible for the prevention of smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. This is the task of the Border Patrol, which also has been designated the primary law enforcement component responsible for drug interdiction between the U.S. land Ports-of-Entry. Since the Border Patrol has been the primary beneficiary of most JTF&hyph;6 engineering actions to date, INS elected to act as lead agency for the preparation of this DPEIS. The Environmental Protection Agency and JTF&hyph;6 elected to act as cooperating agencies. A Notice of Intent to prepare a PEIS was published on July 15, 1993, in the Federal Register at 58 FR 38140. Purpose The purpose of the DPEIS is to address cumulative environmental impacts of previous actions as well as those actions which may be developed within the reasonably foreseeable future. The DPEIS analyzes these cumulative impacts and generically examines the impacts of future individual actions based on experience with similar past actions. The DPEIS also describes the different types of actions performed by JTF&hyph;6. Proposed Action Based on performance accomplishments, INS wishes to have JTF&hyph;6 continue to provide the support services to the LEA's at the same or similar levels that have occurred since November 1989. The support services provided by JTF&hyph;6 to the LEA's are characterized as operational, engineering, and general. This proposed action complies with the National Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510, as amended) and the President's National Drug Control Strategy, in accordance with Section 1005 of the Anti Drug Abuse Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690). Continuation of the JTF&hyph;6 Program is INS' preferred alternative. Alternatives 1. No action, which essentially is a discontinuation of the JTF&hyph;6 support services to the LEA's. 2. To continue the JTF&hyph;6 Program without the engineering support services, which is the support category that has greatest potential for environmental impacts. Dated: May 12, 1994. Doris Meissner, Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12156 Filed 5&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;10&hyph;M
