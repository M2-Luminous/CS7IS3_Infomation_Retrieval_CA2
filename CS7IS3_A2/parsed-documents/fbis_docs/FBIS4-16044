The head of the Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem Vyakhirev, said following talks here with an Ukrainian delegation that Kiev would pay 600 million dollars by June. Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev would privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the newly-privatised companies. Details of the plan have yet to be hammered out and the two sides agreed to establish working groups to determine how the shared ownership would be implemented. "I guarantee deliveries for the summer," Vyakhirev said, adding: "We'll have to wait and see what happens for this winter." Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas deliveries, and the dispute forced Moscow to drastically cut the gas flow to Ukraine in March. Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines would allow it to better control deliveries to its European clients including France, Italy and Germany.
