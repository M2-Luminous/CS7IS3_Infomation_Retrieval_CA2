Regarding the settlements, he said everything depends on how the Israelis and the Palestinians handle this issue, which is more difficult and complicated now than it used to be when the Camp David Accords were signed. As to Jerusalem, the president emphasized its special status among the adherents of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism all of whom attach a sacred character to the city. These remarks came in an interview conducted by the well-known television commentator Dan Rather and broadcast by CBS Television early today. In response to a question, President Mubarak said that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat wishes to go to Jericho but is delaying the trip until the funds he promised the Palestinians become available because it will be difficult for him to go there "empty-handed." President Mubarak emphatically denied any prospect of Egypt's becoming "another Iran." He declared: "Egypt cannot turn into an Iran or any other country. It is an ancient country with very deep roots and a 7,000-year old civilization." He added: "We are able to confront terrorist acts in this country." Concerning the greatest current threat to the peace operation, President Mubarak said: "The main obstacle is the settlements and how the Palestinians and Israelis handle this issue." Asked if that is the primary problem, President Mubarak said: "Yes. I remember that there were 48 small settlements when the Camp David Accords were signed. Now there are 180 settlements and this makes the problem much more difficult and complicated than ever before. Also, there is the Jerusalem issue which is a sacred place for Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews." On whether he doubts Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will go to Jericho this month, his excellency replied: "I recently heard that he is ready to go but is postponing the trip until the aid funds become available. I believe he wishes to go but if he arrives there empty-handed, it will be a very difficult matter for his people to accept." Asked if Yasir 'Arafat will able to govern after a life of armed struggle, President Mubarak said: "Let's be realistic. 'Arafat is facing tremendous difficulties but he is the best man for this mission now. I know him very well." In answer to a question about whether Yasir 'Arafat can do what Nelson Mandela did in South Africa, namely forgive, President Mubarak said: "I believe that 'Arafat is willing to forgive. They can unite and cooperate for the good of the people." On whether he thinks it is time to reduce the economic sanctions on Iraq, although President Saddam Husayn is still in power, President Mubarak remarked: "It is a problem. We sympathize with the suffering Iraqi nation but not with Saddam Husayn himself." In answer to a question on whether he favors selling Iraqi oil on the international market at this time, his excellency said: "If it is for the people's good and if the revenue from such sales can be controlled and used to bring prosperity to the people, then I agree." Asked if Iran poses a major threat to regional peace and security, President Mubarak said: "The Iranians are dead set against the peace process." Regarding the possibility that Egypt might turn into another Iran, President Mubarak said: "Egypt will never be another Iran or any other country. Egypt is a country with a long history and a 7,000-year civilization. We are quite able to confront terrorist acts in this country."
