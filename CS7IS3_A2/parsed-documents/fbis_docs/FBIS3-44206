Clashes between opposing factions have been going on in Maseru for almost two weeks, since one section demanded a big pay increase, but there are those who think it might have been an incipient plot against the government of Ntsu Mokhehle. The leaders decided to set up a task force to look into actions such as sending a detachment of peace-keeping troops to Lesotho, but the Lesotho opposition BNP [Basotho National Party] has been quick to issue a statement objecting. On the line to Maseru, Robin White asked the BNP leader, Evaristus Sekhonyana, what messages they will be sending to Botswana and Zimbabwe. [Begin recording] [Sekhonyana] We have said very, very clearly: We may not have the power to stop those who want to intervene in the country. We have said it, but we have said that, were they to be tempted with this intervention, they honestly would be doing so against a unified political impression of the entire nation. This is our bidding. We have equally said that there are actions....[pauses] You know, this nation--unfortunately--may be small, but it is a nation of very proud people. They have not exhausted their local remedies, and we have said that, you know, the action of intervening at this stage before the local remedies have been exhausted will be considered by Basotho, the sovereign Lesotho, as a naked interference--and in fact a very strong word we are using--as a rape against our nationhood, a desecration of our constitution and its highest institutions, and a contempt upon his majesty. [White] But isn't it pretty obvious that local solutions have failed? [Sekhonyana] No. Only today, the secretary general of the Commonwealth is starting his initiative, and we just don't understand how the secretary general of the Commonwealth can begin his initiative today. The heads of churches, the political leaders, the nongovernmental organizations have all been united today in saying that local remedies have not been exhausted. And only today, the Commonwealth secretary general started this initiative. And somehow, in another capital, a decision has been taken to intervene militarily. We humbly request they rethink. [White] If they were to come, what would you and your supporters do? [Sekhonyana] There is nothing. What do you do against a military intervention? But all I am sure is that Basotho will not welcome it. That is one thing I am sure of. It may help the government if the government feels that it is going to be a helpful solution, but it is definitely not to become a welcome mission by Basotho. [White] Mr. Sekhonyana, inspite of your denials, the feeling persisted in some way these soldiers who are rebelling are supporters of your party. [Sekhonyana] Well, I really do not know, because, you know, this was concocted by the government and it is utter rubbish. [White] I know you say it has got nothing to do with you, but what is your message to these rebel soldiers? [Sekhonyana] The message we are making is that we are pleading with both sides in the Army. We are pleading. We join our comrades in other parties. We join the churches. We join the nongovernmental organizations. Today, the wives of the soldiers made a pleading: For heaven's sake, why do you play into the hands of those who have got bad designs on you? For heaven's sake stop fighting, lay down your arms, go under the structured command. This is the plea. This is the request of us in the entire nation. [end recording]
