ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes new requirements for the registration of designated fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) as authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The registration requirements are organized within a three- tier structure. Tier 1 requires F/FA manufacturers to perform a literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide qualitative exposure information. Tier 2 requires biological testing for the examination of subchronic systemic and organ toxicity, as well as the assessment of specific health effects endpoints. When necessary, Tier 3, which includes follow-up studies or other additional tests, may be required. The rule permits adequate existing test data to be submitted in lieu of conducting new duplicative tests. It also includes special provisions for small businesses and certain types of products, and a grouping system which permits manufacturers of similar F/FA products to share the costs of compliance. DATES: This regulation is effective May 27, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 27, 1994. The information collection requirements contained in 40 CFR 79.51, 79.52, and 79.57 through 79.68 have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and are not effective until OMB has approved them. EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval of the information collection requirements.
