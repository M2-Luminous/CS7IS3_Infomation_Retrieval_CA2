In your opinion, what were the results of the congress? [Ortega] Considering that the FSLN is the nation's largest party, I believe the greatest result was that the congress ended without the party being divided. Nevertheless, Sandinism has not completely escaped the great political, economic, and social polarization effecting all social strata of the nation. [Alvarez] Many say that Sandinism still has not managed to find its identity. It seems unable to adapt to its role as an opposition party and does not find a definite ideological course. Where is the FSLN really headed? [Ortega] The FSLN, as well as all parties in Nicaragua, must face the future to adjust to current world demands, which means analyzing reality by casting aside all those rigid ideological schemes and orthodox leanings. [Alvarez] But is not just the opposite happening through a strong orthodox hegemony following the last Sandinist Congress? [Ortega] I know Sandinism very well, and I can tell you that both opposing currents have among their membership representatives from both trends. Neither side is very rigid or defined. In this sense there are more or less two orthodox points of view, but what is most important is not that heretics should become Christians or that Christians become heretics. It is important that both heretics and Christians agree with what is best for the country. [Alvarez] To what degree will the Sandinist electoral future be affected, especially in light of the 1996 elections, taking into account its growing polarization? [Ortega] To my way of thinking, the problem is not winning the 1996 elections. Why does a party want to win the elections if it is going to rule amid greater poverty, more disaster, and if there is no true way out and no true consensus? This country is going to be ungovernable. What is truly needed is that whoever wins should structure a government of true national unity. [Alvarez] What role will you play within the FSLN once you leave the Army next year? [Alvarez] No, I will not rejoin the FSLN. I believe I already played an historic role in the party. I am now playing another historic role as the head of a handful of revolutionary men like myself. We are giving Nicaragua an Army totally unconnected with the FSLN or any other political force. I will dedicate myself to a very special activity by contributing to bring Nicaraguans closer through my experience, my point of view, and the degree of authority I have. I will not return to the FSLN, but I will always be a Sandinist. I have been making a concerted effort with Pablo Antonio Cuadra, an outstanding conservative intellectual, and with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. For six months, we have been working together to seek concrete solutions to specific problems. [Alvarez] If representatives from various groups reach a consensus on this project to seek national conciliation, would you be willing to lead a new political group? [Ortega] The core of the matter is that the nation's most important forces must reach a basic agreement, because, if the current situation continues, the big winner in the 1996 elections will be absenteeism and frustration. The creation of a movement is feasible when several existing parties and other leaders who do not belong to any party can be incorporated. I do not want to spearhead this movement, but I would like to take part in it. We will see whether in this effort there is a need for some to go one way and others the other way, and if one has the desire to participate in this. [Alvarez] In your eagerness to seek political consensus, could the FSLN pass you a bill for your flexible position with Violeta Chamorro's government? [Ortega] I already have paid a political price with regard to the militant Sandinist sector. Nevertheless, I did what I had to do, and I have received the approval of many other citizens. I am convinced that it is even more important to save Nicaragua than to save the FSLN. The people now understand that polarized, confronted, or divided, all we produce is poverty. [Alvarez] It is no secret that you and your brother Daniel Ortega currently have very large differences in your political concepts. To what do you attribute this distancing between the two of you? [Ortega] I am currently in a very difficult situation, because I have against me the Sandinist leaders of the two political currents. I am criticized because a process of hegemonism still prevails, and maybe the moderates believe that I can compete with them in this area. On the other side of the fence, they know that by my leaving the Army before the elections I might compete for the FSLN party leadership. [Alvarez] Could we say that the differences between you and Daniel Ortega boil down to fact that he wants to maintain the party leadership at all costs? [Ortega] Every leader undoubtedly wants to be in control of his movement. It has fallen upon Daniel to lead the most needy sectors. By working and sharing every day with the most resentful groups -- people who expected greater benefits from the government and yet did not obtain them -- his feelings have hardened. He cannot exercise his leadership through conciliatory positions, because the people who have fallen into despair because of their economic situation do not understand any other position. I, however, am playing the institutional role. I am seeking to leave the nation's Army removed from any political party. [Alvarez] You now speak of conciliatory positions, but your refusal to leave the Army was one of the causes that produced greater confrontation and instability in Nicaragua. How can you explain this? [Ortega] What is most important here is that we reached an agreement with Violeta Chamorro's government, and we are all happy to have reached a consensus on this issue. [Alvarez] But, could this have been reached earlier, thereby avoiding confrontation? [Ortega] The problem is that this matter cannot be assessed in terms of individuals. I could not leave without having the Military Law approved. I have played a leading role in the Army, considering the lack of a more specific law. If the Military Law's approval is obtained at the Legislative Assembly, the Army will not function so much in terms of individuals. Instead, it will be ruled on institutional grounds. I could not leave under the conditions that prevailed last year, because I was not ready at that time, and also because I was subjected to a series of events that were not the most tasteful. [Alvarez] Do you believe that Major General Joaquin Cuadra, who has been mentioned as your possible successor, will continue the work you initiated in the Army as you have planned it? [Ortega] I believe he can, because it is not a matter of placing one man in charge of this task. No matter who is at the helm, he will continue the work within an institutional framework and within a very specific timeframe -- that is, five years. It is no longer a matter that he be another Humberto Ortega. Instead, he will sail on another course.
