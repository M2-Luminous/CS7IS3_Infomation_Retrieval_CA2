So there may not be anything new in this article. Still, I will try to highlight some of the points of that discussion. We will observe that the Mother of Battles began essentially as an economic aggression manifested by an undeclared embargo on several commodities and technologies. They then plotted against the oil prices in a deliberate attempt to reduce Iraq's revenues when it was in dire need of foreign currencies. This was accompanied by a conspiracy against the value of the Iraqi currency. Needless to say, the first to point out that these measures constituted a real war against us was our leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him, at the Baghdad Arab summit. After the war and its outcome, the West, led by the United States, persisted, in harmony with Zionist aims, to use different excuses to prolong the blockade in the hope of achieving by economic war what they could not achieve by force of arms. With this simple introduction, I now go straight to the topic and propose the following: 1. We should declare that trade with any country wishing to deal with Iraq after the removal of the blockade will not be a favor to Iraq, or a friendly or fraternal stand, but a fait accompli stand. 2. Thus, our dialogue with the big powers and neighboring states should follow two courses: First, the course of intimidation, which, in short, means that there will be no special relationship, trade benefits, priority in debt payments, preference in oil supply, commodity and expertise exports to Iraq, or job opportunities for companies with regard to any country not currently adopting a just and equitable stand. Second, the course of temptation, which means that every country that says it has changed its attitude about Iraq and is actually endeavoring in international forums -- by word, action, and stand --to lift the blockade, will enjoy most favored nation rights regarding oil supply, and possibly with regard to preferential prices and debt payments. It will also benefit from an Iraqi market that hungers for foreign commodities, and in the opportunities given to foreign companies. We could, in this regard, sign immediate agreements. 3. Since hostile circles are now diverting the blockade from diplomatic and media attention in order to clamp a blackout on this exposed crime and to prevent the formation of supporting public opinion, nationalist forces, social figures, professional organizations, and men of religion who took part in the popular forces conferences and the Islamic conference in Baghdad should take action in two directions: First, form a public pressure group against the aggressors in support of Iraq by all available means, including pulpits, statements, demonstrations, declarations, solidarity strikes for several hours, fasting for a whole day or part of a day, roundtable discussions, and news conferences. Otherwise, there is little use in resolutions issued in Baghdad and then shelved here and forgotten there. Second, use these methods in calling for the boycott of American goods and interests in the Arab and Islamic states. I believe such calls will find a response even among our people in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf states. 4. The enemies are betting that the phenomenon of the rising price spiral that some merchants cause from time to time will exhaust people's patience, deepen their concern, and destroy their morale. All I am asking is for these elements, whether they are individuals or groups, to be singled out and punished on the basis of the revolutionary code of fairness in punishment and reward. Leaving matters unattended has given these elements the opportunity to continue their despicable behavior in defiance of the people and the revolution. 5. These proposals require active support on the diplomatic, media, party, and professional levels. We know decisionmakers at all these levels are truly strong and competent, and the outsiders have weak excuses. Therefore, until the blockade is lifted, we should choose elements with a high sense of responsibility and on the basis of competence and sincerity, not favoritism. Finally, these proposals may not be the right ones, but they are suitable as a basis for discussion.
