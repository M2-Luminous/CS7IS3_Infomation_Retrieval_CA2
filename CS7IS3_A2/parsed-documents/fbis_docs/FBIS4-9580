A LIDOVE NOVINY reporter has found out that he should stay in the West-Club in Bratislava's Kamzik Restaurant as a private person. Staff from the West-Club confirmed this information to LIDOVE NOVINY. They added that the Russian ultranationalist will probably be in Bratislava for two days, but his program is not known. It is clear from another source that the owner of the West-Club invited Zhirinovskiy to make the private visit. Last week, representatives from the extraparliamentary Liberal Party protested against Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming visit. Zhirinovskiy was originally supposed to come to Slovakia in April. He apologized later, saying he was "too busy." Liberal Party Executive Secretary Pavol Weiss met last week with Slovak National Party (SNS) First Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar in one of Bratislava's cafes. The meeting, which had been instigated by the SNS representative, ended in a physical incident. According to P. Weiss, Molnar, who recently took part in the "Pan-Slavic congress" organized by Zhirinovskiy's party in Moscow, tried to convince him of the need for a "Pan-Slavic union," in which Slovakia would cease to exist, and of the need for a party like V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party. According to the liberals, Molnar even said frankly to Weiss that the Slovaks "will lick the boots of Russian soldiers." P. Weiss ended the conversation by physically assaulting Molnar in front of witnesses. In the meantime, the liberals have submitted a request to the Interior Ministry asking it not to allow Zhirinovskiy to visit Slovakia.
