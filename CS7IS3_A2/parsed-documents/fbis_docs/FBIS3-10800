Rather than talking about "continuity," however, the new administration is announcing "new times", innovations and new initiatives. [passage omitted] Interior Minister German Correa, from the Socialist Party, has announced that in the speech Frei will make today "he will outline the key objectives of his administration." One of the main differences between Aylwin and Frei, a militant Christian Democrat just like his predecessor, is that the Frei has appointed a Socialist as interior minister and chief of cabinet. Correa will also play the role of vice president whenever President Frei travels abroad. [passsage omitted] Yet another difference between Aylwin and Frei is that the latter did not ask or receive suggestions from political parties that make up the government coalition for the appointment of ministers, under secretaries and other government officials. This attitude displeased several people, even some members of the Christian Democratic Party, the largest component of the ruling coalition. Today's presidential agenda includes several bilateral meetings with visiting dignitaries, beginning with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. Later on Frei will meet with Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares. The meetings will continue throughout the afternoon and at the end of the day there will be a rally at Plaza Constitucion, right in front of La Moneda Palace. On this occasion President Frei will make a speech in which he will outline the objectives of his 6-year term in office. [Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional in Spanish at 1259 GMT on 12 March reports that "at 1115 local time (1415 GMT) President Frei will briefly attend a reception at the Santiago City Hall and will begin his meetings with foreign dignitaries at 1130 local time. The formal reception that President Frei will offer to special guests at Plaza Constitucion will last from 2030 to 2300 local time."]
