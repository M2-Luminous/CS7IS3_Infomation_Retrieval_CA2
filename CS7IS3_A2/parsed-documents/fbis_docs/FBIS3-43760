Now, there are reports of a new massive invasion of Angola by powerfully equipped Cuban soldiers who are already in Luanda, under the cover of civil servants and businessmen. Eduardo dos Santos counts on these soldiers to carry out its military adventures against UNITA-controlled areas in northern, northeastern, and central Angola. This is a clear violation of the New York Accords of December 1988, under which all Cuban soldiers should leave Angola by May 1991, within the framework of the independence of Namibia. What is more, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Luanda yesterday [as heard]. According to the Futungo de Belas Palace, he is in Luanda to strengthen historical relations of friendship and solidarity between Cuba and Angola and discuss the possibility of strengthening relations in various fields, including exchanging information. The Havana government invaded Angola in 1975 and imposed on the Angolan people the Communist and dictatorial government of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party. Accordingly, the visit to Angola by Roberto Robaina is simply aimed at inspecting the return of Cuban soldiers to Angola to bring more deaths to the martyred Angolan people.
