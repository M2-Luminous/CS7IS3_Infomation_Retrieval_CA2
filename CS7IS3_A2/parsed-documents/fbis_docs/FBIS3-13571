Our informed sources in Baghdad say that tyrant Saddam has retired more Army officers, who will be on their way to disappearing from the scene forever. The source said that the following officers have been retired: 1. Brigadier General Baha al-Din Sami; 2. Brigadier General Malik al-Juburi from the Republican Guard; 3. Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Rahman from the second police force [al-shurtah al-thaniyah]; 4. Colonel Husam 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-'Ubaydi from the Republican Guard; 5. Staff Colonel Nazim Saddam al-Rubay'i from the 2d Tank Battalion. A few days ago, the special security forces launched a large-scale arrest campaign among Army officers because the criminal regime suspects they had secret contacts with groups and cells of officers working to topple the Saddamist regime. The campaign concentrated on officers from Baghdad city and the Mosul governorate.
