The Petroleum Council, an advisory body to the trade minister, held the first meeting of its subcommittee in charge of studying basic problems in the nation's oil policy. The meeting is designed to infuse efficiency and competitiveness into the oil industry amid a growing call for deregulation in the industry and a shrinkage in a petroleum product price gap between Japan and overseas, said an official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The panel will map out an interim report in the middle of June in line with recommendations in a report prepared last year by the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, an advisory organ to the prime minister, the official said. The report said rules and regulations in the oil industry should be reduced to "the minimum level necessary."
