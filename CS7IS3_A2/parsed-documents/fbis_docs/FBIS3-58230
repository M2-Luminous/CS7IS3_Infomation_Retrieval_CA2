We continue to believe that the conflict in Bosnia must be settled at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield. Only the parties can bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. Only they can agree to lay down their arms and end the violence which for these many months has only served to demonstrate that no side can prevail in its pursuit of military victory. - ...We reaffirm our determination to contribute to the implementation of a viable settlement reached in good faith. - We denounce the violations by the parties of the agreements they have already signed to implement a cease-fire and to permit the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this terrible conflict. This situation cannot be tolerated. We urge all the parties to respect their agreements. We are determined to eliminate obstacles to the accomplishment of the UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia) mandate. We will continue operations to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Bosnia. We call for the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions regarding the reinforcement of UNPROFOR. We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the UN Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
