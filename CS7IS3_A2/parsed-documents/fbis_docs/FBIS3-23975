In its characteristics March is still closer to the winter months than to spring. This is indicated both by the negative radiation balance (the difference between sun's radiation and the earth's surface and the atmosphere's own radiation) and the negative values of the average air temperature measured over many years on the greater part of the European territory of Russia and West and East Siberia. However, as compared to February, in March the temperature begins to rise quickly. Therefore, on the entire territory of Russia (with the exception of the shores of Arctic seas) March is four to 12 degrees warmer than February.
