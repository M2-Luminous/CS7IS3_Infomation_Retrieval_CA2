FBIS4-8732 "dreeu074_i_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Events in Gorazde -- 15 April Events in Gorazde -- 15 April Siladzic: UNPROFOR Not Protecting Anyone LD1604001394 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 2300 GMT 15 Apr 94 LD1604001394 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic made a special statement about the dramatic situation in Gorazde for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television. [Begin Silajdzic recording] The problem lies in the fact that they wished they knew how to impose an embargo, but do not know and are refusing to defend us. In other words -- neither will you defend yourselves nor will you be able to because we will not let you. This is the death sentence pronounced over Bosnia-Herzegovina by the international community. We shall adamantly insist on this issue these days. Why? Why is UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] here? UNPROFOR means the UN Protection Forces, that is what UNPROFOR stands for. Therefore, a protection force. And who are they protecting? That is an entirely different question. They are not protecting the safe havens, they are not even protecting themselves. They are not capable of protecting anybody or of bringing order to this part of the world. The question arises -- Why are they here? Furthermore, we have heard that there were many casualties today, that Gorazde is exposed to heavy artillery and tank attacks. We hold the top-ranking UN officials directly responsible for the deaths of not only these people in Gorazde but for the deaths of 200,000 people. The Security Council had voted for an embargo on arms sales to Bosnia-Herzegovina yet does not know how to protect it. We are asking ourselves why the chetnik offensive on Gorazde -- which has been going on for more than two weeks now -- was not checked by air strikes as prescribed by Resolutions 824 and 836. What was done was done in such a way to in fact encourage those beasts up there on those hills, they were encouraged more than impressed after losing one or two tanks. We have fighters who destroyed 10 or 12 tanks each. Therefore, neither were our fighters impressed nor those beasts. All that was to no avail. Unfortunately, the situation is such that UN Envoy Yasushi Akashi is expected to arrive any moment from Pale. I really do not know why he went there -- everything is clear. What more do they have to do to be treated the way they should be treated -- as beasts and not as some side in the conflict. They killed 200,000 innocent people, they destroyed a country, they violated every human law imaginable -- not only UN laws but human laws -- what else should they do? They attacked UNPROFOR, they attacked them in Tuzla. After their generals said they would collect children in coffins, what else are they supposed to do so someone would react? Unfortunately, I must tell you that I received a letter from Mr. Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, in which -- believe it or not -- he calls on the sides in Bosnia to refrain from any actions. I have this letter here in my pocket. He is in fact calling on us to refrain from any kind of action. And this at a moment when Gorazde is bleeding, when Brcko is bleeding, when Bihac is bleeding. Incredible but true -- our people should know who we are dealing with. [end recording]
