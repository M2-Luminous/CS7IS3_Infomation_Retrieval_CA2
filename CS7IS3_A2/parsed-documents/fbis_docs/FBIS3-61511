Proliferation of T lymphocytes was activated with all these doses. With the two lower doses there was accumulation mostly of the T helper type and with the highest dose, of the N suppressor type. In some cases mice were exposed to x-rays in single doses of 0.25-1.0 Gy. Changes in antibody production, relative weight and cellularity of the thymus and spleen, T lymphocyte content of peripheral blood and spleen, subpopulations of T lymphocytes in the spleen, ratio of Lyt1[.sup]+[/]/Lyt2[.sup]+[/] cells in peripheral blood and spleen. Labeled monoclonal antibodies and phenotypic markers, immunization with ram erythrocytes, lymphocyte cultures, [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine uptake and other methods were used to test humoral immunity, hemolysin and hemagglutinin titers, proliferative activity of splenocytes, blast formation and radioactivity of samples, at different post-exposure times. With lower doses there was activation of some immunological effector functions and with higher ones they were inhibited. The demonstrated proliferation of lymphoid cells, including suppressors, as the dosage of ionizing radiation builds up in the case of prolonged exposure to low levels thereof, triggers autonomous control attenuating the induced increase in lymphocytes and inhibiting effector manifestations of immunity. More precise interpretation of immunological responses of humans who had been in the zone of the Chernobyl accident or other contaminated regions is recommended, since use of immunostimulants is not only inadvisable, but even harmful in such cases.
