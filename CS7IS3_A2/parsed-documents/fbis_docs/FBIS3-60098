The hashish, which was brought in from Russia, was sold in nearby Helsinki. About 1.5 kg were seized in the arrest. The main figure in the hashish ring is thought to be Keijo Changklung (formerly Saira), who was sentenced to a prison term of 32 months for selling 7.5 kg. He will have no chance of early parole. Petri Niemela received a sentence of 26 months for having purchased 3.2 kg of the substance from Changklung, and another 2.7 kg directly from Russia. Previously sentenced in the case was Kari-Pekka Diomin, who bought 2.5 kg of hashish from Changklung. Diomin was sentenced to a year in prison, with no possibility of parole. The Russian-born Israeli citizen Gay Dagan received a one-year prison term, with possibility of parole, for having distributed a shipment of drugs received from a Russian citizen. The East Uusimaa Area Investigation Unit, which is headquartered in Vantaa, handled the case, since it was the first to learn of the drug selling activity. The drugs were sold in nearby areas of Helsinki, i.e., in the Martina Restaurant on Hameetie and in the Cafe Miina in Hakaniemi. Those convicted were also ordered to pay damages to the state amounting to a total of 70,000 markkas.
