FR940407-0-00078 FR940407-0-00014 Comments were received from an environmental group in support of an alternative view outlined in the proposal. The alternative view is that any savings in compliance costs resulting from discretionary EIP's (relative to nonincentive-based programs) should be shared between two accounts: the regulated sources should retain only as much savings as is sufficient to maintain the incentive to participate in the EIP, with the remainder of the savings being used by the State to reach attainment more quickly than would be practicable under a nonincentive-based plan. This alternative view is based on the statutory requirement that States should attain the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable. In contrast, other commenters from State and local agencies, industry, and a joint environmental/industry work group agreed with the proposal that the EPA should not require discretionary EIP's to achieve more rapid progress than other regulations. A joint environmental/industry work group emphasized that EIP's should be designed to increase flexibility and cost effectiveness, and should not be held to any stricter standard than traditional programs. Several industry commenters felt that requiring more rapid progress towards attainment in exchange for a more flexible program appears to be a penalty provision. These commenters felt that, while EIP's should be structured to produce reductions equivalent to traditional SIP rules that the EIP's replace, the addition of further reductions as the price for entry into an EIP will discourage participation and reduce benefits that might otherwise result from broad participation. A State agency disagreed with requiring greater emission reductions from discretionary EIP's since different types of environmental benefits can be achieved by EIP's, such as technological innovation, more available capital for other control measures, conservation of natural resources, and increased commitment from the regulated sources. Another State agency believes that EIP's which replace traditional SIP requirements should be equally effective, equitable, and enforceable as the program it replaces. The final rules take into account the broad array of benefits that can result from the use of discretionary EIP's, the statutory requirement for expeditious attainment, and the fact that EIP's are relatively new and controversial in principle as well as in practice. Further, current experience with EIP's makes clear that successful adoption and implementation of EIP's requires some degree of consensus among the interested groups that both the regulated entities and the environment will benefit from such programs. Thus, the final rules and guidance establish as a goal for all EIP's that they be designed to benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. In so doing, the final rules and guidance require States to meet this benefits sharing goal, while providing flexibility to the States to determine how best to do so. As a result, EIP's will increase flexibility, lower the cost of attaining and maintaining the NAAQS, and provide stronger incentives for the development and implementation of pollution prevention measures and innovative technologies. Benefits from discretionary EIP's can be defined in various terms, as discussed in paragraph III.D.1. While the EPA encourages that discretionary EIP's be designed to produce environmental benefits directly, through increased or more rapid emissions reductions, States should consider these and other benefits in designing a program to meet the goal of sharing benefits between the regulated entities and the environment. In many cases, benefits in terms of cost savings will not be quantifiable prior to program implementation, due to the complex market decisions that sources participating in an EIP will need to make and changes in market conditions during the course of the program. Thus, the final rules and guidance include analysis of control cost savings, to the extent practicable, as a part of the required program audit. However, the difficulty of quantifying cost savings and the extent to which those cost savings constitute an incentive to trade leads the EPA to conclude that it is not practicable to require that all EIP's discount trades or otherwise require increased or more rapid emissions reductions that directly benefit the environment. The authorization for discretionary EIP's in sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) may be interpreted to indicate Congress' view that such programs may help achieve emissions reductions more effectively or efficiently, but not necessarily more expeditiously, than traditional regulatory requirements.
