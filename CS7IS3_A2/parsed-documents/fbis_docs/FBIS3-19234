Last Wednesday's edition [9 March] of the British daily reported that the Belgian prime minister is Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand's preferred candidate to replace Jacques Delors. This cannot be verified. Dehaene is surprised, but it is not impossible that his name is being considered without his knowledge. This kind of appointment, which is settled by the heads of state and government of the Twelve, is very insidious. There are those who can be encouraged to become candidates. And there are also jobs which you do not refuse. Jean-Luc Dehaene owes his experience on the European political scene to the term of the Belgian EU presidency. With his rough manners, he was not an obvious candidate to impress anyone. But, situation after situation the Belgian prime minister succeeded in demonstrating his ability to solve crisis situations. President Mitterrand in particular is indebted to him for having settled the differences between Paris and Brussels on the site of the European Parliament. To consequently conclude that he is the Paris candidate, however, would be rather hasty. He is no doubt preferred by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, who would like to squash at the earliest opportunity the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, a British conservative who is campaigning as European commissioner. There will be much speculation until the European summit in Corfu 24-25 June. In the meantime, why not support the candidacy of a Belgian as head of the European Commission, even if it does mean denying ourselves his services? It is true that the Belgian domestic situation has worsened and that Jean-Luc Dehaene brings a certain cohesion and stability. But if we are forced to conclude that there is nobody in Belgian politics to replace him, we must then also ask ourselves what exactly Belgium would be losing, as it would greatly benefit from having a Belgian as president of the European Commission.
