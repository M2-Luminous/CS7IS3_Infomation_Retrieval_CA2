Isabel Allende, acting foreign minister of Cuba, says there has been no progress in relations, even during President Clinton's era. Allende is critical of the United States for politicizing Cuban immigration, saying that Cuba has launched a program seeking to expand Cuba's foreign political relations. Antti Halinen met the acting Cuban foreign minister in Havana. [Halinen] No progress can be seen in the relations between the United States and Cuba, says acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende very curtly. We waited to see what the Clinton administration would do, but reality remains precisely the same, only the political form is slightly softer, Allende says. She refers to Clinton's recent meeting with some Cubans of Miami at which the president promised to continue the trade and economic embargo against Cuba. Progress has not been made in other sectors either, even though Cuba has announced that it is prepared to normalize its relations with the United States. But if one wants to normalize relations, one cannot, of course, maintain a trade embargo, Allende points out. Allende accuses the United States of manipulating and politicizing Cuba's emigrant and refugee affairs, which has not happened to any other Latin American country. On the basis of the treaty of 1984, the United States could grant as many as 20,000 visas to Cubans a year. According to Allende, just over 1,000 Cubans were granted a visa last year. Allende says the United States is using the matter to its political advantage. Visa applications are rejected, but at the same time the country receives all those who have left Cuba illegally. The Haitians' boats are turned back, but Cuban ferry people are granted a residence permit immediately. In Allende's view, much is spoken and written about these Cubans in Europe too, unlike for instance the Mexicans, the so-called wet backs, who seek to enter the United States illegally. The name wet back comes from the fact that when crossing the border river, the Mexicans get wet. According to acting Foreign Minister Allende, the Cuban Government is prepared to improve relations between Cubans, but it presupposes one thing from its interlocutors: Opposition to the U.S. anti-Cuban policy and recognition of Cuba's sovereignty. At a recent meeting in Havana, some tangible results were achieved but it is still difficult to get close, Allende admits. She cites an example. A Cuban lawyer, who attended the meeting, a U.S. citizen and member of the Democratic Party, at the final meeting thanked Fidel Castro for the conference and kissed him on the cheek. Back home in Miami, abuse and murder threats awaited the lawyer and her children, and the lawyer's car was smashed to pieces. [Announcer] The acting Cuban Foreign Minister Isabel Allende is not the famous Chilean writer, nor is she the daughter of the former president of Chile, with whom she is often confused on account of her name.
