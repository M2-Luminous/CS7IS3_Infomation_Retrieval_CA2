Ion exchange resins used in nuclear power plant core water purification systems in the past have had a low maximum temperature for use of 60�C, so it has been necessary to cool the 280�C core water down to about 50�C to purify it, which results in a large loss of heat. Researchers succeeded in synthesizing a strongly basic ion exchange resin with superb heat resistance by inserting alkyl spacer groups with three or more carbons between a styrene-divinyl benzene resin matrix and quaternary ammonium groups to separate them from each other. The effectiveness of this resin was confirmed in practical evaluative tests, and the researchers plan to proceed with development toward the establishment of an industrial manufacturing process in the future. First researchers synthesized an ion exchange resin that has alkyl chains with different numbers of carbons by performing suspension polymerization of a styrene derivative containing alkyl spacer groups with divinyl benzene. Then they compared the survival rate of quaternary ammonium groups after exposure to 100�C temperatures for one month. In previous resins, the survival rate for quaternary ammonium groups (with single carbon atoms) lies in the 60% range, but when the number of carbons is increased to three or more, the survival rate jumps to 80% or higher, which is a clear improvement in heat resistance. Researchers also confirmed that the thermal decomposition mechanism is different from that of previous resins. The researchers also performed practical evaluative tests on the resin with four carbon atoms (C[.sup]4[/] resin). When they packed a column heated to 95�C with 400 mL [sic] of resin and studied the loss in exchange quantity capability at a flow rate corresponding to 100 L/hour, the current strongly basic ion exchange resin (Mitsubishi Kasei brand Daiyaion [phonetic] SA10A) retained only 80% of its exchange capability after 15 days and dropped to 70% after one month. However, the C[.sup]4[/] resin retained 89% of its exchange capability after one month. When they tested the resin's silica adsorption performance at 95�C, there was a slight amount of leakage with the initial water flow, but after steady state was achieved, the silica concentration values fell below the minimum required for analytical determination. Nuclear power plants need more compact equipment, and if this resin enables core water to be purified at a higher temperature, it will lead to simpler heat exchangers. Researchers at both companies plan to perform evaluative tests in the future and work toward establishing an industrial manufacturing method.
