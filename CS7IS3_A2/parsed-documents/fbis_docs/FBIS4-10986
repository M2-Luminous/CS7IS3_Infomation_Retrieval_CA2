According to the source questioned by AFP, the head of state participated as scheduled in an "official function" on Tuesday [19 April] night. Nevertheless, rumors apparently started by a Florida radio station spread in several Latin American countries, claiming Fidel Castro had been the victim of an attack or had been hospitalized in the CIMEQ [expansion unknown] -- one of the best hospitals in Havana. In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman announced the United States had no information that enabled it to confirm or deny any version of the story, and he noted there was no "indication" of a change in the situation in Cuba. In fact, the situation was completely normal on Wednesday in Havana, where most Foreign Ministry officials were preparing for a conference which, from Friday to Sunday, will bring together representatives of the Cuban Government and some 200 members of the Cuban community living abroad.
