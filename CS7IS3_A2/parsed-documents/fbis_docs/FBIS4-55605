Such instruments should make the offer of sales of enterprises, banks, and insurance institutions being privatized more attractive. According to Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, the operation should contribute to decreasing the level of public debt: "We cannot tolerate a situation where, as a result of the transformation process, the state will be left without any assets and with a huge public debt," Kolodko stated. At this stage of the initiative, the Finance Ministry refuses to reveal details of the introduction of this new instrument. Dariusz Kostyrka, deputy director of the Public Debt Department at the ministry only reported that the ministry prepares plans for new bond issues every year, after the Budget Law is adopted. This year, there are plans for the following: a one-year issue in June (a prospectus has already been signed), the continuation of previously issued bonds (one is a two-year issue and the other a five-year one), and a three-year issue scheduled for August. The Securities Commission [KPW] has noted with satisfaction the announcement of introducing yet another debt instrument. However, according to KPW Press Spokesman Jacek Jonak, before issuing such bonds, the ministry should consider whether all of the commitments arising out of the second issue have been implemented in accordance with what had been announced. The KPW noted that, despite the creation of a legal framework (an ordinance issued by the finance minister in 1989), there are problems with exchanging bonds for shares. The legal provisions provide that people can pay for State Treasury-owned shares with bonds at a 20-percent discount in relation to the bonds' face value plus interest payments. Civil Rights Spokesman Tadeusz Zielinski has addressed the finance minister and asked him to undertake decisive measures to make the implementation of such operations possible. According to Zielinski, the situation undermines citizens' confidence in the state apparatus. "It is outrageous that, throughout the four years, no proceedings were ever worked out that would enable citizens to implement their claims on the basis of bond ownership," Zielinski stated.
