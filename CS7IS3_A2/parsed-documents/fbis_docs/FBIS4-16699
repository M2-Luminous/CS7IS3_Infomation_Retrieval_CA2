They were the victims of Washington's intransigent anti-Iraqi policy. The two Black Hawk helicopters with U.S., British, French, and Turkish officers from the UN mission on board were flying to a meeting with the Kurdish insurgent leader Salakhaddin when they were shot down in broad daylight by two missiles fired from the two F-15 fighters. [passage omitted] The war against Iraq ended in 1991, but Washington's policy toward Iraq remains warlike in tone and is marked by an unconcealed hostility toward Baghdad. It is patently obvious that the U.S. airmen, who were monitoring the safe haven in northern Iraq which was created soon after the Persian Gulf campaign to prevent Iraqi air raids on Kurdish camps, were influenced by the mood of official Washington. It is no coincidence that the Pentagon has issued several orders aimed at "curbing the aggressiveness" of the U.S. airmen serving in the safe havens in south and north Iraq and in Bosnia.
