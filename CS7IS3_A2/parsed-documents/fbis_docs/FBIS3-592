Central Committee spokesman T C Memela said the pre-conditions were those outlined by the IFP last Friday, which included: international mediation in the constitutional deadlock; amending the interim constitution; and, mediation to allow Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to secure the interests of his nation. The Central Coomittee also wanted a rationalisation of the electoral process and timetables to translate constitutional agreements into a fair and free election in which all parties could compete on an equal footing. Mr Memela also said the ball was now in State President F W de Klerk's court to extend the deadlines for registration of parties and submission of candidate lists because he was empowered to do so in terms of the electoral act. He said the Central Committee wanted international mediation to take place to assist in the resolution of constitutional differences and the process of amending the interim constitution. Mediation should also focus on whatever steps King Zwelithini decided to take to secure the interests of the Zulu kingdom. Mr Memela said mediation was necessary on the question of conflict resolution and investigation into criminal violence. The Central Committee, he said, reconfirmed its commitment to pursue the international mediation process with "resolution and urgency". Wednesday night's decision by the IFP is a reaffirmation of its stance adopted ast week after a summit between the party's leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela in Durban. There the IFP said it would provisionally register for the April elections, and participation in the poll would be subject to the success of talks in meeting its pre-conditions.
