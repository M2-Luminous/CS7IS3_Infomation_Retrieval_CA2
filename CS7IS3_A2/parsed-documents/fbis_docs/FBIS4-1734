During the two-hour-odd talks with visiting Australian Foreign Minister Graeth Evans, Qian noted that the volume of Sino-Australian trade reached three billion U.S. dollars last year, registering a 28 percent increase over that of 1992 and hitting the all-time high in history. He said China's economy is developing in a sustained and healthy way and there exists a great potential for furthering bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy and communications. Qian said it is his hope that Australia will soften its terms for transferring technology to China, encourage more Australian businessmen to invest in China so as to further push forward bilateral economic and technological cooperation in the high-tech field. He said that both China and Australia are in the Asian and Pacific region, sharing common interests and responsibility in safeguarding the peace and stability in the region and promoting the economic cooperation there. "Maintaining bilateral friendly cooperation will be a factor for the stability in the region," he said. The Chinese foreign minister said over the past few years, the Sino-Australian ties have grown rapidly, adding that the exchanges between leaders of the two countries have increased and economic cooperation and trade expanded. "The Chinese side is satisfied with the development of its relations with Australia," he said. Evans said that Australia-China relations have been developing rapidly and yielded fruitful results. The Australian people, he said, are pleased to follow the vigorous development of China's economy and they have come to realize that in China there is a very good opportunity for cooperation. Australian enterprises are willing to strengthen cooperation with China, he said. Evans said the Australian Government wants to explore with China new ways to further bilateral cooperation. He reaffirmed that Australia has always supported the restoration of China's status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and hopes that this will be realized before the establishment of the World Trade Organization. Evans said that his country will continue to stick to the "one- China" policy. During the talks, the two foreign ministers also exchanged views on other issues related to bilateral ties and international issues of common concern. After the talks Qian gave a dinner in honor of Evans and his party. The Australian foreign minister arrived here as Qian's guest earlier today. Before coming here, Evans and his party visited Guilin.
