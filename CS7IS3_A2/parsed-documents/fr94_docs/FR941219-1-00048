FR941219-1-00048 FR941219-1-00016 Federal government actions on these four plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975, and included Lasthenia conjugens as threatened; and Navarretia pauciflora (now known as Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora ), Navarretia plieantha (now known as Navarretia leucocephala ssp. plieantha ), and Parvisedum leiocarpum as endangered. The Service published a notice in the July 1, 1975, Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the report of the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (petition provisions are now found in section 4(b)(3) of the Act) and its intention thereby to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. The above four taxa were included in the July 1, 1975, notice. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposal in the Federal Register (42 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication. Navarretia pauciflora and Navarretia plieantha were included in the June 16, 1976, Federal Register document. General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the December 10, 1979, Federal Register (44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal of the June 6, 1976, proposal, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha, and Parvisedum leiocarpum as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. On November 28, 1983, the Service published a supplement to the Notice of Review (48 FR 39526). This supplement changed Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia plieantha, Navarretia pauciflora, and Parvisedum leiocarpum from category 1 to category 2 candidates. Category 2 taxa are those for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats are not currently known or on file to support proposed rules. The plant notice was revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha, and Parvisedum leiocarpum were included as category 2 candidates. Another revision of the plant notice was published on February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184). In this revision Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia plieantha, and Parvisedum leiocarpum were elevated to category 1 candidates. Navarretia pauciflora was retained as a category 2 candidate. Since the publication of that notice, the Service has received additional information on the status of Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora that supports the proposed listing of this species. The September 30, 1993, plant notice of review (58 FR 51144) included all four plant taxa as category 1 candidates. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the case for Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia pauciflora, Navarretia plieantha, and Parvisedum leiocarpum because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1982, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1983 through 1993. Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Lasthenia conjugens Ornduff (Contra Costa goldfields), Navarretia leucocephala Benth. ssp. pauciflora (H. Mason) Day (few-flowered navarretia), Navarretia leucocephala Benth. ssp. plieantha (H. Mason) Day (many-flowered navarretia), and Parvisedum leiocarpum (H. Sharsm.) R.T. Clausen (Lake County stonecrop) are as follows:
