A group of 60 guerrillas seized a stretch of the road about mid-way between the port and the capital early Friday. The guerrillas proceeded to hold up cars and rob their occupants, the police official said. [passage omitted] Government forces were sent to the area and traffic was held up as the two sides exchanged fire. After some 30 minutes the government troops managed to repel the guerrillas, who retreated into nearby forest, and cars were allowed pass, the police officer said. The officer had no information on casualties. Another police officer said that the guerrillas were "probably angry" because the government forces had recently attacked their bases in Kompong Speu Province which lies between the capital and the Sihanoukville. Government forces bombarded Kompong Speu Province Saturday with leaflets urging the guerrillas to defect, a military official said. One of the leaflets carried an appeal from co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen which urges the guerrillas " to stop following the belligerent policy of the Khmer Rouge hardliners which will be disastrous for the national society of the whole Kingdom of Cambodia" and called on them to defect quickly. Printed on the other side of the leaflets were several colour photos of a smiling Ranariddh shaking hands and handing out clothing to guerrillas who had defected. The text of a second leaflet from the military called on the guerrillas to desert as soon as possible to avoid a "forthcoming confrontation". Meanwhile Thai immigration officials said they had closed the border crossing at Poipet as government forces attacked nearby Khmer Rouge positions in northwestern Banteay Meanchey Province. It was the first reported clash after a three day lull in the fighting in the area. Government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas had clashed daily since Thai military officials reported the government had launched an offensive on the guerrillas' bases starting New Year's day. Meanwhile Minister of Tourism Veng Sereivut said Saturday that "specific measures" were to be taken to ensure security along the road to Sihanoukville. He refused to elaborate but said the defence and interior ministries had been instructed to do everything possible to maintain security along the vital road. [passage omitted]
