The situation in the zone of conflict was discussed behind closed doors for four hours, however, the issue remained open and the problem will be further discussed tomorrow. Vasiliy Tarasenko, chairman of the committee for federation affairs and regional policy, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that attempts had been made to block the approval of the decree on various pretexts. In his view, "It is not as much a result of the conflict between the two republics as a way to influence relations between power structures in general." Unfortunately, "Politics and the stirring up of the conflict at the expense of people's sufferings interfere" in the problem of approving the presidential decree, he remarked.
