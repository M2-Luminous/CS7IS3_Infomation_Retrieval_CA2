The cost will be reduced from 163.7 billion HK dollars (20.9 billion U.S. dollars) to 158.2 billion HK dollars (20.2 billion U.S. dollars) due to the significant savings on the seven government key projects, which lowered by 7.6 billion HK dollars (974 million U.S. dollars) in the total amount of cost. The cost-reduction has been made possible mainly by savings stemming from highly competitive tendering on a very cost-effective program, the spokesman said. The local government has awarded 34 contracts worth a total of about 31.4 billion HK dollars (four billion U.S. dollars), representing 78 percent by value of the total government key projects. They have all been let below budget and are progressing well, he said. However, the spokesman added, the real cost estimates, released in March 1991 prices, for the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and for the airport railway are unchanged because slight increases have been necessary for the cost borne by the provisional airport authorities and for the airport railway.
