The unprecedented move ended a week-long strike that paralyzed the country's postal and telecommunication services. Ten-thousand-five-hundred workers of the state-owned Post and Telecommunications Corporation [PTC] downed their tools last Wednesday after management failed to pay them a 12.5 percent salary increase backdated to July 1992 and awarded to them by a labor tribunal. The PTC refused to pay the increases and appealed to the Supreme Court against the labor court ruling. Meantime the workers' union leaders instructed all workers not to go back to work since theoretically they had been fired.
