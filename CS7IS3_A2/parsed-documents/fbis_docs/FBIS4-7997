Enes Musovic reports that "four members of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Internal Commission sent by General Michael Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in Gorazde this morning in order to see the real situation in the Gorazde region. They immediately went to the lines of separation in order to visit this territory, which has been and still is the venue of fierce fighting between aggressor's forces and Gorazde defenders. As I report, the Drina Valley is shaking with strong explosions. Chetniks have continued shelling all defense lines around the besieged Gorazde as well as the civilian districts. The most recent reports say that a fierce artillery-infantry attack by the mad aggressor on [name indistinct] Kamen and [name indistinct] from the direction of Mesici is under way." Mirza Aldobasic reports from the zone covered by the 7 South Operations Group that "in the early morning hours, the aggressor attacked the defense lines of the 203d Glorious Doboj-Bosna Motorized Brigade, particularly in the Putnikovo Brdo region. However, it was somehow calmer on other battlefields on these free territories, although on a few occasions the enemy attempted breakthroughs along the defense lines at Crni Vrh." Studio announcer Arijana Barucija says that "it is somewhat calmer in the zone of the 3d Corps and other battlefields in our country, albeit still with occasional aggressor's activities from infantry weapons and artillery pieces."
