Russia and Ukraine, not without some help from the U.S. President, have finally managed to agree on the future of Ukraine's nuclear potential. At the meeting of three presidents -- the Presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- Leonid Kravchuk confirmed Ukraine would join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as soon as possible as a state without nuclear weapons. [video carries montage of shots showing troops handling weapons components; the ``Voyen TV,'' Ministry of Defense Television Studio logo is shown at top right of screen] It is presumed the first 200 nuclear weapons will be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia within 10 months. Altogether about 2,000 nuclear weapons must be dismantled in Ukraine. [video cuts to show Colonel General V.P.

At the same time, the state of affairs regarding nuclear safety on the territory of Ukraine continues to worsen. Storage depots are packed beyond standard limits with warheads and nuclear munitions that have been removed from service. This is intolerable and besides everything else, it has brought about a considerable increase in radiation levels. This has been confirmed by chief designers from Arzamas-16 who visited Pervomaysk on Ukrainian territory in September last year. The warranty periods of most component parts have expired. [end recording; video shows destruction of a launch tube] The signed agreement promises that nuclear weapons, which are dangerous not only when used but also when improperly stored, will stop being used as bargaining chips in political games.
