The reports add that the new arrivals are being provided with housing for a prolonged stay. The reports note that the area's residents say that the arrivals are members and cadres of the Lebanese Forces who have come there following the dissolution of their party in the wake of their involvement in a series of explosions, including the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. Although the reports do not indicate the number of those arriving, they nevertheless mention that many of them have arrived in the nearby villages and towns as well. The same reports say that some of the arrivals are carrying out military and security activities and are roaming the areas with light weapons. It is not yet clear whether the new arrivals will join the army of agent Antoine Lahd--which has since 1987 banned any political or military entity from operating outside its jurisdiction--or if they will open offices run by the Lebanese Forces and with the support of Israel. The reports say the Lebanese forces will either be deployed along the combat lines facing the liberated southern areas or they will foment seditious acts.
