Ukraine is giving them up voluntarily. And to whom? To Russia -- a state that trod Ukraine down for 300 years, and which is currently putting forward territorial claims against us; a state from which direct threats are addressed against us, and in which the rapid advancement of chauvinistic forces is plain for all to see. Perhaps we are handing over our nuclear weapons because they have lost their value? Not at all. Their value remains colossal. Moreover, they serve as the only sure protection against aggression from any state. No wonder that certain countries -- Israel, Pakistan, India, and others -- have either already acquired them, or are very close to developing them. The material and financial value of nuclear weapons is also astronomically high. Their enormous value is beyond question. So why is Ukraine voluntarily giving up this enormous treasure that is so desired by others? Perhaps because we love peace more than all other nations of the world? Or maybe we do not realize what we have really obtained by the will of God? Neither. Everything is much more prosaic. It is simply that other states, primarily Russia and the United States, are forcing us to hand over our nuclear weapons. They are forcing us by threats, moral and economic pressure, and other means. Ukraine is not giving up its nuclear weapons voluntarily but under duress. One should be deeply aware of this truth, which is shameful for us Ukrainians. From the dense demagogy of the president, who is trying to portray Ukraine's defeat in the issue of nuclear weapons almost as a victory, we could single out one argument that is being repeated with many variations: Ukraine is unable to keep its nuclear weapons because it does not have enough strength to withstand the pressure from Russia, the United States, and other countries. It does not have the strength because the Ukrainian people are not united, the economy is in shambles, our scientific potential is poorly organized, and because it has not found allies on the international arena. It is really hard for Ukraine to resist the external pressure in this situation. Who has reduced Ukraine to such a condition? Are we to believe that the complex circumstances in which Ukraine finds itself are the objective reasons why it is impossible to preserve our nuclear weapons? "Ukraine cannot keep its nuclear weapons because this is objectively impossible!" -- the media keep telling us. Is that really true? It is only half the truth. Ukraine really cannot preserve its nuclear weapons -- not because of objective reasons, however, but because of subjective ones. This does not mean that it is totally impossible, but that President Kravchuk and his team are unable to do it. The current Ukrainian leadership is unable to cope with the numerous problems facing the state, and it frequently surrenders in the face of those difficulties. The problem is not the nuclear weapons themselves, but the ability to conduct a clear and consistent foreign policy, unify the Ukrainian people, speed up economic reforms, mobilize the country's scientific potential, and find strong and reliable allies abroad. How is it possible to speak about a state without these aspects? Having something of colossal value such as nuclear weapons, one could use them as a powerful lever to solve all economic and political problems. Had Ukraine decided to proclaim unilateral nuclear disarmament, it would have obtained concessions and guarantees from Russia, the United States, and other countries, which would have put it among the leading countries of Europe. Still, what is possible for the strong is impossible for the weak, such as our leadership.
