Participating in the meeting are Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps. This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned the double standards the United States has on the subject. [Begin recording] de Greiff: The United States criticizes Colombia because supposedly we have very mild sentences against drug traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice. They claim that the United States has the right system, which consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in which U.S. drug traffickers have been sentenced for life. [end recording] De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali Cartel leaders. [Begin recording] de Greiff: I believe that would be their best choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office will continue its policy of pursuing them. [end recording] With regard to the scandalous espionage case at the residence of Presidential Candidate Ernesto Samper, de Greiff said that espionage is a crime, and therefore those reports will be investigated. De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to regulate arrests in Colombia.
