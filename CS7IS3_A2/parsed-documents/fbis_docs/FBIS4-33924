The Association of Demobilized Armed Forces Members [Adefaes], however, requested and succeeded in having the decree reformed to include military hospital personnel. Now, for the third time, they are requesting another reform to include administrative personnel who were dismissed due to the peace agreements. An unidentified Adefaes spokesman addressed the issue. [Begin unidentified Adefaes spokesman recording] We were not consulted on the decree that was passed, and it is incomplete because it deprives a great many people of compensation benefits. Our concern is that all the people who have been left out are entitled to benefits. [end recording] Adefaes expects a positive response to its petition from the Legislative Assembly. Otherwise, its unidentified spokesman said, it will exert pressure. [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] There may be some violence. If they do not meet our demands we will have no other alternative. We will gradually intensify our efforts and, I repeat, the time bomb may explode. [end recording] On this occasion everything seems to indicate that Adefaes' request will be resolved in its favor because the two largest factions in the Assembly support the petition. [Begin recording] [First unidentified deputy] Directly or indirectly, whether they were on the battlefield or they held administrative positions at garrisons, these people were involved in the conflict and they served the Armed Forces. I believe their request is fair. [Second unidentified deputy] They requested a reform to include military hospital nurses. I do not believe that administrative personnel should be left out either. [end recording] Another group requiring immediate attention are soldiers maimed in the war. According to Deputy Carranza, efforts are being made to establish a fund for the war maimed, which would be included in next year's extraordinary budget.
