Replying to a UNIAN correspondent's question on where the danger was in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's draft law "on introducing amendments and additions to the Ukrainian law `on the formation of the bodies of local power and self-government,'" which he recently vetoed, and whether he assessed this draft law as a deliberate move by the left-wing majority in parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed out: "This draft law was adopted in violation of three articles of Ukraine's Constitution, and it does not matter to me who violates it, either the left-wingers or the right-wingers, because everyone must respect the Constitution, while the Supreme Council and the president should provide an example of respect. If this kind of attitude toward the Constitution is displayed at this level, then it is necessary to announce that we have no Constitution and that we live in compliance with current laws which are adopted either by the left-wing or the right-wing majority." As far as private ownership of land is concerned, which Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz recently spoke out against, Leonid Kravchuk replied that neither the president nor the chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council solves this issue, but the Supreme Council of Ukraine does, as a legislative body, proceeding from the proposals to be put forward by the regions, as well as the decisions by the oblast councils and also people's will. "I have already said that all the talk about democracy, citizens' rights, and freedoms should be discontinued if a citizen of Ukraine, who wants and who can buy a plot of land is banned from doing this," said Leonid Kravchuk.
