He said they are "narcotized," adding that Bolivian and U.S. antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results. The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and alternative development programs. He admitted that "they have had no visible effects," either in the United States or in Bolivia. Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is "controversial" and has caused confrontations in the search for consensus. He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S. market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers "have had no guarantees on the sale of their products to that country." The minister said the peasants have found no market for their products and, because of the economic nature of this problem, they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort. Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit established. He said: "This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the cultivated areas." He added: "This caused a debate on the benefits of the policy and on its success or failure." In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements. This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression of traffickers with alternative development.
