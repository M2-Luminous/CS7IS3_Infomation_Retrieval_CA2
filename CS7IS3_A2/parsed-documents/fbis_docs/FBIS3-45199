Actively involved in producing such works on the subject are not only writers from minority nationalities, but also those of Han nationality. China has 55 minority nationalities, who have developed colorful literatures in the process of their historical development. These works, covering anecdotes, fairy tales, fables and poems, are rich in content and of high artistic value. They are a precious part of the world's literary heritage. Over the past few years great efforts have been made to boost the output of literature for children of minority nationalities. A number of books, such as "Selected Stories for Chinese Children of Minority Nationalities", "Selected Stories for Minority Nationalities in South and North China" and "Folk Tales of Chinese Minority Nationalities", have been published. Some of them have been translated into foreign languages and been carried by foreign magazines. "The Story of a Living Buddha", written by Malchinfu, a famous Mongolian writer, has been highly praised by readers for its vivid description of the life of a Mongolian child who started life as a living Buddha and then became a doctor. In 1987, China's first nationalities publishing house was built in Inner Mongolia. It has published thousands of books in the Mongolian language, including some world classics, such as "Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales". Other such publishing houses have emerged in many ethnic-minority areas, from the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet Autonomous Regions in the west to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in northeast China's Jilin Province.
