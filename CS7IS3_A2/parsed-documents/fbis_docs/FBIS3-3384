Liu Huaqing joined deputies from Hebei today to discuss the "Government Work Report" and the work reports of the NPC Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. He said: Strengthening unity between the army and government and between the military and civilians is an important element for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development. It is also vital to maintaining the country's political and social stability. He continued: Past experience shows wherever the work of "double support" and "building spiritual civilization through joint efforts" is successful, production will develop faster and social order will improve. Therefore, we must adopt new ways to promote the building of spiritual civilization while carrying out the building of material civilization. After hearing the speeches of seven other deputies, Liu Huaqing spoke on the role of agriculture in the national economy and the reform of state-owned large and medium enterprises. He pointed out: Party committees and governments at all levels must pay closer attention to agriculture and rural work, particularly grain and cotton production. A large country like China cannot do without sufficient grain and cotton. Agriculture is not simply a matter of feeding the people; it is also a major issue vital to China's lasting peace and stability. Currently, we must do a good job of raising the peasants' farming initiatives and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living. In developing agriculture and promoting the entire rural economy, we must seek to reduce peasants' burden and give them tangible benefits. Speaking about reforming large and medium enterprises, he said: Among large and medium enterprises, many are old military industrial enterprises. As the focus of the country's agenda is shifted onto economic construction, many old military industrial enterprises have begun to produce civilian goods. In consideration of the country's needs, we must still retain some of the essential military enterprises. Relevant departments of the state are studying measures to help large and medium-sized military industrial enterprises to overcome their difficulties after shifting to production of civilian goods. It is hoped that military industrial enterprises will improve internal management and make concerted efforts to raise economic benefits through reform, as other enterprises have done. Liu Huaqing said: Hebei achieved great success in all fields of work last year. Not only did its economy developed faster, but its social atmosphere and public order were also quite good. Liu Huaqing urged all localities to deepen reform; open up wider; educate people in patriotism, socialism, and collectivism; stress the larger interests of the collective and the state; and work with one heart and one mind to make greater progress in socialist modernization.
