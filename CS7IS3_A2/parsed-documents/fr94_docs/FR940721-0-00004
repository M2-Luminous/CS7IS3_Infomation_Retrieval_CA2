FR940721-0-00004 FR940721-0-00002 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;4] Establishment of Class D Airspace; Class E4 Airspace and Amendment of Class E2 Airspace; Athens, GA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia due to commissioning of a Non-Federal Air Traffic Control Tower, March 14, 1994. This action also amends the Class E2 surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport to indicate part-time when the control tower is not in operation. The intended effect of this action is to require pilots to establish two-way radio communications prior to entering the airspace during the hours the control tower is in operation. EFFECTIVE DATES: 0901 UTC, October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert L. Shipp, Jr., Airspace Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, Georgia 30320; telephone (404) 305&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71 to establish Class D and Class E4 airspace at the Athens/Ben Epps airport Athens, Georgia. This proposal also would amend the Class E2 surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area will require pilots, prior to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned air traffic control tower providing air traffic services. (59 FR 22567). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Designations for Class D, Class E2, and Class E4 airspace respectively are published in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace areas at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia. This amendment also amends Class E2 surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia, to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area will require pilots, prior to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned air traffic control tower providing air traffic service. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
