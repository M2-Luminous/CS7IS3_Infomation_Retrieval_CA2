Ryurikov categorically denied assertions that Russia manifested imperial ambitions in its foreign policy. The presidential aide emphasised that he does not see "anything terrible in remarks by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev who refers to CIS countries as the area of Russia's vital interests". "This is really so. Russia has vital interests in CIS countries, just as those countries have very serious and vital interests in Russia", Ryurikov said. He believes that the vital interests of Russia and CIS countries closely interweave. All depends on what is understood by the term "interests", the presidential aide pointed out. "Russia has moved away from the former Soviet Union's understanding of `interests' as a desire to monitor and influence the internal life and foreign policies of other states and to declare them to be an area of the Soviet Union's special `interests'. If they disagreed, pressure tactics, the dispatch of troops, etc. Used to be resorted to," Ryurikov explained.
