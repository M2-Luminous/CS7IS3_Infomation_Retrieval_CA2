Portugal backs a diplomatic, not military, solution in Bosnia. Maria Rui reports: [Rui] Bosnia-Herzegovina was an inevitable topic for the talks between the Portuguese foreign minister and his Slovene counterpart. Durao Barroso received his Slovene counterpart this morning and they signed a protocol providing for the lifting of visa requirements. Slovenia is the only republic of former Yugoslavia which has managed to establish a democracy, said Durao Barroso. On the subject of Bosnia, he told Renascenca that Portugal advocated the search for a political agreement. [Begin Barroso recording] We continue to believe that the main thing is to search for a political accord, via political means. We said it very clearly two days ago at the General Affairs [European Union ministerial] meeting in Luxembourg. For us it is clear that responsibility for the situation lies mainly with the Serbs. The Serbs have in fact surpassed certain limits. It is important for NATO, in supporting the UN resolutions and within the framework of the legitimacy of the UN, to show the Serbs clearly that this type of behavior cannot be tolerated. [end recording] [Rui] As for the Bosnian prime minister's statement today that the international community has condemned the Muslims to death, Durao Barroso said: [Begin Barroso recording] The international community has condemned no one to death. The international community is doing what it can. The UN has been doing what it can. In one or two cases, perhaps there may have been a failure in communications, a mistake in implementation. But it is totally wrong, when there is a conflict in a certain region, to say it is the fault of the rest of the world. [end recording] [Rui] As for the situation in South Africa and the recent accord between Inkatha, the ANC, and President de Klerk, Durao Barroso is pleased. [Begin Barroso recording] It is good; I am pleased. It is good news. When I was in South Africa recently I met everyone, I also spoke to Mr Buthelezi and, at the time, I urged him to participate in the elections. We believe that it is always a mistake not to be involved when it is a matter of the foundation of a regime or the transition to a new regime. Those who remain outside always lose, because in some way they exclude themselves from the legitimacy of the new regime. [end recording] [Rui] Durao Barroso also said that the Portuguese want to stay in South Africa and that journalists have speculated much about their return.
