FR940712-0-00014 FR940712-0-00006 As stated in the NPRM, we have deferred proposing to regulate non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural ``environmentally sensitive areas'' because we have not yet developed a suitable definition of ``environmentally sensitive area.'' We also need time to learn the extent to which pipeline spills affect such areas. Although the definition of ``environmentally sensitive area'' in the oil spill response plan regulations (49 CFR part 194) has been used for planning purposes, we believe that definition is too broad to use under part 195. A definition of ``environmentally sensitive area'' under part 195 must be specific enough to distinguish pipelines and segments of pipeline that are subject to the regulations. As required by §202 of the PSA, RSPA has scheduled publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to define environmentally sensitive areas, high density population areas, and navigable waterways. (See the ``Semiannual Regulatory Agenda'' at 59 FR 20662; April 25, 1994). We also intend to propose, as required by the PSA, to require all operators of hazardous liquid pipelines (including low-stress pipelines) to identify and inventory their pipelines located in those areas and waterways. NRDC commented that there is ample evidence of pipeline damage in rural environmentally sensitive areas outside navigable waterways, so RSPA should not postpone regulation of low-stress pipelines in those areas. NRDC suggested that RSPA use a broad definition of environmentally sensitive area for purposes of regulating low-stress pipelines, pending adoption of a definition required by the PSA. RSPA has not expanded the final rule to cover low-stress pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas outside the proposed areas of regulation, because the NPRM did not propose regulation of those pipelines at this time. However, we agree with NRDC's concerns about environmental risks, and we will consider those concerns in future rulemaking proceedings on rural low-stress pipelines. As mentioned above, our increased understanding of environmentally sensitive area in the pipeline context should provide a basis for future notices of proposed rulemaking on rural gathering lines and other rural low-stress pipelines. One operator thought RSPA should postpone the regulation of low-stress pipelines entirely until it proposes regulations for non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural environmentally sensitive areas. This operator said additional work and effort could be avoided if it could identify pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas before establishing a compliance program for part 195. The commenter, however, did not address the potential loss of benefits that would result if regulation of low-stress pipelines were deferred pending decisions on environmentally sensitive areas. Nevertheless, RSPA believes that once compliance programs are in place, extending the programs to cover additional pipeline segments, if required, should not be too difficult. Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent an operator from bringing all segments of a pipeline into compliance with part 195 and immediately achieving the benefits. L. Single Public Thoroughfare In the NPRM (at 12215), RSPA mentioned that ``intra-facility piping connecting adjacent facilities separated by navigable waterways or separated by third party property other than single public thoroughfares in populated areas would be subject to the regulations.'' A state agency and an operator asked us to clarify this single-public-thoroughfare exception. The intra-facility piping mentioned in the NPRM is functionally equivalent to in-plant piping, which is excluded from regulation under §195.1(b)(6). Essentially, intra-facility piping is transfer piping used for plant processes. However, plants may be divided by a single public thoroughfare, and transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare. A public thoroughfare includes any road, from a country lane to an interstate highway, but not a railroad or navigable waterway. Because the operating conditions of transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares are comparable in most respects to those of other in-plant piping, RSPA considers thoroughfare crossings to be in-plant piping. This interpretation of §195.1(b)(6) is in effect now. We will apply it to low-stress pipelines under this final rule. The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines, because these lines are different from in-plant piping. One commenter, representing a refining department, suggested that plant transfer piping that crosses property other than a thoroughfare right-of-way, such as industrial property, should also qualify as in-plant piping under §195.1(b)(6). This commenter also suggested that RSPA exclude inter-facility lines in industrial areas from regulation. Neither comment was adopted. We addressed the need to regulate low-stress pipelines in industrial areas under the subheading ``G. Populated Areas'' supra. M. Offshore Pipelines One operator commented that the NPRM lacked justification for the proposed regulation of offshore low-stress pipelines. RSPA disagrees because the accident consequences discussed in the NPRM and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking could occur offshore. Also, the NPRM discussed the need to prevent pollution of navigable waterways, which includes offshore areas. In the final rule, §195.1(b)(3) clarifies the coverage of offshore low-stress pipelines.
