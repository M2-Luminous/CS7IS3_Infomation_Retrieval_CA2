HTS number: 3907.40.00.00 CAS number: 127133&hyph;67&hyph;9 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals methane, chlorine, benzene, propylene, and sodium hydroxide. Polycarbonate is a solid produced predominantly by the interfacial polycondensation reaction of the sodium salt solution of bisphenol-A in an aqueous phase and phosgene in an organic phase. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: CH 4 (methane) + Cl 2 (chlorine) + 2 C 6 H 6 (benzene) + C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 2 NaOH (sodium hydroxide) + 3 O 2 (oxygen) _____> O(C 6 H 4 )C(CH 3 ) 2 (C 6 H 4 )OCO (polycarbonate) + 5 H 2 O (water) + 2 NaCl (sodium chloride). According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 79.1 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $4.91 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for methane of 0.083, a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.276, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.614, a conversion factor for propylene of 0.165, and a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.315.
