A press release circulated at the press conference said Russia earned 2.3 billion dollars from arms sales in 1992, and has set sights on earning about nine billion dollars annually. It is hardly sensible to turn away from this source of income which helps solve numerous problems facing this country, the press release says. It also stressed that Russian arms exports are not politically motivated. They are purely commercial in nature and are not directed against the interests of any separate country. "Moreover, we are prepared to discuss with the world exporters a reduction of arms exports on a reciprocal basis," the paper said. Russia is now orientating its arms sales towards financially and politically stable Middle East, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries. Good prospects exist for cooperation with China in the military field, the release said. Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr Shokhin expressed confidence that the privatisation process underway in Russia, including the sell-off of military enterprises, will not impair state control over Russia's arms export. He recalled that Russia had set up a special system of control over its arms sales, and control is now being further tightened.
