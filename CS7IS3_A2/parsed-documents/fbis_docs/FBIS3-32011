The shootout occurred as two U.S. diplomatic cars were driving along the avenue that links the U.S. Embassy to the Mogadishu airport, when their escorts opened fire on a crowd. The soldiers fired -- even using heavy-caliber weapons -- because they thought the Somalis were trying to block the road along which the caravan was to pass, when in reality the crowd was just waiting in front of a food distribution center. The massacre followed statements by the general undersecretary for UN operations in Somalia, (Kofi Annan), who criticized Washington's decision to withdraw its troops before 31 March. The UN official said he considered that decision a mistake because it might encourage violent actions aimed at sabotaging the peacekeeping operations.
