The launch was successful. This was the 415th launch since December 27, 1971 when the first booster rocket of this type was lofted into space, Major-General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, director of the Plesetsk cosmodrome, told ITAR-TASS. Preparations are being finalised at the cosmodrome for the launch of a photon technological spacecraft which is to blast off in one week's time. The photon is an automatic laboratory fitted out with a set of technical facilities to obtain organic and inorganic materials and substances with improved characteristics in zero gravity. Specialists from the French national space research centre take part in the preparations. In view of the fact that the satellite, which was launched from Plesetsk on May 25, 1994, failed to reach orbit, its number was given to the satellite launched today.
