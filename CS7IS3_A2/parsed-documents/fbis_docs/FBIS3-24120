Sakinform's correspondent asked Zurab Abashidze, the Georgian Republic's ambassador and diplomatic representative to NATO, to answer some questions. [Sakinform] Can you summarize the activity of your mission--our first embassy in Western Europe--at year's end? [Abashidze] Officially our activity in Brussels began last June. The establishment of the embassy involved many technical and orgaizational problems. We had to solve them quickly, because Eduard Shevardnadze made an official visit to Brussels on 21-22 June and met and talked with Belgian and NATO officials. You can imagine the significance of preparing for such a high-level visit in a time of complex political events. Starting our activities on such a "high note" afforded many opportunities. First, we saw to it that the problem of Georgia (in particular, Abkhazia) was the topic of systematic discussion in NATO. We managed to defend our position at meetings on various levels and have it recorded in internationally important documents, for example, the well-known Statement of the NATO and North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Europarliament's November Resolution. Anyone who thinks these documents have no force is wrong. Time will tell. Our embassy has regularly supplied information and materials on current events to the appropriate NATO bureaus, also the Eurocommission, Europarliament, the European Council and diplomatic corps. The press has published numerous reports based on these materials. [Sakinform] Could you say that these international bodies now have a more complete and objective understanding of Georgia? [Abashidze] These organizations, especially NATO, have many sources of information. Most important, Georgia's embassies in Belgium and the U.S. enable us to get more activly involved in day-to-day international events; this is an absolute necessity for any modern state. Now it is up to us how seriously we are represented in the international arena. If you are interested in our foreign colleagues' opinion, it is a pretty good start. Of the former Soviet republics, for your information, Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic countries, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Moldova have opened diplomatic missions in Brussels. [Sakinform] What can we expect in the future from our relations with NATO? [Abashidze] Our interest in NATO is understandable--and the interest is mutual. The changes that have taken place in Central and Eastern Europe in recent years have prompted serious changes in NATO's military and political doctrine. During the Cold War the main thesis was to ensure the West's collective security against the Soviet threat; now the cornerstone is to get Eastern and Western Europe, and especially Russia, involved in joint political processes--with priority given to the West's strategic interests, of course. At the same time, NATO is following events in Russia closely and maintaining its own defense capabilities. NATO's boldest move toward the East is thought to be the creation of NACC, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Besides NATO's 16 members it includes Eastern European and former Soviet republics. At the initial stage, NACC was set up as political consultative body that was designed to be more "educational" than practical. Still, meetings on the foreign ministerial level, ambassadors' and experts' conferences, and numerous seminars and consultations were designed to reconcile positions and foster cooperation in foreign policies and defense. It has now become clear that the West, especially NATO, sees much more promise in this council than it did a year ago. Politicians and experts think that NACC could turn into a major mechanism of Western-Eastern military and political integration. There is already some talk of giving NACC the right to perform certain operative functions, in particular peace-keeping operations. I don't think we have yet fully realized the importance of Georgia's participation in NACC; it marks a first step toward bringing us closer to Western defense structures. I think the current year is very promising in this regard. A foreign ministers' meeting approved the Council's working plan for 1994, which, inter alia, calls for joint military exercises; this would be especially valuable for our army, which is in the formation stage. In May, our military specialists will begin to train in NATO training centers. There is extensive discussion now in the West (NATO in particular) concerning America's new "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which calls for raising NATO's relations with Central and Eastern Europe to a new level. What that actually means will become known after the meeting of officials of NATO's member states. [Sakinform] Might NATO armed forces get involved in the Caucasus, for example to restore stability in Georgia? [Abashidze] Such a move could happen only under UN auspices and would first require a joint decision of NATO's members. Remember, that "aggressive bloc" has never been involved in armed conflict. Even in the heart of Europe--former Yugoslavia--UN forces are only involved in humanitarian aid. NATO is especially cautious toward the former socialist countries, believing that a hasty rapprochement could infuse NATO's environment with the events and elements of conflict that are characteristic of the East at this stage--spreading our infections to NATO, so to speak. The opinion in the West is that NATO's intervention in the affairs of the former socialist countries would only strengthen anti-Western and revanchist sentiments in Russia, which is still suspicious of that organization. Consider, also, the experience of UN forces' actions in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, which didn't exactly produce positive results. So, judge for yourself. [Sakinform] What practical steps were taken to broaden our relations with the European Union in 1990 [as printed]? [Abashidze] Let me start with the practical aid the Union provided. In 1993 this association of Western Europe's 12 leading countries again allocated us 40 million ecus in earmarked credit, which will soon be used to supply Georgia with wheat, margarine, sugar, and medicine (our creditors aren't going to hound us for this loan). We have been allocated humanitarian aid (a gift) of six million ecus' worth of fuel oil which will come to Georgia in January to relieve the energy crisis. The Union has allocated an additional three million ecus to help refugees from Abkhazia. An agreement on textile trade has been signed to enable us to export our goods to the European market without any restrictions whatever. An agreement of this sort is viewed here as a bigger gift than the other millions mentioned above. A program called TAS has been completed that calls for the European Union to give Georgia technical assistance in 1994. It will involve the transfer of know-how and the drafting of specific programs in priority spheres such as privatization, agriculture, and specialist training. A high-level Eurocommission delegation came to Tbilisi in mid-December to coordinate the program. Keep in mind that, however provisional it seems to us, the West is going through its worst economic crisis since World War II. Compared to the former Soviet republics, nevertheless, Georgia has actually benefited from the European Union's special concern in the past half year. [Sakinform] You have talked mainly about Western aid. What is being done to turn it eventually into bilateral, mutually beneficial cooperation? [Abashidze] Trends in cooperation are taking shape. Work is already underway on a vast project to create a modern Europe-Caucasus-Asia transportation line. We are of course very interested in having Georgia involved. At an international conference in Brussels last May the first practical step was taken to implement the project and protect our interests. Now we're trying to have the next international meeting held in Tbilisi. I don't want to get ahead of events, but if we achieve our goal, our country will have new functions and importance in the world. Work will begin in May on a big agreement between Georgia and the European Union concerning partnership relations. This political and economic agreement will be of historic importance in terms of integrating and bringing our country closer to European structures. Western business circles are especially interested in Georgia. I'm certain that after peace and political stability are restored, which should happen in 1994, our country will begin to rebuild.
