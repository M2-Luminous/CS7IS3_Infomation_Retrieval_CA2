FR940110-1-00063 FR940110-1-00006 This proposed provision is consistent with the requirement of compliance with fair housing laws contained in ยง960.5(a)(2)(i) of the Board's existing AHP regulation, and the requirement under existing practice that applications indicate how the sponsor proposes to affirmatively further such compliance. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(i). c. The twenty percent requirement and alternatives. Section 960.9(c) of the proposed rule incorporates the existing maximum subsidy limitation requirement and alternatives contained in ยง960.9 of the Board's interim rule, with minor changes in language and one substantive modification discussed below. See 12 CFR 960.9 (58 FR 17968 (April 7, 1993)). The 20 percent requirement and the alternatives discussed below implement the maximum subsidy limitation requirement contained in section 10(j)(9)(F) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(F). Since the 20 percent requirement or an alternative must be satisfied by all AHP applications to avoid over-subsidization of a project, it is set forth as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. (i) The twenty percent requirement. Section 960.9(c)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides generally that a Bank shall not offer subsidized advances or direct subsidies to applicants in excess of that amount needed to reduce the monthly housing costs for income-eligible households, as committed to in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the household's gross monthly income (the 20 percent requirement). In projects where other forms of federal, state, local or private subsidized assistance are being used in conjunction with AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies, the total amount of subsidized assistance, including funds provided under the AHP, shall not be in excess of the amount needed to reduce the monthly housing costs for the income-eligible households, as committed to in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the household's gross monthly income. Monthly housing costs are defined in proposed ยง960.9(c)(1)(ii) as: (1) For households in AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing units, mortgage principal and interest payments, real property taxes, homeowners' insurance, a reasonable estimate of utility costs excluding telephone service, and for households in AHP-assisted condominium, cooperative, mutual housing or other housing projects involving common ownership, those portions of any regular operating assessment or fee allocated for principal and interest payments, taxes, insurance and a reasonable estimate of utilities attributable to the household's share of the common area and/or the individual unit; and
