'Abd-al-Majid stressed the Arab League's invitation to host all the concerned fraternal and friendly parties that the sides signing the document believe should attend. He also stressed the Arab League's support for all efforts to end the crisis facing our country in order to draw up sound bases and to build a modern Yemeni state. On behalf of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah today received a telephone call from Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, who expressed his desire to see the document of accord signed at the Arab League Headquarters in Cairo. The foreign minister conveyed the greetings of the chairman of the Presidential Council and informed him that, after failure to sign the document in Yemen, the chairman of the Presidential Council would have been pleased to see the Yemeni document of pledge and accord document signed at the Arab League, if some parties in the committee stemming from the expanded National Dialogue Committee had not demanded that the signing ceremony take place in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He said that the General People's Congress leadership agreed to this demand, and, therefore, it would be difficult to change the venue of the planned signing ceremony, especially since the brother officials in fraternal Jordan have begun preparations for the ceremony, in addition to their commendable efforts.
