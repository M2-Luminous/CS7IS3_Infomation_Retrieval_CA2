A short while ago Daniel Ortega said he would return his house, but only to an organization dealing with the handicapped or to some sort of workers' movement, not to its original owner. Will the congress discuss the property issue? As a faction leader in the national parliament, you have studied the property problem. [Ramirez] This is not on the congress' agenda. We will only discuss our political program, changes to our statutes, and the election of our authorities. The property issue is of course on the National Assembly's agenda. As soon as we are through with the congress, I plan to look into this pending matter and what we call the Last Word on Property Law [Ley de Punto Final de la Propiedad], which are a group of laws, not just one law. We are going to propose in the National Assembly a law that deals with agricultural cooperatives, their land deeds or titles; a law that serves to regulate and protect workers' propriety rights, both in the city as well as in the fields; a law that will be called the property stabilization or property stability law; plus a revaluation law covering bonds that belong to those whose property was confiscated. I believe that this package of laws will help us resolve this very complicated property issue, which has no single solution, but instead several solutions. My thoughts on this matter are that although some people were treated unfairly, there are others -- which the government itself admits -- whose property was confiscated fairly, for example the property belonging to the Somozas and those close to them. The finance minister has said that those whose properties were affected becasue of their ties to the Somoza regime will not be entitled to any sort of return. There were other types of property reviews where obviously some people were treated unfairly. Nevetherless, that same property may have been occupied for 15 years by a cooperative, and no one would even consider evicting them, removing them to put someone else in their place. What the state has to do in such cases is to compensate these people. This has been done with bonds. The problem is that these bonds are not worth enough to satisfy the people who receive them, so now we will propose in the National Assembly a law to revalue these bonds and make them good for paying taxes and bank debts, for purchasing privatized corporations, and/or conducting various financial market operations. This will ensure that people who receive these bonds will feel more satisfied. There are also property disputes that need to be discussed in the courts and not simply resolved by administrative rulings. The idea is to find stability, not at the expense of someone else or by a sector of the people -- the poorest, the less fortunate -- instead, that this be accomplished through fairness and justice. [Reporter] Going back to the topic of Sandinist trends and with this special congress in mind, there are so many things, opinions, points of view on the FSLN. However, speaking of the trend that wants Sandinism to return to become a majority party, what would be the FSLN platform, guideline, or alternative for ensuring the return of Sandinism? [Ramirez] First, we need a true political party. When I say a true political party I mean a party that does not fear voters. It was precisely in the 1987 Constitution, which was voted on when there was a Sandinist majority, where the succession of power was established through elections. In order for a party to return to power in Nicaragua or gain power, it has to win the elections through votes. This party has to therefore practice electoral proselytism. Some comrades in the party are a bit embarrassed -- I say because of ideological prejudice -- at this electoral nature that Sandinism must have. I am not saying that Sandinism should only be active during national election periods. I do not believe in parties that remain dormant for six years and when election time comes they awaken -- these are electioneering parties. A party that stops defending those in our society who have the least -- the most humble, the less fortunate, the jobless, peasants without land or those under threat of eviction -- is a party that wants to regain political power through the control of land, Nicaragua's traditional means of political control. This also holds true for those who use small and medium-sized businesses to promote themselves. Sandinism must conduct constant political work to make people aware of their rights, their interests. This is what I mean when I speak of revolutionary parties that always work for the benefit of the great majorities -- those who have the least, without discriminating against other sectors of society. But, at the same time, thinking that a political party that believes its duty is to defend the interests of the vast majority and that it has to struggle every day for the interests of all sectors, the best way to watch over those interests is to put this in practice from a position of power, not from the opposition. Therefore, one must be part of the government and to become part of the government one must win the votes. It must be realized that a political party does not win the majority of votes until such time as a person enters the voting booth behind a curtain to cast his vote for a specific party. If the voter is not convinced at that time that he is voting for something, if previously he has not received the true message of expectation for the return of lost hopes, we will never obtain the majority of votes we need to return to power. We will not achieve this if we do not have a true, credible, and loyal message. I believe we have to go out and send the message again. [Reporter] You have been described as a moderate. It is said that if one is moderate, one is not belligerent. To say, for example, that the FSLN's action in support of the workers' gains, or support for the true problems within society, or for economic problems, or to go out into the streets to stage a strike -- that to a certain extent this harms the nation's development -- well, if this is not being belligerent then it would be best to sit behind a desk and give orders instead of going out to the streets. What is your point of view on this? Do you think that to be belligerent, everyday actions must be taken into account? [Ramirez] I know every inch of this country; I have been in many places throughout these 15 years. I have talked with all sectors; I have visited the most remote municipalities in the nation. I believe I understand the people's way of thinking. If someone asks me to interpret the feelings of the Nicaraguan people about the Legislative Assembly, or whether the people want war or violence -- in my opinion, this is not the type of belligerence that the people want. Given the enormous economic crisis, with such a high rate of unemployment -- in the countryside, in the poor Managua neighborhoods -- what the people want is an opportunity to work. They want peace. They do not want to use weapons anymore. They do not want any more deaths. They do not want any more kidnappings. In Matagalpa, in Jinotega, what the people want is security. Their security is threatened every day by armed criminal gangs who kidnap, rob, kill, block traffic on the road, force people out of buses to rob and assault them -- these people are armed for acts of revenge. What the people want is peace, security. They do not want any more war. This is what I interpret as my belligerence. My duty as a belligerent politician is to proclaim peace, but not peace with injustice. Obviously I will never, never support someone who wants to recover his property by burning down the house, damaging the roof, poisoning the water supply so that cattle die, closing up the water wells -- as happened in a violent eviction on the outskirts of Leon. I can never agree with these acts of violence that the law must punish. What is sought is precisely that violence end, no matter its origin. We want to live in peace with security. The FSLN can't keep hailing violence just because certain sectors use violence; this would be a never-ending story. To the extent that we continue threatening the fragile peace the nation and the citizens are enjoying, with incorrect speeches, with violent speeches, calling for acts of revenge, we will not gain any votes; rather we will alienate them. These are my conclusions after my contacts with the Nicaraguan people, through my permanent dialogues with diverse sectors of society. This is why I reaffirm my conviction in my call for peace, call for reconciliation with justice, for a new society, for a democratic society in Nicaragua. This is what the people of Nicargua want. [Reporter] How much truth is there in that within the FSLN, the rank and file will be taken into account [words indistinct] the communal movement, if only one sector of the society attends the assemblies -- if of course he is member of the FSLN. For example, in Masaya an assembly has just been held, where I understand Henry Ruiz participated. Some leaders did not attend that assembly because they belong to the faction, the other faction, that is. How can one side know the other's position [words indistinct] if they do not sit down [words indistinct] make a decision through a democratic process [words indistinct] reach a conclusion? Maybe a consensus can be reached for presentation at the congress on the 20th. You, as representatives of the Sandinist faction that represent the majority, do you invite all to the demonstrations, to meet and talk about the FSLN's internal crisis? [Ramirez] Well, about this so-called faction, we know that this is a majority that is not an organized faction, it does not have authority, it does not have a leader, it does not have a structure within the nation. It does not seek to be a party parallel to the FSLN. The [passage indistinct] was elected, where 150 Sandinist signed an agreement whereby [words indistinct] were established. I do not see this as [passage indistinct] the radio, the author of the anthem. [passage indistinct] The document was signed by the majority. I do not see [words indistinct] with people such as Ernesto Cardenal, our national poet who signed this document. Also Mario Flores Ortiz could be summoned, the founder of psychiatry in the nation, of great prestige in the medical sector, and one of the senior socialists of Nicaragua. [Words indistinct] the names of the 150 who signed the document, subsequently 500 more signed. There is a true tendency toward [words indistinct] that no one can disqualify. At this stage of the game to be calling as right wing the [words indistinct] Ernesto Cardenal or Mario Flores Ortiz, or [words indistinct], union leaders and all those socialists, is nothing more than nonsense. No one in this country believes in this type of language and in name calling. [Words indistinct] we are not organized as a faction with a structure within the party. Therefore, everyone attends the meetings we call, debates have taken place as they should with the [words indistinct] if the current tendencies are correct this is discussed, if this is correct or not. I believe this is the proper way to wage a political debate. What has assembled us here in this process before the Congress, is the lack of the use of a democratic mechanism within the party. This results in serious mistakes being made. For example, there are two candidates for secretary general. The department heads, the political secretaries of the parties should be [word indistinct], both candidates should be given equal opportunities to appear before the national congress delegates, before the departmental congress delegates. They should be given the opportunity to talk to them. Otherwise, when a candidate goes to talk to an assembly, the others are not present because they might have been prohibited from attending. This is possible. Unclear mechanisms could be used to limit who attends. I believe this is a result of not practicing democracy. From now on we should ensure there is more than one candidate for a public post from the FSLN ranks. There could be two, or three, or four candidates running for the same post. Now there are two, [words indistinct] could be more than two. They should be given the same opportunity to appear before FSLN audiences to present their own points of view. That is democracy. [Reporter] Allow me, I do not know if in this case I am being naive [words indistinct], but talking a little about the reality that exists within the FSLN, [words indistinct] Carlos Mejia Godoy. When Carlos Mejia Godoy presented a composition written by Pablo Antonio Cuadra, it received harsh criticism. At the signing of [words indistinct] other document [words indistinct] the majority, were harshly criticized by the media. What is more, the same media that belong to the FSLN do not give space to persons who agreed with that position. So, do you believe that in the Congress this would be solved, or [words indistinct]? The truth is that they are not allowed to make use of the media. If they belong to the FSLN, undoubtedly the FSLN members should be allowed to use this media. What is your opinion on this? [Ramirez] It would be difficult to respond in that same language [words indistinct], I will never fall into that trap. I believe that my duty is to speak in a lofty manner, to seek the consensus of all in the party, I will not respond to insults. I will not ask: Why are you insulting me, calling me right wing [passage indistinct], cannot sit with me at the same table, cannot be in the same party? I would be paving the way for my expulsion from the party. My duty is to be a Sandinist, my duty is to struggle within the ranks of my party, this is what I believe. I want my party to become a truly democratic force capable of winning the elections in 1996 and other elections in the future. I am going to struggle for a Sandinism that will [word indistinct] with Nicaraguan society, not a Sandinism that instills fear. I am going to struggle for a Sandinism in which true democratic forces can join to offer Nicaraguan society a true alternative of power in the nation. I want to struggle for a Sandinism that will not identify with irrational violent actions that are not the legitimate defense of the people, of the dispossessed, of this nation's majority. This is the Sandinism I want, this is why I am inside the Sandinist party. I am not going to be scared off because they say Sergio Ramirez has identified himself with the rich sector. This is a gross lie and outright slander. I do not possess any fortune, nor do I have anything against those who possess fortunes. I believe it is legitimate within this society, to work in the field one wants, accumulate capital, if one is honest. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what will happen after the Congress? [Ramirez] I do not want to speak now about what will happen after the Congress. I think Sandinist unity should be sought. I am in Sandinism because I believe in the majority. If I did not believe in the majority, I would be doing other things. I would have some business, a candy store, a shoe store, I would have apartments to rent, or a farm of 500 manzanas. I do not know what I would be doing if I did not feel that what I am doing in my party is politically right, because I want to turn my party into a winning force. We must defend the interests of the majority, which is what I believe in, and make that majority return to Sandinism. The truth is that the majority is not in Sandinism right now. The Sandinist Front is a minority party. That is what I believe. [Reporter] This is "Impact 620." We are having problems with this line. Dr. Sergio Ramirez is here. I have three final questions. I had wanted to give listeners the opportunity to participate but due to the line problems, here are my questions which deal directly with the reality facing the Sandinist Front leaders in the National Directorate. There are some who follow a slightly more modern line while others maintain a special position -- a position is respected. For example, in the case of Commander Daniel Ortega, he is not the only option for secretary general of the Sandinst Front. Before you arrived, other people called to ask you whether you think he is the only option in the effort to maintain the Sandinist Front Secretariat and coordinate the party's decisions within the conglomerate of the party congress. It is said that the decisions are made by the conglomerate, not by a single person. But this is not shown in practice. He wants to continue being the Sandinist Front secretary. He no longer wants to be candidate because it is too early to talk about presidential candidates. He wants to continue as secretary, but he does not give the other viewpoints and positions in the Sandinist Front a chance, and for some time those positions have not been accepted. There are also the media and properties owned by the Sandinist Front to keep the party functioning. But most of those properties are managed by the circle that supports Commander Daniel Ortega's line. What do you think about this? If this continues in the next few months, there might really be a division within the Front. [Ramirez] I think that Commander Daniel Ortega has every right to be a candidate for secretary general of the Sandinist Front. The Front's statutes do not prohibit reelection to the secretary generalship. Therefore, as a Sandinist Front militant, he has every right to be a candidate, just as Commander Henry Ruiz has every right. He has the same right to be a candidate for the secretary generalship and to be elected. They each have the right to address the Sandinist audience to attempt to show that each one is the best candidate and has the best proposal. The Sandinists have the right to hear them, to believe them or not. When the vote is held, congress delegates have the right to vote for one candidate or another. That is part of the democratic game in the Sandinist Front. Different candidates present themselves in pursuit of a position. Each promotes his candidacy, and congress delegates will vote secretly to elect the candidate of their choice. Now then, if either of the two sides involved with these candidacies -- Commander Ruiz has his followers and Commander Daniel Ortega has his -- tries to disqualify the other, I think Commander Ruiz and Commander Ortega will be critical of those exclusions, discriminations, or disqualifications. I think that disqualifications would not help pave the way for unity in the Sandinist Front. [Reporter] Now then, the Sandinist Front party is part of the Nicaraguan people, and the Nicaraguan people are experiencing a difficult economic situation. There is also the problem of the return of armed groups to civilian life. There is the issue of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], the economic situation, and the search for aid. The Paris Club meeting is approaching. Yesterday there was a meeting with representatives of donor countries. What viewpoints does the Sandinist Front on the economic problem and the involvement of all sectors, whether they be Sandinists or not? The Sandinist Front must also contribute. It is said that the Front has not contributed to improving the Nicaraguan people's economic situation. There are strikes and disturbances. There is a vertical command structure which does not permit a consensus in resolving economic problems. Criticisms are sometimes voiced in the parliament. What are the Sandinist Front's viewpoints on the country's economic situation? What about the ESAF? What can you tell us? [Ramirez] I think the Sandinist Front was very critical of the ESAF. The Sandinist Front has said the ESAF does not fulfill the Nicaraguan people's expectations for profound change in the economic model. I agree with those criticisms. I obviously agree with the position that the ESAF does not satisfy the needs of the most abandoned sectors as participants in the economy. I would like an economic program that first helps the new owners of land, the cooperatives, the individual owners who were members of the resistance, Sandinists, demobilized Army soldiers, and demobilized members of the Government Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of manzanas have been distributed by the Sandinist revolution and the government of Mrs. Chamorro. They need credit, they need technical assistance, they need roads, they need markets, they need to begin to produce for the nation's benefit and that of thousands of peasant families that hold these lands and resources. Therefore, the economic program should be directed at favoring these emerging economic sectors. If we add up these thousands of producers and the thousands of manzanas they hold, we have there the actual production of food and agricultural products for the country. Therefore, there should be special plans for meeting the needs of these producers. In terms of the economy, the country is not going to progress if only a minority benefits from the ESAF. I am not saying that this minority, which consists of large property owners and manufacturers, should be forgotten, but those thousands of small, medium-sized, and impoverished growers should also be taken into account. They are in dire need of low interest credit, technical assistance, seeds, and new markets for their products. Herein lies Nicaragua's future, among the small and medium-sized growers. I believe that the ESAF should be aimed at addressing the problems of this sector, and here I also include urban artisans, small and medium-sized businesses, and small industrial manufacturers. This sector includes the majority of the Nicaraguan people. Again, when I speak of a majority, I am referring to the term in the economic sense of benefits, not gratuities or giving away credit. I am not referring to that but saying that the time is ripe for the country's production to start to grow and for resources to be truly distributed. [Words indistinct] Nicaragua to those who have less. We need an economic program that can result in a rapid drop in unemployment in Nicaragua. If every year we could produce 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 jobs, we would actually see the benefits and the population's living standards would improve. But all these problems like criminal activity, child abuse, and efforts by the police to control the exponential increase in criminal activity are caused by unemployment. In addition, instability in rural areas is caused by a lack of economic stability, lack of credit, unemployment. This is all related to the economic crisis in Nicaragua. At any rate, what do we have? In order for a program like this to be implemented, as the Sandinists are proposing, first we need to get into the government. We need votes in order to get into the government. If those votes cannot be secured, we will be speaking in merely theoretical terms because there is not much that can be done from the opposition camp to change an economic program. In this case, the only thing left would be to support the just union demands that are determined to change the economic program. [Reporter] What's your opinion on forming coalitions or alliances with other political parties for the 1996 elections? On several occasions, I have even heard Arnoldo Aleman mention that there could be a conservative alliance in order to face the FSLN. [Ramirez] I believe that during the 1996 elections there will be different types of alliances on both sides. In no way am I going to rule out that the FSLN will or will not form an alliance for the elections. But before we can talk about alliances, we must first clearly define what is going to take place within the FSLN as a political entity, and if we can arrive at a satisfactory agreement that will fulfill the expectations of any other party that wants to associate with us. This is why the results of this upcoming weekend congress are very important. Whatever comes out of this congress will determine our image before Nicaraguan society. Whatever takes place during the congress will once and for all determine the FSLN's position for the 1996 elections. Once the congress adopts a political position, this cannot be changed until some time before the elections, during another congress and where we adopt another position. But the assurances and confidence we project during this congress will be decisive in the 1996 elections, with regard to potential allies as well as to society, which will have to choose between the FSLN and those political forces to select a government that will run Nicaragua as of 1996. [Florentina Navarro, caller] Hello. Good morning. Is Dr. Sergio Ramirez speaking? [Reporter] You are on the air. Come in, come in. [Navarro] Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado? How are you? This is Florentina Navarro. I would like to ask you something. But first I wish to greet the congress and the lasting memory of our companeros Fabio Vega, German Pomares, Silvio Mayorga, Hernan Pomares, Silvio Buitrago, and all of the heros and martyrs, those who fell in Bocay and Pancasan, such as Faustino Ruiz and Zoilo Escobar. I hope their memory will last in unity in this congress, which is a congress of the people. I want to ask Dr. Ramirez a question. In addition to the agenda, what other measures could be taken? As far as I remember, the first peace agreements were signed -- one of them was Esquipulas -- by the government, represented at the time by Commander Daniel, Dr. Sergio Ramirez, and other officials. They signed the agreements for peace we have been trying to attain. Other agreements and other documents were signed later. Reading the Constitution, I find that the workers' only strategy of struggle is based on Article 103 of the Constitution, which recognizes the right to strike. This is a method for the workers' struggle, according to the Constitution. Other means of struggle, such as the right to create unions and respect for freedom of organization, are included in the Constitution. I think it is necessary to define in the Congress the nature of these legalized methods of struggle. We would also have to determine how true peace will be attained considering that there is no economic, social, or political stability. One other thing, Dr. Ramirez. I have read nearly all of your writings and papers. I would like to know whether you have a socioeconomic plan for improving the country's situation. At a conference the other day, Dr. Francisco Solaina said that in Nicaragua there are no projects or economic policies that allow investments to crystallize in the country because of the absence of political or economic stability or security in society. It is necessary to devise a strategy to solve this situation [words indistinct] stability in the country. My question deals with the economic situation in Nicaragua and whether what Dr. Lainez says is true, that in Nicaragua there is not even a set of projects or anything that could serve as the basis for an economic or social policy to solve the problems of unemployment and capital depletion. There has been much capital depletion for a long time. This is another factor, which not always is taken into consideration in opinion polls. At the congress, we have submitted a demand for an answer to the people's economic needs. It is necessary to change what some people describe as leadership and others describe in another way. What the people require are solutions to our problems, such as housing, education, health, and all of the services stipulated in the Constitution as the right of the Nicaraguan people. [Ramirez] I appreciate Mrs. Navarro's call. Rather than a question, it has been a series of excellent remarks on the country's situation. The country requires an economic project like the one I have been trying to outline. It is necessary to think first of the large number of unemployed, those who must have the security afforded by land possession, who want to till the land. We must think of cooperative members, small- and medium-sized producers, small- and medium-sized industrialists and craftsmen, all of which comprise the majority of the population who want to participate in economic activities but are restricted by the crisis, who are not given bank loans, technical assistance, aid for production, new or repaired roads, etc. These needs would be met by a true socioeconomic plan for getting Nicaragua out of its economic crisis. National unemployment stands at 50 percent. In addition, thousands of young people enter the labor market every year. These young people cannot find jobs [words indistinct]. Any economic project must first take into consideration these great dispossessed majorities of jobless and just walk the streets. [Words indistinct] I also think that a socioeconomic plan which truly solves Nicaragua's social and economic problems cannot be sponsored by a single party. It is necessary to have a national agreement with the participation of unions and political parties. We must agree on medium- and long-term plans, which would change the course of the country development, ensure the country's economic stability while respecting other parties' ideas. If a government undoes what others did, if one privatizes while the other nationalizes, and then still others privatize again, we would go on and on trying unsuccessfully and the country would continue in crisis, chaos, and desperation. [Reporter] Does that mean you agree with the Cosep [Higher Council of Private Enterprise] when it asked that a deal be struck so that those accords be kept in the years to come regardless of whichever government may be in office? [Ramirez] I have been saying for a long time that we need a long-term accord that will take us beyond 2000 and give economic stability to the country, that we should all get in the same boat, and that regardless of the government that comes to power it should respect the guidelines or fundamental definitions contained in that plan. In that respect, (?Fidelina) is right in criticizing the lack of that economic program [words indistinct] that program must be the fruit of an accord among all the forces participating in the economy and in defining the country's political course. (?Fidelina) also asked about the methods of struggle, [words indistinct] are those allowed by the laws and the Constitution. The right to strike is a legitimate right. It is contained in the Constitution. Under the Constitution and the laws, workers have been guaranteed the use of their right to strike. [Reporter] How about the method used? [Ramirez] The method used is another matter. If a strike is implemented with armaments, rifles, and pistols, that does not fall within the parameters of the law. This is a topic of very intense discussion within the FSLN rank and file. Some say, if my house is being set on fire, why should I not defend myself? Why doesn't the judge see that? If the method used to evict someone from his house is to spill a gallon of gasoline in his home while his family is inside, that person, regardless of his political affiliation and regardless of who it is that is trying to evict him, whether thugs have been paid [word indistinct] violence to where he is resting at home with his children, the Criminal Code, the Constitution, recognizes the defense of legitimate self-defense. That is in the law. It is not illegal to defend oneself, if one watches others coming to disturb the peace of his house. It is one thing to recognize what the laws state, and another thing to preach violence [words indistinct] this incites people, worsens [words indistinct], and will not bring peace, tranquility, stability to the country [words indistinct] violence, no matter where it comes from. Violence is not the domain of one side. Violence exists in different segments of society, and we must calm violence and abide by the laws and the Constitution, so we can create the necessary stability, we can have the investments that (?Fidelina) mentioned. So long as there is no peace and stability in the country, the economy will [words indistinct] there are no capital resources [words indistinct]. [Reporter] On this matter, could we reach a defined position on methods of struggle in the debates? [Ramirez] That is in the agenda of the FSLN congress, a definition of the methods of struggle. That is one of the most important points we are going to discuss in the congress. [Reporter] We have a caller here. Hello? Go ahead, please. [Unidentified caller] Dr. Ramirez, some say that [words indistinct] between Commander Daniel Ortega and Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado is for show, and deep down you are united. Also, Commander Ortega said that no Sandinist will be a candidate for president in 1996. They will support someone else who [words indistinct] the revolution. If you run for president, what will your platform be? Another question is: The charges against Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman were temporarily dropped. Will it remain that way [words indistinct] so he may not be eligible to run in 1996? [Reporter] Dr. Ramirez will answer. [Ramirez] I have already heard some say that the political debate within the FSLN is for show. Skeptics believe the political division is for show. I would like to tell the person who called, he did not give his full name, and I did not ask him to identify himself, that I am participating seriously in this debate. This does not mean [words indistinct] trying to preserve any kind of personal enmity. I do not believe personal enmities are the way to resolve a political debate. There is no reason why I should be an enemy of Commander Daniel Ortega. We worked together for many years [words indistinct] turn into his enemy because we are speaking a different political language and because our political stances are different. I do not regard the political debate in terms of an enmity. If I am not antagonistic toward people who have no political or ideological identification.... [Reporter interrupting] Even if they insult you? [Ramirez] I have not been directly insulted. I must be honest in this respect. Even those who [words indistinct] I seek to convince them that if someone [words indistinct] and I have nothing to do with you, why should I participate in a political debate? I think that slurs disqualify the person who utters them, not the one who receives them. I think the Nicaraguan people and Nicaraguan society have enough political maturity to understand that slurs disqualify the persons who utter them. If a convinced Sandinist, such as the woman who called me, expressed her thoughts, and accurately named all the heroes and martyrs -- I remember her with a great deal of admiration and affection -- if a woman like Mrs. Navarro who called earlier were to believe all those slurs against me, and all the insults and offenses uttered against me on the radio, which I repeat I [words indistinct], she would not be calling me here. She would not believe in me. She gets into a dialogue with me and talks to me over the telephone because she respects me. For that reason, all those slurs have not made an impression on her heart, her mind, or her ears. That is why I am very pleased. I repeat, slurs disqualify those who utter them. Now, I really do not agree with the view no Sandinist should begin to seek a presidential candidacy for the 1996 elections, and that we should seek a candidate outside the Sandinist ranks. I believe that any party that says it does not have a suitable candidate to represent Nicaraguan society during a presidential election is a party that is defeated even before the election starts. If it says that it has to look for candidates outside [words indistinct] even Sandinists who are quite capable of participating in an election campaign and even winning. I am not going to [words indistinct], I have at least 10 Sandinists in mind who have the prestige and sufficient backing to be presidential candidates. Now, if after scrutinizing the FSLN ranks we can ascertain that there is no suitable candidate, then we have no other choice but to look outside the party. However, a party cannot start looking for its candidate from outside its rank and file because it is disqualifying itself from the beginning. This does not imply that I am saying that Sergio Ramirez should be considered simply because he is a Sandinist. If necessary, I am quite willing to stand in line with any list of candidates. My sole objective in life is not to be a presidential candidate, just as my sole objective is not to accumulate great wealth and assets. I am not going to feel distressed or spiteful, nor will I abandon the FSLN or go to the dogs, or lock myself in a dark room and brood just because I was not selected presidential candidate. No sir, that is not my sole objective in life. My objective in life is to change this society, for it to become more equitable, for it to have a better social security, and for resources to be distributed more evenly. I intend to continue struggling for this. In concluding, the issue about Mayor Aleman is currently in the courts. So far an appeal has been filed with the Supreme Court of Justice on the sentence issued by the Managua Appeals Court. This has to be solved in accordance with court decisions. I insist that the state of law must be strengthened, and will be strengthened insofar as it is possible for us to acknowledge the weight of the court's decision. I don't know what is going to happen, if the appeal will be received, or what repercussions will result from the Supreme Court of Justice accepting the appeal. [Reporter] Please allow me to insist again. I believe that we have covered many issues during these 90 minutes. In reference to the exclusion matter, you mentioned that it would not seem appropriate for a situation of exclusion to take place within the FSLN or during the congress. Yet, there is a situation of exclusion taking place at this time. You yourself mentioned the radio stations that do not allow you time to express the views of a segment that specifically has some clout and strength within the party. [Words indistinct] if this continues to take place. Will the issue of the radio stations owned by FSLN members be included in the Sandinist debates, or have you finally digested the fact that the radio stations are owned by private individuals? [Ramirez] The problem is that I do believe that radio stations owned by the FSLN should allow equal time to those within the party who view things differently to express themselves. However, if someone tells me that a radio station such as Radio Ya, for example, is not [words indistinct] private property. In cases such as these, what can I do to get time on the radio if the owners are unwilling? Then, the only thing left for me to do is to approach the other stations that do allow me time. I believe that this is also part of the game of democracy. I am not going to file a lawsuit against a Radio Ya simply because they do not want to give me time. It's all a matter of taste, then.... [Reporter, interrupting] And also because the station is owned by private individuals. [Ramirez] I would like a debate to take place in order to really determine how is it that these stations are owned by private individuals. I believe that is something that concerns mechanisms within the party itself which we must clarify as thoroughly and openly as possible. [Reporter] I would like to [word indistinct] Henry Ruiz, who is running for the position of FSLN secretary general, and as a person who as treasurer has handled issues related to assets owned by the Sandinist Party. As such he is aware of what assets the FSLN has and what it does not. Then we now have Henry Ruiz as candidate and the other side says that he is the candidate of division. [Ramirez] Henry Ruiz is FSLN treasurer. I have been present when he has delivered his financial reports and [words indistinct]. Radio Ya is not registered as one of the party's assets. BARRICADA and Radio Sandino are registered, but not this radio station. I believe that it is the party treasurer's responsibility if the party's list of assets suddenly does not appear. I want to be perfectly clear in that I am not going to make a big fuss simply because I am not allowed media time. Nor am I going to resign the party because I am not given sufficient media time. I intend to continue to struggle so that genuine democracy exists within the party. [Reporter] We have now reached the end of this program and want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado for appearing on our "Impact 620" program. What is your message to FSLN followers and members and the Nicaraguan people about this congress? [Ramirez] My message is to the congressmen. There are 500 congressmen from all over the country and the congress begins on Friday and ends on Sunday. I want to tell them that the FSLN's future is in their hands. They need to be aware that they will be responsible for deciding the FSLN's course. They are elected by the rank and file and their will should not be affected by any possible meddling. There is no party organization at the departmental or municipal level, no type of assembly, no small or large congress that can hold to ransom the will of the national congressmen. Their will is sovereign. They are not obligated to any sort of decision or previously agreed resolution by the party to vote a certain way for or against a certain resolution. Their wills, sovereignly expressed in Congress by raising their hand or by secret vote, is what will determine the fundamental decision that will guide the party over the next few years. This is why the conscience and vote of these congressmen is fundamental to defining the course the party will take. These congressmen must responsibly remember and keep fresh in their minds that they are the people who truly represent the FSLN's true will. [Reporter] We want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We have requested TELCOR [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute] to improve some of our telephone lines because some are noisy and it is difficult to put the calls on the air. We hope that this is not the only time we have you here on this program. We are at your service with this station that has great coverage. With the massive participation of the people both Sandinists and non-Sandinists can express their views here.
