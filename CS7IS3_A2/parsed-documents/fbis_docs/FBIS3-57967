But before the company is disbanded, one final major show is about to be staged. It should not be missed, because it offers a plot with some potential for spectacular developments. For instance, the possibility of a group of ministers tendering their resignation in order to prompt a reshuffle. The title could be "Will Our Hero Persuade Ciampi To Ride Again?" The "hero" is Marco Pannella, the lone occupant of parliament around the end of the old year and the start of the new. Pannella is the architect of a political strategy verging on the brilliant, whose aim is as follows: to prevent the Ciampi Government from sliding toward the elections on the magic carpet of ambiguous neutrality, as a "disinterested" government aloof from the political struggle. Pannella argues (as does Segni now), that this would in practice provide support for the postelection plans of Occhetto, who -- surprise, surprise! -- has precisely Ciampi in mind as leader of a second, infinite transition period -- to provide reassurance for the markets, industry, and our European partners. Hence his obstructive move. Ciampi, Pannella argues, must not be merely an anemic, albeit efficient, government clerk. He is involved in the political crossfire against his will, and the rationale of the first-past-the-post system will exacerbate this conflict to the maximum. So Ciampi must constitute the expression of a coalition supporting him as the precondition for a political alignment that in the future may be either victorious or defeated, but that must in any case prepare for the electoral battle. The next step in his argument concerns the need to make "visible" what we could call this liberal-democratic coalition, which partly coincides with the old majority -- the DC [Christian Democratic Party], the PSI [Italian Socialist Party], and the nondenominationalists -- but which now includes the Pannella group and above all Mario Segni. According to Pannella, if the latter wants to remain consistent, he must not underestimate the possibility of a second Ciampi Government wrested from the PDS and presented on behalf of the moderate camp. But a no-confidence motion is not enough in order to achieve a second Ciampi Government. At least, it is clear enough that the legislature's days are numbered, especially if the prime minister begins the debate 12 January but resigns before the final vote. Scalfaro would sign the dissolution decrees with a view to an election on 27 March or later, as the Senate speaker suggested, on 10 April. Ciampi would stay on to take care of routine business. The political objective proposed by Pannella (a natural coalition) would not be achieved. So here is his idea: Why do interested ministers -- and especially those concerned about the future of the moderate center -- not resign now, of their own free will? By so doing, they would avoid facilitating the government's downhill slide toward the PDS and would turn the process of the dissolution of parliament into a significant political transition instead of a sterile institutional ritual. This, because Scalfaro would be duty-bound to replace the outgoing ministers and his choice would not be without specific political repercussions. The elections would take place all the same, but the liberal-democratic front would feel a little fresh blood flowing through its veins. The Italian people would make their choice on the basis of a proposal (and alliance) for government, "instead of the old classifications of left, right, and center," whereby Berlusconi, Segni, Martinazzoli, and Bossi would be preparing for a Pyrrhic victory, with a weak left commanding 30 percent, and three minority groups commanding 20 percent. Pannella confined himself to making the suggestion, asking whether there are any ministers "unwilling to accept the undemocratic and unpolitical degradation of their role." It is up to them to reply. It is up to people like Andreatta, Barucci, Jervolino, and Costa -- the most "political" members of a highly technocratic government, and perhaps those most interested in the reconstruction of a moderate coalition. We shall see imminently whether the reshuffle takes place. For the present it must be acknowledged that an uphill climb lies ahead. First, it is necessary to see whether the DC -- that is, Martinazzoli -- is willing to follow Pannella. Second, it is necessary to establish what Mario Segni's position is (according to the plan, he would fill the post of deputy prime minister, with Pannella himself as foreign minister): On the one hand, by attacking Ciampi over the year's end economic package, he seems more interested in electoral competition with the League than with establishing himself at the Chigi Palace [government seat]. But yesterday evening he helped Pannella considerably when he told IL GIORNALE that "before the confidence debate the prime minister has an obligation to make it clear whether he considers himself the candidate of the front led by the PDS." Then there is the proposal made by Liberal Secretary Costa, in an interview -- yes to a reshuffle, but only if it guarantees new "substance" to the government program and therefore sets the elections back by a few months, to June. Pannella rejects this argument: Nothing bugs him more than being described as the leader of the "postponement party." "Moreover," PDS constitutionalist Augusto Barbera commented, "if there is to be a reshuffle, it can only be a merely technical one. In our present situation political choices would create too many problems. If that happened, who can say whether we should move to the right or left in order to strengthen Ciampi?"
