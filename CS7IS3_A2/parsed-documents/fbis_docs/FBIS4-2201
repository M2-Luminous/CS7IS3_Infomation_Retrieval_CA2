In its arrangements, the ministry urged the relevant departments of various localities to unswervingly implement a series of policies and measures issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council with regard to easing peasants' burdens. It also urged them to consolidate their achievements in this regard, to prevent relapse, to enhance the standardized and legalized management over peasants' burdens, to protect the economic interest of peasants, and to safeguard the social stability of rural areas to promote the increase of peasants' income and the decrease of their expenses. The six specific measures put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture are as follows: 1. Successfully grasping examination and verification. The Ministry of Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments will strictly examine and verify in line with the law the items that have been abolished or postponed for implementation by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Local supervisory and managerial departments in charge of easing peasants' burdens at all levels should actively coordinate with the relevant departments to implement in a down-to-earth manner the policies for easing peasants' burdens under the leadership of local governments. Efforts should be made to strictly check and handle documents and items related to giving burdens to peasants, which have not been approved through legal procedures. 2. Successfully managing and using the funds retained from peasants for overall projects. In line with the State Council's "regulations on the management over charges and labor work undertaken by peasants" and the provision on the 5-percent fixed volume, we should enhance auditing of specific items of peasants' burdens and prevent indiscriminate transfer and misappropriation of funds collected from peasants and from their labor work. We should achieve results in using the special fund for special purposes and having peasants take up special labor work for special projects. Efforts should be made to resolutely correct faulty collections in 10 fields, which are proscribed by the formal decree, and to improve managerial methods on these collections. No one is allowed to collect more charges from peasants by exaggerating the per peasant income. 3. Earnestly investigating and handling the vicious cases of adding to peasants' burdens. The relevant departments should strictly investigate and handle the vicious cases that occurred in their own locality in 1993 and the prominent problems exposed in the course of judicial inspection. Efforts should be made to strictly deal with the vicious cases cropping up this year so as to further safeguard the stability of rural society. 4. Carrying out consolidation over specific items. By bearing in mind the current work of anticorruption and workstyle rectification, we should conduct the management of specific items in line with the demand put forward by Premier Li Peng in his "government work report" made at the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress with regard to "continuously implementing the measures of easing peasants' burdens and carrying out consolidation over the specific items to deal with the prominent problems". We will continue to conduct judicial inspection over the work of easing peasants' burdens this year. 5. Realistically enhancing the construction of legal systems. The Ministry of Agriculture and relevant departments will firmly grasp the formulation of the "regulations on auditing the specific items for charges and labor work undertaken by peasants" and the "regulations on punishing the acts of adding to peasants' burdens". They will enforce the card system of supervising peasants' burdens and the system of formulating budget for peasants' burdens as well as gradually enforce the system of assigning full-time personnel to supervise peasants' burdens. 6. Conducting the pilot work of setting an example for and monitoring peasants' burdens. In line with the directives given by the leading personnel of the State Council, the Ministry of Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments will select counties (cities) according to their regional economic situation, which have representative characteristics, to carry out deep-rooted reform in the pilot and demonstration work in this regard. In line with the level of peasants' incomes, they will establish the network and centers of monitoring peasants' burdens so as to grasp, in a timely manner, the level of their production, business, and incomes, as well as the trends of their burdens, so that they can render service for macroeconomic policies.
