The new faction, called Encuentro Peronista Bonaerense [Buenos Aires Peronist Movement], was the idea of some 30 Peronist political leaders and trade unionists. Barrionuevo told reporters in a press conference that the main platform for the new group would emphasize "getting back to Peronist basics such as health, education and unemployment." Later, Gonzalez said the group "will work in conjunction with the public and not via the media, which only seems to cater to other interests."
