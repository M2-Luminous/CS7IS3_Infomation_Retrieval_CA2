"America is interested to see an agreement acceptable for both sides and will remain on such a position during talks with Papandreou. We look forward to today's meeting between Foreign Minister Crvenkovski and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and hope to see a fruitful discussion." Asked on possible reactions by the Macedonian Govt. in case Serbs undertake an ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, Gligorov said it would be a tragic event with consequences bigger than those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing peace and stability must be preserved and the Kosovo question must be resolved through peaceful means. Otherwise, he said, a new Balkan war would start, involving two NATO member countries, Turkey and Greece. In regard to Greek remarks on the Macedonian Constitution, Gligorov underlined it clearly states Macedonia has no territorial aspirations and intentions of interfering in any country's domestic affairs. He went on to say Macedonia has suggested signing a treaty with Greece on inviolability of present borders. "They are now bothered by our name and the fact that Macedonia will take care of cultural and other needs of Macedonians living out of the country. Let me remind that one third of the total Macedonian population lives in Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and other countries and that none of these countries are concerned by this responsibility Macedonia took on. And, the Article 108 of the Greek Constitution likewise states Greece will take care of cultural and other needs of Greeks throughout the world." He was also asked on his opinion of the loose federation of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and possibilities of Macedonia entering any federation. He said Bosnia should be re-established, as dividing on ethnic basis violates international laws and in fact approves of changing borders by force and ethnic cleansing. "We consider it is the best interest for the Balkans that Macedonia remains independent and stays out of any form of federation, as it would cause new conflicts. This means we are oriented towards integrating into European associations and wish to see the European option enforced in all Balkan countries. Any joining of countries on religious or ethnic basis would just bring about new complications. We have a great deal of mutual interests with Greece and, once emotions are calmed down in this country, there is a realistic hope we will reach a long-term agreement. That is how we view our relations with all other neighbours -- Bulgaria, Albania, and, when the war is over, Serbia, as well." Asked what terms would the possible agreement with Greece include, President Gligorov said the inviolability of borders would be of greatest priority, and all other issues Macedonia is ready to negotiate on should be discussed in a package and not separately. He also said Macedonia is "aware that both sides must be ready to compromise." As for the ability of the Macedonians to stand up to the strong Greek lobby in the world, Gligorov answered although Macedonians have no such economic and political influence and means to react at every moment, the "justice is on our side."
