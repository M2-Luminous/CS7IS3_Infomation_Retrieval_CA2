Speaking to reporters at Parliament House in Islamabad this evening, Benazir Bhutto asked the opposition to reconsider its decision to boycott the National Assembly proceedings. The government wants the opposition to make decisions in the interest of the people. She said when the Northwest Frontier Province Assembly members elected Pir Sabir Shah as chief minister, the Pakistan People's Party [PPP] accepted the decision. Now that the same members have decided to make Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao leader of the house, the opposition should accept this decision. She emphasized that everybody must follow the Constitution. Answering a question on the opposition members submitting their resignations to their leaders, the prime minister said the speaker has not received any resignation from any member. She asked the opposition leader not to speak about resignations, but to make efforts at conciliation with the government. In response to another query, Benazir Bhutto said that as prime minister and former opposition leader, I invite the opposition to return to the National Assembly. Answering yet another question, she said democracy is in the hands of the people and there is no danger to it. She said the opposition is taking these steps because it is afraid of action against it. She said that the PPP has been trying to establish the rule of law and hold aloft the rights of the people. Her government has not set up tribunals for disqualification in order to make the opposition the target of a vendetta, as the former government did during its tenure.
