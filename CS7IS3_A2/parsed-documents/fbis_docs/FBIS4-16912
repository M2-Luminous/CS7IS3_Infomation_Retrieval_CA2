FBIS4-16912 "drsov076_a_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Foreign Ministry Seen Split on Approach to Bosnia Foreign Ministry Seen Split on Approach to Bosnia LD1904182794 LD1904182794 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1625 GMT on 19 April carries a 10-minute program on the process leading up to the statement by Russian President Boris Yeltsin urging the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. Presenter Sergey Dorenko opens the program by saying that "at 1617 GMT today the Russian president's statement on the Bosnian crisis came out. You, perhaps, already know about the aggravation and about the fact that the Serbs are in direct conflict with UN forces. I wrote it down as it was dictated to me by telephone -- we have just talked with the president's press service -- and I will try to recount what I have grasped: The president said that the situation has reached a point of dangerous confrontation. The Serbs have been requested to withdraw from Gorazde immediately, to let the UN contingent pass, to unblock all UN forces, all UN contingents. Also, the Russian president's invitation to the United States and the European Community to hold a summit on the Yugoslav conflict with Russia's participation was confirmed. Signed by Yeltsin, Russian president". Dorenko goes on to update the situation in the Bosnian region and international reaction to the aggravation of the crisis. He says that "since about 1100 GMT today Moscow has been in turmoil, as we have learned from our sources. The text of the above presidential statement on the Bosnian crisis was being decided. The statement could have appeared earlier if everything had been clear regarding it. After 1100 GMT Vitaliy Churkin met [Duma Chairman] Ivan Rybkin, an hour later he was in Vladimir Shumeyko's office, at 1415 GMT he reported to his minister, Andrey Kozyrev. Before that, at 1405, he cancelled his promise to take part in our program live. Incidentally, he pleaded indisposition -- a diplomatic excuse, one should think. The Foreign Ministry was not ready for an publicly announced decision. I will venture to speculate about why there was such a big delay with the statement. The thing is that the Foreign Ministry did not have a unanimous view. We believe that Andrey Kozyrev tried to foresee the development of events and was afraid to acknowledge Russia's clear fiasco in the Yugoslav crisis, while Vitaliy Churkin, who was in charge of the Serbs and could forfeit his career because of his protegees' disobedience, said straight away that he placed all responsibility on them and described their actions as betrayal. Both Foreign Ministry officials could not ignore a third view which maintains that we must fight on the side of the Serbs. It seems that it is for precisely this reason that Vitaliy Churkin spent so much time in Rybkin's and Shumeyko's offices. His refusal to be here live shows that his stand was gaining ground with great difficulty". Further in the program, over archive footage of 'Arafat's activities, Sergey Dorenko comments on Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Moscow and its goals. He sees Russian involvement in the Middle East peace process as yet another attempt by Russian diplomacy to assert its major international standing. But the Yugoslav lessen should serve as a warning. Dorenko concludes by reminding the viewers that the program was the first to announce Yeltsin's statement on the Bosnian crisis.
