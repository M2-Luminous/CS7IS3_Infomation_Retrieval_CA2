"Today the problem is to manage the new rules of international competition, to ensure that everyone respects the trading rules set by the Uruguay Round (the round of negotiations for liberalizing trade concluded last April in Morocco -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note), while the question of tariffs is in a certain sense behind us." Ambassador Renato Ruggiero is one of the "strong" candidates for heading the WTO [World Trade Organization], the body which will replace GATT on 1 January and will work alongside the Monetary Fund and the World Bank in managing the international economy. An important job, and not just a post from which to observe worldwide economy, but a position from which "disputes" between countries in the most disparate industrial sectors will be settled. A task for which Ruggiero has received the explicit support, not only of Italy, but of European Commission President Jacques Delors, and of other countries. The question of the WTO should also be under discussion right now at the European summit which is taking place on the island of Corfu. [Cecchini] Ambassador, you are saying that the problem of tariffs has in part been overcome. Can you explain your reasons for this affirmation? [Ruggiero] The Uruguay Round accord marked the end of a cycle. The level of tariff protection in the industrial world has fallen to 3.5 percent. If one considers among other things that almost half the products entering developed countries do so at a zero rate, one gains an idea of the globalization achieved by the economy. New players are emerging in the market. The Monetary Fund calculates that in the next millennium the economy of the three Chinas will be three times the size of Germany's, twice the size of Japan's, and slightly higher than that of America. Even the European single market is small compared with such an integrated world. The reduction of tariffs in order to promote trade will continue, but today the real problem lies elsewhere: It is a question of managing the rules of international competition. [Cecchini] Will this be the task of the WTO? [Ruggiero] Exactly. The new rules of the game will serve everyone's interests. Industrialized and nonindustrialized countries alike. [Cecchini] What will the WTO's particular role be? [Ruggiero] It will have to put into practice the 18 agreements contained in the 26,000 pages which make up the Uruguay Round. For the first time 123 countries have signed these agreements, developing nations have been fully included in the multilateral trade system and have taken part in the discussions on tariffs; and trade in new sectors, such as textiles and services, will be progressively liberalized. This is a genuine and specific revolution which will inevitably call for a regulatory center. [Cecchini] And disputes? [Ruggiero] These are one of the most important chapters. The WTO will have to create a sort of international court for settling disputes, stemming regionalism, and giving itself the tools for punishing those who fail to abide by the rules of the game. The lives of thousands of companies will be radically influenced by all this. [Cecchini] An opportunity to come out of recession? [Ruggiero] In particular. It is enough to think that, with East Europe, the Far East, and part of Africa, a market of almost 3 billion consumers is developing. What does all this mean? Simply that, with a disciplined trade system, the opportunities for development are simply enormous.
