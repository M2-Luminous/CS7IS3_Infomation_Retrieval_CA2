However, capital construction across the country remains large in scale. Departments and units in some places have exceeded the boundary of their authority in approval matters and have flouted the relevant state decrees. Some have gone their own way, launching projects in a blind fashion, with the result that the "property fad" is rearing its head again, creating a very negative impact on national economic development and efforts to curb inflation. This we must view with great seriousness. Preventing blind development in property and real estate will be the focus of a reduction in the scale of fixed-assets investment and an improvement of the investment mix this year. We expect to see greater and better efforts in this regard, which will produce results early this year. Property and real estate is a new industry in our country. It has to develop healthily. The healthy development of the property and real estate industry is marked by a reasonable proportion of investment in other industries and should be commensurate with the supply capacity and market demand for capital and building materials. Based on our national situation, fixed-assets investment must focus on infrastructural facilities and industries such as agriculture, transport, communications, and energy in order to break the constraints of "bottlenecks" created by the relative backwardness of these industries on national economic development. At the same time, we must support the development of key capital and technology-intensive industries, promote upgrading the production structure, and enhance the competitiveness of products in international markets. If large amounts of social capital flow into the property and real estate industry and it is allowed to develop blindly, the development of infrastructure and industries and the revitalization of key manufacturing industries will be seriously affected, and eventually the progress of our country's modernization will be hampered. To maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, we must prevent blind expansion in the property and real estate industry. First of all, measures must be adopted to put a tight lid on the building of luxury hotels, office buildings, luxury villas, holiday resorts, and high-class amusement facilities. These building projects require large-scale investment, and, moreover, demand for them has grown soft. Vying and competing with each other, blind development and building is bound to result in serious wastage. Second, strengthen investment management. Property and real estate investment must be incorporated in fixed- assets investment and credit plans and must not go beyond these plans. Planning and management departments should reject property projects which are not incorporated and banks should refuse them loans. Third, strengthen the management of development and construction. Regardless of size, property and real estate developments must meet the requirements of urban planning and must be handled according to capital construction procedures. Land must be used with extreme care and reason, and scrutiny and approval must be done according to the relevant land use rules and regulations. Fourth, conscientiously enforce regulations on levying value-added tax on property and real estate and regulating the property market. To facilitate the healthy development of the property and real estate industry, it is necessary to correctly adjust the investment mix in the property and real estate industry. Solving housing problem for urban residents, especially families with special difficulties, and renovating dilapidated houses should be the key tasks in property and real estate development. These should be pursued in a down-to-earth manner and in accordance with the relevant state decrees, and thus we will render some practical services for the masses. We should go as far as our ability permits but pursue the job to the utmost of our ability; and we should pursue reform of the urban residential housing system under the state's centralized planning to achieve a home ownership scheme.
