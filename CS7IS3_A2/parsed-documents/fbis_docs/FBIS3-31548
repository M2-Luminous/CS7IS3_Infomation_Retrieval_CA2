A spokesman for UNPROFOR could not reveal the reasons behind the postponement of their meeting. Croatian sources assume that Gen Delic has encountered some difficulties while on his way to Zagreb. The talks between generals Delic and Roso were arranged during a recent round of the Geneva negotiations between Croat Minister for Foreign Affairs Mate Granic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime minister Haris Silajdzic. They reconfirmed this arrangement when they met in Frankfurt last Saturday. Yesterday, following their meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi at the UNPROFOR Headquarters in Zagreb, HVO generals Ante Roso and Milivoj Petkovic said that they would hold talks today with Rasim Delic and that they hoped they would sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Speaking about the possibilities of signing an agreement on the cessation of hostilites, Akashi yesterday said that this would be an historic moment in the return of peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
