This is the arena in which the five death squads of 'Az a-din Elqasem, the military arm of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], operate. Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles by the PLO and Israel, the organization has murdered 12 Israelis inside the triangle. The five squads are composed of just 15 wanted men. Six of them, who operate on the West Bank, are residents of the Gaza Strip. Five others live in Hebron, two escaped four months ago from Dahariya Prison, and Ramalla is home to three of them, including 'Abd Almon'am abu-Hamir, who killed General Security Services [GSS] Coordinator No'am Cohen. The most wanted of the 15 is 'Ali 'A'etzi, a resident of Kafr Bani Hasan, not far from Ari'el. Security officials announced this week that they believe that 'A'etzi and two other wanted men were the ones who murdered Tzipi Sason last weekend. 'Ali 'A'etzi, 30, has been active in the ranks of 'Az a-din Elqasem since the summer of 1992. With two of his accomplices, he staged an attack on an IDF unit at the Dir-Balut junction last August. His comrades were killed but he managed to get away. During the incident, Tomar David, of Kibbutz Manera, and Lev Pisahov, of Beit-She'an, were also killed. The GSS has been on his tail ever since. 'A'etzi has managed to evade a number of attempts to capture him, each in the nick of time. He joined up with a cell of Gaza residents with whom he has taken refuge most often in the Ramalla area -- in the homes of sympathizers, in mosques and in apartments rented by Hamas for that purpose. From time to time, on the basis of orders from Hamas' military command, he arms himself and goes out to kill, as he did last Friday on the Cross-Samaria highway. The security agencies stated this week that they believe that Hamas will step up its terror attacks in the coming weeks. Preliminary signs have been seen recently in Hebron: wanted men of 'Az a-din Elqasem issued flyers, used loudspeakers and posted notices on walls declaring its intention to carry out a major attack and calling on the people of the city to collect food in anticipation of an extended curfew to follow. Security officials believe that the latest attacks, especially the murder of a GSS agent, have raised the standing of the wanted men and Hamas in the territories. That fact heightens fears that they will attempt to translate the momentum of success into further terrorist actions. The mass phenomenon of wanted men that characterized the intifadah for the previous two to three years no longer exists in the territories. At the peak of the intifadah, there were some 500 wanted men on the West Bank, most of them unarmed. They won widespread public sympathy and fearlessly went about in the villages and the streets of the refugee camps. The residents gave them shelter and refuge; most of them were street leaders. Today, the IDF is engaged in a war against a well-defined and compact group. For the most part, it is the men of 'Az a-din Elqasem. Generally speaking, Fatah's wanted men on the West Bank receive a lower degree of attention. Lt. Col. Nimrod, commander of the Ramalla region, says, "Our primary task right now throughout Judea and Samaria is catching the wanted men. Liquidating them is the only thing that will bring real security to the area." The men wanted in the territories up until two years ago were small fry compared to the small group on which the security forces are now concentrating. They are all cut from the same cloth. The group's members are imbued with an extreme form of Islamic religious faith. They kill to fulfill religious commandments and are ready to sacrifice themselves. Islam promises them that such actions--including suicide missions--will grant them the key to eternal life in Paradise. The makeup of the cells--both in Gaza and on the West Bank--makes them extremely dangerous. The Gazans are more radical and more daring. In general, they also are more skilled in executing operations. The six wanted Gazans are disciples of 'Imad 'A'aqel, the commander of 'Az a-din Elqasem's cadres who was killed in Gaza about three months ago, and see themselves as carrying on for him. Their trigger fingers are lighter. As members of Hamas' military arm, the wanted men of 'Az a-din Elqasem coordinate their actions with the movement's military commands and other armed bands. The commands see that they have money, weapons, guidance and other logistical support--such as automobiles and safe houses or contact men and helpers. The 15 wanted men operate in small squads of three to four terrorists each. As a general matter, they do not stay long in any one hide-out. They shift from area to area, usually from one part to another of the Gaza-Hebron-Ramalla triangle. They generally travel in stolen Israeli automobiles bearing yellow Israeli license plates. It is known from a number of sources that the terrorists often have stuck on their stolen cars stickers proclaiming slogans associated with the settlers, such as: "The people are with the Golan." On many occasions, they have walked the streets wearing skull caps or wigs on their heads. Each of the wanted men apparently has a forged identity card. Usually, the card belongs to a Hamas supporter, the original holder's photo has been removed and the wanted man's picture affixed in its place. Some of the wanted men have more than one false identity card, some have Israeli identity cards provided by residents of east Jerusalem. Thanks to the stolen cars and the identity cards, they roam the roads. Their guns are always close at hand in case of a problem at one of the checkpoints. To prevent surprises, they are careful to travel with assistance from helpers and contact men, who usually travel the route that the wanted men plan to take and make sure it is free of patrols, checkpoints and other IDF activities. Only then do the terrorists set out. They usually travel with protection. Helpers drive ahead of the wanted men to warn of any possible danger or provide assistance as needed. The wanted men sometimes travel by taxi or bus. Such trips are usually considered safe in areas far from their homes where they are not known and unlikely to be identified. The wanted men generally shuttle between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The trip is made through various ruses. The main problem is getting past the Gaza checkpoint. Entry into the Gaza Strip is usually easier because the Israelis are more careful with exit inspections. Reports reveal that in a number of instances, wanted Gazans operating in the West Bank have managed to get past the Erez checkpoint with their weapons hidden among crates of vegetables. They find hiding places--leased apartments, a room with an activist in the organization, a room in a mosque or even a cave for a night's sleep--through contact men. These helpers are usually Hamas members among the students or the religious establishment. In January, a squad of four wanted men headed by Amjad Abu Halaf, one of Hamas' commanders in Hebron, was wiped out in a student room in the city. The house where they hid out was located near the student dormitories and leased from its owners by students from the university in Hebron. One wanted man hid out in one of the villages in the Ramalla area in the house of an old woman. She got money from Hamas for helping a "student" without knowing his true identity. Arms are not their biggest problem. It became clear this week that a single Kalashnikov is enough to slaughter six Israelis. Each Hamas wanted man has a personal weapon--usually a pistol, hand grenades or a "Karl Gustav" or Uzi sub-machine gun. Operational weapons--the Kalashnikov and the M-16, which are used for murder missions--are distributed among the squads according to plans drawn up by the command and in coordination with the planning of the murder. Ballistics tests have also revealed that an M-16 rifle held by Hamas cells has periodically gone back and forth between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and been used in a plethora of terrorist attacks. The Galilon rifle that was the personal weapon of 'Imad 'A'aqel was seized three weeks ago after a shoot-out in Palestine Square in which one of the Hamas wanted men was killed. Ballistics testing of the Galilon established that it was used in a large number of attacks in the Hebron area and the Gaza Strip. Bullets from it killed, to name just some, Lt. Col. Me'ir Mintz and three Druze Border Patrol officers, Wafa Asad, Ibrahim Shibel, and Mofa Abu-Shaykh. Kalashnikovs, M-16's or Galils in working order are very difficult to obtain even in Gaza. The price of a rifle generally runs from 6,000 to 8,000 dinars (about 20,000 shekels). As a result, these rifles are not used as personal weapons by the squad members but left in caches between attacks. IDF operations against the wanted men are based mainly on information and intelligence supplied by GSS coordinators. Such information can be obtained only through agents, in other words, collaborators. 'Abd Almona'im Alhamid Naji, the murderer of No'am Cohen, was such an agent. Over the years, he carried on a long affair with Hamas; now he is the GSS's number-one target. The newspaper ELIZATONA published at Bir Zeit University printed a photograph of 'Abd Almona'im on the front page as a "hero." Every soldier beginning service in the territories these days receives a page with 15 pictures of faces under the heading: "Wanted Hamas Men in Judea and Samaria." The photo of 'Abd Almona'im appears in the first row. The troops are requested to memorize the names, descriptions, and other identifying marks of the fugitives for future identification. Lt. Col. Nimrod: "We're putting a lot of time into operations designed to create contact with the wanted men. We close off areas without warning and stop suspicious cars at random." "As part of this activity, we've formed closer ties to the police. The specifications of every car suspected of being stolen are immediately turned over to the police, who can get them from the computer within minutes." The IDF's relentless pursuit is breathing down hard on the band of wanted men. Their homes are searched at night by the GSS. Pressure is put on their families to turn them in. Residents known as Hamas sympathizers are subjected to constant visits. Periodic searches are also made in mosques. On top of all that, undercover units have increased their activity. The small number of wanted men, their ability to get by under difficult circumstances and their superb knowledge of the terrain hinder the vast manhunt for them. But they too, not just the IDF and the GSS, know that their days are numbered.
