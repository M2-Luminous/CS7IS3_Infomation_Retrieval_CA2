The laboratory was found on 1 June in an inaccessible area between two branches of the Grande river. It had separate areas to produce and pack cocaine. In one area the drug enforcement force found 12 barrels each containing 200 liters of ether and another 10 barrels of acetone. FELCN commander Colonel Hector Frias said nobody was arrested because the traffickers fled after being alerted by a lookout with a communications system.
