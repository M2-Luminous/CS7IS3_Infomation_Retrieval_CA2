FR940811-0-00021 FR940811-0-00009 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;115&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8997; AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11 200 and 400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11 200 and 400 series airplanes. This action requires a one-time inspection to determine the tension of the control cables of the thrust reversers, and correction of the tension, if necessary; a one-time inspection of the cables to detect breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion, and replacement of discrepant cables with serviceable cables; lubrication of the cables; and reporting the results of the inspections to the manufacturer. This amendment is prompted by a report of a frayed and corroded control cable. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the control cables, which may lead to the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing. DATES: Effective August 26, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 26, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;115&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from British Aerospace, Inc., 22070 Broderick Drive, Sterling, Virginia 20166. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11 200 and 400 series airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received a report from an operator of Model BAC 1&hyph;11 500 series airplanes that the control cable of the thrust reverser was severely corroded and frayed. Severely corroded and frayed control cables of the thrust reverser could result in failure of the control cable. This condition, if not corrected, could result in the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing. Since the thrust reverser system on Model BAC 1&hyph;11 500 series airplanes is similar in design to that on the Model BAC 1&hyph;11 200 and 400 series airplanes, these airplanes are also subject to the same unsafe condition. British Aerospace Airbus, Ltd., has issued Campaign Wire 76&hyph;CW&hyph;PM6031, dated May 12, 1994, which describes procedures for performing an inspection to determine the tension of the control cables of the thrust reversers and correction of the tension, if necessary; a detailed visual inspection of the control cables to detect breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion (swelling), and replacement of discrepant control cables with serviceable cables; lubrication of the cables; and reporting the results of the inspections to the manufacturer. The CAA classified this campaign wire as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the control cables, which may lead to the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the control cables of the thrust reversers to determine the tension of the control cable, and correction of the tension, if necessary; a one-time inspection of the control cables to detect breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion, and replacement of discrepant control cables with serviceable cables; lubrication of the cables; and reporting the results of the inspections to the manufacturer. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the campaign wire described previously. This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further rulemaking.
