To end a freeze in relations that was costing French firms the opportunity to bid on large contracts in China, France was forced to promise Wednesday not to sell the Nationalist island any arms in future. China had imposed the freeze after the French sold Taiwan jet fighters in 1992. Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told his weekly press conference that Beijing "has always attached importance" to its relationship with France. "In recent years, however, the authorisation by the previous French government of the sale of arms has inflicted serious damage to Sino-French relations," he said. "We believe that as long as the two sides strictly abide by the principle underlying the estblishment of diplomatic ties and the relevant principles elaborated in the joint communique, Sino-French relations will be able gradually to improve and develop," Wu said.
