This is said in a letter which the prime minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, Jadranko Prlic, today sent to Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. The government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna also supports the agreement on lasting peace between Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and confirms its readiness to work on the consistent implementation of that agreement, the letter says. We would like the Muslim side to sign a similar bilateral or tripartite agreement on ending fighting and on peaceful negotiations in all future relations. [passage omitted]
