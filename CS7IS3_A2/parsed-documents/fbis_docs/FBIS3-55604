The high commissioner made a conditioned division of the country's non-Latvians into those who really want to integrate into the Latvian society and those who do not, and would leave the country in next five years. He estimated the second group at 10,000 persons. If somebody who lived in Latvia for a longer time failed to learn the language, his willingness to integrate into the local society as a full-fledged citizen becomes doubtful, said Van der Stoel. Van der Stoel, however, criticized the quota principle stipulated by the Latvian draft citizenship law. The doubts and uncertainty among non-citizens should disappear; they must have a clear picture of their future, he said. Ulmanis answered that he could not think about the future not thinking about the future of Latvians who also did not have clear prospects in view of the threat of being pulled back to the sphere of Russia's interests. Consequently, it is not enough to judge by the language skills on naturalization. The people brought to Latvia by force or lured in by sweet promises should be offered a chance to return home. But Latvia should receive some help to manage the complicated process, said Ulmanis.
