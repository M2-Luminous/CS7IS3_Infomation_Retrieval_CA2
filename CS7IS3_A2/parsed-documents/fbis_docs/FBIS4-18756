On Westdeutscher Rundfunk's morning magazine program today, Kinkel expressed "hope that the Serbs will now come to their senses; otherwise NATO may be forced to intervene there again." This is possible according to UN Security Council resolution 836. "We are dealing here with one of the UN's safe areas which may be protected if force is used [against it] without any further decisions [being necessary]," the foreign minister stressed. At the same time Kinkel spoke in favor of making further progress in the political field. It is of prime importance that the Russian side plays a part, he said. Kinkel called on Russia to exert its influence on the Serbs.
