The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bilateral talks dealt with Tokyo's plans to further deregulate its markets and open them up to more foreign competition. The United States is "very concerned" about Japan's actions to stimulate domestic demand and liberalize the market, the source said. A Japanese official, meanwhile, said Fujii briefed Bentsen on the latest pump-primer that totals 15.25 trillion yen and said the 6 trillion yen tax reduction envisaged by the package is "but a first step toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in the future." The talks, which will be followed by a meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers here, mark the first ministerial-level bilateral talks between Japan and the U.S. since the "framework" trade talks broke down earlier this month. The collapse of the framework talks, meant to reduce Japan's chronic current-account surplus with the U.S. that totaled 60 billion dollars last year, has led to a series of tough trade actions taken by Washington in recent days. A few days after the February 11 summit meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Washington announced plans to impose sanctions on Japan for what it perceives as limited access for foreigners to Japan's cellular phone market. In a bid to head off a U.S. trade tit-for-tat, the Japanese Government has started compiling voluntary plans to liberalize the market. The plans are scheduled to be unveiled in March.
