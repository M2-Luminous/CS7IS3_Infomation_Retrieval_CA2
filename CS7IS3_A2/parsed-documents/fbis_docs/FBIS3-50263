Apparently, problems do exist; Janos Vekas will speak about these. [Vekas] We are trying to function in the Vojvodina Hungarian community as if the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK] and the VMDK-member local government deputies formed some kind of national minority parliament. Even now, this body can be said to be pluralist: It includes everyone from the Christian democrats to the social democrats, even the socialists (but not socialists like the ones sitting in the Serbian Parliament), and the various ideological platforms. We have many differences, but we are held together by one fact, namely that we want autonomy. The VMDK's national board can be seen as an executive body, and we feel that our mandate obliges us to deal with all issues affecting the situation of the Vojvodina Hungarians. This is the reason we established the operative organizations that can fulfill certain tasks, and this is how the Vox Humana was established. Naturally, this organization deals with humanitarian aid. At the moment, this is the only reliable organization. However, we think that problems are arising that affect both the professional and the political aspects of aid. We would like to find out what proportion of the aid that is collected under the heading of helping the Vojvodina Hungarians actually reaches them. [Mucsi] What about international aid? [Vekas] We do not receive anything from the big international aid organizations. The distribution of this aid is largely done against us, regardless of what the intent of the international aid organizations is. The European Union [EU] clearly intends the aid for the refugees and for those families who host or support refugees. What happens in practice is that, for example in Temerin, the Hungarians can see the Serbs line up at the town hall and take away the bacon. Hungarians in Vojvodina are in a very delicate situation. If they, for example the Hungarians in Zenta [Senta], conditionally accept that they are hosting so-called refugees, then they can get EU-aid, but this also means forced settlement in the Vojvodina, or they exclude themselves from the aid. We have told this to European leaders. [Mucsi] What was the reaction to this? [Vekas] We did not get a direct and clear answer to this question. We collect what we can in the West through our own resources, but this is of course negligible compared to the big international aid services. However, in Hungary, parcels are usually collected to help the Hungarians in Vojvodina, or, as it were, to help the Vojvodina. [Mucsi] This is of course different.... [Vekas] We are convinced that people in Hungary generally think of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, however, the Hungarians receive very little from these packages. We would like to clarify this issue. What we can do is that, if we receive adequate information on the collections in Hungary, and it is clearly shown to whom, for what purpose, and where the aid is intended, then we can say whether the consignment has arrived at its destination. Naturally, everyone has the right to decide whom he wants to help, and for what purpose he gives the aid -- in this sense, we do not wish to prevent anyone from aiding, for example, the Bosnian Serbs. However, in our view, it is dishonest to forward the aid that is collected specifically for the Vojvodina Hungarians to some other destination.
