This Statute sets forth a series of measures to control exports of certain types of raw and other materials, equipment, technologies, and scientific-technical information that can have applications in the development of weapons and military hardware (referred to hereafter as dual-use goods and services). 2. The procedure for controlling exports from the Russian Federation of dual-use goods and services shall entail: --the preparation and issuance of authorization findings on the export of dual-use goods and services included in the List, confirmed by Russian Federation Presidential Directive No. 74-rp of February 11, 1994, of certain types of raw and other materials, equipment, technologies, and scientific-technical information that can have applications in the development of weapons and military hardware and whose export is controlled and carried out under licenses (referred to hereafter as the List); --the licensing and customs clearance of exports of dual-use goods and services. 3. All economic entities under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership, when concluding contracts for the export (transfer, exchange) of dual-use goods and services included in the List, shall be required to specify in the contract text the end users of the goods and services being exported, the purpose for which they will be used, and undertakings by the importer that the goods and services will be used solely for the stated purposes, which shall not be related directly or indirectly to the production of weapons and military hardware, and will not be re-exported or transferred to any party without the exporter's written consent. The undertakings must be specially filed by the importer with a duly authorized state agency of the importer-country for each specific transaction involving the delivery of each exported object included in the List, in the form of an international (national) import certificate or equivalent document, or, in the absence of a procedure for filing an import certificate, in the form of a document containing the undertakings specified in paragraph one of this point, with a notarized Russian language translation. 4. In the event of the absence in the importer-country's legislation of regulations relating to export controls for certain dual-use goods and services or the absence of the dual-use goods or services being imported from the Russian Federation in the national control list of the importer-country, it shall be necessary to present an official document (certification) to this effect issued by a duly authorized state agency of the importer-country. In this event, the importer's undertakings in the contract text shall constitute sufficient grounds for export. An extract from the trade register of the importer-country or other document confirming the legal status of the foreign importer in accordance with the legislation of the country in which it is located, with a notarized Russian language translation, shall be appended to the aforementioned documents. The contract text must include a mandatory provision specifying the exporter's right to verify that the exported goods or services are being used for the stated purposes. Verification of compliance with the undertakings of foreign importers with respect to the use of dual-use goods and services imported from the Russian Federation shall be organized in the procedure specified in Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government Decree No. 1030 of October 11, 1993. In the event that efforts to verify compliance with the importer's undertakings reveal a breach of those undertakings or noncompliance with them, the contract shall be subject to dissolution. 5. The obtaining of licenses for the export (transfer, exchange) of dual-use goods and services included in the List shall be mandatory for all economic entities on the territory of the Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership; this shall apply to all types of foreign economic activity, including direct production and scientific-technical ties, coastal and border trade, and barter operations, in accordance with this Statute. The export (transfer, exchange) of dual-use goods and services included in the List shall be carried out only on the basis of one-time licenses issued by the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. An export authorization finding for dual-use goods and services issued by the Russian Federation government's Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls shall constitute grounds for the issuance of a license. To obtain such a finding, the following items must be submitted to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department): A license application completed in accordance with the requirements established by the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations; a copy of the contract; a copy of the agreement between the Russian producer and the exporter (if the export of goods or services is being carried out via an intermediary); originals of the documents containing the importer's undertakings (if they are absent from the contract text) and of the importer-country state agency specified in points three and four of this Statute. The export authorization finding shall be issued no later than 20 days after the receipt of the aforementioned documents. The finding shall be forwarded by the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department) to the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and to the applicant. The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations shall send information on licenses issued on the basis of findings issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls (in an agreed-upon form) to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department). Authorization to re-export shall be issued to Russian exporters on the basis of a re-export authorization finding issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls. To obtain a re-export authorization finding, the Russian exporter shall submit to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department): notarized copies of the foreign importer's contract with the third party containing the terms stipulated in point three of this Statute, and a document that contains the undertakings that follow from the contract and that has been filed with a duly authorized state agency of the third party's country in the form of an import certificate or other document specified by that country's national legislation. 6. The temporary export from the Russian Federation of equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and scientific-technical information included in the List for demonstration at exhibits and trade shows and for advertising purposes may be carried out without licenses on the basis of a finding issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls. To obtain a temporary export authorization finding, an application shall be sent to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department) containing information on: the type of object to be exported (specifying the foreign economic activity product code) and the quantity; the purpose of export and the manner in which the object will be used; the country of destination; the name of the exhibit (trade show); the locations where the object will be used; the period of time for which the exported object will be abroad; the name and address of the Russian organization carrying out the export; the foreign contracting parties; and the name of the customs agency that will clear the object at customs, along with an undertaking by the Russian organization exporting the object to the effect that the object will be returned. A temporary export authorization finding shall be issued no later than 20 days after receipt of the aforementioned documents. The Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department) shall send the finding to the applicant for submission to the customs agency indicated in the finding. A copy of the finding shall be sent to the Russian Federation State Customs Committee. 7. The export from the Russian Federation of materials, equipment (goods), and technologies containing information that constitutes a state secret shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Russian Federation Law "On State Secrets." 8. The dual-use goods and services included in the List shall be subject to mandatory customs clearance in the established procedure upon leaving the Russian Federation. The exporter shall present the obtained license to the customs agency, and the license shall constitute grounds for clearing the object for export from the Russian Federation. When equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and scientific-technical information included in the List are temporarily exported for demonstration at exhibits and trade shows and for advertising purposes, the temporary export authorization finding of the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls shall be presented to the customs agency. The Russian Federation State Customs Committee shall submit information on the export from the Russian Federation of dual-use goods and services for which the findings and licenses specified in points five and six of this Statute have been issued to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the export control department) in an agreed-upon form. 9.
