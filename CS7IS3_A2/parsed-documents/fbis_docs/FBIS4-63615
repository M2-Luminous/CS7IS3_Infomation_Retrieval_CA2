We are now in the third year of the great tragedy of which the "Soyuz" group of the Congress of USSR People's Deputies repeatedly warned. It is time to sober up: Not only the peoples but also their leaders have had bitter experience of "salvation" apart. Now everyone sees that this is impossible. Our strength resided and will reside in the unity of peoples and territories. Our strength resided and will reside in the correct cause of mutual assistance, sincere friendship, and cooperation. Our strength resided and will reside in the clear realization that each of our peoples stands to gain more in a unified Union than without it. The restoration of a unified Union should not be seen as the restoration of the featureless dominion of the totalitarian bureaucracy. That would be a step back. The basis of the new union must be a political, economic, legal, and cultural area of multiethnic states. In that form cooperation between peoples and states will make it possible to make the best use of the wealth of natural resources, industrial potential, and possibilities of agriculture. This will ensure the highest labor productivity -- the only real basis for an increase in the standard of living and prosperity of all peoples and society as a whole. The state's coordinating role in the development of the economy should be commensurate with the acuteness of the social tasks that this state is urged to resolve by the whole course of history. By virtue of its uncontrolled laws of price formation, competition, and the activity of investment areas, the market should not be the main regulator of commodity and money relations. Only a unified army and unified state security organs can be the guarantors of the state's national security. The state should provide the defenders of the fatherland with firm social guarantees. We deputies within the "Soyuz" group have not betrayed our principles and remain true to our positions to this day despite the taunts unleashed against us by many mass media. We previously advocated the preservation of the unified state, and today our main and sole objective is the restoration and strengthening of the state system, the restoration of our common home -- as a renewed union of peoples -- and the unity of all our territories. As you know, during the Second "Soyuz" Congress the group was reorganized into an all-Union association of deputies of all levels, and the "Soyuz" People's Foundation was set up. A presidium session has decided to hold the third congress of the "Soyuz" movement at the end of July 1994. We appeal to all members of the "Soyuz" deputies' group, to people's deputies past and present of all levels, to all those who support a strong, unified state -- a Union of peoples -- to step up the work of our organizational structures in the localities and enlist the public at large. Today "Soyuz" is ready to cooperate with all parties and movements that aim to revive our unified state for the sake of national peace and harmony and for the sake of the well-being and prosperity of our peoples. It is still not too late, it is still possible to restore our common home -- the Soviet Union. [Signed] G.I. Tikhonov, chairman of the "Soyuz" People's Foundation; V. Alksnis; S. Baburin; V. Varennikov; G. Kadyrov; N. Muradyan; F. Salmanov; A. Chekhoyev; V. Yakubov; B. Oleynik.
