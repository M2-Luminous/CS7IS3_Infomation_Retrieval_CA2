FR940802-0-00093 FR940802-0-00019 The regulation does not restrict aircraft access to or within national wildlife refuges. Aircraft access to and within Alaska refuges for hunting, trapping, fishing and other traditional activities will continue to be allowed. It provides reasonable restriction against shooting free ranging wolves and wolverines immediately after a person has flown in an aircraft, as necessary to alleviate law enforcement problems and protect values associated with ethical and fair chase standards. These regulations are not solely dependent on a determination that same-day-airborne hunting or trapping is detrimental to wolf populations. Even if construed as an access restriction, the Service believes the same-day-airborne prohibition is a reasonable regulation needed to protect natural and other values of Alaska refuges. The Service reviewed the administrative procedures related to the promulgation of these regulations and determined the process used does fulfill the legal public participation and closure requirements (50 CFR 36.42) related to the restriction of an otherwise allowed activity. (d) Legal Authority to Regulate the Taking of Fish and Wildlife The most prevalent objection to the proposed rule involved the Service's authority to regulate methods and means of harvesting resident game species. The State of Alaska and many Alaskans argued the sole authority to regulate hunting and trapping of resident wildlife in Alaska rests with the State. As such, they claimed the proposed rule constitutes an unauthorized and unwarranted extension of Federal jurisdiction that intrudes into the State's responsibilities to manage resident fish and wildlife. Associated arguments were presented that the proposed regulations violate Section 1314 of ANILCA by attempting to regulate harvest methods and contradicts Department of the Interior policy concerning State and Federal relationships, and the Master Memorandum of Understanding between the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Service. Our review found that the regulation is in compliance with Section 1314 of ANILCA and there is ample legal precedent supporting the Service's authority to regulate uses on national wildlife refuges as needed to ensure compatibility with refuge purposes and legal mandates, and to protect refuge resources and other values. Section 1314 of ANILCA does not diminish this authority. The Service remains committed to administering our mandates and responsibilities in a way that avoids unnecessary interference with the State of Alaska's ability to manage resident wildlife. However, the Service feels the regulation is needed because the State's revised regulation authorizing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves allows, and even invites, excessive reliance on aircraft to pursue and take wolves, which inevitably results in abuse and violations of the Airborne Hunting Act and exacerbates enforcement problems. The significant diversion of resource management funds needed to reasonably ensure compliance with the Airborne Hunting Act and other applicable laws and regulations, when State regulations allow same-day-airborne shooting of wolves, contravenes the Refuge Recreation Act. Though airplanes serve an important role as a vehicle for access in Alaska, it is evident from public comments received that most of the American public objects to the heavy and direct reliance on aircraft to locate and take wolves, and strongly supports prohibition of such activities on refuge lands. The Service repeatedly advised the State of our concerns and initiated promulgation of these regulations only after the State failed to adequately address Service concerns. (e) The Proposed Rule Is Not Based on a Biological Problem Many commenters stated that there is not a biological basis for the regulations since wolf and wolverine populations in Alaska are healthy; these species are managed by the State to ensure continued viability of populations; Service concerns about impacts to the species are speculative; and there is no data to indicate that same-day-airborne shooting of wolves constitutes a threat to wolf populations in Alaska. The need for this regulation is not based on immediate threats to wolf or wolverine populations on Alaskan refuges. The Service does not expect a significant increase in the legal harvest of wolves to result from the State regulatory allowance for same-day-airborne shooting of wolves. Only a very small portion of Alaskans participate in or benefit from whatever same-day-airborne wolf hunting and trapping opportunities the State allows. The Service is more concerned about the associated enforcement problems that will provide additional incentive and opportunity for illegal harvests and ethical problems. Furthermore, there is potential for localized impacts on refuge wolf populations, if trappers or hunters are allowed and it becomes more popular to shoot wolves the same-day-airborne. State officials indicated that same-day-airborne shooting of wolves is not intended to manage or control wolf populations, but only to provide harvest opportunity. Thus there is no biological or resource management need to allow such activities. In deciding to proceed with this regulation, the Service found, after consideration of all substantive public comment, that all problems associated with same-day-airborne shooting of wolves far outweigh the limited benefits or additional opportunity it provides, particularly when there is no biological or management need to continue such practices.
