If he utters even one word, explanations are sought from higher authorities, fearing that the word may be misinterpreted and our aid may be stopped. Pakistan's nuclear program began as a reaction to India's nuclear explosion and to guarantee our security. The world knows that our program is solely for peaceful purposes, because Pakistan has no aggressive designs. On the other hand, India has fought three wars with Pakistan, and by dismembering Pakistan in 1971 it proved that it finds Pakistan's existence unacceptable. Following the fall of East Pakistan, India is looking for the opportunity to grab what remains of Pakistan. India's other neighbors are also tired of this. The Maldives and Sri Lanka have already been the victims of its aggression and Bhutan has been blockaded economically. Except for Pakistan and China, India's neighboring countries are not in a position to challenge it. That is why India's nuclear program has a direct bearing on Pakistan. India, having been defeated by China in 1962, is unable to indulge in confrontation with China. That is why it has adopted a reconciliatory path to settle its border dispute with China. There has been no change in its designs against Pakistan, however. Even now Indian leaders are threatening a limited war with Pakistan. There are disputes between Pakistan and India over Kashmir and Siachen. India has still not accepted Pakistan's existence wholeheartedly. If India were not entangled in its own domestic problems, and if it was not afraid of Pakistan's nuclear program, it would probably have attacked Pakistan by now. It would have been very difficult for Pakistan to face Indian aggression with conventional weapons. India has increased its defense budget by 20 percent this year. Its Army is four times bigger than ours and there is no comparison between India and Pakistan in the naval field following the expansion of India's Navy. In air defense, too, India's capability is double than that of Pakistan, even though we are not weak in this field. During his term of office, General Mirza Aslam Beg disclosed that Pakistan is capable of fighting a war with India for up to 32 days. Knowledgeable sources say that this capability has decreased rather than increased with the passage of time. The only thing left for Pakistan is the nuclear deterrent, which guarantees its security and protection, but the valiant United States is dead against it. In addition to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, former Army Chief Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg admitted that Pakistan's nuclear program was capped in 1990, but the valiant United States is still not satisfied. Washington suspects that Pakistan has made further advances in this field despite capping its program; that is why it is insisting on inspection of the installations instead of securing assurances from the president or the prime minister. Nuclear inspections lead to the destruction of nuclear capability, which was shown in the case of Iraq. Ms. Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state, said this recently while testifying before a House of Representatives committee. Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, is coming to Pakistan in the first week of April to demand the same thing. The opposition has alleged that the present government has knuckled under to U.S. pressure on the nuclear program and that after having frozen the program, it will now agree to dismantle it. The statement by Kahuta Plant hero Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan hints that his hands have been tied and he is not in a position to make any further advances. Nevertheless, a vain feeling remains that we can make use of the capability we have acquired thus far at any time. It is essential that the government or some institution responsible for national security inform the nation as to whether or not it is true that the hands of the nuclear scientists have only been tied and are not going to be broken according to U.S. wishes. This is essential, because if we are deprived of this capability India will attack us immediately in the absence of any deterrent, and the lollipop [preceding word in English] that the United States wants to give us will not help in any way. Pakistan learned a lesson from its friendship with the United States in 1965 and 1971, when Washington imposed restrictions on the purchase of spares, rendering our arms and aircraft unusable. Even the U.S. demand of a one-time inspection of our nuclear installations is unacceptable, because if we accept this demand ingenuously we will be subjected to the same treatment Iraq received. The inspection will mean nothing short of the destruction of our capability. Forgoing our nuclear program for the sake of U.S. aid -- given in the form of loans with interest at the cost of our honor and security -- will be an utterly foolish act. Nations do not exist merely to fill their stomachs. Their foremost priority is to walk shoulder to shoulder with other nations with honor and dignity. By receiving a loan with interest that Washington offers us in the name of military and economic aid, we may be able to overcome our present difficulties, which are not real but are the creation of the major powers and our hostile neighbor. On the other hand, it will completely ruin our honor and fame as a daring, dynamic, and principled nation which both India and the United States fear. We must keep in mind where the secret of our strength and honor lies, because if we are deprived of it, the F-16's and the World Bank and IMF loans will serve no purpose. If we have to accept the hegemony of the Hindus and live under their domination, then why did we struggle for the establishment of Pakistan? It is the government's responsibility to remove all doubts and suspicions that have been created by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's statement.
