During a scheduled meeting with the media, Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the boat and the crew had been seized earlier "and this represents an act of piracy and kidnapping." Alfonso added that "there are certain elements that make us think this was a planned action" because the people who seized the vessel "tied up some of the crew members." The Foreign Ministry spokesman added that "the Coast Guard vessel pursued them, we fired some shots; I do not know if they also fired shots, and after a while the pursuit ended." Alfonso did not say how many people were on the boat, whether anyone was wounded, or whether some of the crew members were involved in this action. The spokesman did say, however, that the boat, and some of the crew members, are now back in Cuba. According to statements made by the escapees on arrival in the United States, there were 61 people on board. Four of them, including a child, were wounded when the Coast Guard crew opened fire on them.
