FR941021-1-00009 FR941021-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Fiscal Service 31 CFR Part 247 RIN 1510&hyph;AA44 Regulations Governing FedSelect Checks AGENCY: Treasury, Fiscal, Financial Management Service. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This rulemaking proposes new regulatory text for 31 CFR Part 247 to govern the use of FedSelect checks, a new payment instrument for use by Federal agencies in paying Federal obligations. This rulemaking sets forth procedural instructions for using FedSelect checks, and defines the rights and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks, and depositary institutions in connection with FedSelect checks. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments on this proposed rule should be addressed to Mr. John Galligan, Director, Cash Management Policy and Planning Division, Financial Management Service, 401 14th Street, SW, Room 511, Washington, D.C. 20227. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Galligan, Director, Cash Management Policy and Planning Division, 202&hyph;874&hyph;6935; or Mr. Brad Ipema, Principal Attorney, 202&hyph;874&hyph;6680. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Financial Management Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (FMS), currently offers Federal agencies two payment mechanisms for paying Federal obligations. A Federal agency may either request the issuance of a Treasury check or the initiation of an electronic funds transfer. However, the FMS will soon be making available to Federal agencies a third payment option called FedSelect, a new check instrument to be used with imprest fund transactions and other ``on-demand'' payment needs. The preferred method of payment is electronic. However, FedSelect is the FMS's response to customer needs for a new paper instrument and is to be used only when checks are deemed appropriate and consistent with FMS policy. Federal agencies that use the new payment instrument will be given a supply of FedSelect checks, on Federal Reserve Bank check stock, which are drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity, rather than the United States Treasury. Federal agencies will be able to issue the FedSelect checks on site in payment for United States obligations. These proposed regulations set forth procedural instructions for using FedSelect checks, and define the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks, and financial institutions in connection with FedSelect checks. These rules for FedSelect checks differ from those applying to Treasury checks in three important ways. First, FedSelect checks will be negotiable for 90 or 120 days, whereas Treasury checks are payable for 1 year after issuance. Second, Federal agencies can at their own discretion stop payment on a FedSelect check. Stop payment orders generally are not available on Treasury checks. Third, the regulations governing Treasury checks are inapplicable to FedSelect checks, unless otherwise provided by statute or this proposed rule. In all matters not addressed by these proposed regulations, FedSelect checks will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, as drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and by Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210) and Regulation CC (12 CFR Part 229) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
