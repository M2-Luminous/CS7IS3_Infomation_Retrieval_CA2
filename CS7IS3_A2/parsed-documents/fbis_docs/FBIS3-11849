[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] As for the accusations leveled by certain media against the church, as well as a campaign to discredit it, Monsignor Nel Beltran Santamaria today said he forgives his enemies, adding that he does not harbor any feelings of bitterness, resentment, or revenge. [Beltran] Let us seek the truth. I especially urge the media to seek the truth. Let us speak the truth. Truth will make us free. Truth is light. Death is only present in darkness. [Reporter] The bishop today said at the public square in Sincelejo that never before in his long career as bishop had he had enemies within or outside the church. The monsignor urged his parishioners to pray for those who accused him of having participated in a guerrilla summit. Evil is not stronger than good, monsignor added. [end recording] Meanwhile, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today clarified his office's position regarding the case of the bishop being in Cuba: [Begin recording] [Reporter] De Greiff said this morning that his office has never been deceived. He explained that the Prosecutor General's Office has evidence -- evidence that includes testimonies and documents -- which proves a church representative was involved in a guerrilla summit in Havana, Cuba. [De Greiff] Whether I should recant is not an issue here. The Prosecutor General's Office cannot base its opinion on anything but the evidence it has. As I told you, we have such evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence countering this evidence is respectable. We will have to compare their evidence to ours. As for the case of the bishop, we have decided that this not our responsibility. [end recording] De Greiff also said his evidence will have to be compared with the evidence of other investigative organizations to determine which is genuine. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General's Office said Bishop Nel Beltran is not the person in question, as has been claimed from the very beginning. [Begin recording] [Reporter] Is it necessarily Nel Beltran? [De Greiff] Not necessarily. One piece of evidence involves a priest. Like I said, this is only one piece of evidence. The integrity of this evidence has yet to be determined. [end recording] After comparing all of the evidence, the Prosecutor General's Office will present documents to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal, the organization in charge of investigating church representatives.
