FR941021-1-00034 FR941021-1-00009 The AMA Report recommends the same near visual acuity standards for all three classes of medical certification: a near vision of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses. In addition, the AMA Report recommends, at age 50 or older, a near vision standard of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at both 16 inches and 32 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses. Additional requirements are imposed after age 50 because, with age, the eye loses the ability to accommodate for close viewing distances, a condition called ``presbyopia.'' The AMA Report states: It is important while piloting to be able to see clearly at close distances, as when looking at maps, and at intermediate distances, as when viewing the instrument panel. This is especially important in night flying. Diminished intermediate visual acuity due to presbyopia in an individual 50 years of age or older may be further compromised by bifocal correction. Trifocal or progressive power lenses may be necessary for clear vision at distance, intermediate, and near. The AMA Report recommends that the appropriate necessary corrective lenses must be worn while exercising the privileges of the certificate. The proposed rule at §§67.103(b) and 67.203(b) follows the AMA Report recommendations except that a standard for intermediate visual acuity is not proposed for third-class medical certification (see proposed §67.303(b)). Also, the proposed rule would require only that the corrective lenses be available while exercising the privileges of the certificate. The FAA is not proposing an intermediate visual acuity standard for third-class certification in recognition of the lower level of responsibility inherent in noncommercial flight operations. The proposal does not require that corrective lenses for near or intermediate visual acuity be worn during all flight operations because this is a matter better left to the discretion of the pilot. FAA practice and the FAR currently permit airmen to exercise their certificates when any required corrective lenses for near vision are in their possession. This permits, at the airman's option, use of separate near and distance spectacles; contact lenses for distance with the addition of spectacles for near; unifocal contact lenses that correct for both near and distance; bifocal spectacles; or continuously variable focus spectacles. If the airman requires correction only for near vision, spectacles, half-spectacles, or bifocal spectacles without power in the distance portion may be used. From among these options, an airman should be able to choose his or her method of visual correction while piloting an aircraft. A requirement that all airmen wear their correction for near vision while flying would significantly and, in the absence of demonstrated problems, unnecessarily limit their choice of visual aids. The FAA has no evidence that significant operational problems are occurring with the use of corrective lenses for near vision. Therefore, the proposed requirement for corrected intermediate vision in older airmen can be met through possession of additional spectacles of the appropriate power or by use of trifocal lenses or lenses of continuously variable focus, as desired. Color Vision The current standards for first-class medical certification require ``normal color vision'' (§67.13(b)(3)); second- and third-class certification require ``ability to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green, and white.'' (§§67.15(b)(5) and 67.17(b)(3)). In current practice, applicants for certification are tested by use of standard pseudoisochromatic plates or by other approved devices. A passing score defines the applicant as not color deficient. Failure indicates a color deficiency and requires that any certificate issued be limited, prohibiting flight at night or by color signal control. This limitation can, however, be removed through the successful completion of a practical signal light test or of a medical flight test, as appropriate for the class certificate sought and the level of aviation experience of the applicant. Airmen are routinely granted second- or third-class medical certificates without restriction if they pass the signal light test. When they have the experience required for an airline transport pilot certificate and pass the medical flight test, first-class certification is granted. An experienced airman rarely fails a medical flight test given for deficient color vision. Safety is further enhanced by the thorough training and testing given airmen seeking authorization to pilot new aircraft. Through use of actual aircraft or of simulators, instructors, check airmen, and flight inspectors have an opportunity to identify and, if necessary, recommend restrictions for those individuals who encounter difficulty with color. The AMA Report states: *␣*␣* the hazard to aviation safety of anomalous color vision is not clear. No studies have shown that color deficiency has been a direct cause of accidents. On the other hand, color is an important constituent of aircraft devices such as instrument panel gauges and warning lights, and of airport landmarks, such as beacons and runway lights. The AMA Report recommends that testing for color vision remain part of the routine periodic examination of airmen. The suggested standards include the retention of ``normal color vision for first-class certification and ``ability to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green, and white'' for third-class certification. The AMA Report suggests, however, that the standard for second-class certification be changed to that for first-class. The AMA Report notes an increasing use of color in instrument displays for advanced aircraft but less frequent use of colored signal lights in today's flight environment. Despite these diverging trends and the absence of accident data, prudence dictates some continued concern for the color perception of airmen. The FAA, therefore, proposes at §§67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c) that testing at the time of the periodic medical examination be continued as recommended, but that the standard for all classes of certification be, ``Ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties.'' The standard is consistent with that of the ICAO and reflects the agency's experience and practice for many years. Tests, instructions, and scoring criteria are provided to AME's in the ``Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners.'' Certification relative to deficient color vision ultimately is based on performance. It is appropriate, therefore, that the standard be related to the job requirement and that it be the same for each class of medical certificate.
