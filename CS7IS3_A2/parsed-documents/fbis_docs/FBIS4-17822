Correspondent Vasyl Kukurichka asks Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, a member of the Ukrainian delegation and deputy defense minister of Ukraine, about his impressions of the talks. Bizhan replies: "When we arrived here with specific intentions and specific proposals with regard to resolving this problem -- I will tell you that Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy, the defense minister, and we, too, searched for all ways to carry out the instructions of our presidents. I will say that our proposals and our approaches to this matter were, well, very flexible. "In the first place we took account of the social situation and social problems, the current situation, the future situation, but unfortunately, we did not meet such an approach from the Russian side -- I am not talking about diplomats, I am talking about the military. From the Russian side we met demands that only that part of the Black Sea Fleet which will go to Russia should be based in Crimea, but Ukraine's Navy should be based beyond the boundaries of Crimea. ``I will tell you that this is not only...[pauses] well, I do not see at all how one can dictate such conditions to a state, in which the other state would like to be based. I think that the problem of where the navies will be based is, after all, not Russia's problem, but Ukraine's problem. But where the part of the Black Sea Fleet, which will go to Russia, will be based -- this is precisely its problem, and therefore it should resolve this problem, absolutely taking account of the interests of our state, but unfortunately, as I have already said, we did not see such a constructive attitude from the Russian side.''
