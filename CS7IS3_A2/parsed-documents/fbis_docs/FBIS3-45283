Provincial leaders, including Li Changchun [provincial party secretary], Ren Keli, Fan Qinchen, and others attended the forum presided over by Hu Shujian, director of the provincial party committee united front work department and vice chairman of the provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Committee. Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun first took the floor at the forum by briefing the non-CPC personages on the recently concluded Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan Provincial CPC Committee. Secretary Li Changchun also expressed the hope that all of the non-CPC personages attending the forum would show utter devotion, freely speak out, and put forth views so that the two documents adopted at the aforementioned plenary session could be amended. The two documents are: "The Henan Provincial CPC Committee Opinions on Implementing the CPC Central Committee Decision on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure" and "The Henan Provincial CPC Committee Work Report." In their speeches, all of the non-CPC personages unanimously agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan Provincial CPC Committee had been held at an appropriate moment, the two documents adopted at the plenary session are of overall guiding significance to Henan's work, and the work report delivered at the plenary session by Secretary Li Changchun on behalf of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee had realistically summed up Henan's work in 1993 and laid down both goals and guiding principles for Henan's work in 1994. [passage omitted] After conscientiously listening to a series of views voiced by the non-CPC personages, Li Changchun stressed: As we are to build a socialist market economy in 1994, we will certainly come across many more problems. However, the crux of the matter lies in economic growth. We should strive to develop the economy on the one hand and cut down outlays on the other. I hope that all non-CPC personages present at this forum will join hands in putting forth views and proposals aimed at speeding up Henan's development.
