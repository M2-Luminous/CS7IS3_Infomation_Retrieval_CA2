Garcia] [Text] Havana, 4 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban immigrant organizations are interested in holding talks with the Cuban Government to review links between both sides without discussing matters related to the country's internal situation. The Cuban-Americans have told PRENSA LATINA that whatever happens in Cuba only concerns Cubans who live there and that they would like to talk, preferably, about normalizing the relations between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad. Subjects such as immigrations, communications, family reunification and aid, the need for cultural exchange, and ways to facilitate the lifting of the blockade could be the main points discussed during the meeting, which has created great expectations in the United States, where more than 1 million Cubans live. Alicia Torres, a Cuban-American who arrived in the United States when she was four and today heads the Cuban-American Committee in Washington, has said it is time to discuss certain aspects that could contribute to normalizing the links between certain moderate political groups and authorities. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced the dialogue at the end of 1993 in New York. The meeting is expected to take place during the second half of 1994. The Cuban Government has not yet decided the date or the list of participants in the meeting in which, according to Torres, all sectors willing to participate in a respectful dialogue should participate. The Cuban Parliament has rejected, however, the participation of groups of immigrants supposedly interested in talking with the authorities but which have the support of the CIA. A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Commission has said Cuba "has never closed the possibility of reaching agreements with Cuban immigrants and has been talking with groups that oppose the Cuban political ideas, as long as those groups are not linked to the CIA or to positions that favor the blockade and aggression. [no closing quotation mark as received] Foreign Minister Robaina said some time ago that individuals linked to Miami-based terrorist organizations or those who want to give away or sell the country (Cuba) will be excluded from the talks. Robaina said the Cuban Government is willing to hold talks and establish fluent and normal relations with those segments of the community that maintain a respectful position and will not estrange themselves from their homeland. Coincidentally, Andres Romero, president of the Organization of Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organization Cubanos-Americanos por la Dignidad] has agreed that representatives from terrorist groups should not be invited to the meeting, adding that his organization rejects any attitude of confrontation or violence that could lead to a bloodshed. Extreme-right groups should not be invited to the meeting, because in Miami they oppose, in various ways, assistance to Cuba, even if it consists of medicines or powdered milk for children, he has said. We are accused of being communists, which we are not... we simply act as decent Cubans who want to help. They, however, distort the truth, saying that our shipments are sent to the government, when they are really for hospitals, schools, and nursing homes, something which has already been confirmed. Romero, one of the organizers of the fleet that on two occasions has brought humanitarian aid to Cuba from Key West, has said that during the meeting neither side should try to impose their ideas on the other, and he stressed the importance of reviewing the subject of immigration. Regarding a similar dialogue held in 1978, during which Torres was the youngest participant, she said "there have been some advancements on the challenges we had at that time. Obviously, new subjects will emerge, as times have changed since then." She recalled that under current circumstances there are more complex aspects, such as the economic situation in Cuba and the illegal departure from the country of Cuban citizens who receive the U.S. Government's protection when they arrive in U.S. waters. Both Torres and Romero have agreed that whatever happens in Cuba only concerns Cubans who live on the island and that the Cuban community abroad has no right to decide what should be done. It is a different situation, Torres said, when Cuban immigrants want to help their families, keep in touch with them, or return to their country of origin, among other things. Meanwhile, Romero has said no one abroad has a right to impose changes in Cuba and that any proposal in that regard should be made respectful of the island's sovereignty.
