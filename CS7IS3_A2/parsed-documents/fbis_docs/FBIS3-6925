The statement said that when the Kim Yong-sam "government" emerged as a "civilian government" the council expected that all of the political prisoners would be released, but none of the Japan-born Korean political prisoners has been set free. Although the abolition of the "National Security Law", an evil law making people political prisoners, has been demanded strongly, it still remains, said the statement. The South Korean authorities must scrap at an early date the "National Security Law," a leftover of the cold war era, that defines fellow countrymen as the enemy and suppresses the pro-reunification movement, urged the statement, expressing opposition to Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan.
