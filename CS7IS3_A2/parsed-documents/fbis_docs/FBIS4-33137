You have an 4-percent advantage; what does this tell you? [Samper] I am very pleased with these results because they are the first figures to appear after Caracol's exit poll on election day. The poll clearly indicates the trend favors my candidacy for the runoff election; it also shows that the people who most likely voted for other candidates before have now decided to support my proposals. Obviously, then, I am very pleased with the results. [Arizmendi] How should we interpret the statements you made yesterday? You said you would not accept any bureaucratic alliances with any minority group, with those who managed to secure minor percentages, including Antonio Navarro Wolff's movement, Miguel Maza Marquez' political group, and so on. [Samper] The whole intent behind a runoff election was never to have the process following the first election become some sort of bureaucratic free-for-all to see who could offer more to this or that candidate to form an alliance. I have a clear program with a strong social content, as the public already knows. Whoever wants to vote for my government program, be they Liberal supporters or otherwise, is more than welcome to do so. I am not willing to sit down to a bureaucratic negotiation or to accept anyone asking me how much I am willing to offer to secure the support of any candidate from the first election; instead, I believe we should be thinking in more broad terms in Colombia. Colombia needs the ideals of the majority working on the more significant issues of its future. That is where I stand, and those who would like to accompany me are welcome to do so, but not in exchange for any kind of bureaucratic offering. [Arizmendi] Does that mean you have ruled out any kind of talks with Antonio Navarro or Miguel Maza Marquez? [Samper] All types of negotiations are ruled out. I can converse with anyone now but I am not going to become involved in any bureaucratic negotiations or agreements in order to allocate pieces of the government beforehand in exchange for support. I have, essentially, a liberal candidacy and there are other independent sectors that have joined us. I hope many other independent sectors decide to support the proposals I have made for Colombia. I also hope others decide to leave the mistaken road of abstentionism and actively participate. With their support, I am sure, as the poll indicates today, I can win the runoff election. [Arizmendi] What political changes will you make as a strategy to secure the support of the Liberal Party members around the country? [Samper] Although the Liberal movement responded well in the election -- I have no major doubts about that -- the truth is not all Liberals were summoned and not all Liberals voted in many regions. During this second phase of the campaign, I am going to concentrate more convincingly on reaffirming the Liberal nature of the message I have been presenting: equality, tolerance, and social justice. Second, I am going to try and convince the independent sectors that ours is the better alternative. The country wants to take the social leap I have proposed. It wants the government to concentrate on health, education, and employment. This is why I am convinced my message must get to those Liberals who can still support my name. I call on them now and on all those independent sectors, no matter what party, that are looking for the right alternatives to support me. [Arizmendi] What is your position on radio and television debates with presidential candidate Andres Pastrana Arango and between the vice presidential candidates? [Samper] I am sending Pastrana a letter today inviting him to use the two hours of television time provided by law to hold two debates on issues of national interest. The campaign organizers would jointly select the topics. I believe Colombians want to see what differences there are between Pastrana and myself. I am convinced I have an alternative for Pastrana's proposals. Pastrana represents a conservative and respectable candidacy, given the nature of the party supporting him. He has several economic proposals that differ from mine. I represent, however, a liberal option that enjoys the support of independent sectors. If we expect the public to choose on election day, then I believe they have the right to know from what they have to choose. They have the right to know what their options are. One word says it all: election, and we must choose one of several options. [Arizmendi] Andres Pastrana Arango was here at the main studios of Caracol Network yesterday. He agreed to appear on this program, "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast, within the next few days for a debate with you on an open agenda. Would you accept this same invitation? [Samper] Of course. I believe this stage of the campaign should be for Colombians to learn what makes each of us different from the other; that is why the Constitution establishes a runoff election. In that way, the people can vote on 19 June with a full knowledge of the two alternatives. [Arizmendi] What does your security plan include exactly? You mentioned it yesterday outside an Immediate Attention Center in Bogota where there were a large number of citizens protesting against a gang of criminals who had spread fear throughout the capital. [Samper] In addition to the country's problems with the guerrilla movements, there are also serious problems with the public security system, something which is true for Medellin and other cities as well as Santa fe de Bogota. Colombian cities have almost become the most unsafe in the world; this is why we have had a group of experts at campaign headquarters working on a civil protection bill for the past few months. That is what I presented in Santa Fe de Bogota yesterday, and I am on my way now to present it in Medellin. In essence, it states the following: 1. We have to increase the number of policemen on the force. Security will undoubtedly improve with more policemen; obviously, the police force must be more committed to the community and it must be a more moralized force. We must realize we cannot cover all of our cities with the current number of policemen. 2. We have to improve the communications network of the police force. A police force without a communication network is ineffective anywhere in the world; in addition, their communications network must extend even further to include other options. In Santa Fe de Bogota, for example, taxis have agreed to link their network with the police, making each cab a civilian patrol car. There are 10,000 taxi drivers with their eyes on the city. 3. We must create an elite police force to counter those crimes that hurt the community the most. Just as we have special forces for abductions and drug trafficking, we need a special force to fight rape, murder, and muggings. 4. The bill also proposes a restoral of penalties for certain activities. We propose penalizing actions that have nearly institutionalized juvenile delinquency. Given we can only arrest a juvenile for a crime involving more than 1 million pesos, these criminals have been vigilant in remaining below that ceiling, and they do as they please. We must restore the penalties for crimes such as these while including rehabilitation programs. 5. The proposed civil protection bill also provides for community involvement. If the community does not become involved in the problem, there is no way to effectively protect the cities. There are several new ways of organizing the community. [Arizmendi] You said you are going to Medellin. The Liberal Party leaders, legislators, and political heads have issued a statement in which they ask you to reinstate the debate system in Antioquia Department to include acting senators, deputies, and council members; furthermore, they have asked that the Liberal Party's ideology and symbols be used more enterprisingly during this second phase of the campaign. What will your proposal or your response be to the Liberal Party's leaders in Antioquia Department? [Samper] I am preparing that response now. I do believe we must make a more Liberal presentation of our message; after all, I am the candidate and a director of the Liberal Party, but I do not believe we should send that message out without any kind direction. We must make a commitment with Antioquia Department. What are we going to do about insecurity in Medellin? How are we going to deal with unemployment in Medellin? They have one of the highest rates in the country. How can we provide Medellin and Antioquia Department in general with a modern infrastructure that will give them access to the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts? How will we go about completing the highway to Puerto Berrio? What plans do we have to save the education system in Antioquia Department? Antioquia Department was looked up to as a model for the country 10 years ago, and now they rank 22d in the student aptitude testing program; thus, this is not a matter of telling the Liberals to vote for the Liberal Party but, rather, for a Liberal proposal for Antioquia Department instead. That is precisely what I will present in Medellin today.
