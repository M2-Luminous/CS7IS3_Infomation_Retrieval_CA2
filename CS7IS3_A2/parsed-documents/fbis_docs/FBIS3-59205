"Yes," Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said, "1,000 soldiers will go to Calabria and 500 will be deployed in Naples. We made this decision at a meeting of the national committee for public order. I also raised the issue of guarding the polling stations, a task that has been entrusted to the Army. Italy and Greece are the only two countries in Europe that use the military to guard polling stations." [Nese] Do you mean that on 27 March there will be police and Carabinieri guarding the polling stations rather than soldiers? [Fabbri] Maybe we will not have time to change anything before the 27 March elections. Starting with June's European elections, however, the soldiers should have been replaced. Guarding the polling stations requires a good 28,000 soldiers. When you consider that we sent some divisions to Somalia, others to Sicily, and now more to Calabria and Naples, it is becoming difficult to maintain our commitment for the elections. [Nese] You say that 1,000 men will be sent to Calabria. [Fabbri] Yes, they are light infantrymen from the Garibaldi Brigade who had been scheduled to go to Somalia. They will be involved in guarding high-risk targets. In this way, police and Carabinieri will be freer to concentrate on truly investigative tasks. We have called it Operation Riace, and it will have the same features as the Sicilian Vespers operation that produced very encouraging results. At the meeting, Police Chief Parisi said that, thanks to the presence of the soldiers, Sicily has recorded a 35 percent drop in the number of homicides. That is not all. The forces of order have been able to channel their energy into the fight against major crime, with excellent results. Therefore it was decided that 5,200 soldiers will remain in Sicily. [Nese] The deployment of the military was controversial. Some people have said that our towns are not Mogadishu. [Fabbri] These objections were above all raised with respect to Rome. I, however, was against putting soldiers onto the streets of Rome. As a matter of fact, we have abandoned that plan -- the mayors, judges, and the cardinals asked me to. The soldiers will be used to man the garrisons of the government buildings and important headquarters. In Calabria, spring and summer military camps will be set up. Moreover, starting next spring, the 360-strong mounted Carabinieri regiment will go on exercises in Aspromonte, and another 600 Carabinieri cadets will arrive there next autumn. [Nese] Soldiers will be arriving in Naples, too. [Fabbri] Mayor Bassolino requested it for the garrison of the new court and a few unauthorized buildings currently patrolled by the municipal police. Finally, we will keep 300 troops on the frontier with the former Yugoslavia.
