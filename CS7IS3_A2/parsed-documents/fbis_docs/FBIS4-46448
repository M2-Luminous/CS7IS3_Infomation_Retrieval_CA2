L/Cpl David Wilson, a single man from Greenock, Scotland, of 9 Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, died while guarding the RUC station at Keady, about two miles from the border, late on Saturday night. It was his first tour of duty in Northern Ireland. Another soldier suffered severe shock. Although the terrorists were at first thought to have fired a mortar at the post, police said last night that the blast was caused by a small bomb placed on a wall. Loyalist gunmen opened fire with an automatic weapon as about 200 people taking part in a Sinn Fein march made their way to a rally in Belfast city centre yesterday. The Ulster Freedom Fighters admitted responsibility for the attack in which no one was injured.
