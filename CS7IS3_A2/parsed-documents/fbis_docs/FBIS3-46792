Newtech Z II, a private computer research institute, built the dual-microprocessor, dual-Operating System (O/S) Notebook in a state-promoted "medium-tech" project over five months at a cost of 1.2 billion won (1.4 million U.S. dollars), of which 750 million won was put up by the ministry. The world personal computer market is mostly divided between IBM and IBM-compatible microcomputers and Apple microcomputers, and attempts have long been made to make the two compatible. "Computer users can now have an IBM PC and Macintosh O/S on the same computer," institute President Chong Chan-ik told reporters. The notebook has both an Intel 486-DX CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a Motorola 68030 CPU, which work together through four home-grown chips. The institute will complete a prototype by end of January for introduction at an international computer show in Hannover, Germany, in March. Production of the dual O/S Notebooks is due to begin in June to export 100,000 units, Chong said.
