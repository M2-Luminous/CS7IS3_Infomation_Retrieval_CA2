"The CP strongly objects to the squandering of R4 billion [rand] by the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral Commission," the party's finance spokesman Cas Uys said in a statement. He said the amount now had to be made up for through a five per cent levy. Mr Uys said the insufficient increase in social, military and civil pensions resulted in a further lowering of living standards in a sector of the community which, in some cases, was already below the breadline. "The budgeted shortage in the current financial year of R29.3 billion will once more result in a drastic increase in government debt," he said. He said if the government did not succeed in bringing about law and order and stability there would be no influx of capital to South Africa and its entrance to international markets would fail.
