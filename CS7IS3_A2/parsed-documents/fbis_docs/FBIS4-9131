He justified this fact by saying that, when Vacek was minister, only the Army's symbols were being repainted, but the Army had not been transformed. According to Baudys, only under his leadership has the transformation of the Army begun. The key question is what our idea about transformation is. It is certain, however, that the defense minister intends to present a long-term transformation project in the summer--one and a half years after his assuming office. From this viewpoint, the thing is clear. We should present some figures, however: The Czech Republic Army had 92,599 job positions on 1 January. According to experts, the optimum number should be 65,000 soldiers. Since 1990, 777 units have been abolished; of these, 132 were abolished last year. A total of 187 units have been newly established. The Air Force discontinued its operations at seven airports. A total of 6,594 people left the Army in 1993; of these, 4,303 were officers and 20 generals. According to Baudys, this not the right time for personnel changes.... Mr. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the Defense and Security Committee, said in an interview for RUDE PRAVO in February that, "in the three most recent years, almost nothing has changed in the Army." At the recent meeting in Harrachov, he even stressed that, if the positions of platoon, unit, and troop commanders are not filled (only 35 to 40 percent of these positions are filled), "the Army may face collapse." J. Pospisil, Baudys's deputy and Fejfar's party colleague, is rejecting this catastrophic vision, but he, too, believes that the Army is losing between 150 and 200 competent officers, who do not believe in the prospects of the military profession. The Czech Republic Army has reached the figures planned for 1996. We are not going to comment on Baudys's idea that colonels and lieutenant-colonels should take over the positions of warrant officers. I see today's situation in the following way: Fearing more screenings, personnel purges, and similar Baudys's actions, professional soldiers who have been in service for a long time are taking the first opportunity to leave the Army for civilian life. Fejfar is convinced that this applies not solely to former political instructors and military counterintelligence but also to expert professionals--for instance, elite pilots. Young people are not eager to join the Army because no one can tell them in which direction the Army will develop. Baudys's being in darkness as a minister has its effect on the Army, too. Having no concept for transformation, he cannot tell the Czech factories what orders the Army will place. It is quite possible that he does not realize that the development of a new tank takes not several months but years. He believes that the purely professional Rapid Deployment Brigade is an important transformation step. This brigade should be established on 1 July. Foreign military experts believe that such a short time is unrealistic for training the brigade. Baudys believes that it is alarming that cases of wounding soldiers, of even death cases, are on the rise. He assured us, however, that he gave the task to General Staff Commander Nekvasil to adopt efficient measures. The problem is that no simple order can solve the problem of the decomposition of our Army. If the training is at minimum, pilots do not fly the necessary number of hours, there is disorder in Army units, and military material is being stolen (the Defense Ministry registered 3,500 cases of illegal activity by soldiers). Then no wonder accidents resulting in death are on the rise, too. If Baudys says, in view of this bad situation, that the basic transformation of the Army will be completed in 1995 and the Czech Republic Army will be prepared to join NATO, this seems like palm reading to me, which the minister demonstrated in a television show directed by Simek, rather than a realistic evaluation of the prospects of the Czech Republic Army.
