FR941025-0-00028 FR941025-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9051; AD 94&hyph;22-02] Airworthiness Directives; Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 250 Airplanes Equipped With a Bendix/King KFC 150 Automatic Flight Control System AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplanes equipped with a Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control system. This action requires pulling the ``A/P'' and ``TRIM'' circuit breakers, and fabricating and installing a placard that specifies the use of manual trim only. An incident where the elevator trim spring lever of a Lake Model 250 airplane failed to return to neutral following KFC 150 automatic flight control system autotrim operation prompted this action. The resulting mistrim overpowered the autopilot and caused the airplane to deviate from its flight path. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent automatic flight control system malfunctions caused by failure of the elevator autotrim to disengage, which could result in flight path deviations. DATES: Effective November 4, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Information that relates to this AD may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger A. Souter, Aerospace Engineer, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4134; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has received a report where the Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control system malfunctioned because the elevator trim spring lever on a Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplane failed to return to neutral following KFC 150 automatic flight control system autotrim operation. This resulted in the airplane deviating from its flight path. This KFC 150 automatic flight control system incorporates a mechanical attachment to the basic airplane's trim system; the basic airplane in turn has a pilot-actuated spring-loaded lever that controls a hydraulic actuator. During the original type certification efforts of the KFC 150 automatic flight control system, a modification was incorporated that prevents the engage solenoid for the elevator autotrim servo from remaining occasionally engaged because of an opposing forced created by the spring. The modification provided a design where the spring would back-drive the servo motor, relieve the spring tension, and allow the solenoid to disengage; the solenoid engages once autotrim begins to run, and disengages when autotrim stops running. In the referenced incident, the spring lever of the airplane failed to return to neutral and the pitch trim continued to run while the KFC 150 automatic flight control system was on autopilot with autotrim operation. The resulting mistrim overpowered the autopilot and caused the airplane to deviate from the flight path. The pilot recognized the problem, disengaged the autopilot, and took control of the airplane. Initial investigation of the incident reveals that the elevator autotrim servo did not disengage because of the loads imposed by the basic airplane's spring lever. While testing and additional investigation continues in developing a modification to solve this problem, the FAA has determined that, in the interim, this Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control system should not be utilized on Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplanes. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken in order to prevent automatic flight control system malfunctions caused by failure of the elevator autotrim to disengage, which could result in flight path deviations. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplanes of the same type design that are equipped with a Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control system, this AD requires pulling the ``A/P'' and ``TRIM'' circuit breakers, and fabricating and installing a placard that specifies the use of manual trim only.
