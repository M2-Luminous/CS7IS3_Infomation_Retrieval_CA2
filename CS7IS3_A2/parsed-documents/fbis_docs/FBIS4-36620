FBIS4-36620 "drnes113_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Foreign Ministry Director on Palestinian Economy Foreign Ministry Director on Palestinian Economy TA1206094994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0405 GMT 12 Jun 94 TA1206094994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir by Me'ir Einstein; place not given -- live] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Einstein] I understand that the issue of Jerusalem and the location of the Palestinian economic authority were also discussed at the meeting of the donor countries in Paris. I believe the issue first came up in the document submitted by the PLO which stated that the economic authority would be established in Jerusalem; however, you managed to foil this intention and the economic authority will be set up in Jericho. [Savir] We told the Palestinians that we were very interested in promoting the agreement between us. We said that a great deal of time had been wasted over words and that we were facing a test, a new reality, which would require patience since things do not change for the better within a day. We said that the time had come to improve conditions on the ground, and, at the present stage, the autonomous areas were in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Second, we promised to cooperate in these efforts on condition that they complied with the framework of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. According to the DOP, all the autonomy institutions must be in the Gaza Strip or Jericho. This was stated by the Norwegian chairman at the meeting and also by Nabil Sha'th at the concluding news conference. [Einstein] It was decided at the conference to transfer $42 million to the autonomy in order to meet expenses for the next three months. What will happen after that? [Savir] Look, there are commitments to provide $720 million this year. The donor countries contributed $42 million for current expenses above the $130 million previously agreed upon. I think that at the beginning of the process, a greater emphasis was placed on investments because the various countries and their industries seek to profit from investing in joint projects by Israel and the Palestinian autonomy in the territories. I think that not enough thought was devoted to the need to give the autonomy a chance to get itself established and pay the first salaries before they can collect taxes and customs duties. Afterwards, the autonomy will have to start financing itself through taxes and its agreement with Israel. Also, investments in infrastructure will improve financial conditions. I believe that what is important is that the international community gave this agreement a very great chance for success. There are many areas of tension in the world but in this case there was a meeting of representatives from over 40 countries, led by the United States, the EC, Japan, the Scandinavian countries and others, who said that they wanted the autonomy and its relations with Israel to succeed, and the Palestinians will now have to prove that these funds will indeed be used for the development of the economy. It is important that everyone learn to equate peace with economic improvement. That is the really big test. [Einstein] When will there be another conference of the donor countries? [Savir] Approximately one month from now in Paris. This mechanism is very important not only to recruit contributions and future investments but also to monitor the auditing processes of the Palestinian economic institutions which are currently being established. At the conference, the Palestinians reported the establishment of their new economic body PECDAR [Palestinian Economic Committee on Development and Reconstruction]. The donor states insist on knowing where the money is going and what the autonomy's budget is. They are working closely with the World Bank and these issues will be examined periodically and the Palestinians realize that they had better cooperate in these processes. We should also help, because ultimately the real test lies in bringing about an economic improvement that leads to greater stability and security. Following the Israeli withdrawal and the PLO's assumption of control in the area, the Palestinian residents will want to see their lives improve. The international community will want to examine these processes on a regular basis, at least at the beginning. The atmosphere at the talks was very good. The Palestinian delegation told us that a great deal of time had recently been wasted on various statements and that we must continue implementing and promoting the DOP in the field and get back on track with regard to establishing an entirely new relationship between the Palestinians and Israel.
