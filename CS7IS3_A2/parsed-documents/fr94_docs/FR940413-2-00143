FR940413-2-00143 FR940413-2-00070 In contrast to competitive underwritings, negotiated underwritings present greater risk of abuse in the underwriter selection process. 14 Issuers may become involved not only in selecting the lead underwriter, but also in controlling other provisions of the distribution. Selection may be based on nonmeritorious considerations, creating a genuine risk that underwriters will be selected on the basis of political influence rather than the quality of the underwriter's services in distributing the securities. 15 14 Negotiated sales do present advantages. GFOA notes three: ability to delegate tasks such as document preparation, sizing and structuring to the underwriter; pre-sale period in which structure may be tailored to investor demand; and flexibility to respond to market conditions.

While some financial advisers are chosen on an issue by issue basis, others are retained to assist the issuer over a period of time. Financial advisers also are paid by the issuer, and their fees may be considered an expense of the offering. B. ``Pay to Play'' Recent reports regarding ``pay to play'' have raised concerns about the practices municipal securities dealers employ to obtain municipal securities business. There have been numerous reported instances where registered municipal securities dealers, their employees, and related parties, allegedly have made payments, political contributions, or entered into business ventures with political figures apparently to obtain the underwriting business of municipal securities issuers. Specific abuses have been alleged in several state and local governments including Alabama, 16 California, 17 Colorado, 18 the District of Columbia, 19 Florida, 20 Illinois, 21 Kentucky, 22 Massachusetts, 23 Michigan, 24 New Jersey, 25 New York, 26 Ohio, 27 Oklahoma, 28 and Wisconsin. 29 The widespread nature of the complaints concerning abuses has received considerable attention from Congress, the Commission, the MSRB, the securities industry, the media, and the public, reflecting concerns regarding the integrity, fairness, and sound operation of the municipal securities market. 16 ``Crying Cronyism, Lawmaker Seeks Alabama Ban on Negotiated Deals,'' The Bond Buyer , (February 7, 1994), at 1. 17 ``Curbs Sought on Bond Firm Contributions,'' The Washington Post , (January 14, 1994) at B2. 18 ``The Politics of Money,'' U.S. News and World Report , (September 20, 1993), at 67. 19 ``Lazard Pushed D.C. to Arrange Swaps With Merrill Lynch, D.C.
