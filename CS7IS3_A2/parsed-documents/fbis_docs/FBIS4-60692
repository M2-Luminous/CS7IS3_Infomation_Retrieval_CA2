It is a crime of piracy, something we thought Yitzhaq Rabin's government had abandoned. The paper says in its editorial of tomorrow, Friday, that such acts will apparently remain part of Israel's policy as long as the remnants of the old generation of state leaders, or the old guard, remain in power. We cannot see any country raiding the territory of another sovereign state for any reason, the paper says. AL-AKHBAR asks whether the United Nations and the Security Council would have [words indistinct] if such an act, which flagrantly violates every law and convention, had been committed by a state other than Israel. The paper hopes Rabin will think again and ask himself if the kidnapping of a Lebanese citizen, no matter what the charge, merits endangering the peace process, which had begun to bear fruit.
