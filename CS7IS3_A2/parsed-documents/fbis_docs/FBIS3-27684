And ties between the two big powers are facing a rocky period. Lin Shaowen has the details. Moscow said Wednesday [23 February] that it would expose CIA agents in Russia in retaliation for accusations by the U.S. that an American spy for Russian bought [as heard] secret documents. It is the first time that Moscow has responded since the spying case came to light this week. Aldrich Ames, the former chief of the CIA's counterintelligence network, and his wife were arrested in Washington on Monday. They were accused of spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia for nine years. The Department of Justice said that they had received more than $1.5 million for selling vital information on CIA operations and personnel. U.S. President Bill Clinton described the case as very serious and ordered an official protest to the Russian Government. Some American senators called on the government to freeze aid for Russia immediately. Moscow had no reply in the beginning. The U.S. demanded that Russia withdraw diplomats who were involved in the spying case or America would take the action themselves. But Russia would not bow under the pressure easily. It has been enjoying the limelight after its successful mediation of the Sarejevo crisis. Senior Russian officials said that the spy scandal might have been revealed to discredit the success of Russian foreign policy in the Balkan region. Russian Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said the case was a return to the psychology of the Cold War. He said that exaggerating the scandal would be harmful to relations between the two countries. Russia has recently taken a tougher stance on several issues. President Boris Yeltsin publicly criticized the West for trying to resolve major international issues without involving the Kremlin. Although the American Government is uneasy about a stronger Russia, there is not much it can do about it. Even a top White House official admitted that many vital American interests are tied up in the relationship with Russia. Washington has committed $2.5 billion of aid to Russia this year to foster its economic reform. And even after the espionage case surfaced, President Clinton reaffirmed that Washington will continue to pursue its supportive policy toward Yeltsin. Russia isn't likely to ignore the U.S. demands completely. If it wants to restore its status as a superpower, it will have to learn how to play ball according to a few rules. The U.S. and Russia were old competitors for several decades. In recent years, relations have become a lot warmer. But a lot of negotiations are going to be needed this time to keep the honeymoon going and the couple away from divorce court. For China Radio International, I am Lin Shaowen.
