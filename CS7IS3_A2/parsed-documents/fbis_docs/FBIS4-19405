This summit was preceded yesterday by a meeting of experts. The main subjects discussed were the continuation of the reorganization of public finances and economic recovery. One source of optimism for the participants is that the international prices of raw materials, and especially cocoa, coffee, and rubber which are exported by these countries, have considerably strengthened since the beginning of the year. "The franc area's financial backers will pay a total of around 24 billion French francs [Fr] this year -- including Fr5 billion from France -- to help bring about economic recovery in these countries following the devaluation of the CFA franc," a senior French official said. This is a way of stating that France and the big international institutions are moving in the same direction. Loans in CFA Francs Some people in Africa and France have openly condemned the attitude of the IMF and the World Bank, regarded as too strict because excessively theoretical. Jean-Pierre Thomas (UDF [Union for French Democracy]-Vosges), keynote speaker on cooperation funds in the National Assembly's Finance Commission, thinks in particular that "a moratorium must be established on these countries' debts. They cannot do everything at once." The keynote speaker also protested "the rumor that there might be a second devaluation." (Footnote) (A UN report published last January expressed the view that the effects of this devaluation would rapidly be canceled out by the resulting inflation.) To "halt" these rumors and to avoid discouraging the capital "which is starting to return to Africa," Mr. Thomas proposes that the loans of the French Development Fund (formerly the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation) to countries of the franc area should henceforth be paid in CFA francs. The cooperation minister is in favor of that and could even suggest it today.
