The exchange of notes came as a result of the implementation of agreements concluded at the Russo-American summit in Vancouver last April. It is intended to officially assert the high level of mutual understanding between Russia and the United states in the sphere of consular relations, to systematise and facilitate to the maximum all the visa formalities, and also to eliminate obsolete provisions which are ineffective and contradict the current spirit of cooperation. The agreement is based on the principle of issuing multiple visas for terms ranging from one to two years to a considerable share of the citizens of both countries. This refers primarily to participants of various exchanges in the sphere of science and education, officials of joint Russo-American organisations, companies and banks, businessmen, and also certain categories of officials of state institutions, making official trips. This agreement, which will take effect as of January 15, 1994, cogs in with the relations of partnership and cooperation, typical for current Russo-American relations, and pursues the purpose of further promoting political, commercial, economic, scientific, and technological cooperation, expanding contacts among people and between the public organisations of the Russian Federation and the United States, the report of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Consular Department notes.
