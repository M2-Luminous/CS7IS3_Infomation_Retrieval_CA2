The Serbian military consider this an unauthorized interpretation of the UN peace forces' mandate. According to information obtained by TANJUG from highest-level military sources of the republic of Srpska, the Serbian side has gathered considerable evidence to conclude that these individuals are Muslim soldiers involved in reconnaissance of Serbian units' positions under the protection of UNPROFOR personnel. "During the reconnaissance" the weapons of the "Blue Helmets" are turned toward the Serbian positions, though this is not supposed to happen. The military of the republic of Srpska point out that UNPROFOR's mandate is not to establish peace, but only to provide security for the humanitarian aid convoys on land. This excludes any armed reconnaissance. The Serbian side points at the fact that UNPROFOR has started building a watchtower north of Kalesija on Muslim-controlled territory, though they have no right to do so. The Serbian military warns that the Serbian side will destroy the tower if the construction does not stop. Reacting to all the events taking place in the Kalesija region, the Serbian side has issued a strict warning demanding that the UNPROFOR command observe the mandate of the peace forces in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina to the letter.
