The rules, worked out by a special group of the Securities and Exchange Council, require corporations to regularly disclose quarterly trading of their own shares, the officials said. They said firms acquiring their own shares will be barred from making buy orders at prices higher than the previous day's closing price. The regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and stock price manipulation which are banned under the Securities and Exchange Law. A company will be barred from buying its own shares for a certain period of time preceding the closing of daily trading in order to avoid stock manipulation, the officials said. The officials said the report will be submitted to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii after it is approved at the council's plenary session February 21.
