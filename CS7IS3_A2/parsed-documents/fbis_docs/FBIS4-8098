Just as the Serbs predicted, the Muslim-Croatian coalition was not made for peace, but for a new war. After the Muslims in Bosnia realized that they would not be able to reach their territorial aspirations -- which even the United States considers too lofty -- at the negotiating table, they turned to the gods of war. They think that they have more chances for success now. According to Serbian military sources, Muslim troops are getting weapons and equipment through various humanitarian operations. The NATO ultimatum and the loosening of the Serbian military ring around Sarajevo have enabled Alija Izetbegovic to transfer tens of thousands of soldiers from Sarajevo to other fronts, from where they are now attacking Serbian positions. Apart from that, since the Washington agreement was signed, nobody asks what Croatian Army troops are doing in Bosnia anymore. Through the alliance with the Muslims under the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] patronage, Croatia -- against which sanctions should have been introduced on Muslim request because of the presence of over 50,000 soldiers in Bosnia -- has become a legal participant in the war since it is now defending the borders of the future confederation. It is becoming clear now why Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, accepted this absurd union with the Bosnian Muslims, which will neither enable him to reestablish the Independent State of Croatia nor to prevent the creation of an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. On the contrary, owing to demography and to the huge capital Muslim countries have, it can be assumed that a strong Muslim state, in which Croatian children would have to learn the Koran, could reach the Adriatic Sea. It is obvious that the Croatian president was not only attracted by the promises about NATO and European Union membership for his country and by the return of Krajina to Croatian jurisdiction. He was far more attracted by the legal nature of Muslim-Croatian military actions that should bring new territories to both Muslims and Croats -- which they would share and then part. The Muslim-Croatian confederation is probably only a temporary marriage of convenience. This assumption is also supported by the meeting announced for the 5 April in Ankara between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the Turkish military leadership. The leading peacemakers, the United States and the European Union, are passively observing all this, and it is not excluded that they might help their friends by a NATO action against the Serbs under the pretext that they are protecting the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Judging by the UN Security Council resolution on the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, such a recipe can also be applied to Krajina now. It has been once again proven that the U.S. peacemaking efforts are nothing else but favoring of the Serbian enemies, or -- as Mrs. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, stated in Sarajevo -- it is yet another proof that the United States is a real friend of the Muslims. Under these conditions, it can hardly be expected that the Serbian side will accept the unequal treatment, the politics of accomplished facts in negotiations, and blackmail in connection with the removal of the sanctions. The United States should finally realize that its political and, as they are announcing, military presence is not enough to resolve the situation in Bosnia. Without the real wish to achieve peace and an active participation of the Serbian side under equal conditions, without political, economic and military blackmail, the peace in the former Yugoslavia will not have a real chance.
