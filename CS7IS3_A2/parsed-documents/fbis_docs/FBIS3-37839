First, Sergey Stankevich, on the spying matter, from a Russian perspective, how seriously would you assess the strain between America and Russia on this issue? [Stankevich] I think that mutual spying is normal, routine practice, not only for totalitarian but also for democratic states. I am absolutely sure that we have enough American spies now in Moscow, maybe now even more than before, and I see no reason to over-dramatize this particular case. I think that if we use this case as a ground for revising previous long-term agreements and relations between Russia and United States, it would bring quite serious damage, not only for our bilateral relations but for international situations also. Strategic partnership is such a thing that should be preserved by all countries. This case should not be over-dramatized. [Snow] So you don't think there is any danger that the Americans may move back to a rather sort of Cold War stance? [Stankevich] I hope that the reception, that the estimation of this case will be more moderate than maybe first reaction. [Snow] On what's been going on in the Russian parliament today, a very important session because it's giving us a clue as to what sort of an institution you are now sitting in, this pardoning of the people who staged that hold-out in the White House last year, does this mean we're going to see Khasbulatov and Rutskoy back on the streets? [Stankevich] I think yes, they will be freed in several days as far as I can understand the result of the current decision, and I think it was quite reasonable decision. One should take into account that Russian society is deeply splitted, politically, ideologically and so on. We adopted new constitution and now it's necessary to give Russian people a chance for national reconciliation. It is not a one sided decision just to give pardon to these people, Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and others, it is a package of decisions and the appeal for national reconciliation is the essence of this package... [Snow, interrupting] ...not good news though, for the man you used to be so close to -- Boris Yeltsin? [Stankevich] I think that Boris Yeltsin also in his tomorrow's speech, tomorrow he will address to the Russian parliament, also will take some measures to guarantee that national reconciliation can be possible. So I think that it will be good initiative for him and he can use this chance to make his part of the way [as heard]. [Snow] Now you're a reformist, a moderate. What's it like sitting in there with Mr. Zhirinovskiy on the far right? How far is he able to play fast and loose with what's going on in the parliament? [Stankevich] Mr. Zhirinovskiy is quite exotic maybe demonstration of some serious political affects for Russia. Russia should have maybe more national interest oriented foreign policy. It should be strengthened as a state and it is up to President Yeltsin, and up to Russian democrats to show their ability in strengthening Russian state. [Snow] That does suggest you see this institution as something that may well be able to take in hand the nationalist aspirations that this exotic Mr Zhirinovskiy has conjured? [Stankevich] Yes, I think that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is a very serious signal and Russian democrats including Russian president, should take this lesson seriously and should hear the voice of Russia. [Snow] Mr. Stankevich, thank you very much indeed for joining us.
