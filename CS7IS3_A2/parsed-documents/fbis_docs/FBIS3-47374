A message of greetings sent by the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, on the new year was read out at the meeting. Yi Chin-kyu, first vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee, addressing the meeting, said one of the most valuable achievements made by Chongnyon in its work in 1993 was that officials of Chongnyon and compatriots in Japan came to cherish deep in mind as never before the pride and honor of having and following dear Comrade Kim Chong-il as their illustrious leader. Noting that 1994 is indeed a meaningful year preceding the 50th anniversary of August 15 national liberation, the 40th founding anniversary of Chongnyon and the 17th meeting of Chongnyon, he elaborated on the main tasks of the year. He stressed that Chongnyon founded and built by the great leader should develop into an overseas Koreans organisation of chuche type unfailingly loyal to the dear leader, a more powerful and viable organisation which struck its roots deep among the Koreans in Japan, generation after generation. He underscored the need to arouse all the compatriots in Japan in the work to defend their national rights and upgrade democratic national education and vigorously conduct a drive to implement the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the Reunification of the country" as an all-compatriots one and decisively step up external activities to increase the ranks of supporters and sympathizers among the Japanese people. Officials of Chongnyon expressed their determination on the new year at the meeting. The meeting adopted a letter to Generalissimo Kim Il-song.
