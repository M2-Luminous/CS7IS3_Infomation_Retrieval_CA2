Standards in parentheses apply to vehicles sold in specified high-altitude counties. For the Tier 1 standards, vehicles are required to meet both the intermediate and full useful life standards. 2For Tier 0 standards the weight classification is loaded vehicle weight (i.e., curb weight plus 300 lb). For Tier 1 standards the weight classification is adjusted loaded vehicle weight (i.e., the average of curb weight and gross vehicle weight). 3The Tier 1 standards apply to 50 percent of a manufacturer's optionally certified 1996 model year vehicles, and 100 percent of 1997 and later vehicles. The Tier 0 standards are optional before the 1995 model year and apply to optionally certified 1995 and 1996 model year vehicles not covered by the Tier 1 standards. 4The Tier 0 particulate standards apply to diesel-cycle vehicles only. The Tier 1 particulate standards apply to all vehicles, but are phased in beginning one year later than the other Tier 1 standards. 5Five years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. 6Eleven years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
