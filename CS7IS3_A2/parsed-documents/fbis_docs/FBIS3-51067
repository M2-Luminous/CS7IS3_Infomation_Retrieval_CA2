The Foreign Office also said that there had been "considerably more" than the initial estimate of about 40 Italians staying in and around the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas near the Guatelmalan border. Most were said to be tourists traveling in groups, primarily from Milan, Rome and the Veneto region. According to the Italian embassy in Mexico City, most of the Italian tourists have by now left the town aboard tour buses directed toward the capital of the province, Tuxtla Gutierrez. The Foreign Ministry's report confirmed that of Turin resident Carla Astigiano, who had been in telephone contact Saturday and Sunday with her husband Mario Paravano, staying in San Cristobal with his business partner, Maurizio Albertini. After a call from her husband Saturday to say he and other foreigners were cloistered in the hotel, Astigiano had learned from the hotel manager that today her husband and other Italians had been evacuated for Tuxtla. She later spoke with her husband around 19.00 Italian time (18.00 GMT) and said he told her the region was heavily patrolled by the Army. According to some reports, there were six deaths and numerous injuries during the takeover of the five towns Saturday. There were no reports of deaths among civilians or tourists, and eyewitnesses said the rebels were careful not to involve civilians in fighting. Conflict between law enforcement agents and the estimated 200-300 guerrillas involved in yesterday's occupation was expected to continue after the guerrilla withdrawal from San Cristobal, a picturesque highland city with a population of about 80,000 that is a growing favorite with tourists. Although the Mexican government denies it, rebels among southern Mexico's indigenous population have been fighting a widening guerrilla war against the conditions of extreme poverty and exploitation in which they live. About one third of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Chiapas province are indigenous peoples or `Native Mexicans,' and their cause, represented by ethnic and civil rights organizations, has drawn support from the north and south American clergy loosely grouped under the `liberation theology' label. The area is also one that has been intensely studied and visited by anthropologists, some of whom have actively supported the Indios cause. But in an inquiry last summer, ANSA found that social protest, largely unheeded by Mexican officials and mostly ignored by the church establishment, was beginning to develop into armed revolt. The clandestine Zapata Liberation Front was reported to have recently made contact with remnants of Procup [Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party - Union of the People], the guerrilla organization active in Mexico in the 1970s. Even after the Mexican Army mobilized 3,000 men last May to hunt down a patrol of 40 guerrillas who had killed two soldiers, the governor of Chiapas Patrocinio Gonzalez, continues to deny that an armed guerrilla movement exists. Gaspar Morquecho of Chiltac, a group that aids the Indios in San Cristobal, said earlier this year that "an armed struggle might be beginning" adding that "the crisis is driving the Indios to the limit of their endurance." Last August, when Pope John Paul II visited Merida on the Yucatan peninsula during his American tour, the bishop of San Cristobal, Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, sent a letter to the pope warning him of the difficult conditions of the Indios in that region. Ruiz said there was a danger of "struggle and tensions" not only in Chiapas but elsewhere in Mexico with indigenous people suffering from the government's free market economic policies. The San Cristobal cardinal, a leading exponent of liberation theology has been accused by the Vatican of "doctrinal and pastoral errors." Mexican sources say that condemnation was pushed for by powerful local economic interests. "Practically without hope" was how Padre Jorge Rafael, head of the Dominican missionaries in nearby Ocosingo, an outpost on the edge of the great central American Lacandona forest, described the condition of a people who are forces to emigrate 2,000 miles away to Florida to survive. Today's dead and injured were said to have been mostly among police, in clashes said to have taken place in the villages of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas during Saturday's takeover. Not much is officially known about the Emilio Zapata Liberation Front, named after the Mexican revolutionary figure who lived from 1877 to 1919, apart from the fact that yesterday's occupation force was said to number between 200 to 300, and may have some non-Indian participants. Last July, native Mexican rights organizations criticized the Mexican Catholic church and the organization of the Pope's approaching visit, saying it "only has meaning for the government and for the church." The church "despite the assassination of Cardinal Posadas at Guadalajara, only wants to smooth things over at all costs," Genaro Dominguez, chief of the National Committee of Indian Peoples, told ANSA. (In a stunning attack on May 25, Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, an outspoken critic of Guadalajara's violence and drug culture, was shot and killed by narcotraficantes in a gun battle outside Guadalajara airport.) "If I were meeting the Pope," Dominguez said last summer, "I would tell him to seek a real contact with indigenous peoples, beyond formal meetings and without middlemen, to touch the real truth of an extremely difficult situation that is quite different from that which Papal Nunzio Girolamo Prigione is likely to give him." The `indios' continue to live with "starvation, insecurity and exploitation such as existed in the time of Porfirio Diaz," Dominguez said, adding that in the Yucatan, "the native peoples have by now been humiliated, whereas elsewhere a visit like this could create problems." Apparently, he referred to the growing rebel activity in the neighboring province of Chiapas. Press sources in Mexico City confirmed other rumors that the rebels, although they had withdrawn from San Cristobal de las Casas, continued to occupy the four other smaller villages (Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas) in the highland forest region near the Chiapas-Guatemalan border. Government forces are said to be battling with guerrillas this afternoon (local time). A spokesman for the Mexican Interior Ministry said that "if necessary the central government will take over the state of Chiapas," but argued the fighting was "an isolated phenomenon" and that the government "didn't intend to fall for the provocation of this armed group. Church authorities in the region meanwhile volunteered to act as mediators between the government and the rebels and appealed to the guerrillas to lay down their arms. The local episcopate has said it thinks the government should begin negotiations to deal with the region's severe socio-economic problems. Yesterday Mosignr Felipe Arizemendi, archbishop of Tapachula in Chiapas, warned that "the poverty and conditions of inequality in which many indigenous groups live has become a breeding ground for a real insurrection. Extreme poverty is always a threat to social peace," he said. Emiliano (NB: not Emilio) Zapata, after whom the rebels named their band, remains a symbol of indigenous rebellion against the latifundista land owners 75 years after his death. Born in 1877, Zapata, who came from a humble family, fought among the guerrillas who overthrew dictator Porfirio Diaz. A great campaigner for social justice, he never supported the revolutionary government of Francisco Madero and favored a more radical expropriation of large land holdings. Zapata's name is closely identified with the agrarian reform that has still not been completed more than a century after the Mexican revolution. In 1919, Zapata was slain in the town of Cuernavaca on orders of president Venunziano Carranza. In addition to the 6 deaths Saturday, another 10 persons are said to have died in today's fighting between the Emiliano Zapata Liberation Army and the Mexican army, sources in the capital reported. The skirmishes were said to be intense, with soldiers mistakenly firing on an Red Cross ambulance at one point. According to the Defense Ministry, the guerrillas, after abandoning San Cristobal de las Cases this morning at dawn, surrounded two military outposts about 10 km from the town. Official sources placed the number of rebels at no more than 200 but press sources estimated 400-2,000. The rebels reportedly intend to head toward the capital of the state of Chiapas at Tuxtla Gutierrez. Additional guerrilla forces were said to be continuing to hold the towns of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas. At the airport of Ocosingo, where the rebels were loading planes with supplies picked up during yesterday's occupation of San Cristobal, hungry local residents were rumored to have raided the guerrilla stocks.
