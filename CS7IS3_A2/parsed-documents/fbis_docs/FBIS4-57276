During his visit to Radio Ya today, Daniel Ortega explained that he hasn't resigned the presidential candidacy because the FSLN has not nominated him yet. He said he never had any aspirations for any post. [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN has not nominated me. Had the FSLN said: our candidate is Daniel Ortega or any other person, then I could have resigned. However, I have not resigned. I simply said what my revolutionary behavior should be. I have no aspirations for any post. [end recording] The FSLN secretary general would not discount the possibility that the FSLN would strike an alliance with another party, except possibly with Mayor Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Liberal Constitutionalist Party], because it is a Somocist stronghold. [Begin Ortega recording] The main thing is to remain receptive to a policy of alliances. We must also find the right time to strike an alliance. I believe alliances are a necessity in forming a government of national unity. I think it is paramount in promoting [words indistinct], because it is the only thing that can give this country stability, hope, and a future. [end recording] He also talked about the need for a government of national unity condensed in a program that will listen to people's hopes for solutions to socioeconomic problems. [Begin Ortega recording] I believe forging an alliance with several socioeconomic sectors is essential because these organized sectors -- namely unions, workers, and producers -- are strong. Producers are organized under UNAG [National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen] and Cosep [Higher Council of Private Enterprise]. Workers are organized under the CPT [Permanent Workers Congress] and other organizations like the Nicaraguan Workers Federation. Thus, there is a large number of organized producers and workers interested in the stability of the country and aware of the need for consensus. I believe this consensus must and can be reached through a program for national unity. [end recording] To allegations from a Sandinist faction that is accusing him of resorting to violent methods, the former president replied: [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN cannot be divided into violence and nonviolence because the FSLN is a political organization that makes decisions binding all party members. We are not a group of people where everyone makes his own decisions; we are a political force that must have a unified position. [end recording]
