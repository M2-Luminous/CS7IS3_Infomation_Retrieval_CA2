According to last week's poll, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] continues to be the foremost political force, while the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] and the PAN [National Action Party] remain in second and third place, respectively. ESTE PAIS, a monthly magazine run by journalist and political expert Federico Reyes Heroles, published the results of the latest weekly poll conducted in the cities of Tijuana, Mexico, Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Puebla. Some 320 people over the age of 18 were asked for whom were they going to vote. The results of the poll are as follows: the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon received 34 percent of the votes; the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas received about 15 percent, much lower than what he received in mid-March; and the PAN's Diego Fernandez de Cevallos received about 12 percent. The ESTE PAIS poll showed that the number of undecided voters is about the same as the number of Zedillo's voters; that is, undecided voters amount to about 33 percent. There could be many surprises to come. Other candidates garnered less than 5 percent of the votes. As I say other candidates, I am talking about the ill-named second-rate parties. In short, this is the current political scene.
