Welcome to Newsline. [Finca] Good evening. [Ascar] As I asked Mr. Goosen earlier, plans for the immediate future. I'd like to ask you again what do you think can be done to address the concerns of the civil servants as regards their pensions? [Finca] There is a task force already set up by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] for that purpose and I am led to believe that that task force is already addressing that issue. We, as the joint administrators, will be lending our support to what the task force is going to be doing. [Ascar] Rev. Finca, do you think there are any similarities between the situation in the Ciskei and the situation in Bophuthatswana not too long ago? [Finca] There are similarities, and there are, of course, differences. The similarities lie in the fact that there is a popular uprising of dissatisfaction with these Bantustan dictators. The similarities are in the fact that in Ciskei there has been, what I believe, an acceptance by Brigadier Gqozo that he can no longer control the situation and has voluntarily stepped down. [Ascar] Do you not see a pattern emerging in the independent states? Is there not a fear that this could spill over to other areas? [Finca] I don't know whose fear that is. Is that the fear of those who are in authority or is that the fear of the people? I think there is a general trend developing in our country that democracy has to be dictated to by the people on the ground. [Ascar] Rev. Finca, would you corroborate what Mr. Goosen said, that the Brigadier is in fact not under house arrest? [Finca] I'm not as conversant with the facts of what has been happening today as my colleague Mr. Goosen is. I've just come in this morning from Johannesburg. I've been attending a meeting there, so I believe that Mr. Goosen's version of what is happening will by and large be correct. He has been closer to the situation than myself, for today. [Ascar] You have been in the Ciskei today. Are you able to ascertain whether there are indeed Ciskeian Defense Force loyalists who are still supporting the brigadier? [Finca] I am not able to comment on that. I'll be going to Bisho for the first time tomorrow morning. I came in, as I say, from Johannesburg this morning, and I have never been to Bisho. [Ascar] Rev. Finca, we thank you for your participation. Thanks for joining us. [Finca] Thank you.
