"None of the parties with the possibility of winning have attained the percentage demanded by law to secure victory. Therefore, all tendencies lead to the possibility of a runoff election. The TSE already has a budget earmarked for this, and as of this very moment we are making preparations for the event," the official added. With regard to the problems or shortcomings charged by some of the political parties, he said that these can be overcome in the new election and that the TSE is willing to correct the errors that could have been committed at voting time. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the noted problems do not have serious repercussions on the final results of the election and that these are normal in any activity of this nature. With 73 percent of the votes counted, Armando Calderon Sol garnered 49 percent; Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]-Convergence-MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] coalition received 26 percent; and Fidel Chavez of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] received 14 percent. "The preliminary results clearly indicate that the tendency is in favor of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance]. It has been made clear that we continue being the choice of the Salvadoran people," said Calderon Sol. To win in the first round for the Presidency, 50 percent plus one vote is required. Whoever is elected will replace President Alfredo Cristiani on 1 June for a five-year period.
