It has now been a year since North Korea's nuclear ambitions sparked a crisis on January 1993, with Pyongyang refusing to let IAEA inspectors carry out a "special inspection" of two nuclear waste sites. Such an inspection might have provided evidence as to the nature of North Korea's nuclear program; North Korea is thought to be engaged in a program to manufacture nuclear weapons. In March, Pyongyang announced that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which it had signed in 1985, then "suspended" its withdrawal in June, a few hours before it was to become effective. The United States has been trying since last Summer to convince North Korea's Communist regime to rejoin the NPT and to agree to the IAEA's requirements. North Korea recontacted the IAEA last week; however, the agency said on Thursday that Pyongyang still rejected its requirements. The following is an interview with IAEA Executive Director Hans Blix. [Franklin] Is North Korea's attitude especially problematic for the IAEA as well as with respect to the more general issue of non-proliferation? [Blix] I would say that this is the most acute and politically most sensitive non-proliferation issue we have to deal with. The IAEA has been demanding, unsuccessfully so far, that a number of inspections which require additional information and site visits be carried out, and the case has been referred to the Security Council of the United Nations. That the inspection process should be paralyzed in such a manner is quite a serious matter. [Franklin] The CIA says that North Korea could be in possession of up to 12 kilograms of plutonium, enough to make one or two atom bombs. Is that a fact? [Blix] We do not know. The North Koreans have declared having extracted minimal amounts of plutonium (from their Yongbyon reactor). However, our inspectors have concluded that the amount declared was not the whole picture. This could be very serious if the amounts involved are substantial. It might be possible to get a better idea of such amounts by checking how long the nuclear fuel has been in place in the reactor -- whether it has been in place since the initial start-up or if it has been changed since. [Franklin] What did you hope would come out of the inspection of the two sites Pyongyang has made off-limits? [Blix] Evidence or confirmation of plutonium production there; there is no guarantee that we will be able to determine the amount of plutonium produced, however. [Franklin] If all IAEA requirements are met, will you be in a position to guarantee that North Korea is not working on a military nuclear program? [Blix] There will always be some uncertainty, all the more since inspecting the Yongbyon plant does not in any way rule out the existence of other (clandestine) facilities. [Franklin] Is it still possible to hide an underground nuclear facility from all current detection techniques? [Blix] That must be no easy task. [Franklin] But it is technically feasible? [Blix] In Iraq, we looked for an underground plant...and even though we did not find one, we remain cautious. Never, for any country, do we give a 100-percent guarantee that there is no clandestine nuclear program in operation. [Franklin] Are the cameras installed by the agency on the Yongbyon site still operational? [Blix] None of them is as their film supply is now exhausted. [Franklin] Then, is it possible that fissionable materials might have been taken out of the reactor in the meantime? [Blix] This cannot be ruled out. [Franklin] The United States, acting under a UN mandate, is currently arranging an agreement which would make it possible to reinstate the inspection scheme in North Korea. Some people say this agreement is too advantageous for North Korea. What are your basic requirements? [Blix] We do not intend to carry out any inspection that would not be significant, that is, which would not let us determine whether fissionable materials have been diverted since our previous inspection. The agreement being negotiated would be implemented in two phases, at least. First, we ask to be allowed to carry out the types of inspections we were performing on the seven declared nuclear sites last year. Then we ask for a consultation with the North Koreans on the inspection terms for the two additional [undeclared] sites. Furthermore, such inspections must take place on a regular basis in the future. [Franklin] Does fissionable material smuggling create a new danger? [Blix] This is not a very serious problem. We never found any enriched uranium when investigating the cases brought to our attention by the media. As for plutonium, the amounts involved were minimal. Likewise, we never noted a defection by any nuclear scientist from the former USSR's military machine. [Franklin] What other dangers may arise? Some of your colleagues have referred to the atom bomb as becoming a "poor man's weapon..." [Blix] More and more developing countries are reaching the technological level needed to separate plutonium or enriched uranium. There is a definite overall risk, and what matters is retaining the political will to curtail it.
