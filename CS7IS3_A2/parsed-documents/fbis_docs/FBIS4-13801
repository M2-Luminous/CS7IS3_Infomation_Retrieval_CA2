FBIS4-13801 "drnes079dd_94014" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Notes 2700 Palestinians Arrested in 2 Weeks Hamas Notes 2700 Palestinians Arrested in 2 Weeks NC2304195294 Paris AFP in English 1743 GMT 23 Apr 94 NC2304195294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Damascus, April 23 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas said Saturday [23 April] the Israeli army arrested more than 2,700 Palestinians in the last two weeks, but added its militants would still continue to attack Israelis. These arrests "which affect all those suspected of links to Hamas will not prevent more operations by the (armed wing) 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam nor the popular resistance" against Israeli occupation, Hamas said in a statement to AFP here. Palestinian sources in the occupied territories have said that the Israeli army had arrested more than 500 militants in a bid to destroy the group after it launched attacks which claimed the lives of 14 Israelis this month. The mass roundup "comes at a time when the enemy government prepares to release thousands of prisoners who don't belong to Hamas in a bid to divide the Palestinian people," the statement said. Israel is to set free around 5,000 prisoners after the signing of a final deal to launch delayed Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, which may take place in May. Israeli negotiators have rejected requests to set free members of Islamic militant groups opposed to peace. Hamas called on the London-based human rights group Amnesty International "to pressure the Israeli government into freeing immediately the prisoners."
