In Pavel Grachev's words, this position was confirmed to him by Boris Yeltsin on the eve of the trip to NATO headquarters. NATO's leading circles breathed a sigh of relief, not least because Russia does not intend to put forward any prior conditions about the program. What is left now is to wait for the signing of the framework agreement, then, apparently, the presentation document will be elaborated and after that, possibly, will come the adoption of the Statement of Intent enshrining the desire of Russia and NATO to conclude a large-scale agreement on strategic partnership outside the framework of the program. In that case the question of Russia's special role, as the West is signaling, will apparently not meet with any objections. I would like to hope that this viewpoint will be adhered to in those countries which have been reacting extremely sensitively to the problem of Russia's mutual relations with the North Atlantic Alliance. After all, Russia has every justification for such a role. In the first place it is a major European country with a mighty economic potential. Second, Russia is a nuclear power which moreover is not pursuing narrow, selfish aims with regard to its neighbors near and far. Consequently, Russia and the North Atlantic bloc simply cannot but cooperate closely in the discussion of topical European problems. That factor is increasingly beginning to be understood by sober-minded Western politicians. Many of them realize that Russia, despite the difficulties it is experiencing, remains a most important factor of regional security on the continent. That was confirmed by the speech by Czech Defense Minister A. Baudys at an international seminar in Prague entitled "Security in Central Europe -- Public Opinion." The speech expressed the idea of the need to take into account Russia's balancing role in Europe. Well, such an understanding deserves attention. Unfortunately, by no means all politicians obey commonsense logic. At the same conference in Prague Czech Deputy Foreign Minister P. Bratinka, apparently in pique at his defense minister, spoke again about Russia's attempts to restore its "sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe" which, in his words, should be resisted by a firm NATO and EU policy toward Russia. In short, what we see here are diametrically opposed approaches by two leading figures in the Czech Republic, and furthermore, members of the executive structures. [passage omitted] Varying assessments of Russia's policy are characteristic of other international meetings recently. That was clearly shown by the North Atlantic Assembly session in Oslo. For example, the representatives of the West European states and the United States finally expressed understanding for Russia's participation in peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS countries. Meanwhile, their colleagues from Estonia and Latvia, who even there distinguished themselves by their attacks on Russia, still called such participation "neoimperialism." New extremes have appeared in our as yet unbuilt common European home. It is primarily in Central and Eastern Europe that they are causing apprehension. This is the fear that the small countries might again become a target in a "geopolitical game" among the great and large powers. Is that not the reason for the extremely nervous reaction to the activation of Russo-German ties? The revived dialogue between Moscow and Bonn was yet again the reason that some familiar expressions from the times of bloc confrontation have begun to appear in the vocabulary of certain politicians. Only one piece of advice can be given to such "strategists": Do not inflame unnecessary passions. Moscow is not weaving any intrigues or hatching any treacherous schemes against other countries. It would like to be integrated into Europe as an equal partner. But such integration presupposes a consideration of Russia's interests, too, for example, access for Russian experts to work on the new "COCOM" and the renunciation of all forms of pressure regarding Russia's export of arms to third countries. Then, you see, that would also remove some of Moscow's "imperial ambitions" which various foreign politicians and the mass media are so fond of expatiating about today.
