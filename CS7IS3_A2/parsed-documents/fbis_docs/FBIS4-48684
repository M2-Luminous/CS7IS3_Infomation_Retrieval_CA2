The leadership of the negotiating team from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is still in Huambo. Eugenio Manuvakola, Jorge Valentim, and Elias Samakuva are expected to return to Lusaka only tomorrow afternoon. We learned from a reliable source that the UN plane will leave for Huambo tomorrow morning to bring back the leadership of the UNITA negotiating team. Today, the leadership of the government negotiating team held an informal meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. If the leadership of the UNITA negotiating team returns to Lusaka tomorrow, the talks will only begin after tomorrow, because tomorrow is Africa Day and it is a national holiday here in Zambia.
