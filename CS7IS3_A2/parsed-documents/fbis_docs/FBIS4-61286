In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Sergeyev said that the missiles will be scrapped at Russian plants as envisaged by the agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine and the United States and START-1 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Sergeyev recalled that under the Lisbon Protocol, Byelorussia [Belarus], Kazakhstan and Ukraine are also parties to the treaty which has been ratified by the U.S., Russia, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan. He stressed that Russia has already scrapped over 350 missiles and about 300 missile launchers. He added, however, that the implementation of the treaty depends not only on Russia, but also other ex-Soviet republics which posses nuclear weapons. Russia has signed an agreement with Byelorussia to transfer a group of strategic missile troops in Byelorussia under Russia's control. Russia is also withdrawing strategic missile units from that republic. A similar agreement was signed with Kazakhstan in March 1994. Both sides are now working on an agreement on the elimination of missile facilities.
