Using all the power of his presidential office he will work for a "yes" to membership. He expects to travel to South Africa before visiting Finland's gigantic neighbor, Russia. Much will be different with former UN official and diplomat Martti Ahtisaari as the Republic of Finland's tenth president. But not in the sense that as a result of the presidency's presently more limited powers he will content himself with the presidential role of only representing Finland. On the contrary, he exudes a desire to work and a very conscious desire to influence policy and the development of society when he met DAGENS NYHETER for his first newspaper interview since he entered office a little over a month ago. He had already acquired a new authority in his behavior when he received us in the Yellow Salon in the presidential palace by the harbor in Helsinki. He has not opted for a solemn approach, but it is already natural to address him using the formal form for "you." The 56 year old Ahtisaari still moves slowly, but has lost 13 kilograms since the election campaign and he joked about being overweight and about the impression he sometimes gives of being a little indolent and absent-minded: "You forget that I use my resources as and when they are needed. I am probably not oblivious of tactics either and know about the need for timing with international diplomacy. ``I too am in favor of more power for the Eduskunta. It is natural for the political elite to want to strengthen the Eduskunta. But at the same time there is a firm call from the people for strong presidential powers,'' he said, clearly approving and stressing that he has never been a political innocent. Despite the fact that the presidency stands above party politics, he referred as a matter of course to the Social Democrats as his party. During his first weeks as president he has built up his own staff of aides, often with UN experience, and set in motion regular discussions with the parties. When we met him he had just had a visit from the National Coalition Party. During the election campaign his criticism of the government's economic policy gave rise to questions because domestic policy does not lie within the president's area of competence. He explained his criticism by saying that it was necessary in order to distinguish him from his opponent, Elisabeth Rehn, in the final round, but said, not without some satisfaction, that the government is currently preparing tax cuts to stimulate the economy. He is happy with the favorable push from his predecessor, Mauno Koivisto, who has predicted that there will be "a better Finland" than today's Finland with its half a million unemployed when Ahtisaari's term of office expires in six years' time. "Of course the question then is whether I will be able to take the credit for this," he added. Martti Ahtisaari wants to lead Finland into the EU and wants Finland to be the first of the Nordic applicant nations to hold its referendum -- by early October at the latest: "I have nothing against Finland showing a little leadership. ``My election campaign was something of a lecture tour about the EU for which I should almost have received payment. I will undoubtedly speak out warmly in favor of membership during the referendum campaign.'' He believes in a special Nordic responsibility and involvement in the EU and wants to develop Nordic cooperation on the basis of the patterns which already exist today in the United Nations where the Nordic area is most often seen as a unit. He stressed the Nordic involvement in support of democracy and economic growth in Russia and the Baltic region: "In the EU, Sweden and Finland will have a special interest in the EU's playing an active role in developments." He admitted that there are differences in Finland's and Sweden's policies toward the Baltic region, but he prefers to stress what they have in common: "We are both deeply involved and positively disposed. That is the important thing." He is prepared to go into battle about appointments to public posts which are often viewed in Finland as a system of political rewards: "I have told the parties that I do not want to read in the newspapers that they have portioned out the appointments under consideration among themselves," he said authoritatively. "I want to be informed at an early stage and have urged the parties to look for the best possible candidates for all the posts and not just think about who they represent politically." In the context of the question of future EU membership a discussion has grown up with the parties about whether the president or the government should represent Finland. "I have to see to it that the responsibility for foreign policy does not appear divided. It would be dangerous if it looked as if it was the president who dealt with bilateral contacts with the rest of the world and the government with everything else. In relation to the EU the important thing is that I will decide who will represent Finland . Here I will be very pragmatic and decide what is most sensible in each individual case." His activism coupled with his critical distance to traditional party politics could perhaps help to regain the respect for politics which has largely been lost in Finland, as elsewhere. In addition he is striving to achieve a new folksiness in the presidency. Once a month he travels out into the country to listen to people's worries, complaints, and wishes. His wife, Eeva, goes with him. But without having any "Hillary ambitions" she has complained about the program of the first trip they made. In future she will demand that her husband must also take part in her program of visits to schools and care institutions and not simply make industrial visits. The first stories about his breakouts from presidential isolation have already begun to be heard. He went to an ordinary cinema showing of "Schindler's List" and the projectionist was so beside himself that he mixed up the reels of film. His first engagement at the presidential residence at Tamminiemi was a swing session with Count Basie's band for his circle of friends who are interested in jazz. And when an unemployed man complained during his first walkabout in the country that he needed money to be able travel to visit his fiancee he had one of his aides buy a return ticket for the unfortunate man. He was not given any cash, however. "That was probably the best thing we did," he said. Relations with Russia were once a Finnish president's most important responsibility. They were a very formal and solemn business. Now the situation has been normalized, Martti Ahtisaari stressed, mentioning appreciatively all the more relaxed contacts between local authorities and individuals. If he is worried about developments in Russia and the Baltic regions, he hides it well. Unlike the Swedish prime minister he seems more relieved that the time of shock therapy for Russia seems to be over: "When you pursue a policy of reform you have to have the people with you. You can always theorize about what you want to do. But if you want to keep a democratic system you must, in my view, take a slower reform pace," he said, pointing to his experience in the IMF's tough programs of savings in developing countries. The extremist Russian nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, had just left Helsinki when we met the president. Martti Ahtisaari said that he approved of the initiative to invite a Russian delegation to discuss the democratic terms for membership in the Council of Europe and pointed out that it is not up to the hosts to decide which deputies the Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee should choose to send. Ahtisaari's comment on Zhirinovskiy's provocative statements and behavior was short: "I think that it is useful both for Zhirinovskiy himself, his aides, and his voters to see what reactions there are to his behavior." Part of the normalization of contacts with Russia is the fact that as yet the date for a first official visit has not been set. It is even possible that Estonia will be higher up on the list of visits, even though the sensitivity here is clearly still the subject of consideration. And in any case he will -- unless something catastrophic happens in the elections -- pay a visit to South Africa before going to Russia. "My friends would not like it if I were not present at the installation of a new president on 10 May," the former UN commissioner for Namibia said. But Martti Ahtisaari, like his predecessors, is paying his very first visit abroad as the president of the republic to Sweden and will arrive on Wednesday [13 April]. The special relationship with Sweden continues to exist: "We share a common history. It is not without reason that my first state visit will be to Sweden. This is something completely natural, and I could not have envisaged anything different." Martti Ahtisaari's own relationship with Sweden is also a special one. In his working life he has been more Swedish than his Finland Swedish opponent in the presidential election. His background is purely Finnish and he found Swedish so difficult at his Finnish high school in Oulu that he had to repeat a year. But in 1960, as a 23 year old, he found employment in a Swedish aid project in Pakistan. There he learned his Swedish which is still excellent and began his work as a Nordic-based UN aid official which has been his main career since then. When he told us about his Swedish friends and his early work it was like a refresher course in the history of the personnel of Swedish aid policy. He mentioned such foreground figures as Sixten Heppling, Arne Bjornberg, Ernst Michanek, Anders Forsse, and Bengt Save-Soderbergh. He said that he had been involved in supplying idea's for Save-Soderbergh's study on improvements to UN social programs. His Nordic philosophy is founded on these experiences, and not on the work of the Nordic Council or through party contacts with Ingvar Carlsson and other top politicians. It was when he was out in the big wide world that he realized that the Nordic area is viewed as a unit. And it is through the Nordic area that Finland must work: "I have seen that Nordic cooperation is so important that the responsibility for it cannot be left to our Finland Swedish friends alone." This is why he will not simply be devoting his visit to Sweden next week to representative courtesies. He will meet Finns who live in Sweden on factory floors and in schools and will discuss the conditions under which they live in Sweden. He thinks that they should have a special position, but does not seem to want to make any capital out of their wish to be counted as a linguistic minority in Sweden. At the Foreign Policy Institute he will also deliver a lecture on Finland, its Nordic neighbors, and Europe: "But don't ask what I intend to say. We are still working on the speech and it probably will not be ready until immediately before I leave."
