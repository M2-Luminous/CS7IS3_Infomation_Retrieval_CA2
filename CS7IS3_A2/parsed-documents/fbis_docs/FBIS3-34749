Several dates have been mentioned for the signing of the Pledge and Accord document between the Yemeni president and his deputy. As a member of the National Accord Committee, can you tell us if a date has been agreed on for the signing of the document? [Al-Ansi] Contacts were held with officials in the fraternal Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan. It was agreed in principle that the signing will take place on 20 February and that the final confirmation will be made on Saturday, God willing. This is the date agreed on in principle. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, who will attend this signing? [Al-Ansi] The signing will, of course, be witnessed by the Political Dialogue Committee and the former presidents of North and South Yemen, that is Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, Judge 'Abd-al- Rahman al-Iryani, and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important clauses in this document, which has taken a long time to formulate? [Al-Ansi] The most important thing in it is its reference to the bases for building the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order. This is manifested by the bases on which this state will be established. Then there are the state's establishments and structures as represented by the Presidential Council, the government, and the Chamber of Deputies. A council has been established, the Shura Council. It also refers to the economic and administrative structures and lastly to the issue of building the armed and security forces. We regard these to be the important bases for building the state. [Abu-al-Majd] Does this document satisfy the ambitions and requirements of the two sides, that is, the president and his deputy? [Al-Ansi] This document represents the common denominator that binds all the influential forces in Yemen. As I told the Voice of the Arabs previously, the issue is not about the president and his deputy but about the country. It is the issue of developments in Yemen that might not have been understood and that probably have not been handled properly. Therefore, these developments expressed themselves in this crisis. It is true that the president and his deputy are regarded as the face of the crisis, but the latter is much deeper than this. Everyone involved in this document was motivated more by a patriotic feeling than by partisan calculations. It does not represent a specific party or specific political force but the common denominator binding all the forces that want what is good for Yemen. [Abu-al-Majd] But Mr. al-Ansi, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has said that this document might be submitted to a referendum. Could this be done? [Al-Ansi] It took us a long time to deal with this issue. We completed studying the constitutional, legal, and procedural guarantees for implementing this document yesterday. Discussion of what is required from the existing constitutional establishments took us a long time. There was a view that these establishments should support this document and that they should not be involved because implementation will be carried out through them. Their role will come after the document is signed and implementation begins. The Chamber of Deputies will have its turn when it comes to the constitutional amendments and the draft laws. The government's role will come when it lays down the plans and timetable for implementing the document. We concluded in our discussion that there is no need for a referendum. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, you said that a consultative council has been set up. Does this mean that the existing parliament is not performing its role as required or that you felt the need to create this council? [Al-Ansi] This is an extremely important question. I am glad you gave me the opportunity to explain what this consultative council is. First, regarding the name of this council, perhaps one could have found a better name than this. Discussions in this consultative council have focussed on dual legislation in Yemen. The answer from everyone was no because there is no justification for this duality. Agreement was reached from the very beginning that this council does not have any legislative responsibilities. The current parliament is the sole body responsible for legislative and administrative matters. The objective of this council is to sponsor the local government or local administration experiment and to express an opinion over the laws and judicial matters of the local government. Its main function is advisory. It has no legislative duties at all. Therefore, there is no contradiction between it and the parliament. Its existence does not mean that parliament is not performing its role as it should. This is not the case at all. The objective of this council is to represent the governorates, first and foremost, in development matters and in activating the administrative units so that they protect the interests of these units and supervise their activities. It has no legislative duties at all. It is a purely consultative council. [Abu-al-Majd] Will the assassinations that have taken place recently stop after the Pledge and Accord document is signed, and what is the fate of the Armed Forces command? Who will command the Armed Forces? This topic has been raised many times. [Al-Ansi] Regarding the Armed Forces, there is a comprehensive agreement; there are measures stipulated by the document. These urgent measures include relocating the camps that were in what was called [word indistinct] before the unity to border areas and areas that need protection. This is the first step. After that, the comprehensive step of merging the Armed Forces completely will take place, after which they will be deployed in areas where they are needed. There is total agreement among all political forces in Yemen to make the Armed Forces neutral and turn them into a force that protects constitutional legitimacy that stems from the parliamentary elections. [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we thank you and Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ansi, secretary general of the Yemeni Reform Group and member of the National Accord Committee. Thank you. [Al-Ansi] On our part, we always thank the employees of Voice of the Arabs and express through this radio station our greetings to the Arab people in Egypt and through them all the Arab and Islamic nations.
