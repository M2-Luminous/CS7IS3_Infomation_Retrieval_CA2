During his three-day visit, Zardari will be accompanied by Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan and Bashir Riaz, a former press spokesman of the prime minister. According to informed sources, the special envoy will deliver a written message of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn for the release of two armed forces personnel, employed by the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and one civilian. All of them had lost their way and strayed into the Iraqi territory during the Gulf war and the Iraqi authorities awarded six to eight years sentences to them. Utilising this first hight-level Pak-Iraq contact since the Gulf war which resulted in total devastation of Iraq, Pakistan is sending 10 to 14 tons of life-saving drugs, worth Rs[rupees] 2 million in a special C-180 flight as a special humanitarian gesture to the Iraqi people. The same plane will also carry the delegation. High level official sources told 'The News' that the delegation would remain in Baghdad from February 9 to 11. During its stay the delegation will hold meetings with President Saddam Husayn and several other Iraqi government leaders in an apparent bid to remove unnecessary tritants in the Pak-Iraq relationships including the imprisonment of the three Pakistanis. It is learnt that spadework for the Zardari-headed delegation has already been done. A C-130 aircraft is being loaded with life-saving drugs the list of which was said to have been provided by the Iraqi authorities. Foreign Office sources say that the Zardari mission will prove a great success as it will secure release of the Pakistanis and would also help remove irritants between the two Muslim countries, besides reactivating traditional relations between Pakistan and Iraq. Earlier, communicaitons exchanged between the two countries revealed that Iraqi leadership is pleased and deeply touched by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's gesture in nominating her husband as special envoy. Pakistan's ambassador to Iraq had already held lengthy deliberations with Iraqi Foreign Secretary Abdul Jabbar Al-Douri. The Iraqi response to a request from Pakistan for the release of its three nationals is reported to be 'highly encouraging' Iraqi government has also shown its eagerness to welcome the Pakistani special envoy on his arrival in Baghdad. Iraq also views it as 'welcome opportunity for dialogue' at a high level.
