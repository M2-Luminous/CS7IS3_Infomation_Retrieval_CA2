They have recently taken an oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people. The hospital staff explained that their decision was based on the fact that they are all Ukrainian citizens, and that they were tired of being hostages to circumstances, and to feeling the constant psychological pressure caused by the uncertainty of their fate. To prevent property and equipment from being taken away from the hospital, additional security was deployed during the oath. The press center report also notes that the command of the Black Sea Fleet Ochakiv Division failed to convince the officers to change their decision.
