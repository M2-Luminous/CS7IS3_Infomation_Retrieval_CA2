FBIS4-826 "drafr074_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Youth Brigade Decides To Postpone March IFP Youth Brigade Decides To Postpone March MB1704120594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1137 GMT 17 Apr 94 MB1704120594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 17 SAPA -- The planned Inkatha Freedom Party Youth Brigade [IFPYB] march through Johannesburg on Monday [18 March] has been postponed, but rolling mass action would continue at a later date, possibly Tuesday, IFPYB executive committee member Sipho Mathobela told a news conference in Johannesburg on Sunday. But he evaded questions on whether the mass action would be provocative by saying: "Mass action will take place. The date will be announced late tomorrow (Monday). It will be peaceful, very, very peaceful and non-violent." The brigade's executive committee was meeting the IFP's Executive Committee to discuss plans for the protests, he said. Mr Mathobela said the march would have to be held in Johannesburg because eight Zulu marchers were killed outside the African National Congress headquarters at Shell House in Johannesburg. He said people could decide themselves whether to take part in the stay-away and wreath-laying ceremony outside Shell House. When the IFP Youth Brigade first announced its planned week-long stay-away on Friday, PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional chairman Charles Lilowe said only journalists, students and civil workers were exempted from the call. Youth brigade members at the media briefing said they could not comment on details of the planned mass action because it was being discussed at the moment. They insisted the march would be peaceful. But the march would go ahead by force if police did not give permission, brigade PWV Regional Secretary Carter Ndlovu said.
