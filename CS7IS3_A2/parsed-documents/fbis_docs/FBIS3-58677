Is this true? [Hurd] We do not believe that an independent Kurdish state is possible. [Birand] Let us move on to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] problem. What is your government's position on the PKK? [Hurd] We are against the violation of laws. The London metropolitan police units have established a special unit to deal with PKK crimes. We are very familiar what it takes to fight terrorism. We, therefore, will not allow any acts of terror and violence within our borders. [Birand] But you are not banning the PKK? [Hurd] Our laws do not permit such a measure. This alone cannot be effective. The important thing is the effective enforcement of the laws. [Birand] You and your prime minister, John Major, met with the Turkish Prime Minister in Brussels. Did she promise you that she would be solving the Cyprus problem? Your prime minister, addressing the British parliament, said that she did make such a promise. Is this true? [Hurd] Mrs. Ciller said that she very much wants progress on the Cyprus issue. The two prime ministers share the same views on the issue. We, the British, believe that this problem has lasted for too long and that it will become more dangerous with time. Now we are faced with an opportunity. The UN secretary general is exerting efforts toward development. He is waiting for a reply, a result. The Turkish government is standing by these efforts. There is a Turkish Cypriot community and elected officials in Northern Cyprus. I hope that they will be in favor of a development as well. I hope that they will establish cooperation with the officials in Nicosia. Now is the right time. If we miss this opportunity then I am concerned for the future. [Birand] Now, you are going to be in Ankara on Wednesday [19 January] be the main topic of the talks? [Hurd] Yes this is true, I am looking forward to this visit. I want to listen to the views of my Turkish colleague, the Turkish prime minister. I would like to hear about Turkey's view on the situation in the world and the Caucasus and Turkish-European relations. This is very important. I am personally most interested in the development of these relations. I hope that Turkey's position within the European Community will progress. We will probably discuss the issues concerning Cyprus and Iraq. We have a very long agenda. I am looking forward to it. Turkey has a very significant part in British foreign policy. [Birand] Mr. Minister, I thank you. I will be very happy to see you in Ankara. I thank you again.
