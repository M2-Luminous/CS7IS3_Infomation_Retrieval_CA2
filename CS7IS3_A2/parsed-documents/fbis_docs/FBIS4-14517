I have grounds to believe that various polar forces will be represented in it and, on the one hand, this will reflect the democratic nature of the council. On the other hand, I think that each deputy, and the council as a whole, reflects the essence of his people -- the main bearers of power. Therefore, both the old and new councils will not be able to radically change foreign policy. There are factors that determine the future of our independent state, and any kind of radical changes in this or that direction will not serve the further strengthening of our independence and sovereignty. We have a concept of foreign policy, which has been confirmed by Ukraine's Supreme Council, but we should all understand that the concept is a changeable system, which should adapt in accordance with the relevant realities, but not in a radical manner. I admit the introduction of adjustments to Ukraine's foreign policy, but not radical ones, because such changes could have a negative influence on the attitude of the international community to our state, and this is then dangerous."
