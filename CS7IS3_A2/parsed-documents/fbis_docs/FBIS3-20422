But all countries throughout the world sharply subsidize grain producers, imposing tariffs and quota protection on international grain trade, which severely distorts real grain prices, affecting the growth of grain production. The Impact of International Grain Protectionism on China's Grain System The longstanding lack of restraint by basic GATT principles and provisions on grain production and international trade has severely distorted the production and international trade in grain of all countries. 1) Developed market-economy grain-exporting countries have used price supports, export subsidies, farm (grain) import tariffs, and quantitative quotas for domestic grain producers to distort world grain-market prices. 2) These grain-protection policies have brought pluses and minuses for China. The pluses are that China is a net grain importer, while grain world-market prices have fallen due to the grain-protection measures of developed grain-exporting countries, enabling China to import grain cheaply. The minuses are three: 1) Cheap grain imports are a blow to domestic grain producers and add to our national financial burden. Until grain is deregulated, this impact will be somewhat less, as grain prices are set by the state, cutting the impact of world grain-market price variations on China. But once our grain market is deregulated, with grain-market prices being determined by supply and demand, cheap grain imports will be even more of a blow to our grain producers. 2) China is generally a net farm-product exporter. While developed market-economy countries can acquire certain advantages from grain imports for domestic production and trade protection, other farm-product export opportunities and export earnings will drop, which is generally a minus for China. 3) Grain-protection policies will add to China's grain-market price instability, mainly because once China deregulates its grain market, our domestic market will have to link up with overseas markets. Overseas market volatility will spill over very easily to our domestic market, thus touching off domestic-market price instability. The Impact of GATT Membership on China's Grain System 1. The Positive Impact 1. The ultimate objective of GATT negotiations is to effect worldwide free trade, which is the only way to ensure the most efficient disposition of resources on a global scale. But trade protection interferes with this efficient disposition of resources. A UN Food and Agriculture Organization's simulated study results show that if all developed market-economy countries completely lifted all of their trade restrictions, prices would rise 20 percent for wheat, 16 percent for coarse food grain (such as maize, sorghum, and millet as distinct from wheat and rice), and 14 percent for (husked) rice. Except for the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if all wheat-trading countries adopted free trade, world wheat prices would go up 11 percent, with market price volatility down 35 percent. Based on this simulated study, once China joins the GATT, if developed grain-exporting countries could lift their trade restrictions (which would be extremely difficult), grain prices would generally rise, which would be a plus for China's grain producers. But if China simultaneously lifted its trade restrictions, conceding some of our domestic grain market, particularly while China's grain costs or prices were higher than world market prices, large amounts of overseas grain would pour in, shocking China's grain market, which might have a negative impact on our producers. 2. As grain protection eases in degree, the general rise in farm product and grain prices not only will raise farm product export earnings (with China being generally a net farm-product exporter), but also might indirectly raise peasant income, which may increase investment in grain. So China's grain production can take advantage of this opportunity to speed up grain development. 2. The Negative Impact 1. As farm tariff protection weakens and nontariff barriers are dismantled, our domestic grain market will necessarily open wider, with GATT member nations exploiting the opportunity to grab China's grain market, which will have a crucial impact on China's overall balance of grain supply and demand. Particularly as China has not yet completed the conversion from a "dual-track system" to market forces or the transition in grain from a product economy to a commodity economy, Chinese grain, which is produced on a small scale, high in cost, low in labor productivity, and poor in quality, will be in a disadvantageous market-competition position with overseas grain, which is high in quality, low in cost, and high in labor productivity. 2. As control over grain imports is eased, particularly while domestic grain prices are higher than international ones, China's southeastern coastal provinces and cities (our grain-market zone) will very likely import foreign grain, which will shrink our domestic grain market, exacerbating our "grain-selling difficulties." 3. As China is a large grain importer, grain trade protection enables us to acquire grain cheaply. But as trade protection is eliminated, the general rise in grain prices will confront us with two options: 1) Paying more money for grain imports. 2) Reducing imported grain and increasing domestic grain self-sufficiency. While raising domestic grain production will require government investment in grain and higher domestic grain prices, this will mean greater sacrifices for grain consumers and domestic taxpayers, which would be a minus for consumers. Adapting to "GATT Reentry" by Intensifying Reform 1. In light of its basic principles and prerequisites, the GATT is actually a market-economy-based free trade system. In respect to this basic principle, China's grain market reforms are still sharply lagging. While over 700 counties in one-third of our provinces and cities have deregulated their grain markets, our basic system still remains a "dual-track one." In order to join the GATT, we will have to speed up our market-reform pace as, unless we complete our market reforms before becoming a GATT member, we will be unable to complete the linkup of domestic to overseas grain markets. 2. We need to link up our domestic grain market to the international grain market. This market linkup is based on China's grain-market reforms achieving the desired result, to operate through the same forces as the international market. Completing the domestic-overseas market linkup on this basis will mean doing the following particular jobs: 1) We will have to push our grain foreign trade organs and domestic grain business enterprises toward the market, by establishing a sound market network oriented to international service. 2) We need to adjust our grain product mix to raise our grain quality. While Chinese rice, soybeans, and corn are exportable, their lower quality leaves them quite lacking in world competitiveness. So we need to widen the price differences for quality, practicing a uniform international standard for export grain, and eliminating the two standards, domestic and overseas. 3) We need to import overseas fine varieties and grain production technology, to reach international standards for variety and technology. 3. We need to establish and perfect as quickly as possible China's two-level grain reserve system. As linking up the two markets will mean that international grain-price volatility will spill over domestically, establishing a domestic grain buffer reserve will help to ease the shock of international grain-price volatility on our domestic market.
