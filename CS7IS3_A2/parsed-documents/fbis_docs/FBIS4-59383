He said that he informed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of this today so that the authorities would receive this information through official channels, and not to ask Israel for approval of the Council members. He added that the Council chairman will be Yasir 'Arafat. It will include 14 members. These are: Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh Abu-Midyan, Faysal al-Husayni, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad, Ilyas Furayj, Ahmad Quray' alias Abu-'Ala', Samir Ghawshah, Yasir 'Amr, Mrs. Intisar al-Wazir alias Umm Jihad, and Mrs. Hanan al-'Ashrawi. Sha'th told his news conference at the Foreign Correspondents Association in Cairo today that all these members have agreed to take part in the first Palestinian Authority Council, and their nomination has been approved by the PLO Executive Committee. He noted that in the next four days, nine other members will be nominated, thus completing the formation of the Council, which will consist of 24 members. He said that the Council will start its duties immediately. He expected that this will take place on Wednesday, 18 May, in Gaza-Jericho and will constitute the first Palestinian National Authority on Palestinian territory. Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that among the members of the Council are two former deportees, 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi. There are also two women: Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi and Intisar al-Wazir. Among them also is one of Jerusalem's prominent sons, namely Faysal al-Husayni. Dr. Sha'th added that the members of the Council have not yet been allocated their portfolios. He clarified that in accordance with the protocol that was signed last week, the PLO will continue to be the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people until their Palestinian state is established. He said that the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho is a part of the PLO, which supervises the liberated territories. He added that foreign relations and the Palestine Liberation Army's affairs outside the Palestinian territories, as well as the national and international relations will continue to be the responsibilities of the PLO headquarters in Tunis. These affairs will be administered by three prominent members from the PLO Executive Committee--namely, Faruq Qaddumi for foreign diplomatic relations, Mahmud 'Abbas for national relations with Jewish organizations, and 'Abdallah Hurani for the Palestine Liberation Army. On the delay in the Palestinian Authority's assumption of its duties in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said that this is due to very difficult circumstances because of the Palestinian diaspora. Thankfully, Saudi planes have transported members of the police from Yemen to Sinai. Saudi planes will also transport those coming from Algeria. Those coming from Libya will travel by car thousands of kilometers to cross through the al-Sallum border post to Sinai. Egyptian planes have transported those coming from Sudan. In this regard, Sha'th thanked President Husni Mubarak; King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques; and the Arab countries who have provided and continue to provide all the necessary facilities to transport these forces. Sha'th expressed his belief that these forces will complete their arrival in Gaza and Jericho within the next few days. He said that the Palestinian Authority would like the financial allocations from the donor countries to arrive quickly so that it can be spent on this police force. He noted that there is positive international action by the United States, Japan, and the European countries to hasten this process. Also, a batch of new cars for this police will arrive in Port Said sometime next week. He said that this positive attitude reflects the extent of the world's interest in backing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. On the relationships of the newborn Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that this authority is part of the PLO, and although the latter is entrusted with representing the Palestinian people and negotiating and signing on its behalf, the Authority will be in charge of implementing the agreement on the scene. He added: Both the Palestinian people and Israel want to the retain the PLO at present. The Palestinians believe that the PLO is their representative until the state of Palestine is officially established. Israel would like to continue to negotiate and cooperate with the PLO in order to avoid the establishment of the Palestinian state. But, he added, the establishment of this state has become inevitable, no matter how long it takes. In reply to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent statement that Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel, Dr. Sha'th said: Rabin has no right to say this because, according to the Declaration of Principles, Jerusalem is an issue in the bilateral negotiations. If Rabin wishes it to be the capital of Israel, we in turn insist on making Jerusalem the capital of Palestine. He added: Since Israel has agreed to share the land of Palestine with us, why does it not agree then to let us both share Jerusalem? In reply to a question on why Israel has not released the remaining Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Dr. Sha'th emphasized that he is confident that they will all be released. He explained that Israel would like to hand over many of them to the Palestinian Authority when it takes over, especially those convicted of ordinary crimes. Their cases will be left for the Palestinian Authority to decide on. As for the members of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and al-Jihad movements, they have not been released so far because they have not signed a declaration to the Israeli authorities accepting the peace agreement. Maybe they do not want to sign such a declaration for the Israeli authorities but might sign for the Palestinian Authority so as to be released. On 'Arafat's entry into Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th referred to 'Arafat's statements that this will take place in early June. But, he added, 'Arafat has his own surprises. We don't know. The date might be before then. On the differences between the Palestinian organizations, especially Hamas and al-Jihad, Dr. Sha'th said that there is an agreement that these differences should be kept within the democratic framework and not turned into acts of violence. He stressed his conviction that all the Palestinian organizations care about this democratic dialogue in order to establish the Palestinian state and ensure the success of the agreement as the first step toward the establishment of the state of Palestine. Dr. Sha'th went on to say that the PLO, which is headquartered in Tunis, will remain in charge of the affairs of the refugees outside the liberated areas in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and that the Palestine National Council [PNC], which includes members from inside and outside the territories, will remain the highest legislative Palestinian authority. Sha'th went on to say that the coming elections in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are scheduled to be held after three months, will be for the election of the members of the PNC from inside the territories, who were formerly appointed. He said: These members comprise a third of the PNC members but at the same time constitute the Palestinian Authority's parliament inside the territories. In response to a question about the Palestinian diplomatic missions abroad, he said that they will remain the prerogative of the PLO headquartered in Tunis, but all countries will have the right to open representation offices in Gaza and Jericho until the Palestinian state is established. On the new Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, Sha'th said that Acting Ambassador Zuhdi al-Qidrah will be appointed the Palestinian state's ambassador in Cairo.
