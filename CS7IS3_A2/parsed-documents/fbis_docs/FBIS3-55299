The cost of a selection of 19 of the most important foods in December throughout Russia on average was 30,700 rubles [R] calculated on a monthly basis and increased 11 percent compared with the previous month and sevenfold since December last year. The cost of this selection for stores (irrespective of form of ownership) is assessed at an average of R29,500 and for unorganized trade at R39,800. The cost of the selection according to prices which have taken shape at city and informal markets was 35 percent greater than its cost in the stores, as was the case in late November. In December the gulf between the maximum and minimum cost of the selection in various Russian cities was equal to a factor of 3.8 times. The greatest increase in the cost of the selection over the month was recorded in the Central Chernozem and Northern regions -- 16 and 15 percent respectively. And the selection increased least in cost in the Central and Northwest regions -- by 7 and 8 percent. An increase of more than 20 percent in the cost of the selection of the most important foods was noted in 13 Russian cities. Of these the cost of the selection increased over 30 percent in Rubtsovsk, Abakan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. The cost of the selection in Moscow as of 27 December was equal to R34,600, exceeding November's level by 6.4 percent, while in St. Petersburg it was R29,700 (9.3 percent). In the list of observed cities Moscow moved to 35th place (in late November it was 33d) while St. Petersburg moved to 58th place (it was 59th).
