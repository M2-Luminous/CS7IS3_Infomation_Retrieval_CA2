FR940927-1-00009 FR940927-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;89&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect corrosion on areas of the airplane structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repair, if necessary; and replacement of black insulation blankets with certain aluminized (silver) insulation. This proposal is prompted by reports of corrosion forming on areas of the airplane structure where the black film covers the thermal insulation blankets. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capability of the airplane fuselage and sudden loss of cabin pressure due to corrosion of the airplane fuselage structure. DATES: Comments must be received by November 21, 1994.
