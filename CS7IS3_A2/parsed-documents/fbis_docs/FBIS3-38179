They added that an economic crisis might occur in the coming years as a result of monetary and fiscal imbalances. "Things have turned sour. I am afraid difficult times are ahead of us," one senior government economist told a TURKISH DAILY NEWS editor. The same official, one of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's closest economic aides, said that economic conditions have deteriorated so rapidly that the political authorities might soon be deadlocked. He spoke on condition of strict anonymity. In a related development, one senior monetary authority confirmed to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that Turkey had no foreign currency shortages at the moment. However, he warned that if the present trend continues for another two years, the economy will have to confront a foreign currency crisis. "The prime minister is right when she says there is no currency shortage in the economy. Yet the Turkish economy won't endure today's growing foreign account deficits for another two years," he said. He also asked not to be named. The Turkish foreign trade gap climbed to an all-time high of $11.3 billion in the first 10 months of 1993, compared with the original program target of only $8.8 billion. The current account deficit soared to $4.8 billion in the January-October period, making the prospect for the balance of payments a bleak one. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller denies that Turkey has foreign currency problems. She claimed that the economic management of the coalition government will start bearing fruit in 1995.
