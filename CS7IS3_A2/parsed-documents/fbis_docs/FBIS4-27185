In a meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Needham called for Japan to support the "action Japan" campaign, the third such campaign by Britain to boost trade with Japan, the officials said. The "action Japan" campaign aims at offering advice and specific information on 10 industrial sectors in the Japanese market to British companies, they said. Needham also vowed to try to deepen British firms' understanding of the Japanese market and to "constructively" solve the trade imbalance with Japan, they said. Kakizawa told Needham that Japan intends to support the British efforts as much as possible and pointed to the need for cooperation by both Japanese and British companies in the world to strengthen bilateral economic ties, the officials said. Needham arrived in Japan on Monday to promote the trade campaign. He is scheduled to leave Japan for Taiwan on Tuesday.
