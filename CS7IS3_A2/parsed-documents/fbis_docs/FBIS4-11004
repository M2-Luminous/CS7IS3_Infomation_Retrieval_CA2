Meanwhile, the State Council of the Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) has promised to refrain from promoting further occupation of land and, as established in the document, "to abide by the law should an occupation occur on or after 15 April 1994." This agreement will be valid for two months. During that time, an executive commission will be formed. The commission will be comprised of representatives of the agrarian reform, agriculture, social development, government secretariats; the Chiapas State government; the CEOIC; small landowners; and interested peasant groups. Together, the representatives will study the situation of each of the properties occupied by CEOIC groups. After the study has been completed, the commission will establish the legal status of the lands and decide on its ownership in a manner "that will be fair and satisfactory for all parties involved." In addition, the Agrarian Plural Commission [Comision Plural Agraria] will handle "all pending matters regarding the rural backwardness of each of the CEOIC organizations. A strict schedule will be set and respected by all parties involved, and the mechanisms for human, technical, and social requirements that will speed up the solution will be established." Likewise, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno said that his office will advise the district attorney's office to "suspend all arrest warrants against those involved in the agrarian struggles." Lopez Moreno said that they will "examine" the current situation of human rights activist Enrique Perez Lopez who was arrested on Sunday. The agreement was signed last night by SAR Secretary Victor Cervera Pacheco, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, Government Deputy Secretary Jose Narro Robles, and representatives of 22 CEOIC organizations following an over six-hour meeting -- from 1700 until after 2300 -- at the SAR offices. In conclusion, it was established that to avoid further occupations of land and to attend to new requests for land, the governor, a CEOIC representative, and a small landowners representative will meet in Tuxtla Gutierrez soon to "examine the agrarian situation and jointly suggest new alternatives for the solution of the problems." A bank official, as well as federal and state officials involved in agrarian matters, will also be invited to the meeting. Meanwhile, it was learned that CEOIC and the Zapata Lives National Liberation Coordinating Board will march from the Zocalo to the Chamber of Deputies headquarters to demand changes to Article 27 of the Constitution.
