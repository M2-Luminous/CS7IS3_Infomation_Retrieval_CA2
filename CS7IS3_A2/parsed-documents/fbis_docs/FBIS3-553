Many people will say that the real peace process is finally under way. Yesterday we heard the commander of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia, General Opande, saying he had been on a tour and had seen former fighters handing over their weapons. However, in this report from Monrovia, the BBC's West Africa correspondent, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, shows that not all the fighters are disarming. [Begin recording] [Quist-Arcton] Two truckloads move in the Schieffelin Camp, outside Monrovia, packed full of soldiers from the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL], the nominally national army which in the minds of many Liberians will always remain associated with the horror and killings of the civil war. But at Schieffelin they seemed ready and even eager to give up their weapons to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and shake off that damning legacy. Under the watchful eye of the ECOMOG chief of staff, Brigadier Samuel Victor Malu and UN military observers, the Nigerian camp commandant at Schieffelin gave orders to the Liberian soldiers as disarmament began. [Unidentified camp commandant] Attention! Do you understand me? I want you to face me, this way. That's how I want it. [Quist-Arcton] In turn, the Liberian colonel told his men what to do -- a slight confusion between Nigerian English and Liberian English. Guns were neutralized and bullets discharged from magazines before the AFL chief lined up a large stock for registration and cleaning. They were a ragtag collection of men, many young; some in proper military uniform, others inadequately dressed in threadbare clothes and rubber slippers after years at war. How does it make you feel? [Unidentified soldier] I feel happy. [Quist-Arcton] Why? [Soldier] Because we have been fighting since 1991 and the war is coming to an end, and that is why I am happy when they say we are disarming. [Quist-Arcton] Do you think that peace will be lasting in Liberia? [Soldier] Yes, peace will be lasting in Liberia [Quist-Arcton] Nobody in Liberia had any illusion that disarmament would be (?smooth) or easy, and they were right, and camping and disarming the Armed Forces of Liberia is just the first step and probably the simplest. ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] are still officially under arms. [Unidentified military officer] About-turn! About-turn! Turn about, turn about! [Quist-Arcton] Visiting the NPFL encampment site of Kolela near Kolela yesterday, about 50 miles north of Monrovia on the road to Taylor's Gbarnga headquarters, we got the impression at the Tanzanian ECOMOG troops in charge that everything was set to receive Taylor's fighters and their weapons. The mainly young troops milling around the camp seemed ready too waiting for the word from their boss but I am told that Charles Taylor is not taking any chances, indicative of the continuing mistrust among Liberians. Taylor is waiting before he gives the order for his boys to disarm. Of course, he is waiting for ULIMO, or so I am told. The very public split and the power struggle in the ULIMO leadership is causing the latest delay in the Liberia peace process. Nigerian ECOMOG military commander, General Henry Odopu, is responsible for the areas that include Toby, one of the encampment sites allocated to ULIMO. [Odopu] Now there is a problem with leadership. Everything has been put into place. The camp has been set up and the ECOMOG soldiers have taken their positions, and we have.... [pauses] The boys, in fact are ready to move in there. There are some minor problem within ULIMO, and it is that minor problem that ECOMOG headquarters is trying to resolve, and the moment it is resolved, they will move in. I can be very sure of that. [Quist-Arcton] Gen. Odopu added that he wanted to be sure that ULIMO troops with different loyalties would not clash in camp once they have been disarmed, and he said he wanted that matter sorted out before hand.
