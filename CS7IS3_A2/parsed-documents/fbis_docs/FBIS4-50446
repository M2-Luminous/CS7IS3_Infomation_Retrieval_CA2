This measure has achieved great success but, in reality, a lot of problems also exist. Since it is a long-term policy, it is necessary to study the actual conditions, problems, and measures for foreign-funded enterprises in the country. I. The Basic Conditions in Foreign-funded Enterprises According to State Administration for Industry and Commerce statistics, by the end of 1992 there were 84,371 foreign-funded enterprises throughout the nation, accounting for 3 percent of all industrial and commercial corporate enterprises. Of these, 34,288 are already in production and operation, accounting for 40.6 percent of the registered foreign-funded enterprises. Of the registered foreign-funded enterprises, 55,826 are Chinese and foreign joint ventures, accounting for 66.2 percent of the total, while 14,180 are Chinese-foreign cooperative enterprises, accounting for 16.8 percent of the total, and 14,365 are exclusively foreign-owned enterprises, accounting for 17 percent of the total. The aggregate investment in foreign-funded enterprises throughout the nation amounted to $178.46 billion, with a registered capital of $116 billion and a foreign capital contribution of $68.66 billion. Of the 10.461 million employees, 293,000 are personnel working on behalf of the foreign party. Trades in which foreign-funded enterprises have become involved cover almost every aspect of the national economy, with industry being the major one. Real estate and public utilities also take up a fairly big proportion. Besides, foreign-funded enterprises also take up a certain proportion in commerce and catering. In terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, the proportions of enterprises are 2.6, 83.2, and 14.2 percent respectively; the proportions of employees are 1.3, 90.4, and 8.3 percent respectively; the proportions of aggregate investment are 1.5, 67, and 31.5 percent respectively; and the proportions of registered capital are 1.8, 70.6, and 27.6 percent respectively. Foreign enterprises throughout the nation are developing unevenly and they are concentrated in the open, coastal areas in southeastern China. Along the southeastern coast, they are concentrated in four provinces and one city, namely, Guangdong Province, Jiangsu Province, Fujian Province, Shanghai Municipality, and Shandong Province. Of these, Guangdong has achieved the most remarkable results in exploiting foreign funds. In terms of the number of foreign-funded enterprises, foreign invested funds, registered capital, and foreign capital contribution, they account for 31.2, 37, 37.2, and 43.2 percent respectively of the nation's total. As for the countries and regions from whence the foreign funds come, for the time being, the overwhelming majority of the foreign funds come from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao. According to statistics, 68,887 enterprises are from Hong, Taiwan and Macao, their aggregate investment stands at $144.2 billion, their registered capital $93.23 billion, and their capital contribution $55.76 billion, each accounting for over 80 percent of the total foreign capital. Besides, the number of enterprises from the United States, Japan, and Singapore and their aggregate investment account for around 12 percent of the total, while enterprises from six countries, namely, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Australia add up to no more than 2.4 percent of the total. II. The Main Problems in the Development of Foreign-Funded Enterprises 1. The relationship between the development of foreign-funded enterprises and that of state-owned enterprises The development of foreign funded enterprises plays an active, as well as a negative, role in promoting the development of state-owned enterprises. Given that state-owned enterprises lack vitality, the preferential policies adopted by the state toward foreign-funded enterprises has put state-owned enterprises in a very unfavorable position in the intensely competitive market. In terms of taxation, foreign-funded enterprises enjoy income tax exemption for the first three years and a reduction in tax for the next two. In some areas, the duration of tax exemption and reduction is even longer and the actual taxation even lower. In 1992, the average tax handed over by foreign-funded enterprises which had gone into production or operations was only 68,000 yuan. However, the income tax rate of state-owned enterprises has just been reduced from 55 percent to 33 percent this year. Their actual taxation is still much more than foreign-funded enterprises. In terms of enterprise autonomy, foreign-funded enterprises enjoy various decisionmaking powers on manpower, finances, materials, production, supply, and sales. They feel comfortable as fish in water in the market. However, the management autonomy for state-owned enterprises is not fully granted and, consequently, they often bungle their opportunities. In terms of retirement and insurance for workers and staff members, the burden om foreign-funded enterprises is light as they chiefly employ young people while state-owned enterprises not only have to be responsible for the insurance of their employees but also their retirement pay. In terms of import and export rights, foreign-funded enterprises at large enjoy the right to declare to customs or the import and export rights and they are not restricted by the import and export permit system. They also retain all the foreign exchange and use it without restriction, whereas most of the state-owned enterprises do not have corresponding rights. They needs permits for the import and export of goods. Moreover, they have to hire foreign trade agents. They keep a small proportion of the foreign exchange earnings but cannot use it directly and freely. The crucial point of restructuring our economy lies in enlivening state-owned enterprises. The basis and the main force for socialist modernization lies in state-owned enterprises. Whe, competing with foreign-funded enterprises which have absolute advantages, state-owned enterprises will lose repeatedly, the profit-making ones becoming loss-making ones and the loss-making ones being driven into bankruptcy because of their imperfect mechanism, the unequal policies, and their lack of sufficient strength for technical innovation and management improvement. This has deviated from the starting point of utilizing foreign funds, delayed the course of enterprise reform, and impaired the healthy development of the whole national economy. How to combine the development of foreign-funded enterprises with the invigoration of the state-owned enterprises so that we can attract foreign funds, while protecting and promoting the rejuvenation of state-owned enterprises, is a problem of first importance which deserves our study. 2. The investment orientation of foreign funds The principal demerits of foreign funds in terms of investment orientation are: Items of general industrial processing are many while items of agriculture, energy, communications, and raw materials which the national economy needs urgently are few; primary processing and labor-intensive industries are many in number while high-tech and technology-intensive ones are few; projects of small and medium enterprises are many while big ones are few. Of the total investment, agriculture accounts for only 1.54 percent, energy and raw materials 0.1 percent, and communications and transport, as well as post and telecommunications, 1.8 percent. From the foreign businessman's viewpoint, factors affecting their investment orientation finclude the fact that those small processing projects need small investment but bring quick results, yield good profits, involve little risk, and are good for giving full play to the superiority of manpower. On our part, the main factors that affect the investment orientation are that some localities attach importance to quantity rather than quality. They evaluate their achievements by counting how many foreign-funded enterprises have been set up without sufficient knowledge of the investment orientation, technical level, market orientation, and scale of foreign investment, as well as the technique and credit worthiness of the foreign businessmen. The irrational orientation of foreign investment brings hidden troubles. It is disadvantageous to restructuring our industry and upgrading technology. In the long run, it will do harm to the even and healthy development of the national economy. 3. The management of foreign-funded enterprises A. Foreign capital fails to show up. According to an analysis by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, 5,000 of the 25,000 foreign-funded enterprises across the country have not invested any money. Some foreign businessmen withdrew their funds by installments soon after making investments but continued to enjoy preferential treatment for foreign-funded enterprise. B. The deficit rate of enterprises exceeds 40 percent. Some enterprises lose money because of failure to select the right project. Some fail in business because the foreign businesses play an underhand game in import and export. A considerable number of enterprises actually make profits though they claim losses. C. Goods produced by foreign-funded enterprises are not exported abroad according to the proportion set in contracts. Instead, they squeeze into and occupy the domestic market, affecting the state's foreign exchange revenue. From 1991 to 1992, the imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at $43.3 billion while their exports totaled $29.4 billion. After deducting $12.7 billion for investment in equipment and other articles, the international trade deficit was $1.2 billion. D. Serious tax evasion. In 1991, the average unified industrial and commercial tax handed over by foreign-funded enterprises which were in operation, was 242,000 yuan and the income tax was 76,000 yuan. In 1992, the average unified industrial and commercial tax handed over by them was 243,000 yuan and the income tax was only 68,000 yuan. Foreign-funded enterprises pay the salary of employees under the name of subsidies so that they can evade personal income tax and individual income regulatory tax. The lack of perfect laws and regulations contributes to the difficulties in administering foreign-funded enterprises. What is more serious is that the Chinese party to the joint venture, proceeding from their local interests, share the preferential policy with foreign businessmen at the cost of national interests and the interests of the whole. 4. The investment environment of using foreign funds From the angle of the international environment, international opinion generally holds that China's economic growth and market have great potential. The number of foreign businessmen who intend to invest in China keeps increasing. On the other hand, the economies of some Eastern European countries are gradually recovering and the momentum of economic growth in our neighboring countries is not decreasing. So, the competition to introducing international capital tends to become fiercer. In addition, some Western countries are wary of us politically so that, to a considerable extent, transnational corporations and big financial groups are hesitant and take a wait-and-see attitude toward investment in China. From the angle of the domestic environment, some areas are backward in conditions such as transportation, energy resources, and communications. The relevant laws and regulations on using foreign funds are imperfect. The operation mechanism of the market economy has not been finally established. All this has brought certain difficulties to the normal operations of foreign-funded enterprises and, therefore, has affected the introduction of international capital and the healthy development of foreign-funded enterprises. III. Development Tendencies and Some Suggestions 1. The foreign-funded enterprises will indicate the following characteristics for some time to come: A. The number of foreign-funded enterprises and aggregate investment will increase steadily. Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be the main form of enterprises and the actual investment funds will exceed the foreign loans of our country. B. Foreign-funded enterprises will mainly be industrial ones and will gradually develop towards infrastructure and basic industries. There will be considerably big development and breakthroughs in the tertiary industry. However, the development of new and high-tech projects and capital-intensive ones will still be restricted in certain extent. C. The export and import scale of foreign-funded enterprises will increase fairly quickly. Because quite a number of foreign-funded enterprises are grafted from town and township enterprises as well as small and medium state-owned enterprises, they are small in scale and exports. The contradiction of imbalanced foreign exchange will exist for a long time and sometimes will become very conspicuous. D. Foreign-funded enterprises will still mainly be located in the economically developed coastal areas, along rivers, and in the border areas and they will develop in quite a big way. E. Taiwan and Hong Kong will remain the chief sources of foreign funds and the investment from the United States, Japan, the ROK, and Southeast Asian countries will increase steadily. 2. Some suggestions: A. Emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and strengthen leadership over the use foreign funds. Three tendencies should be overcome: First is the tendency to compete with one another in offering foreign businessmen preferential policies; second, is the tendency to pay attention to quantity rather than quality in the development of foreign-funded enterprises; and third, is the tendency to duplicate imports and fail in absorption. Exchange of information and project guidance should be strengthened. A good job should be done in the introduction, digestion, and absorption of advanced foreign technology and not just simply taking it over. B. Continue to improve the investment environment. Further efforts should be made to improve the hard environment such as traffic, transportation, energy, post and telecommunications, and communications. At the same time, the laws and regulations concerning foreign-funded enterprises should be perfected to protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises. The procedures and links to set up foreign-funded enterprises should be simplified to raise work efficiency. We should quicken the steps of the reform, establish the operation mechanism of the market economy, and reduce the contradictions and frictions between the current system and the operation of foreign-funded enterprises. We should also strengthen publicity on the use of foreign funds abroad, restore and build the international image of China, and publicize China's economic achievements and potential for development in a realistic way, to raise its attractiveness to foreign funds. C. Stress the main points in strengthening guidance to foreign investment orientation. The focus of investment is in projects of basic industries, infrastructure, and high technology. With regard to projects regarding energy and communications in particular, we should further relax our policy and boldly attract foreign funds to serve us. To such businesses as trading, tourism, and banking, we can liberalize our policy a bit more so that they can develop appropriately. As for some high-tech projects, especially products which can replace imported ones, we should offer a bigger proportion for internal sale to promote the enthusiasm of the foreign businessmen for investment and further investment. Some localities assign large areas of farmland for sale or lease at low prices to foreign businessmen to develop real estate. Although this practice brings some immediate interests and temporary prosperity, its disadvantages outweigh its advantages in the long run. The lesson to be drawn from Japan's bubble economy in the 1980s is worth our learning. We should properly control the excessive growth of foreign-funded real estate. E. Raise the level of management of foreign-funded enterprises. It is necessary to formulate laws and regulations to bring about the timely arrival of registered capital in the full amount, strengthen inspection and supervision, and change the existing phenomenon whereby the Chinese party alone takes the operating risks if the foreign capital does not come. To strengthen tax management, the state should set the minimum standard for the policy which offers income tax deduction and exemption to foreign-funded enterprises and rectify the tendency for each locality to go its own way. On the other hand, we should screen pseudo-foreign-funded enterprises, especially those which still enjoy preferential treatment for foreign-funded enterprises but which actually have very little proportion of foreign funds or from which the foreign funds have been withdrawn. At the same time, we should strengthen financial supervision to prevent enterprises from evading tax by falsely claiming losses when they have actual made a profit and the abnormal phenomenon whereby the state has little increase in tax revenue while the number of foreign-funded enterprises keeps increasing. We should strengthen the supervision and management of imports and exports by foreign-funded enterprises to prevent them from taking advantage of the preferential policy to import equipment and raw materials which have nothing to do with production and then selling them at high prices for profits. We should also prevent them from selling their products to the domestic market directly or changing the goods originally assigned for export into goods for domestic sales without sticking to the proportion set by contract. The number of Chinese employees working in the joint ventures now exceeds 10 million. We should protect their legitimate rights in terms of working conditions, medical insurance, labor insurance, and endowment insurance and, at the same time, collect individual income regulatory taxes according to regulations to ease the phenomenon of inequality in social distribution.
