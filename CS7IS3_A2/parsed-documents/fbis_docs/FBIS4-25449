The study of creativity is an emerging science researching the creativity of human beings, applications of creative thinking, and the processes involved in human discovery and invention. In the late 1970s, Chinese experts and scholars entered the study of creativity. Over the past ten-plus years, a dozen societies promoting the study were set up in Shanghai and other provinces and cities. Scholars in the study have published more than 30 compilations of works in the field. The number of experts engaged in the study has increased from about 200 a decade ago to several tens of thousands now. There are 48 universities in China which now offer courses in the study of creativity. Approved by the State Commission of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the China Association for Science and Technology, the society will devote its efforts to international and domestic academic exchanges and promote the development, application and popularization of the study in China.
