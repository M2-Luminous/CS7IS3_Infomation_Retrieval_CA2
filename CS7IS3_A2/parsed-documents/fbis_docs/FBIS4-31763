"There must be the same rules for all," he said. Kolodziejczyk opened Monday a three-day international seminar on "Civilian and Democratic Control over the Armed Forces" attended by representatives of 38 countries, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the supreme command of NATO allied armed forces. According to Poland's defence minister, the "Partnership for Peace" is a step towards western security structures although "it fails to secure full NATO membership and gives no full security guarantees." Kolodziejczyk emphasized that full membership of the Western European Union and NATO was Poland's "strategic choice." Poland wants to participate in the work of the two organizations, in NATO manoeuvres and peace-keeping missions. "We are ready to meet the "Partnership for Peace" obligations although it will not be easy because of Poland's economic situation," he said. "The to-date pro-east political orientation, conditioned by the subjection to the USSR and anti-NATO security policy, does not meet the expectations of Polish society, nor our geostrategic situation," he stressed. According to him, Poland faces the opportunity of "independently choosing an optimal political option." The turn to the western democracy does not mean, however, "breaking the to-date links with the east," said the minister. Kolodziejczyk stressed Poland's advantages, including good relations with neighbours, no ethnic conflicts, many-year experience in UN peace-keeping missions, military potential, and the defence system. He also admitted that Poland's "system of control over the army is far from being perfect" and is still in the making. In his opinion the seminar will help better tailor Polish solutions to west European standards. The civilian control over the army is a significant element of breaking away from the old totalitarian structures and dependencies, said Kolodziejczyk.
