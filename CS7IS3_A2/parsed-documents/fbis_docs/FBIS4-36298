Singh, who took over as External Affairs Minister a year-and-a-half ago, has kept indifferent health almost throughout the period. Though Singh could not be contacted, his colleagues told INDIAN EXPRESS that the minister was leaving for London on Monday morning. He was likely to be away for a month, they said. Through sheer coincidence, the top bureaucrat in the ministry is also not expected to be in Delhi for some days. Foreign Secretary K Srinivasan is also in a London Hospital; he flew there after catching malaria during his Bulgaria trip with President Shankar Dayal Sharma. With an ailing cabinet minister at the top, much of the work is split among his two deputies, Ministers of State R L Bhatia and Salman Khurshid. Bhatia has just returned from the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Minister's Conference at Cairo, and Khurshid left on Sunday for a week-long trip to Kazakhstan, Kyrghizistan and Tajikstan. With illness taking him to London, Dinesh Singh will be missing from the scene just when he might be needed at home. The Foreign Office should now be working at consolidating the gains of Rao's US visit, and another important summit is scheduled later this month when Rao flies to Moscow to meet President Boris Yeltsin. Like always, Dinesh Singh's illness triggers off bouts of speculation about replacing him with a fitter man. The rumour mill has begun churning again; and Human Resource Development Minister Arjun Singh is now being mentioned as the man who might take over the ministry.
