These three political parties say the legislature does not have the authority to enact laws with a view to forming a provisional government under Article 111 of the Constitution. [The leaders of these parties, respectively] Volvick Remy Joseph, Francois Latortue, and Greger Jean-Louis, affirm that logically, no government can be formed before the dismissal of the president, in keeping with constitutional procedure. The three leaders point out that the Senate reinstated President Aristide as president of Haiti and that the Army acknowledged his legitimacy by signing the Governors Island agreement. These three party leaders explain that the text of Article 111 as a general clause cannot replace a particular clause. The MODELH-PRDH's Latortue has labeled the behavior of the international community as...[rephrases] has criticized the behavior of this community, which has imposed economic sanctions on Haiti. [Begin Latortue recording, in Creole] Those sanctions affect mostly the lower strata of society: the poor, the poorest of the poor. Those who are in the middle class manage so their arms are not competely broken when the ball is falling down. [sentence as heard] Those who are at the lower level, however, can do nothing. They are suffering. When fuel is as expensive as it is, fares are high. The unfortunates who cannot pay the fares at all will be obliged to walk. When the prices of all items increase, when the prices of milled corn and rice increase, many people cannot eat those things because they cannot afford them. At present, many children are dying of tuberculosis. Their parents do not have money to buy medicine, nor even to provide the children with food. A situation such as this must end as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the leaders themselves have plenty of money. They wear nice clothes and have money in their pockets, but the masses have nothing and are dying. I do not know what his [not further identified] reasons are. However, in my opinion, an end should be put to this situation. I believe that thanks to the pressures or...[rephrases] he [not further identified] will eventually understand that forming a new government is an urgent necessity. Otherwise, I believe, the international authorities will be obliged to take measures. [end recording]
