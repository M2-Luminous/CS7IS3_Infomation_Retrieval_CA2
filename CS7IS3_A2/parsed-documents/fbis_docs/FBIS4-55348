Croatia will officially circulate the new currency on Independence Day, May 30. The currency has the same name -- the kuna -- as that used in the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia during World War Two. Immediately after Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslav Federation nearly three years ago, Bosnian Croats embraced the breakaway state's then currency -- the Croatian dinar -- thus making clear to one and all their ultimate objective -- secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina and union with Croatia. The Croatian news agency HINA has quoted Prlic as admitting that there are forces in Herzeg-Bosna which oppose the implementation of the Washington agreement on a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina. There are political forces among the Croats which oppose the agreement, and there are also those who have lost members of immediate family in the fighting against the Moslems and do not want a union, Prlic explained. Five-day U.S.-sponsored Croatian-Moslem talks at the U.S. embassy in Vienna ended on Wednesday in an agreement on a cantonal division of the future federation and the appointment of the two nations' officials to top state positions by rote.
