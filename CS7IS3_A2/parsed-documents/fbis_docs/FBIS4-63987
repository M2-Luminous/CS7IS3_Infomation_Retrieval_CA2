According to all the realities of history, they belong to Russia. I am sure that in time the Chinese side will come to accept our logic and our arguments," Genrikh Kireyev, Russian Foreign Ministry special envoy and chairman of the Russian delegation at the border talks in China, stated at a press conference in Khabarovsk. The Russian diplomat was meeting with journalists from central and local newspapers after the latest working meeting of the members of the Russian-Chinese joint demarcation commission had ended in this city. G. Kireyev also refuted rumors that 2,000 islands will be transferred to the neighboring country during the demarcation process. In all there are 1,845 islands in the border rivers -- the Ussuri, the Amur, and the Argun. Legally speaking, they have never belonged to anyone. The demarcation will make it possible to remove that contradiction for the first time. Bearing in mind that the border line runs along the fairway of the navigable rivers, it may be presumed that one-half of the islands will be deemed Russian, the other half Chinese. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman did not agree that there is no single approach at government level to the assessment of the border problem in the east of the country. The members of the Russian delegation at the talks have a single directive -- to uphold Russia's interests above all, he stressed. However, the participants in the press conference still had some uncertainty over the unhindered passage of Chinese ships, including naval ones, along the fairway of the Amur River near Khabarovsk. This is indeed envisaged by the border settlement agreement between Russia and the PRC of 18 May 1991, which finally enabled the demarcation work to begin. That agreement says that special rules for such traffic must be devised. But this has not been done yet. Meanwhile, ships from the PRC sail here freely, often without even notifying the Russian side. This is causing a negative reaction from the local authorities.
