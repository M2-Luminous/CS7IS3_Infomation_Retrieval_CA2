We want your reaction, sir. [Peres] I do not know this for a fact, and I would not rush to react. There are always rumors and decisions reported, and I would rather wait for the most official announcement before I make any comment. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that what happened in Hebron yesterday greatly complicates the negotiations. This madman brought a moral disgrace upon our people. It also caused a deterioration in our political standing, and I do not take this lightly at all. This will not only speed up the negotiations, it will make them more complicated, more difficult; this is clear as day. We cannot turn this entire country into a madhouse, even if there are a few madmen. Madmen should be put away. [Enosh] We have heard remarks from people who support the act. [Peres] You should not have broadcasted them. It is a shame, a disgrace. Their remarks are shameful. [Enosh] This could mean, however, that we are dealing with more than just an individual; perhaps a large group of people who support him? [Peres] Look, whoever does not meet the criteria set by the law, should be outlawed. One cannot shoot and murder people and come up with stories. That group of people who justify the act are no angels from heaven, nor do they represent the people of Israel. They have no authority, and they should not brag. They gave the Jewish people a very sad day, a moral disgrace, and with all due respect for the Cave of Patriarchs, the Ten Commandments are not less sacred. There it says: Thou shalt not kill; and they have killed. [Enosh] Are you saying that measures should be taken against these people? [Peres] I believe that people who do not respect the law, should be outlawed. [Enosh] Yesterday's cabinet meeting discussed some of the measures. What more do you believe should be done to prevent such things from recurring and such remarks from being uttered? [Peres] We decided that we will make resolutions tomorrow. I will be at tomorrow's cabinet session, and speak there. I will state, however, that there is no doubt that the harshest and clearest measures must be taken to prevent the fire of hatred from bursting out of this place and prevent the violation of all human norms. The Jewish people are a humanitarian nation. It is not a nation of murderers who shoot innocent people. None of them has a right to justify this shameful act. [Enosh] I would like to move on to the political issues, in view of the loathsome murders in Hebron. Israel has, in fact, reneged on one of the principles it insisted on for quite a long time, and agreed to moving the security talks with PLO out of the region, out of Taba. [Peres] There is no doubt that at this stage we must save the negotiations. Certainly, yesterday's incident places an enormous burden on us. There is no point in playing down the crime or the damage it caused. Certainly it made our standing more difficult, and certainly we are no longer free to do whatever we want. Israel is greatly interested today in demonstrating that indeed it means peace; real peace, not the peace of madmen. [Enosh] We have heard that political sources in Jerusalem said that this will speed up.... [Peres, interrupting] I do not know who those sources are, and I do not know what they said. It is absolutely clear that matters are very complicated now. We scored no achievement nor half an achievement, and there is no point in portraying this as such. The incident harmed us and caused us damage despite the fact that it was done by a single madman who feeds on a larger madness. [Enosh] The PLO, through its UN representative, is currently demanding that an international force be placed in the area because, it claims, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the State of Israel are unable to maintain order in the territories. This is a very complicated call from our point of view, but do you believe such a resolution could ever pass? [Peres] Absolutely not. We have seen multinational forces in Somalia and Bosnia. Such a force cannot bring about peace. Peace is the business of politicians. Regrettably, a multinational force has never succeeded in its task, be it in Angola, Somalia, Bosnia, or Lebanon.
