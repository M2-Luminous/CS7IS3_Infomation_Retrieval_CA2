He said he would continue the hunger strike until Prosecutor General Raja' al-'Arabi publicizes the findings of investigations into the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al- Harith Madani and releases the detained lawyers. The Lawyers Association Council held a meeting in its general headquarters yesterday to discuss developments in the case. 'Abd- al-'Aziz Muhammad, a 58-year-old diabetic, announced the beginning of his strike and sit-in and said that he would give a press conference at the headquarters tomorrow, Monday [20 June]. The meeting was attended by heads of the association's sub-branches. Sayyid Khalaf, secretary general of the Cairo branch of the association, is expected to join the hunger strike on Monday. The association's council members will follow suit. Yesterday EHRO appealed to all human rights organizations to intervene with the Egyptian authorities to release two of its lawyers. The appeal affirmed that the two lawyers were arrested in court as they were performing their duty of being present at the interrogation of lawyers arrested during riots outside the association. The two lawyers--Jamal 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Sayyid Fathi--work at the EHRO's Field Unit.
