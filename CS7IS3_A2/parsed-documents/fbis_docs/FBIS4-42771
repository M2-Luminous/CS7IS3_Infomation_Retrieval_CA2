The presence of French soldiers side-by-side with troops of the Rwandan Government Army, from October 1990 to December 1993, had been met with general indifference. When international organizations and the press condemned this situation, stating that it was not limited to the protection of French nationals, their arguments fell on deaf ears. Not once was this especially bizarre presence the subject of political debate, and never did the issue become an intellectual hobby horse. Now everyone is making France responsible for the massacre of moderate Tutsis and Hutus. This outcry is both late in coming and excessive -- excess that is doubtless due to the irrational aspect of events and the flagrant barbarism that we would like to understand and explain. Nevertheless, France, considered as being "pro-Hutu" because of the president's support for the murdered Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, is in an awkward situation. The proof of this can be seen in France's sidestepping, in the early days of the massacre, when it evacuated its nationals as quickly as it could. Then there was the rejection of France by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which looks likely to win the current conflict. The RPF does not even want Paris to supply the equipment of the Senegalese or Congolese blue helmets. This is a logical rejection: Comprising mainly Tutsis, the RPF would have overturned the Hutu authorities at the start of the 1990's had it not been for the French Army, which opposed it by backing the Kigali regime. At the height of this support (700 soldiers), while French public opinion remained indifferent, the experts were getting all wrapped up in conjecture. They debated whether it was a question of preserving the French-speaking zone faced with the expansion of the English-speaking area (the RPF was backed by Uganda). Should not a Socialist France intervene to avoid a majority community (Hutus represent 85 percent of the population) from being subjected to the laws imposed by a minority? They asked also whether the friendship between the French and Rwandan presidents was strong enough to permit France to step in to save the Hutu regime, even though Rwanda is not a former French colony. All three proposals are, even today, open to debate. The third suggestion is the most convincing, however. A real friendship existed between Francois Mitterrand and Juvenal Habyarimana. Moreover, on the morning of 7 April, the day after the Rwandan presidential plane was blown up, the first instruction issued by the Elysee [office of the president] to the Foreign Ministry was: Take care of the evacuation of the president's widow and family. Ministerial sources say: "The Elysee not only assumes but also confirms the statement justifying France's intervention in support of the Rwandan Armed Forces." The Elysee, moreover, in no way denies its Rwanda policy from 1990 to 1993, and, on the contrary, justifies its stance by citing the results obtained from Kigali in exchange for French support: the end of the party-state and the commitment of the Hutu authorities to start negotiations with the RPF. Elysee sources confirm: "Without the presence of French troops, the Arusha Agreement would never have been signed and the UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in Rwanda] would never have existed. How, by implementing this policy, can France be held responsible for the massacres? On the contrary, for four years we have tried to avoid it." And so it was. However, did France really apply all the pressure it could? In particular, it is surprising that despite the pressure that was applied, a holder's ethnic origin remained on Rwandan identity cards -- a useful tool for the exterminators! Similarly, we may wonder how it was that in January 1993 an international commission of inquiry uncovered atrocities committed against Tutsis while 150 French soldiers were present in Rwanda and 14 million French francs [Fr] had been spent by Paris in 1992 in military cooperation with Kigali. Two Schools of Thought It is an open secret that the Rwandan Armed Forces were equipped by France. The Socialist government did begin to change its policy in 1992, a few months before the victory of the Right, when work was begun that led to the Arusha negotiations. However, the military "establishment" [previous word in English] did not follow suit: The French military, which was opposed to the arms embargo decreed by France a year ago, is still opposed to it today. Ministerial sources say that "there are currently two schools of thought in France: On the one hand, you have those who still want to rearm the Rwandan forces, while on the other hand you have all those who believe that nothing can be settled without the RPF." Faced with this choice, the French Government made up its mind: Rearming Paris's former ally is out of the question. France flatly refused Tanzania's request that Paris arm the scattered Rwandan Army -- a solution that was hoped for by many countries in the region that fear the RPF becoming too influential. Having chosen not to take sides with any of the belligerents, France has very limited room for maneuver; its only means of applying pressure being on the other side of the border in Zaire which is the transit hub for weapons to the Rwandan Armed Forces. Meanwhile, the Americans and the British are trying to pressure Uganda through which weapons to the RPF are shipped. Here again, French influence is now considerably reduced, since all cooperation between France and Zaire has been suspended. Marked by its recent "pro-Hutu" stand and handicapped by a lack of relations with Zaire, France today seems unable to exert any influence at all in this region. This is doubtless why it prides itself in doing most humanitarian work, by granting unprecedented funds to the non-governmental organizations operating in Rwanda and Burundi. It is as if the government, lacking the necessary political resources, is now passing the torch to these organizations.
