With the launching of Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti's promised tax decree, and with the forthcoming (but perhaps less easy) measures relating to the flexibility and functional character of the labor market in sight, the new government is demonstrating its intention of doing a serious job. The objective that it is pursuing with determination, given its urgency -- that of simultaneously stimulating the recovery which is becoming visible, and the possible and necessary expansion of job opportunities -- is aimed at removing obstacles and hindrances to growth, which have for too long paralyzed Italy's economy. Also in terms of method, yesterday's tax "package" has nothing of the chronic emergency approach, nor of the comforting but useless remedies to which bitter experience has too long accustomed us. And the consequences of which are visible to us. Whilst representing solely a relatively limited "advance" on the tax reforms which the government intends to develop, over time, into a major edifice of simplification and efficiency, the measures which have been adopted can have a certain efficacy in the current economic situation. But right now, they touch, within a relatively short time frame, on certain key points of the functioning, or more accurately, the -- in the long term paralyzing and unbearable -- malfunctioning of the very structure of the Italian economy. Moreover, the package consists, to a large extent, of provisions which together seek to create a (minimal) relationship of trust between the state and taxpayers. As first steps on the road toward rationalizing tax structures and a gradual shift of the tax burden from direct to indirect taxation, in particular in support of production and hence of jobs, these provisions mark out the route which the government will be taking. Moreover, not a few of the measures which have been adopted reflect the need to begin to move decisively toward a substantial modernization of the system in a European direction. To the immediate objective of providing incentives to improve companies' capacity to generate new productive thrusts, new employment, new income, and to providing immediate incentives to the formation of new entrepreneurship (also in the form of self-employment), is added to the partial detaxing of reinvested profits and the introduction of the "dry dividend tax" on stock exchange listed companies. Tax Parity They are the first steps too in the direction of the essential tax parity of financial activities, in favor of companies and, more generally, of productive investment. One may wonder whether these initial measures, aimed at creating jobs, may not perchance threaten the other essential target to be attained: that of reducing the budget deficit and, indirectly, achieving monetary stability and the lowering of interest rates. The conviction (and the commitment to ensure) that this will not happen, as a result of the increase in income and hence of the tax base as a result of the stimuli to expansion and the economic efficiency of the tax reductions contained in the government's measures, lead us to hope for the arrival, also in theory, of a "Tremonti curve" in place of the Laffer curve.
