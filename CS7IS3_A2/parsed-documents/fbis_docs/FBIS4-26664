The week-long exhibition, which has attracted some 900 well-known car companies and manufacturers as well as 11 government agencies and trade associations from all over the world, is the largest ever staged in China, said sources from the organizing committee. Overseas auto enterprises, numbering four times as many as at the previous event in 1992, include France's Renault, Peugeot and Citroen; Japan's Toyota, Mitsubishi and Honda; Germany's Volkswagen, Audi and BMW; the United States' General Motors and Ford, and dozens of others. Official statistics indicate that China produced 1.34 million automobiles last year, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier. A further rise of 15 percent is expected for this year and the output for the year 2000 is estimated at three million. K.S. Tong, general manager of Adsale Exhibition Services Ltd., one of the organizers of the ongoing exhibition, said that auto companies worldwide are quite optimistic about the Chinese market, despite a six percent drop in China's auto import volume during the first quarter of this year from the same period of the previous year. "China will emerge as the world's potentially largest market as a result of a sustainable growing Chinese economy," Tong said. The fact that more and more of the world's auto giants have been eager to enter the Beijing international auto fair indicates that they are interested and confident in the China market, he explained. Official data show that 80 percent of the Chinese buyers of sedan cars last year were government organizations. Private enterprises and foreign-funded joint ventures accounted for 19 percent, leaving only one percent for individual buyers. Conservative forecasts have put the Chinese auto parts market at some 5.7 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000. Many foreign companies and manufacturers have promised to elbow in for a share of the China market, by developing new models that suit Chinese living standards and transportation facilities. The Beijing international automotive industry exhibition, first started in 1990, is held every other year. Some 200,000 people are expected to visit this year's exhibition, which ends on June 29.
