Investigations and treatment of patients suffering, as commonly believed, from incurable and fatal illnesses, e.g., Down syndrome, diabetes, ParkinsonUs disease, AlzheimerUs disease, and many others, including various immune system deficiency syndromes, will treated in it. Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor Gennadiy Sukhikh, who has become its General Director, has headed the Institute. The transplantation of human embryonal tissues is the method of treatment of so extensive spectrum of diseases. The first studies in this sphere appeared as far back as the 1920s, and moreover, in the USSR, recounted Chairman of the Council of the MIBM, Dr. Michael Molnar, an American of Hungarian extraction. But due to the exceptionally powerful anti-abortion movement in the US and Western Europe, governmental support of research projects, including the use of human fetal tissues, is so restricted that the progress achieved by Western medicine in this field is very slight for practical purposes. As a result, the development of new treatment technologies along these lines has not been noted. Russia is a different business.S Russia is in fact a different business. Abortions had already been permitted in the Soviet Union for several decades, and until the present, have unfortunately remained the main method for the regulation of the birth rate; this is supported by the existing public health system. About four million abortions are carried out annually within the walls of medical establishments, and presumably as many criminal abortions. Thus, the resources of human embryonal tissues which are intended for use in the MIBM are comparable only with the reserves of oil and gas. At first there were funds, and facilities, equipment, and personnel as well. The Russian Scientific Research Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health and the Biocellular Research Organization, Ltd. (USA) created the Russian joint-stock company, RMIBMS, officially registered in Russia. The charter fund was distributed in the following manner: Biocellular Research Organization, Ltd. - 51 per cent; Center - 49 per cent. Such a distribution of contributions will undoubted be reflected, sooner or later, in the economic policy of the MIBM and the level of interference in its affairs of the Russian Ministry of Health. The Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology is a recognized leader in the country in this field, and it has been entrusted with the development of medical indications and technologies for the interruption of pregnancy at various points of the gestation period. It has been decided that the Department of Human Reproduction will supply the MIBM with the necessary quantity of embryonal tissues and carry on medical research and the treatment of patients. The obligations of the Biocellular Research Organization include the equipping of the laboratory for the isolation and preparation of the fetal tissues for the purpose of their subsequent transplantation. Leading specialists of Russia, Europe, and the USA form the medical personnel of the MIBM. A Scientific Consultation Council has been formed, consisting of 15 major scholars of various fields of medicine, the overwhelming majority of whom are members of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. An agreement has been reached with the Russian GovernmentUs Medical Center regarding the use of its facilities. Thus, there is no doubt that the Institute's development will not encounter serious impediments, regardless of the contentions and objections of ethicists, legal scholars, and the church. Is this for good or ill? The dispute has already heated up. The German magazine, Die Stern declared the following in its article on the work of the MIBM: In the majority of countries the use of fetal cells for these purposes is generally prohibited out of the considerations of elementary ethics. And those scientific centers which conduct research along these lines utilize individual embryos... which the obtain after the decision of competent commissions, with observation of all ethical norms and with the full and voluntary consent of the women. Moreover, the German journalists accused MIBM specialists of using five-month fetuses. The Director of the Russian Scientific Research Center [RNITs], Vladimir Kulakov, has been compelled to justify himself and to prove that only nonviable embryos, weighing up to 500 g, the results either of spontaneous abortions or medical abortions, have been used for medical purposes. Such manipulations with embryos that have not reached the half-kilogram boundary do not contradict either Russian law or the international system of calculating infant mortality. Previously this valuable biological material was simply liable to be thrown out. The Russian Ministry of Health has granted the Institute the right of expert review in the field of transplantation of human fetal tissues. The new technology has also obtained in the RF governmentUs Department of Medicine. The mechanism of treatment has not yet been studied completely. Nevertheless, there already are available, in the words of MIBM researchers, statistics and clinical data that indicate the high degree of effectiveness of preparations of embryonal tissues. We have at our disposal Tknow-howU which enables us both to store and to prepare tissues for transplantation, says Gennadiy Sukhikh. They are reduced to pharmaceutical form (something like a jelly) and are placed in test-tubes, from which the material for injection is taken. We obtain liver, pancreatic, brain, kidney tissue... Up to 27 types of tissues are used. Special preservative solutions are added. Preliminarily we carry out histological, biochemical, and virological analyses. Testing for the presence of hepatitides, HIV infection, and syphilis is obligatory. The list of analyses will be expanded continually. RA preparation from a specific types of tissues or their combination is administered to a patient, depending upon his illness. RWhat is the percent of useful outcome out of the total volume of tissue you obtain?S RI thinks 10-15 percent. But, taking the effectiveness of the preparations into account, that is not so low. For the treatment of burns, for example, there is enough tissue from one fetus; three to four fetuses may be required for the treatment of female infertility, when there is the possibility of compensating the ovaries. How many first-class fetuses does the Institute need in a year? About 500 abortions are required. There already is an agreement with several of the capital's regional antenatal clinics. When the system will be organized and the women recognize that the abortion can be done at the highest medical level, without detriment to reproductive function, the problem of supplying the Institute will be solved. However, at first we expect some shortage. Physicians throughout the word are struggling to reduce the number of abortions, while today it seems that you are interested in increasing their number. Isn't this amoral? The number of abortions in the world and here in Russia will decrease. This is inevitable. And our interest infetal tissue will hardly affect the statistics. Moreover, humanity will never entirely relinquish abortions. Do you not fear criticism of your activities? What we are doing of course destroys many moral stereotypes. But we are physicians, and thus, rationalists. Aren't you in danger of the fact that commercialization of this type of treatment may lead to moral catastrophe, or even to crimes? Human embryonal tissues will never be the object of commerce, since this field has always been under the professional control of the health protection system. That means that nowhere and to no one should the thought occur that abortions could at some time become an object from which material benefit is extracted, if medical science discovers an opportunity for the use of human embryonal tissues in treatment technologies. All of our pediatric patients will be hospitalized together with their parents in the pediatric unit of the Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Government's Medical Center. Adult patients will undergo treatment in the corresponding departments of the Central Clinical Hospital [TKB], which, from the point of view of its material and technical level, is equipped and staffed in accordance with the standards of the US and the countries of Western Europe. RI would like to note that the WHO has been familiar with our project since the beginning of its existence, follows its development, collaborates with us at present, and intends to preserve it in the future. When the methodology will be definitively developed and standardized, the WHO may recognize the MIBM as a collaborative center.
