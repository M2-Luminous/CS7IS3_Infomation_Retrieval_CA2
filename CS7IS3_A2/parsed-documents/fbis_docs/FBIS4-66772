It started with the transmission of the Egyptian satellite channel, and in one year, the number of Arab satellite stations reached 14. Their number is expected to reach 28 in the next five years Thus the competition has intensified, and the confrontation has multiplied in the war that men with neckties and white collars and beautiful women announcers are waging directly in the air What is this conflict?! Has the map of media leadership in the region changed? And what is the role of Egyptian production [facilities] and of Egyptian television along with its rich archives in this frantic Arab competition for the world of space? First, we must admit that there are no satisfactory answers to all these questions. The fact is that this Arab rivalry is a collection of puzzles and filled with mystery. On this basis, we will try to get acquainted with this subject through meetings with the people responsible for some of the satellite channels--Egyptian and Arab--and those in charge of television production work, despite their discrepancies. The Air Wars In mid-October 1994, the trial transmission of ART [Arab Radio & Television] television on four seperate channels began from Rome. An Italian television company had gone broke, so the owners of ART television bought it and rented four channels on the Arab Arabsat D.I. [expansion not given] satellite at a rate of $1 million annually for each channel! The Arabsat D.I. satellite carries 13 satellite channels reserved completely for renters through Lebanese, Saudi, and Gulf agencies. The first of the channels is the Lebanese "Future" channel that began trial transmission and then was stopped by the war in Lebanon. Another leasee is the "Resources" group that has been getting ready for several months to start transmission on four channels. It is composed of a group of Saudi businessmen! The top managers of ART television are Shaykh Salih Kamil and Shaykh Walid Bin Sulman. The management of the four channels is distributed as follows: Samia Sadiq is the president of the general purpose channel, Mona Gaber is the president of the children's channel, Muhammad Yasin (Lebanese) is the president of the Arab and foreign films channel, Ali al-Bunud (Saudi) is the president of the sports channel as a backup for the broadcasts of Salah Zaki, who presented his resignation before the start of trial transmissions. There is also Hamdi Quandil, the regional representative, who handles the company's relations with the international organizations and associations! Hamdi Quandil summarizes the most important characteristics of ART television as follows: "Currently, the average daily broadcast is for 15 hours per channel, except the children's channel, which is linked to the children's schedule because it receives television programs at fixed times. Among our future goals is 24-hour transmissions, except for the children's channel, which will operate between 12 and 15 hours a day. There are several companies providing private television support for ART channels like the Arab Production Company in Cairo. There are also other production centers in Tunis, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon. ART television does not offer any news programs or news transmissions, especially since most of the other Arab and foreign satellite stations are already doing it." I asked him why the Arabs go to Europe for satellite transmission and why specifically to Italy? [Quandil] We wanted to broadcast ART television from Cairo. We submitted actual requests, and we negotiated with the Ministry of Communications, but circumstances didn't permit! [Sa'ad] Which circumstances, and what is the reason for the lack of agreement? [Quandil] The truth is that the request was not approved, and I still don't know why! [Sa'ad] There is a charge that ART television overpays its business partners, as though it were trying to pull the rug out from under the feet of Egyptian television. [Quandil] This is not true, because we benefit from the financial regulations of Egyptian television and our rules don't permit payments more then 10 percent above the Egyptian television [schedule]. [Sa'ad] Why do you believe there is the increased interest in satellite stations in the Arab region? [Quandil] Arab investors are realizing the importance of investing some of this capital in this field! [Sa'ad] What is the rate of return that the Arab investors are deriving from these channels? [Quandil] Income is from the advertisements and subscriptions. We expect each one of these private channels to encrypt its message, just like the news channel CNN. So far no Arab channel depends on subscriptions; most financing is from advertisements, especially since the volume of advertisements and their price go down when subscription charges begin. [Sa'ad] What is the future of these many channels, and can the advertisements cover the cost? [Quandil] These channels are like any other project--they are exposed to profit or loss and in constant need of great economic expertise and outstanding experience. Although I am sure that some of the Arab satellite channels will go broke, I am also sure that many more channels will appear over the next few years! [Sa'ad] Is it correct that there is a war between these channels?! [Quandil] Without a doubt. There is sharp competition, and survival of the fittest, at least for the private channels. Because countries can support their stations to maintain their national prestige, because, unlike the private companies, the governments do not depend on money alone! There are now 14 satellite channels in the Arab region as follows: Egyptian, MBC [Middle East Broadcasting Center], four channels of ART, Moroccan, Amman, Tunis, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar--which began trial transmissions one month ago--and Jordan. This, in addition to a number of other land-based stations that are waiting for the opportunity to break into the satellite world. For example, in Lebanon there are 34 [local] television stations available, plus the "closed cable" systems that are present in a number of Arab countries. The first of these countries is Dubai, which operates three television systems: land-based, satellite, and closed cable. Note: The Dubai station's broadcasting hours approach the hours of television broadcasting on all of the channels of the Arab Republic of Egypt, from the first channel through the seventh. Dubai has the first channel; the foreign channel; the satellite channel; and, on the closed cable system, the educational channel and the information channel; and the trial stations for sports and films. And, during this past Ramadan, Egyptian television entered as a partner into production of the "Qays and Laila" series, which Dubai television produced for broadcasting on Egyptian television! Crowding in Space 'Amar Al-Lagthi, president of the MBC, thinks there is a difference between government and private channels, because the government channels have strategic goals, the most important being its presence outside the political borders! He adds that the government satellite stations have an economic advantage over private television stations becuse the state channels have a source of television materials from the land-based channels which feed them programs and products. MBC, however, needs to do everything because it doesn't have the backup stations on the ground. Even marketing these products has been a problem. It is assumed that the broadcasting of material comes first, but their marketing is hard in countries that have seen them by way of the dish, and we are forced to sell at reduced prices, except in one instance--that we agree with a number of stations to all broadcast the same program at the same time, as happened with "The Riddles of Samir Ghanim" last Ramadan. 'Amar al-Lagthi confirmed that most of these private stations depend first and foremost on advertising, because private stations can only depend on subscriptions if they offer different content from other stations. The fact is that all the Arab satellite channels have similar content! [Sa'ad] I observed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia issued a decision forbidding the use of the dish, and asked how advertisers can agree to pay an advertising price when Saudi Arabia doesn't receive it? [al-Lagthi] I believe that Saudi Arabia forbid the dish, but it supplied the alternative cable system which permits receiving some channels and not others. [Sa'ad] Also, there is an accusation that you are contracting with the Egyptian television workers for higher sums of money. Is this true? [al-Lagthi] We are working with movie producers not television staff, and we respect the decisions of Safwat al-Sharif, minister of information, that forbid doing business with two stations at once. Therefore, we didn't make use of any current broadcaster. We decided from the beginning to give the opportunity to unknown young people, because broadcasters are a part of the personality of the channel and it is not permissible for them to appear in multiple stations! I don't deny that our prices are high, for a simple reason: We are the private sector. The difference between our prices and the television prices is the difference between work in the government and work in the private sector. [Sa'ad] Is there a "satellite war" now between the Arabs in the area of satellite channels? [al-Lagthi] No. But there is a satellite crunch. That's all. Nothing else. The reason being that the volume of television production in the Arab world has not risen in spite of the additional channels. The channels that will last are those that set up television production facilities and studios. MBC plans to establish television studios. Egyptian television is still the leader in this area. It owns the largest production base in the Arab region. I hope all the Arab owners of these channels will unite to complete the studios project in the 6 October City so they will be exploited to expand the production base, increase the labor force, and improve the Arabic media tools, because we assume that our goal is the same--to fight off the foreign satellite channels and to lure the Arab viewers away from them. Outside the competition Suhayr al-Atribi, president of the Egyptian satellite channel, said that there is no decision forbidding doing business with the Arab channels, with the exception of the broadcast announcers. This is the situation inside Egyptian television itself, which forbids an announcer who works on one channel from appearing on another! Suhayr al-Atribi sees no danger from these channels for Egyptian television because they basically do not compete. And in the last opinion polls of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-ANBA', the Egyptian satellite channel was ahead of all the satellite channels during 1993! [Sa'ad] The Egyptian satellite station is supposed to be supported by Arab advertising in the geographical areas that use it. So, does this happen? [al-Atribi] In our new plan Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister of information, promised that the satellite channels would transmit to the United States of America and agreement has actually been reached. As for advertising, I believe that the entire Arab region is competing to advertise [in Egypt]. There is a Saudi-American agency that bought the advertising of the Egyptian satellite channel. Every Egyptian is entitled to advertise with us through the economic production sector. Advertising is continually increasing. When I took charge of the channel in 1992, advertising was 15 seconds daily. It has now risen to 72 minutes daily! [Sa'ad] There are also accusations concerning the quality of the satellite channels and the news they offer! [al-Atribi] The news on the satellite channel is not my speciality. So far we get the news from the central television news [service]. When I took over the channel, Mr. Safwat al-Sharif told me I was to be responsible for the programming only. As for the news, it will arrive ready made from the television news [service]. [Sa'ad] Is this channel to have a different status, and is it supposed to be provided with a number of correspondents in the Arab world to cover real-time news and transmit it immediately? [al-Atribi] This question is above my competence. Generally, I try to cover the Arab world by following the meetings and activities that occur in Cairo. Also, the [Egyptian] satellite channel has begun to show 25 percent of the programs that are produced for it on an exclusive basis, because our study confirmed that some programs are only of local interest. [Sa'ad] Suhayr al-Atribi, what is the satellite channel's policy in light of the prevailing competition, and what is your opinion of the decision forbidding the dish in Saudi Arabia? [al-Atribi] I don't think about the competition. We just work and, thank God, we have what we need and no one can compete with us. As for the issue of the dish, I asked and they said that the Egyptian satellite channel will not be abolished. Saudi Arabia will bring in the cable system and I believe that the Egyptian satellite channel will be among the first of the channels that will be included in this system. The president of the production sector, Mamduh al-Lagthi, said that the decision of Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister of information, is a basic organizational process. Egypt is rich in the expertise of its young people, and it doesn't withhold its expertise from any Arab state. Rather, it supports them culturally and in production. The decisions aimed at guaranteeing the level of wages and protection of our work secrets and our television archives from every temptation. Thus, the goal is regulation and not forbiddance. He added that Egypt, its production sector, the television union, and the Egyptian media are beyond Arab media competition, becuse Egypt has organizational and technical capabilities and a history and literary wealth unlike anything in the region. We do not compete with anyone, but we support the Arab brothers, and this is not arrogance or a type of pride. [Sa'ad] [addressing al-Lagthi] But the Arab stations pay much higher prices than the television production sector? [al-Lagthi] If it were only that... Money isn't everything. Believe me, any artist thinks it over carefully when he knows that his work will be seen by a wide audience in Egypt. Yes, there are material temptations, but there is a very important spiritual burden for the artist, and his value is limited here in Egypt. His income level in the future will also be limited here. His work in Egypt is what will limit his earnings elsewhere! [Sa'ad] But is there a fear of a brain drain to these television stations? [al-Lagthi] No. This is also not true, as is evidenced by the fact that we have been working in the production sphere for 34 years, while these stations were also producing television productions. And if you consult the list of names of artistic productions that were produced outside of Egypt and stuck in the minds of the Arab viewer, you will find them not exceeding two or three productions. Muhammad Fadil directed them and Mahfudh Abd al-Rahman wrote them, i.e., directors and writers of Egyptian television. At the same time, there are names of thousands of important dramatic works that Egyptian television has produced! [Sa'ad] What is the size of the production of the production sector and the broadcasting and television union as compared to the production of the Arab satellite channels? [al-Lagthi] I believe it is more than five-fold what all the Arab channels produce collectively. The First Egyptian Satellite Amin Basyuni, president of the broadcasting and television union, preferred to speak about the evolution of Egyptian television after clarifying that there is no danger to the role of the Egyptian satellite channel from competition like the following: The Egyptian media is working toward and has its sights on the future. Recently, Mr. Safwat al-Sharif prepared a study on the project to launch the first Egyptian satellite that would provide more media services for culture, education, and training. During the next few days, the study of the project will be presented to the Council of Ministers. Currently, Egyptian television makes use of the fiber optics system for transmission of the broadcasting and television service, in addition to microwave links. This helps make the picture clearer. And we started their propagation from our transmission stations! Egyptian television now uses the digital system. It is the most modern television technology. It is what is called overseas high definition television. It means programming of receivers and transmission stations and recording by a high precision and high definition system. It is the most recent international experiment in the field of communications. [Sa'ad] Some people think that there is a fear of losing the television archives to other satellite channels. [Basyuni] The tapes of the archives come and go by a system of regulations, and no television tape can be taken outside of the building even if it is empty. The owners of these channels can buy what they want from the archive officially through the television and broadcasting union and at fixed prices, and there is never any business conducted behind closed doors! [Sa'ad] What were the reactions to the decision of Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister of information, to prohibit television staff from contracting with other television stations? [Basyuni] First, I want to clarify something important. There is a difference between duty and cooperation. We do not permit anybody to combine two posts at one time. This is an Egyptian labor law. Secondly, we have allowed our staff to do business with these television stations on the condition that management is sure that it doesn't affect the amount of effort given to basic television assignments. Anyone who wants to occupy a post in one of these television stations can submit a request for rotation or resignation. These are the facts of the decisions, removed from any conjecture! [Sa'ad] Why are there no systematic arrangements with the owners of these channels? [Basyuni] There is actually an existing arrangement through the Arab Broadcasting Union whose headquarters is in Tunis and which belongs to the Arab League. There is a permanent committee of this union that is composed of authorized representatives of the Arab information ministries. It presents its reports to the Conference of Arab Information Ministers. Thus, there is coordination at the highest level. But the problem currently is that these committees work for television cooperation between the Arab government stations. The private stations need to participate in this integral web! For example, the Arab television stations have had difficulties for many years in communicating with each other to exchange media feeds due to rising media charges. Recently, an Arab satellite channel was rented for media exchange between all the Arab stations. Every Arab television is to send three packets--news, culture, and sports--via this channel which receives and retransmits them to any Arab channel requesting them--without reciprocity. The permanent committee is responsible for the channel's rent, which amounts to 1 million [Egyptian] pounds annually! There is another side to the picture--the producers' side. Ibrahim Abu Dhikri, general secretary of the Arab Distributors and Producers Union for television productions made it clear that the producers have several reservations concerning the nature of business with the satellite channels, such as the following: In the past, the land-based stations contracted to buy the producers' works. With satellite transmission, the television product is transmitted over a wider geographical area. This has led to problems with the producers for the following reasons: The producer used to sell a single work to two or three countries. With the satellite channels, the producer sells just once to a channel that covers all of this area and pays approximately the same price as a single country! The producers confirm that [using] the old contracts is absurd and that the agreement does not specify this wide geographical area. The satellite stations are deriving their authority from documents written as contracts for intellectual property. The Arab intellectual property is not used on the satellite stations as it is on its foreign counterparts. For example, the foreign serial is shown for the first time at full price. The second time, at half-price, and its use ends within a specified time period. The Arab stations are obligated to do that, but they don't work with the Arab intellectual property in this way. They buy it once and use it forever! Currently, we are preparing a detailed memorandum on these problems to present to the Permanent Committee on Arab Media of the Arab League to be raised at the Arab Information Ministers conference this coming July in Cairo! The current situation is causing many problems with distribution. All of the old schools of marketing have died, and another, unknown language has risen. The strange thing is that these situations themselves are producing television productions and they know how much they cost. If a station can produce a program for $20,000, and can buy it ready-made from the producer for $3,000, is that reasonable?! What is even stranger is that some of the satellite stations strip the distinguishing logo off the satellite channel material so that the producer that sold the literary work to the land-based station can protest in spite of the fact that the intellectual material is broadcast by satellite! A Last Word These are not the only words that were said on the issue of the future of the Arab satellite channels. Perhaps what helps to understand these puzzles is this strange succession and competition for buying ownership of Egyptian technical products and the invasion of the world production! The most recent news of the satellite channels now is that last week Shaykh Salih Kamil bought all of Jordan's studios, and it is anticipated that he will buy Lebanon's studios also. It is expected that these studios will be the site of the sports channel belonging to ART television. A number of television producers adjusted their work to offer quick services to these stations by opening studios of voice, makeup and television photography! Mona Jabir, president of ART television's children's channel is presently managing the "Gemini" Studios of voice and image. They are outfitted with the most modern equipment and material. This is in addition to her work as the president of a channel for offering facilities for new television! A number of Arab stations have begun to gradually introduce the local dialect of their countries through satellite stations! This is the final picture of the competition that is occurring in the Arab arena, and the opinion of the officials in it. Does it help to solve the puzzles that still intensify the mystery of the picture in the sphere of Arab space? That is the question!
