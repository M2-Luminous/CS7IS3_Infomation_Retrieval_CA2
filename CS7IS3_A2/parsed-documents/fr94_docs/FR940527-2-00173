Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) using alternate travel modes; (3) transportation systems management; (4) improvement of the existing highway system; and (5) constructing a four-lane, limited access highway on new location. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments were sent to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and organizations on January 3, 1994. A series of public meetings have been held in the project area between January and May 1994. In addition, several public hearings will be held in the project area. Public notice will be given of the time and place of these hearings. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment. These activities are providing input regarding the scope of the EIS. To ensure that the full range of issues to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and suggestions concerning the proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
