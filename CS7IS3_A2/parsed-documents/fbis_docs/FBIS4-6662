On 19 April, a top government official denied the remarks as groundless, saying: "We have let officials check whether remarks have been made to that effect, but at the end of the check no such remarks were found to have been made." The front-page article cited the testimony of a source familiar with Japan-U.S. relations, the Japan-U.S. summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in February, and the talks held between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Marrakech, Morocco, on 14 April during the ministerial talks of the Uruguay Round. According to the testimony, during the Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton pointed out to Prime Minister Hosokawa that a political party which maintains a close relationship with North Korea is positioned at "the center of the government." Clinton then asked the prime minister whether Japan would be able to enforce economic sanctions against North Korea. Also, Vice President Gore candidly told Foreign Minister Hata that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is believed to have friendly ties with North Korea. Gore said he was wondering if Tokyo could really accept economic sanctions against North Korea as long as the SDPJ participated in the coalition government.
