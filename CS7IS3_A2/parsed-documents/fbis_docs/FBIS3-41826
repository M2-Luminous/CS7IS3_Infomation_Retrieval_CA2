Factor-R has been developed by a medical team headed by Prof. Bogdan Petrunov, director of the National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases. The team has been working jointly with Life Choice International and the Applied Research Combine of Pharmaceutics. The tests of the preparation began in October last year.
