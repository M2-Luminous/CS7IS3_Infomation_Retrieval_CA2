FR941230-1-00009 FR941230-1-00003 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;24&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion The FAA has received a report where excessive current flow caused the electrical landing gear motor and wiring to catch fire on a Beech Model 200 airplane. Investigation revealed that the right main landing gear actuator assembly jammed, causing the actuator to slow or stall the landing gear motor. This caused the motor to use excessive current, which caused smoke to fill the cockpit and cabin. Other incidents where the landing gear motor used excessive current have been reported; however, in these incidents, airplane safety was not an issue. Beech has issued Service Bulletin No. 2035, Issued: February 1985; Revised: August 1990, which specifies procedures for preparing the airplane for the installation of a circuit breaker on the landing gear motor control panel assembly of certain Beech Model F90, and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The instructions included with the following kits specify instructions for installing this circuit breaker: 101&hyph;3069&hyph;1 S, 101&hyph;3069&hyph;3 S, 101&hyph;3069&hyph;5 S, and 101&hyph;3133&hyph;1 S. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent excessive current flow through the electrical landing gear motor, which, if not corrected, could result in an airplane fire. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech Model F90, and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing a circuit breaker on the landing gear motor control panel assembly. The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with Beech SB No. 2035, Issued: February 1985; Revised August 1990; and the instructions to the applicable Landing Gear Motor Circuit Breaker Installation Kit (specified above). The FAA estimates that 2,297 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 workhours (varies between 2 to 6 workhours depending on the airplane model) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. The cost per parts varies by airplane model; however, for purposes of this proposed AD, $1,000 is utilized. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,137,702. This figure is based on the assumption that no U.S. operator of the affected airplanes has accomplished the proposed installation. Beech has informed the FAA that approximately 2,100 installation kits have been sold. Assuming that each of these kits is installed on one of the affected airplanes, the proposed cost impact on U.S. operators would be reduced by $2,868,600 from $3,137,702 to $369,102. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.
