That is where passions are seething! The whole point is that the draft agreement on dual citizenship was prepared by the Russian side and conveyed through the Russian Embassy in Kyrgyzstan to the republic's president and government. Later there was Askar Akayev's New Year address to the people, his interviews with newspapers, and speeches in which he noted that dual citizenship "will be useful to both sides and will introduce a new spirit of trust, cooperation, and fraternity to relations between the two peoples -- Russian and Kyrgyz." And most importantly it will work like a dam in the path of the stream of the Russian-speaking population leaving the republic. After all, last year alone, according to the Slav foundation, over 100,000 Russian speakers, as almost all inhabitants of nonindigenous nationality are now called here, left Kyrgyzstan. And those who left were primarily skilled national economy specialists, doctors, teachers, and engineers. The republic's president is concerned. Measures are being urgently elaborated in the government to halt this destructive flow. But the process has begun, as the saying goes. And, unfortunately, it is being accelerated by several political parties defending so-called "national resurrection." Closing their eyes to the obvious advantages of dual citizenship both for Russians and for the Kyrgyz, not only, for instance, in the stabilization of the situation in the republic but also in the sphere of science, education, and so forth, they have rallied on one salient -- preventing the signing of this agreement. The fiercest attacks on Askar Akayev come from the headquarters of the "Asaba" national resurrection party. Its central council has stated categorically and without beating about the bush: "The introduction of dual citizenship is a threat not only to the sovereignty of the Kyrgyz state but also to the very existence of the Kyrgyz nation." But sober politicians who have preserved a spirit of internationalism do not think that way at all. Here is the opinion of Feliks Sharshenbayevich Kulov, a hero of August 1991 in Kyrgyzstan, vice president, and now head of the administration of Chuyskaya Oblast, the largest in the republic: "I hope no one can accuse me of lacking patriotism, and I hope it does not seem immodest, but my actions have spoken louder than any words.... I unconditionally support the idea of dual citizenship since it serves primarily the interests of the Kyrgyz nation and could become the foundation of our state's security." An interview with Chingiz Aytmatov appeared in VECHERNIY BISHKEK at just the right time. Considering Russian culture and its influence on him as an Asian man, the writer simply and clearly told his fellow citizens as if for their edification: "How blind are those who call for national self-isolation, speaking of national exclusiveness. That road is a dead end. I think Kyrgyz culture should in no circumstances separate itself from Russian culture, from the Russian language which opened the way for the Kyrgyz people into world culture." Whether or not there is to be dual citizenship will most likely be decided in the next few days. Optimists, and there are many of them among sober Kyrgyz politicians, believe that Askar Akayev will embark on such an interstate agreement between Russia and Kyrgyzstan after victory at the referendum.
