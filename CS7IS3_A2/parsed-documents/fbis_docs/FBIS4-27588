Exports to China totaled 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months, up just 11.5 percent from 1.58 billion dollars a year earlier. The January-April growth is dwarfed by the 175.2-percent surge recorded in the same period last year. Exports to the vast market grew 28.6 percent in January, 20.5 percent in February and 10.6 percent in March, then slipped 2.3 percent in April. Exports to China, a major contributor to Korea's trade balance, have slowed despite the continued popularity of most items because of a drop in two mainstays, cars and steel. In the first four months of last year, 294.8 million dollars worth of cars were sold to China, 227 times more than a year earlier, but the volume plunged 94 percent to 17.8 million dollars worth this year. With steel exports sinking 27.1 percent to 341.4 million dollars from 468.1 million dollars, the share of the two items in shipments to China fell to 20.4 percent from last year's 48.2 percent. Beijing's restrictions on imports to promote its own car industry since late last year explain the decrease in auto exports while steel shipments dropped due to a lack of stock for exports because of high demand at home and an easing of the construction boom in China. Exports to China have surged since relations were normalized in August 1992, to the point of posting 94.1-percent growth last year. However, Korea can no longer expect such growth due to sluggish exports of automobiles and steel products, BOK officials said. As exports of other items are still going strong, posting growth of 71.5 percent in this period, shipments to China are expected to account for around 6 percent of total exports, close to last year's 6.3 percent.
