After the audience, the Rwandan emissary told the media that he bore a message from Rwandan Interim President Theodore Sindikubwabo to Togolese President General Gnassingbe Eyadema on the current political and military situation in Rwanda. [Begin recording] [Ngirabatware] I have just been received by President Eyadema to whom I delivered a message from the Rwandan president. Our discussions centered on the current political and military situation in Rwanda. On 1 October 1990, Rwanda was attacked from Uganda by an army composed of Rwandan refugees. We later negotiated a cease-fire with them and signed the Arusha peace agreements. On 6 April, President Habyarimana and his Burundi counterpart were killed in a plane crash by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and its supporters. Since then, the country has been in flames and the transitional government, which was formed in accordance with the Rwandan Constitution, is doing everything to stop the interethnic conflict. The Rwandan Government's second ultimate objective is to sign a cease-fire agreement with the RPF as it is convinced that the RPF can never seize power in Rwanda. The people do not support it. The Rwandan Government is convinced that all sons and daughters of Rwanda, both Hutus and Tutsis, must live together on the national territory in peace. This is the subject of the message I delivered to the president. I also answered President Eyadema's questions on the possible restoration of peace in Rwanda. [Unidentified correspondent] On the military situation, what exactly is happening in your country? [Ngirabatware] The military situation is very, very difficult to describe because of the RPF's method of fighting. The situation is really difficult to describe but on the whole the Rwandan Armed Forces are in the process of controlling the city of Kigali. RPF soldiers are scattered in pockets around Kigali but according to the latest information, it is time for mopping up operations. The RPF has made slight advances from the Ugandan border to the southeastern part of the country where the fighting is going on but the Rwandan Armed Forces are very alert. [Correspondent] On the diplomatic level, taking current initiatives into account, is there any hope for the rapid restoration of peace in your country? [Ngirabatware] Concerning hope, I, personally, am always optimistic. Even if the recent interethnic conflicts in Rwanda have scared me, I am, by nature, optimistic and I nourish the hope that Rwanda can overcome this crisis. On the diplomatic level, the Rwandan Government appeals to all powers, both African and Western, to convince the RPF that the cease-fire is an obligation and a necessity, because the RPF does not care if human beings continue to die. Taking Rwanda's political structure into account the RPF cannot, in any way, seize power in Rwanda. The RPF is in the minority, but it is a strong minority, a minority that the Hutu majority in Rwanda must absolutely compose with. The two sides will certainly gain nothing from constant war, so the government is doing everything possible to ensure the implementation of a cease-fire. Of course, as usual, the RPF is not showing any clear desire for the implementation of this cease-fire but we will continue to demand its implementation. [end recording]
