The delegates declared their loyalty to the PSL members, and they expect the PSL to respond in kind. We Demand Loyalty "Waldemar Pawlak wants deputy prime ministers to execute the government's policies, not to cocreate them. He regards the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee as a forum for discussion, the decisions of which can be changed without reason," Sejm Deputy Marek Borowski, former deputy prime minister and finance minister, fulminated during the SdRP session. "One must define with precision who is responsible for what in this government. This is not a coalition but a case of PSL domination." Borowski added that the "hesitant" PSL is also to blame for Lech Walesa's successes in his little games with the government. He also admonished his colleagues from the Sejm deputies club for creating a "joyous legislative legacy" and for lack of discipline during votes. This time, Borowski said, the disciplined PSL should be an example to follow. "The SdRP, while expressing its respect for agreements that have been signed and loyalty and understanding vis-a-vis the coalition partner, expects the same from the partner," the convention's resolution reads. Rakowski's Attack Journalists expected fights between the party "liberals" and "social democrats." They were hoping for a Kwasniewski-Rakowski polemic exchange, especially given Rakowski's article published in POLITYKA, in which he mercilessly attacked the SdRP leader and party policies. Rakowski wrote that "social democrats are wearing liberals' pants" and that they want "capitalism with a human face." Rakowski's suspicion is that some SdRP leaders would prefer to be supported by entrepreneurs than by workers. He expressed his indignation at "social democrats' active participation in the building of capitalism in Poland"--he means Privatization Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek--and at the "we want to be in NATO" demands. Rakowski accuses the leaders of having abandoned the "It doesn't have to be that way anymore" slogan after the elections, and he is critical of Kwasniewski for his confession that he feels closer to the Democratic Union than to the PSL. Many other party members have similar views to those of Rakowski. They call themselves "Millerists" (meaning they are supporters of Leszek Miller), as opposed to the liberal "Aleksandrists." While not making any references to Rakowski's article, Kwasniewski engaged in polemics with Rakowski and the "Millerists": "The SdRP must fight for economic development. It would be a tragedy if left-wing rule were to bring to mind inflation, economic chaos, and breach of ties to international institutions." He added that "there are no miracles": there is no way that promises can be fulfilled all at once--for instance, elimination of the popiwek [wage-controlling legislation]. Kwasniewski then disappeared along with Rakowski, and, when he returned, he ostentatiously hugged Rakowski. Social Democrats' Grievances Only a few activists took the floor during the exchange because Kwasniewski made an appeal to his colleagues not to give journalists a reason to launch an attack on the SdRP. "We were strengthening party unity at the expense of program-related debates," Waldemar Czajkowski, a delegate from Katowice, expressed his regrets. He speculated on the relationship between the views of some activists--for instance, on the issue of privatization--and a provision in the party statute saying that the SdRP is a party of democratic socialism. By saying this, he was definitely making a reference to Borowski, who had spoken out some time before that on the need to speed up privatization. Ryszard Olow from Suwalki expressed his criticism of Kwasniewski's apology to the Solidarity groups: "I have no idea why the apology. Who will apologize to us for the four years, I'm asking?" He also demanded changes at the local level because all that has happened so far has been that politicians from Rozbraty (the SdRP's headquarters) moved to the Sejm building on Wiejska Street. Unity in a Multitude Whereas in the main meeting hall the poor elocution by some Sejm deputies was debated, and delegates showed each other black and honey yellow briefcases they were given as gifts (malicious journalists have calculated the party spent over 60 million zlotys on the gifts), a livelier debate took place unofficially over glasses of beer: "Rakowski is right. Some members of the leadership are closer to salons than to people wearing workmen's jeans. We must be returning to the period of the Polish People's Republic. We must defend the people and the achievements of an economy on the basis of social criteria, and not just on a free market," one of the delegates told us. "If it were not for Kwasniewski, we would no longer be here. We owe our election victory to him," another delegate was trying to convince me. He added that the SdRP leader is an efficient politician, a pragmatic person who knows economic realities and not a populist. He also expressed his praise for Kwasniewski for, among other things, the party's most recent success--that is, the announcement of introducing activists from the Democratic Left Alliance into the "Belweder ministries" (Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Internal Affairs). The entire party leadership received a vote of confidence from the delegates. "This does not prove anything. It has always been the case here that one complains kind of unofficially, but when it comes right down to it, everybody raises his hands anyway," one of the delegates was trying to convince me.
