Background On April 21, 1994, the FAA issued Notice 94&hyph;12, entitled ``Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed Forces'' (59 FR 19114, April 21, 1994) proposing changes that would remove the regulations for issuing type certificates for surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces. The purpose of the proposed removal is to eliminate references to obsolete airworthiness standards that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus airworthiness standards that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus military aircraft. Surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces may still be certificate in normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter, transport, and restricted categories when compliance with the applicable regulations is shown. This proposal, if a adopted as final, would become effective on April 21, 1994, and is intended to provide a greater level of assurance that the appropriate airworthiness standards are met before standard airworthiness certificates are issued for surplus military aircraft. Several telephone and written requests received between June 13 and 14, 1994, asked that the comment period be extended for up to 60 days. In view of these comments and the unanticipated level of public interest in the proposed rule change, the comment period for this notice needs to be reopened to accommodate the requests. Copies of the written requests are available in the docket. Conclusion The FAA has determined that the reopening of the comment period will allow several companies in the aircraft industry additional time for a more thorough review of applicable issues and questions raised by the NPRM, and the drafting of responsive comments. Accordingly, the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to reopen the comment period until August 26, 1994.
