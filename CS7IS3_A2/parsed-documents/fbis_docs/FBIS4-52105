The Jiangxi Provincial people's government officially notified the South Korean Embassy in China that it is detaining a Korean ship, "the 2d Songgwang-ho," and that it has decided to fine the vessel 50,000 U.S. dollars for allegedly fishing in Chinese waters. Of the 50,000 dollars, the fine for illegal fishing is 30,000 dollars and that for violating China's territorial waters is 20,000 dollars. The fine is about 20 times higher than that levied by South Korea on ships violating its territorial waters and so runs counter to the principle of equity, according to ministry officials. Besides, Sin Hyong-pok, captain of the Songgwang-ho, and the other 10 crew members claim they did not violate Chinese waters on purpose but lost control of the ship due to engine trouble. Ministry officials, worried that the problem might develop into a diplomatic tiff, said, "we will make efforts to persuade China to lower the fine as well as return the crew as soon as possible." Chinese patrol ships captured the "Songgwang-ho" in the East China Sea 175 miles southwest of Cheju Island's Mosulpo port last Friday at 11 AM after seizing another fishing vessel, "the Taehung- ho," and its 11 crew. Both vessels were adrift after experiencing engine trouble, according to the crew. Meanwhile, China has not sent an official notification on the capture of the Taehung-ho, the Foreign Ministry said.
