FR940523-0-00057 FR940523-0-00014 The following table establishes the Department's determination as to the quantity of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material and total dry short tons of byproduct material present at each active uranium or thorium processing site as of October 24, 1992. The data from which these quantities are derived were obtained from the reports entitled ``Commingled Uranium Mill Tailings Study, Volume II: Technical Report,'' (DOE, June 30, 1982) and ``Integrated Data Base for 1992: U.S. Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste Inventories, Projections, and Characteristics'' (DOE/RW 0006, Rev. 8). In some cases, this data was updated based on the Department's review of quantity information provided by some licensees in response to the proposed rule. These quantity reports are available in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading Room indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. These quantities shall be the basis for the Department's determination of the Federal reimbursement ratio applicable to each active processing site, unless a licensee requests and the Department agrees to use an alternative method for computing the ratio. These quantities will also be the basis for the Department's determination of the individual maximum reimbursement ceiling applicable to each active uranium processing site. Although Title X provides that the per dry short ton limit on reimbursement for each eligible uranium licensee shall not exceed an amount equal to $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, the Department is authorized to establish a lower per dry short ton limit if necessary. Based on the total quantity of 56.231 million Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material, the Department is establishing an initial per dry short ton limit of $4.80. This is necessary because the aggregate $270 million statutory ceiling will not support the maximum allowable reimbursement of $5.50 per dry short ton, as established by the Act, if remedial action costs at all of the eligible uranium processing sites reach or approach this per dry short ton limit ( i.e. , $270 million divided by 56.231 million Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material equals $4.80 per dry short ton). The Department will adjust the preliminary limit on reimbursement accordingly when the $270 million statutory ceiling is adjusted annually for inflation or if other circumstances, as determined by the Department, enable the adjustment of the preliminary limit.
