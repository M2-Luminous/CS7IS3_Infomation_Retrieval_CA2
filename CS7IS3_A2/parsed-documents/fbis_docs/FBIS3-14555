In reaction to media reports, the IDF spokesman wants to make it clear that the IDF command in Judaea and Samaria has not approved the march, slated to be conducted under the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron," and that the IDF will not safeguard it. It was also decided to prevent entry into Hebron on the day of the march to anybody who is not a town resident. The body of a person suspected of collaboration with Israel, Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ata, 28, a resident of the Rimal neighborhood, was found near a garbage dump in Gaza. Local residents told our correspondent Moti Amir that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members murdered him since he participated in several IDF actions against wanted Hamas people. According to them, more than six months ago Hamas members murdered Abu-'Ata's brother for similar reasons.
