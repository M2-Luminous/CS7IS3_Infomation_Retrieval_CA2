FBIS4-52825 "dreas093_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 South Korea * Manpower in DPRK's Nuclear Program Reported * Manpower in DPRK's Nuclear Program Reported 942C0094A Seoul WOLGAN CHUNGANG in Korean Mar 94 pp 252-267 942C0094A Seoul WOLGAN CHUNGANG Korean CSO [By reporter Song Ui-ho: "Manpower in North Korea's Nuclear Development Program: Its Personal Relationships, Training and Taboos"] [Excerpts] -- To Sang-nok, Han In-sok and other scientists who defected to the North against the "National University Plan" laid the foundations. -- Under General Manager Chong Kun, a "Moscow-trained group" including Choe Hak-kun and Yun Ho-chin played the key role. -- Theses written by 100-odd North Korean scientists in the 1970's are kept in the U.S. National Archives. -- Construction of the Yongbyon nuclear development complex began in 1962. -- Security is so tight that even Kim Il-song has to disembark from his car when entering the Yongbyon complex. When did North Korea embark on its nuclear development program? Who have participated in it, and how has Pyongyang trained the required manpower? And what are the general software levels of the program? These questions surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue have not been fully answered, although there has been a great deal of discussion dealing with hardware. There have been debates as to the type of atomic reactors in Yongbyon, the amount of plutonium they could produce, the kind of reprocessing facilities, and the number of weapons they have possibly developed by now, but almost nothing is known about the people who possibly have participated in those processes. For this reporting, I interviewed nuclear scientists in the South, persons who had served in high positions in North Korea in the past, and correspondents who visited Pyongyang. I also received assistance from intelligence agencies at home and abroad. Among them were some who were deeply involved in the nuclear development effort in the Pak Chong-hui era. Also, I used channels with links to the Japanese Cabinet Information Research Office. North Korea first began exploring nuclear development possibilities in the mid-1950's immediately after the end of the Korean War. Kim Il-song, who had been unnerved by MacArthur's atomic bomb threat, reorganized the Korean People's Army [KPA] in 1954 right after the end of the war, establishing a "Nuclear Weapons Defense Branch" for the first time as part of the reorganization. The next year, in 1955, President Eisenhower went so far as to say that "new-type nuclear weapons" will be deployed to the U.S. Forces in Korea [USFK], stirring North Korea. Meanwhile, President Syngman Rhee, crying out for "March to the North for Reunification," declared that "if the North invades us, we will respond with a nuclear holocaust." North Korea, confronted with the crisis, held a mammoth Pyongyang City Mass Rally on 5 August 1955 to condemn the United States. According to Mr "A," a former North Korean official who participated in that rally, "the uneasy feelings the nuclear threat caused among the North Korean authorities and population then were almost a panic." About that time, the former Soviet Union, then the leading power of the communist world, launched an all-out effort to develop a new-type, nuclear weapon that can match what the United States had. Thus came the "Agreement on the Organization of a Joint Nuclear Research Center" signed in 1956 as part of Soviet nuclear strategy. The agreement stated that 11 socialist countries (the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Poland, East Germany, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania) will pool manpower and material resources for joint nuclear research and utilization to strengthen the nuclear capabilities of the socialist camp. The joint research thus started was conducted at the renowned Dubna Nuclear Research Center in Moscow. It was an old institute reorganized and rechristened "Dubna Joint Nuclear Research Center," they say. "It was then that North Korea, in accordance with the agreement, began sending 20 to 30 nuclear physicists to Dubna every year," said Mr "A." Subsequently, the "Korea-USSR Agreement on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy" was signed in 1959, and North Korea began creating a nuclear development complex in Yongbyon in 1962. Through all this, Pyongyang took interest in a nuclear development program early on. Then came the 1962 "Cuban crisis" which led North Korea to distrust the Soviet nuclear umbrella. The Soviet fleet steaming through the Caribbean Sea carrying missiles to Cuba was confronted with the U.S. threat of war, bowed to the pressure and made an eleventh-hour retreat. NODONG SINMUN strongly criticized the action by Khrushchev. North Korea was seized with apprehensions that with Khrushchev in power, the protection of the Soviet nuclear umbrella could be taken away from it in the event of a similar U.S. threat. It was precisely in December that year at the Fifth Plenum of the Fourth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee that North Korea put forth the Four Military Lines calling for self-reliant defenses. The military strategy adopted then was essentially sought to thwart the U.S. atomic bomb. Mr "A" continued: "There was only one way to make the U.S. atomic bomb good for nothing and it was for them to go underground. The Turn-the-Whole-Country-Into-a-Fortress policy was basically a `hedgehog tactic,' that is, going underground. All installations began moves to as deep as 150-200 meters underground. The subway in Pyongyang was no exception." The U.S. nuclear threat increased its pressure on North Korea in the early 1970's. Especially, at the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975, the United States deployed additional tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea against a possible invasion by the North, even pronouncing that "if the North should invade the South, we will crush it with our tactical nuclear weapons." Newspapers and broadcasts unhesitatingly reported on the nuclear arming of the USFK. "At the time, North Korea was engrossed in the task of determining the strength of tactical nuclear weapons deployed to the USFK. Materials were gathered from South Korean newspapers, broadcasts, and magazines and from authoritative Japanese and U.S. newspapers for analytical purposes. Through this work, it determined that the number of tactical nuclear weapons as referred to in a `Memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,' was 900 to 1,000," said Mr. "A." Against these historical backdrops, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il began saying in the mid-1970's that "the key of modern warfare is nuclear strategy. The nuclear weapon can be a political and military threat." In other words, Pyongyang had recognized its military strategic need for nuclear weapons. Further, it began viewing nuclear weapons in light of the strategy for survival. It was then that the North Korean leadership began thinking--vaguely though--that it should come to have nuclear weapons. [passage omitted] It can be said that the Manhattan Project and France's TGV high-speed train system belongs to this category, the category of Big Science. So, which way a country pushes its Big Science program has an important bearing on the future of that country. "In North Korea's case, military science--nuclear science in particular--must have become an ambitious Big Science program for it," says Dr Yun Se-won, 72, a South Korean nuclear science pioneer of the Syngman Rhee era. According to scientists who were deeply involved in nuclear development in the Pak Chong-hui era, North Korean scientists who worked for the nuclear development program, Pyongyang's Big Science program, can be divided into the first, second, and third generations--those who defected to the North around the time of the Korean War forming the first, their children who defected to the North with them and who later studied in the Soviet Union making up the second, and those who were educated in North Korea, then studied in the Soviet Union and who are currently working in the nuclear development program representing the third generation. Among those viewed as leading first-generation figures who must have established a master plan and led the development program are To Sang-nok, Yi Sung-ki, and Han In-sok. Their personal history follows: To Sang-nok, a native of South Hamgyong Province, majored in physics at Tokyo Imperial University [present Tokyo University]. On liberation, he returned to Korea and became a Kyongsong University [present Seoul National University, SNU] physics professor. According to Dr. Cho Sun-tak, 70, former director of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology [KAIST], To Sang-nok was his professor in his university days. Professor To, he said, had studied two years at Tokyo Imperial University, which was then a three-year institute, spending the third year, the year for thesis writing, in Korea working as a teacher at Songdo Middle School in Kaesong, for financial reasons involving his family. Thus, he had to earn his way through the university. The thesis he wrote then was about "the Structure of the Hydrogen Molecule." After that, To Sang-nok worked as professor of Singyong University, established in Manchuria mainly by Tokyo U. graduates, until immediately before liberation. On liberation, he moved to Kyongsong University. His son, To In-sop, also attended the SNU physics course. The father and son are said to have defected to the North together. Regarding his work in North Korea, Mr. "B," another former North Korean official, said as follows: "I understand that while serving as the head of the chair of physics in Kim Il-song University, Prof. To was devoted to radioisotope research. Through with the pure science stage, his research was on military application. Without Soviet aid, he was laying the foundations of nuclear energy research almost single-handedly. His academic level was so high that those who know used to cite as top scientists `To Sang-nok in physics, Yi Sung-ki in chemistry, and Kye Ung-sang in sericultural science.' In other words, To Sang-nok is the father of nuclear research in North Korea." To Sang-nok became an Academician, the highest position for a scientist in North Korea, and was awarded the titles of Labor Hero and People's Scientist. He died in February 1990. Meanwhile, some observers view Dr Yi Sung-ki as having made greater contributions to the North Korea nuclear development program. They are mostly veteran scientists who know both To Sang-nok and Yi Sung-ki well or those who took part in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort. Yi Sung-ki has a distinguished record as scientist. A native of Tamyang, South Cholla Province, he majored in synthetic fiber at Kyoto University, Japan. He was the second SNU president when he defected to the North immediately before the Korean War. And by inventing vinalon, a synthetic fiber from coal, he became a world-renowned scientist. Besides, Yi Sung-ki was known for being broad- and open-minded. So, he had many followers in the South, too, it was said. Commenting on his role in the nuclear development program, Dr Yi Pyong- ho, 70, professor emeritus of the KAIST nuclear engineering department, said as follows: "Although it is not very likely that he participated directly in the nuclear development program, there is no question that he must have performed the role of organizing the research team for it. He is the top leader of North Korean scientists. When he selects people for a project and ask them for cooperation, it would be unlikely that they turn him down. Prof. To Sang-nok was, basically, a loner-type researcher, while Prof. Yi Sung-ki had a great deal of experience in setting up team work in research." Moreover, considering the fact that the process of extracting plutonium for atomic bomb materials is fundamentally a process of chemical engineering, and that Kyoto U. is known for being most advanced in nuclear physical chemistry, it would not be strange if he took part in the nuclear development program. It is officially unknown who was the first director of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center [NRC]. According to a scientist who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort, "Yi Sung-ki was the first director" of the Yongbyon NRC. "He was not," countered Mr. "B," the former North Korean official who testified earlier about To Sang-no. With regard to Yi Sung-ki's work in North Korea, the latter said as follows: "It is true that of all the scientists in North Korea, Yi Sung-ki was trusted most, but he was a chemical engineer known for his vinalon research, not a nuclear scientist. He became the director of the Research Institute of Chemical Technology right after his defection to the North, but soon began devoting himself to vinalon research while leaving institute business to Yo Kyong-ku, his junior partner. Needless to say, it is not that he made no contributions to military science. It should be noted, however, that while making all-out efforts for nuclear development, North Korea did even more to develop chemical weapons. When the Defense College was established in 1962 under the Four Military Lines, Yi Sung-ki became its first commandant. This put him in military uniform for a while. Thus, I understand that while in charge of training scientists and engineers for munitions industries, he was deeply involved in chemical weapons development." [passage omitted] For his service in solving the problem of clothing for the people with his invention of vinalon, Yi Sung-ki was awarded the title of Labor Hero and the Lenin Prize in 1962. Currently, he is serving as the head of the Hamhung branch of the Academy of Sciences. According to Mr. "B," the person who said that Yi Sung-ki did not take part in the North Korean nuclear development program, "the first director of the Yongbyon NRC was Han In-sok." [passage omitted] Meanwhile, influenced by Dr. Yi Sung-ki, many professors and students of the SNU engineering school's chemical engineering branch defected to the North. Among those professors were Yo Kyong-ku, who went over to the North even before Yi, and Ma Hyong-ok, Yi Se-hun, Kim Tae-yol, Yi Chang-chik, and Sin Hyon-sok. Also, it is said that it was about that time when Kwon Tae-mun, Kim Pyong-chun, and Ok Chi-hun, who were all classmates of Ma Kyong-sok, 73, honorary president of the South Korea Engineers Club, and second-batch graduates of the chemical engineering branch, defected to the North. It is difficult to rule out the possibility of those who had majored in chemical engineering, a course with possible links to nuclear reprocessing, having performed a role in the nuclear development program. According to Ma Kyong-sok, he learned some time ago, through telephone conversations with Dr Yi Sung-ki and Ok Chi-hun, of the Hamhung branch of the Academy of Sciences, that of these people, Yo Kyong-ku, Prof. Sin Hyon-sok, and Kwon Tae-mun had died. He was also told, Ma said, that Yi Chae-op, a graduate of the Kyoto U. chemical engineering course who defected to the North before Liberation, and Chang Chil-pyo, his pupil who went to the North with him, had married Yi Sung-ki's daughters. Besides Dr. Yi Sung-ki and Prof. To Sang-nok, another person who seemed to have played a leading role in the nuclear development program is Prof. Han In-sok. A graduate of the physics course of Japan's Tohoku University, he studied in Germany for a while, then served as physics professor at Kyongsong U. It is known that soon after that, he, as one of the opponents to the "National University Plan," briefly moved to Yonsei University before defecting to the North. According to his pupils who remember him, it is unlikely that Han In-sok had attracted attention as a preeminent physicist -- not in South Korea at least. In the North, however, it seems that he stood very much in the spotlight. Mr "B," who said that Han In-sok was the first director of the Yongbyon Atomic Energy Research Center, explained Han's role in North Korea as follows: "While at Kim Il-song University [KISU] as physics professor, Han In-sok went to Moscow to study the latest nuclear theories for some time. He began giving North Korean leaders, including party cadres, lectures on the importance of nuclear energy and the need for nuclear development, in the late 1950's. He was articulate. In the early 1960's, he put out many theses concerning nuclear development. This led to rumors among cadres that he was even more capable than To Sang-nok. Han In-sok, along with To Sang-nok, can be called the founder of North Korea's nuclear physics." In 1965, Han In-sok made public his research paper entitled "Distribution of Irregular Speeds of Electrons in Plasma." Dr. Yun Se-won, Han's pupil, said he and Han frequently got together at parties when they were both professors at Yonsei U. for a short period. Yun said: "He was a man of little ambition but of great passion and outstanding brains. The only setback was his move to Yonsei; he did not get the treatment he deserved while there. According to Yun, Prof. Han celebrated his 60th birthday about 25 years ago. In an appearance in a broadcast program that day, Han said that "I have a pupil in the South," referring to him by name, Yun said, adding that "I was deeply impressed." The person who also seemingly performed an important role, only next to the roles played by the three, To Sang-nok and Yi Sung-ki and Han In- ok, in importance, is none other than Chong Kun. According to a nuclear engineer who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort, "when Dr Yi Sung-ki was in charge of organizing the nuclear development team, Chong Kun must have acted as the top working aide for him. I had felt his such presence on various occasions." Chong Kun, one of the second-batch graduates of the Kyongsong U. physics course, majored in basic physics, molecular movements in particular. It is said that he left for Moscow to study after his defection to the North. It was the time when KISU was being established. He studied nuclear physics in Moscow, specializing in reactor physics, a field directly linked with the nuclear development program. On his return from Moscow, he became a member of KISU. He is known to have written five or six theses on reactors after that. Dr. Cho Sun-tak views Chong Kun as an "extraordinarily brilliant person." "When I was involved in a leftist movement," Cho said, "I first thought that he belonged to the South Korean Labor Party, but later learned that he had belonged to the North Korean Workers Party from the beginning." That made him remember Chong very clearly, Cho added. Among the theses Chong wrote in the 1960's were "Research on Thermoelectric Phenomena," "Thermal Diffusion of Neutrons," and "On Minimums of Metallic Resistance at Low Temperatures." In addition to the above-listed, scientists like Yo Kyong-ku, Chon Pyong-su, Kim Yong-ho and Yo Chol-ki are thought, in the views of atomic energy-related scholars, to have participated in the nuclear development program one way or another, for their academic levels. Yo Kyong-ku, nephew of Yo Un-hyong, who majored in applied chemistry in Japan's Waseda University, was assistant professor of chemical engineering at Kyongsong U. when he made his rather early defection to the North. About that time, after learning that Dr. Yi Sung-ki was troubled by the "National University Plan," he is said to have visited Yi to suggest that he go over to the North. In North Korea, Yo Kyong-ku rose to Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences. He is said to have participated in the V-2 rocket development in Okinawa in the last days of World War II. Chon Pyong-su, a native of Hamhung who majored in physics in Japan's Hokkaido University, briefly served as physics professor at Kyongsong U. While in Japan, he was viewed as being so extraordinarily brilliant that his professor made him his top student, they say. Ideologically, however, he was socialist from the beginning. In North Korea, he briefly departed from scientific research and joined a political school, even serving as the party's top responsible officer at KISU. It is known that after leaving that post, Chon Pyong-su shifted from pure research to experiment. Among theses he wrote in the 1960's were "On Nuclear Interaction in Nuclear Fluid by Particles with Energy," "On Raising Precision in Measurement of Each Distribution," and "On Each Distribution of Secondary Particles in Nuclear Interaction with Heavy Nucleuses in Nuclear Fluid." Kim Yong-ho, who majored in quantum chemistry at Japan's Kyoto U., was a chemistry professor at Kyongsong U. when he defected to the North. Quantum chemistry is said to have connections with nuclear reprocessing facilities. He was also reputed to be a very outstanding scientist, they say. Yo Chol-ki, one of the second-batch graduates of the SNU physics course, was assistant professor of the university when he defected to the North. He is a brother of Yo Sok-ki, who was once English literature professor of Korea University. He attended a 1990 World Conference of Korean Physicists held at Yanbian University in China as chairman of the North Korean Physical Society, and accompanied by four persons. He was a Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences at the time. It was then that Dr. Ko Yun-sok, 67, former chairman of the Physical Society of the South, met Yo Chol-ki, his 2-year senior, for the first time in many years. They talked about many things. Of the meeting, Ko said as follows: "He was calm and not particularly argumentative. He was the same chain smoker as he was before. His specialty then was plasma physics. As I knew it, it was his fourth. He had specialized in hydromechanics, then in particle physics, and the latest I had heard was that he was studying nuclear physics. The fact alone that he was ranging over a number of fields like that made me think that he was perhaps assigned some important job. Strangely, whenever I asked about some statistics, he kept his mouth shut." Besides Yo Chol-ki, North Korean physicists Cho Pyong-nae and Kim Yong-il, both specializing in statistical mechanical physics, attended the conference. Another scientist named Ko Yong-hye, specializing in the theory of field at KISU, who appeared to be in his fifties, also showed up at the conference. Scientists referred to in the above were mostly Kyongsong U. professors in physics or chemical engineering when they defected to the North. Leftist leaders at the Kyongsong U. science and engineering school in those days were To Sang-nok and Yo Kyong-ku, it was said. Although those scientist defectors were mostly leftists opposed to the "National University Plan," they excelled in scholarship. In the views of atomic energy-related scholars, they must have laid North Korea's scientific foundations, setting the direction of its nuclear development program. Other scientists from the South include Choe Sam-yol, a graduate of the Tohoku U. chemistry course, who served as professor of KISU and later became an Academician, and Yi Chae-yong, a graduate of the Kyoto U. fuel chemistry course. These people went straight to North Korea while they were overseas for study purposes. In the views of atomic energy scientists in the South, it is possible that they also participated in North Korea's Big Science project, the nuclear development program. Forming another group are second-generation scientists who were trained by the above-listed seniors and who could have performed the central role in the nuclear development program. Among them are Choe Hak-kun, Yun Ho-chin and Kye Yong-sun. Choe Hak-kun, a native of Hamgyong Province, is a nuclear expert who went to Moscow University from KISU, then to the Dubna NRC. Following his return home, he served as the second director of the Yongbyon NRC, then as minister of the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry, which was created within the State Administration Ministry in December 1986. He also served as counselor in Vienna for 4 years from 1975, when North Korea joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi, 64, former director of the Atomic Energy Bureau of the [ROK] Ministry of Science and Technology, and IAEA board member for 1977 through 1983, was Choe Hak-kun's counterpart in Vienna. North Korean officials in Vienna usually moved around in a pair; on rare occasions when Choe met with Dr. Yi by himself, he always was inquisitive about the state of atomic energy in South Korea, said Dr. Yi. At the time, one of the three secretary-level officials -- graduates of KISU physics, metal engineering, and chemical engineering departments respectively -- alternately came from Pyongyang to work under Choe Hak-kun. They were seen frequenting at the IAEA library, where detailed information were available on blueprints of, and construction methods used for, atomic reactors that had been built in various parts of the world. Dr. Yi continued: "Over there, one could obtain the entire information needed to build an atomic reactor in 1 or 2 years if he was determined to do so. Suppose North Korea had spent about 4 years making such preparations, the 5-megawatt-class Yongbyon No. 2 atomic reactor was possibly built in early 1980. Give it enough time for a good trial run and inspection, say 7 years, then the reactor could possibly be put in operation in 1988." Dr. Yi also noted that "at any rate, the massive data thus gathered at the time must have been used for the nuclear development program." He added that "Choe Hak-kun is believed to have played a significant role in that process." Meanwhile, since North Korea's entry into the IAEA, Choe Hak-kun intensified his demand for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." Yun Ho-chin, resident officer in Vienna, was responsible for administrative affairs concerning the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and the inspection issue. A graduate of the KISU physics department, he also had extensive knowledge about nuclear power. Once he was engaged in a heated debate with Ambassador Kennedy, the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the U.S. State Department on NPT issues. According to Dr. Yi, who was listening to the debate, it seemed that no one could beat Yun in argument. He is a specialist who is, in effect, in charge of external affairs concerning the North Korean nuclear issue. Kye Yong-sun, a KISU gradate, who also studied in the Dubna NRC, is a key figure in North Korea's nuclear power plant construction. It was he who first suggested that "we build nuclear power plants for ourselves" in early 1970, they say. Kye Hyong-sun, former minister of machine-building industry, regarded as the godfather of North Korea's munitions industry, is his elder brother, they say. Under these second-generation scientists, there are third-generation specialists who returned from the former Soviet Union and are currently active on the first line of the nuclear development program. Their names are mostly unknown. Fortunately, Mr "B," the former high official in North Korea, knew one of them -- Yi Yun-song, alias Yi Yun-su. Yi Yun-song, a very bright boy since his childhood, went to Moscow U. the year after his graduation from KISU, obtaining a Ph.D in physics at the age of 31. On his return from Moscow, he served as a professor at Pyongsong Institute of Science before moving to the Yongbyon NRC. He should be about 50 years old and, if he still is with the NRC, he could be at the level of a section chief. The people mentioned above are part of the North Korean brains in the nuclear development program as we came to know about from information provided by atomic energy scientists and intelligence agencies in our country and by people who formerly served in high posts in North Korea. They of course represent only a small part of the picture. It is a limitation we face, but there is a way to overcome it a little bit. It is by using our judgement on the basis of theses written by North Korean scientists. Agencies in the South reportedly used the same method for some time to measure levels of the North Korean nuclear development program. Basically, however, it is difficult to gain access to such theses. The Korean division of the National Archives of the U.S. Congress is known to be the only place in the West that provides access to theses by North Korean scientists. Even so, it is limited to the period through the early 1970's. Entering the 1970's, North Korea apparently tightened control over the handling of theses as it embarked on its nuclear development program. Those available at the National Archives are said to be the result of a volunteer's efforts who collected them in Hong Kong despite great difficulties. The theses kept in the National Archives are by 100-odd scientists, mostly published between the 1950's and the early 1970's. They include many by the previously mentioned scientists. Most of the theses were printed in KWAHAGWON TONGBO [ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT], which is a highest-level journal published in North Korea. About half of them only deal with mathematics while the rest are doing researches based on experiments. Considering the fact that they were by North Korean scientists in the period through the early 1970's, and that the nuclear development program has been Pyongyang's Big Science undertaking, it can be said that a considerably large number of the authors probably participated in the nuclear development program. Dr. Chong Sun-tak, who examined the theses, said "their research seems to cover fields such as high energy, solid-state physics, statistical physics, hydrodynamics, astrophysics, and even atomic nucleus. In respect to experiments, it appears that organized research with links to defense and industry were under way." The following is a look at some of those scientists who have published relatively many theses, their post at the time and their representative thesis: - Kim Kyong-chong, assistant professor, engineering, B.A.; "Heat Transfer Between the Fixed Bed and the Heat-Exchange Wall" (1966) - Kim Myong-nin, engineering, B.A.; "On Mechanism of Interaction Between Manganese Oxides and Sulphurous Acid Gas in Water Solution" (1966) - Kim In-sik, candidate academician, engineering; "Experiment of Pellet Melting by Various Chemical Catalysts in the Electric Furnace" (1961) - Kim Hyong-nak, assistant professor, chemistry, B.A.; "New Calculating Method in Chemical Analyses Using Formation Reaction of Adherent Compounds" (1967) - Yi Myong-ha, physical mathematics, B.A.; "On Energy Loss of Charged Particles with Magnetic Moment in Plasma" (1964) - Yi Yon, physics, B.A.; "Statistical Dynamical Instability in the Combination of the Atomic Nucleus" (1965) - So Sang-kuk, physics, B.A.; "On Phenomenological Quantum Electrodynamics of the Scalar Particle" (1964) - Chong Kye-son, physical mathematics, B.A.; "Effect of Plastic Deformation to High-Temperature Internal Friction" (1967) Among other physicists and chemists whose theses are found in the National Archives are: Kang Ho-ung, physics, B.A.; Kwak Tae-hung, professor, engineering, Ph.D.; Kim Nae-su, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Tal-won, engineering, B.A.; Kim Yong-hum, assistant professor, engineering, B.A.; Kim Il-tae, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Chae-kil, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Chong-tok, assistant professor, physics, B.A.; Kim Chun-ul, assistant professor, engineering, B.A.; Kim Chun-hwan, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Hyong-nak, assistant professor, chemistry, B.A.; Yu Chong-kun, assistant professor, engineering; Yi Mun- yong, engineering, B.A.; Yi Pang-kun, engineering, B.A.; Yi Song-chun, assistant professor, engineering; Yi Yong-tae, physics, B.A.; Yi Chae- pok, assistant professor, physical mathematics, B.A.; Yi Hyo-chin, engineering, B.A.; Pae Nae-sop, assistant professor, engineering; Paek Yong-kon, physics, B.A.; Pyon Yong-nip, physical mathematics, B.A.; Sin Mun-kyu, engineering, B.A.; Sin Pyong-chong, engineering, B.A.; Sin Tae- kon, engineering, B.A.; Sin Taek-hui, assistant professor, engineering; Om Song-nok, engineering, B.A.; Yu Song-chol, engineering, B.A.; Cho Yong-uk, physics, B.A.; Cho Chol-hui, engineering, B.A.; Choe Sok-kwon, chemistry, B.A.; Hong Sun-tae, engineering, B.A.; Hong Ha-kyong, chemistry, B.A. In addition, there were scientists brought in from overseas, mostly Korean residents in foreign countries. Explaining, Mr. "B" said: "I understand that quite a few overseas Korean nuclear scientists entered North Korea. In most cases, they were residents either in the Soviet Union or Japan. For them, separate research facilities were set up, mainly in Kanggye and Hyesan in Chagang Province where many weapons production bases were located, as well as in the vicinity of Pyongyang. I understand that in the cases of well-known figures, some were assigned to the National Defence and Science Institute." Of those from Japan, some stayed on in North Korea taking part in the development program while others shuttled between the two countries. The Korean Scientists and Engineers Association in Japan (Kwahyop) served as the channel. Kwahyop's slogan was "Promote Scientific Research and Technological Development of Korean Scientists in Japan and Contribute to North Korea's Construction." More than 100 executives and members of Kwahyop are reportedly playing key roles in advanced science and technology divisions of Japanese universities and corporations. Among them are scientists working in nuclear fusion, control engineering and accelerator fields or even taking part in nuclear technology development programs. Dr. Kyong Won-ha is one of them whose name is frequently mentioned in conversations concerning Korean scientists who went to North Korea from Japan. He is known to have participated in the atomic bomb building at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, then served as professor at Canada's McGill University before moving to North Korea in about 1974. But a check with atomic energy-related scientists and people who formerly serviced in high posts in North Korea revealed that none of them had any knowledge about him. At a time when information is as scarce as it is, the foregoing list could represent a small, first step in our attempt to get a more comprehensive picture of human relationships in the North Korean nuclear development program. North Korea's training system for nuclear-related talents also deserves careful attention. The training began at a university level. The first nuclear physics course was established in 1949 before the Korean War. "That year, North Korea's first nuclear physics course was created within the KISU physics school and 30 students were selected for it," said Mr "B." It was also in 1949 when Pyongyang began sending students to Moscow U. and St. Petersburg University. Needless to say, they were not all nuclear physics students. Suppose 30 students left for Moscow or St. Petersburg in any given year, three to four of them were nuclear physics students. Choe Hak-kun, former minister of atomic energy industry, is said to have been one of the first-group students who went to Moscow. The KISU nuclear physics course was closed temporarily during the war but reopened later. After that, in about 1957, a nuclear engineering department, made up by three courses, was created in Kim Chaek Institute of Technology [KCIT]. The number of students was 50. Further, in 1963, a nuclear physics course was opened in Pyongsong Institute of Science in South Pyongan Province, a college under the control of the Academy of Sciences, accepting 50 students. Pyongsong is a North Korean science town similar to Taedok Science Town in the South, and its Institute of Science is an equivalent of our Institute of Science and Technology. There are slight differences between the roles performed by these three institutes. While they are all for the study of nuclear physics, KISU is dedicated to both theoretical and technological researches, KCIT trains technical personnel and Pyongsong trains scientists, research officers and professors primarily in fundamental theoretical fields. Besides, a nuclear engineering department was created in the National Defense College in Hyesan in about 1963, primarily for the training of specialists in munitions and weaponry. Basically through these four institutes, North Korea has systematically trained its personnel since the 1950's. The length of their nuclear physics courses is 7 years, they say, and they accept only bright students. On this point, Mr. "B" said: "They take only students of I.Q. 160 or higher. Children of state cadres who are bright enough are required to take the nuclear physics course mandatorily even if it is against their wish. Once, there were moves among students to avoid taking the course as those who willingly had entered the course first saw graduates assigned to Yongbyon or military-related research institutes. Circulating rumors had it that once they entered the course, their coming and going would be restricted and, more seriously, they could be exposed to radioactivity. Once there was a case in which one of the cadres prevented his child from applying for the course, and when the fact was discovered by authorities, he was reassigned to a remote forestry station. Since that time, if a student would avoid applying for the nuclear physics course, he or she would be sent to the countryside or otherwise called to task for it." Attached to these institutes are, respectively, "the KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute," "the KCIT Nuclear Physics Research Institute," and "the Nuclear Physics Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences." The KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute has a long history of research in radioactive isotope. Other major research institutes are mostly lactated in the Yongbyon complex. They include the "Atomic Energy Research Institute," "Radioactivity Prevention Research Institute," and "Nuclear Power Generating Research Institute." The Yongbyon nuclear complex was created in the late 1950's. North Korea began its expansion in earnest in 1962 after the fifth plenum of the fourth party Central Committee. Beginning in the 1960's, North Korean institutes turned out nuclear scientists in large numbers who were trained by themselves through those 7-year courses. Some of the graduates left for Moscow for further studies, mostly at the Dubna NRC. Scores of them were sent there each year in rotation; their stay in Dubna ranging from 2-3 years to over 10 years. There they, along with scientists from other socialist nations, jointly participated in the Soviet nuclear development program. The cases of those who had stayed there for more than 10 years were because their research achievements were so outstanding that the Dubna NRC would not let them go home. Occasionally, there were minor disputes over persons whose homecoming ran into difficulties for such reasons. Among them were many who had obtained Soviet doctorates at the age of 30 and became an object of envy. So, Soviet scientists, knowing about their abilities more than anyone else, would never underestimate the levels of North Korean students, it is said. At times, students were deported back home from Dubna because of their persistent attempt to spy on advanced Soviet nuclear technology. North Korean students were also sent to the Kurchatov NRC, the Kiev NRC and the Ioffe NRC. While Dubna was for basic research in nuclear physics, Kurchatov was known as a laboratory for experimenting and building nuclear bombs. They were all secret facilities off limits to unauthorized citizens as well as foreigners. Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi happened to be allowed to visit the Kurchatov Nuclear Physics Research Center, a secret facility, for 1 week in 1992. Named after Dr. Kurchatov, who led the team that built and tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949, the center stands about 20 kilometers from downtown Moscow. Dr. Yi was amazed at research facilities at the center. Nuclear fusion, remote control and radioactivity lab facilities appeared to be incomparably more sophisticated and advanced than those at the Argonne National Laboratory where the Manhattan Project was conducted. The world's most advanced installation, however, had come to a complete standstill because of Russia's economic collapse. Consequently, the United States is reportedly working on economic aid for improvement in the treatment of Russian nuclear scientists so as to prevent their exodus from the country. "It is quite possible," Dr. Yi speculated, "that quite a few of those Russian nuclear scientists who had been to North Korea in the past, returned there in 1989 or 1990 during the disintegration of the Soviet Union and just stayed on there." North Korea also sent scientists to China, which successfully conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964, although fewer in numbers than those sent to the Soviet Union. For exchanges with Chinese nuclear physicists, Pyongyang sent its specialists to Xiangshan Zhao Dai Suo in Beijing where those Chinese frequently get together. Pyongyang also sent scientists to the Xinjiang explosion test site to learn explosion technique. Thus trained through various routes, the number of North Korean nuclear experts and technical personnel is now estimated at approximately more than 5,000, including 200 trained at Dubna. The systematic training like this showed its first results in the development of missiles. North Korea produced on its own a short-range rocket missile using nuclear energy in the late 1960's. To share the excitement, a demonstration firing was conducted for 2 hours in November 1970 before some 1,000 party delegates who arrived from all over the country for the Fifth Party Congress, according to reports. Pyongyang's nuclear policy came to the fore in March 1974 when Kim Il-song told a National Industrial Workers Meeting that "we must build nuclear power plants on our own." Thus, North Korea, with its own technology, embarked on the construction of No. 2 reactor, a 30 megawatt-class reactor by the graphite moderator gas coolant method, in Yongbyon in 1980, completing it in 1987. In addition to an army of nuclear talents thus trained, North Korea has uranium ore deposits scattered all over the country, a factor that made possible the nuclear development on its own. The development of the large-scale Pyongsan and Pakchon mines began in the 1950's, and the Sunchon and Songchon mines are known for high uranium purity. Other uranium mines include one at Unggi, North Hamgyong Province, and the Kujang Mine in Mt. Myohyang. It is also known that there are a number of them in the vicinity of Hyesan and Hamhung. Although North Korea had to send ores to the Soviet Union for processing before the 1960's, it later built its own smelting plants near mines for independent processing. Then the prospecting drive for uranium ores, they say, spread to other parts of the country so widely that slogans like "Find the Bluish-Black Mineral" became popular among prospecting workers. Yongbyon is geographically very close to Pakchon. Thus, it has a uranium mine a short distance away and, surrounded by Kuryong River and Mt. Kuryong, has a security advantage, plus natural water of good quality. It reportedly was the unquestioned top candidate when authorities were looking for a site for the nuclear development complex. When the project got under way, residents were relocated elsewhere. Yongbyon was gradually turned into a secret town. Guard posts were erected around the complex, which was then put off limits to unauthorized persons. Security measures made were so tight that they were simply beyond imagination. Except for workers there and Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and the chief of the general staff of the KPA, no one is allowed to enter the complex without authorization, including high-ranking cadres and politburo members. Even Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are of course not completely free to enter the facility. On this point, Mr. "A" said: "There is a check point at the Kuryong River bridge leading to the Yongbyon complex. Even the car carrying Kim Il-song and/or Kim Chong-il must stop at the point. Officials from the complex in another car meet them there. The visitor(s) then would get in their car and go through the point. The facility is off limits even to the aide-chauffeur for the visitor(s). Security is that tight." Personnel are also under strict security control. Researchers are usually not authorized to leave the complex. When one is allowed to leave for a compelling reason, e.g.,the death of a parent, he will be shadowed by two or three security men of the Ministry of National Defense, they say. Telephones and mail to and from the complex are out of question. Even for communications with the Atomic Energy Committee, the facility uses a courier. On the other hand, the complex has every facility needed for the daily life of people there, they say. When the need arises for building facilities inside the complex, a special team of the 105th construction unit under the Ministry of Public Security is assigned to it. The unit itself is a special one assigned to such works as repair of the houses of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, the Pyongyang subway or special tunnels. So, there is absolutely no way for outside people to know what is going on inside the complex. "Considering the fact that major North Korean facilities have gone underground, facilities that have been put to the international inspections are only those that had been made public. It is reasonable to think that there are other facilities that have not been made public," said Mr. "A." In addition, it is known that there are many underground plants in Taechon, only eight km from Yongbyon, he added. Nuclear physics research institutes attached to universities in general are also under strict security. They are off limits to unauthorized people and telephone calls are impossible. When people come out with personal belongings, they are checked by defense department personnel each time, they say. These institutes are under the control of the WPK Science and Education Department. Also, personnel of this department are known to enter the institutes once or twice a year when party meetings are held to sum up their activities. Persons found to have leaked secret information are separated and sent to remote places in the mountains. Mr. "A" said he would like to point out a misconception which he comes across so frequently in discussions about the North Korean nuclear issue. It is that because of the current economic crisis, Pyongyang would be unable to continue the enormously expensive nuclear development program. It is indeed a capitalist perception, he went on, but the fact is that in North Korea, they can carry out any project only by paying the personnel expenses, and if that should become difficult, even by just giving workers enough to eat. Materials needed for the nuclear development program are mostly available domestically. The only thing they had to buy from outside was equipment from the Soviets. Even for them, North Korea could solve the payment problem by, extremely speaking, mobilizing military personnel for free labor at gold mines and refining facilities and handing over nuggets to the Soviets, Mr. "A" said, adding that although digging a tunnel, for instance, costs dearly in the South, it can be done virtually free in North Korea by mobilizing people's labor.
