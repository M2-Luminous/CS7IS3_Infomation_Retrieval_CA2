According to General Manuel Andara, Venezuelan acting defense minister, a commission is visiting the border area to establish if the crash was caused by mechanical failure or was attacked by Colombian guerrillas. National Guard members and some peasants, who had been captured -- according to complaints on the Colombian side -- in Colombian territory, were aboard that helicopter. It was reported in Venezuela that these people were arrested in Venezuela. We are now in contact with Hernando Prada Gonzalez, Colombian consul in the town of Guasdualito, located opposite the Arauca Intendance. Good morning, please tell us what reports Colombian diplomatic representatives have received from the Venezuelan Government on the helicopter incident? [Prada] Good morning, on Saturday at 1800 they released Mr. Patino, who was the only person to be held in this border area because of the helicopter accident you mentioned. [Reporter] Did Mr. Patino say he was captured on Colombian soil? [Prada] Yes, he said this happened on the Puerto Rico path in Colombia. You have already told the country about this. He was later taken aboard another helicopter to a military base stationed in Guasdualito. Foreign Ministry officials were following the case. On Saturday at 1800, he was turned over to the Arauca military operation command. [Reporter] In addition to Mr. Patino's report, has your consulate received any other explanation or additional reports from the Venezuelan authorities. [Prada] No, the only thing we received was Mr. Patino's return. We were told he was held as a witness to the helicopter crash. [Reporter] We have reports that another Colombian fisherman, besides Mr. Patino, was captured and that the Venezuelans are not reporting on his whereabouts. [Prada] The consulate has no knowledge of that. We talked with Mr. Patino, and he was the only person flown aboard a helicopter from the crash site to this military garrison. [Reporter] Colombian authorities are guarding the Venezuelan helicopter. Has Venezuela requested the helicopter's return through you or any other channel? [Prada] Not at all. The helicopter is in the custody of the Colombian authorities in Colombian territory. No request on the matter has been submitted through this consulate. [Reporter] Do you think this incident has harmed relations between the two countries in the border area? [Prada] I do not think so. We are promoting Colombian-Venezuelan integration. The Colombian foreign minister will refer to the incident this week. As far as our relations are concerned, they will remain normal as they have until now. [Reporter] Is the climate around your office the same? Have you perceived any deterioration in the climate in Guasdualito? [Prada] None at all.
