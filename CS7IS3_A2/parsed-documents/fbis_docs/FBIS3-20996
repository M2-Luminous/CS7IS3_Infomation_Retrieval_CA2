It is an organizational and financial effort that has no precedents and is already being formed as a result of the law providing for the reorganization of telephonic services, the first tangible effects of which will be seen between 1 January and the end of 1996. The document has still not been made public but some guidelines have been revealed by Managing Director Michele Tedeschi. In brief, there are plans for an investment program that will have a total value of 32 trillion lire, and a growth in revenues of between 30 and 36 trillion lire per year, with the goal of reaching a telephone density of 48.4 percent in a context that is becoming more and more internationalized. These are the most important statistics of the "group program" for 1994-1996, that was approved in mid-November by the STET board of directors, presided over by Biagio Agnes. This period will be particularly demanding for the IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry] finance company, because of the reorganization of telephonic services to form a single operator, Telecom Italia, and the effects of this reorganization that will start to be seen within a market situation that is continually evolving both at home and abroad. The sole operator, which will surmount the fragmentation of the five former concessionaires, will face the opening up of overseas markets following the abolition of the monopolies, the appearance of large foreign corporations, and the formation of new alliances that go beyond national and continental barriers. The formulation of the plan is therefore coherent with the current trends of demand that accentuate the supremacy of market factors in a context that is increasingly characterized by strong competition. With the new organization, the Italian system, like those of the other major European countries, will be able to present itself on the services market with a structure that is capable of enforcing a strategy of a single offer and competitivity, with the prospect of reaping all the possibilities of growth in the telecommunications sector. In particular, the constitution of the sole operator, the formation of which, it has been confirmed, will take place before September 1994, will permit its intrinsic synergies to be exploited. Consequently this will strengthen its position both on the national and international markets, and ensure the group a more favorable contractual position within the context of a global alliance. Specific emphasis will be given in the new plan to client segmentation to be able to prepare the most appropriate response in terms of services/prices, particularly for business clients. The rapid strengthening of the network structure and the relative administration systems, the strong nationwide organization of customer services, and the evolution of the pricing structure, will contribute to this. In 1994, the latter in particular will already have the goal of gradually reducing existing mutual assistance to give greater competitiveness to the global supply system through the reduction of long-distance prices, and thereby start to catch up with the most advanced organizations at international level. Therefore, in view of the fact that the program contract will be applied when the single operator is formed, the plan has been worked out on the basis of a price restructuring process that does not presuppose greater net capital contributions to the sector. The resulting benefits will be an improved utilization of the network and a more favorable market position. These actions are part of a management plan that also foresees achieving a notable improvement in economic-financial strength. Under this profile the program is characterized by a growth in the volume of revenues from the current 30 trillion lire to 38 trillion lire by 1996, and by overall investments of over 32 trillion, and a revenue situation that will be decisively better than that of 1993, the results of which were already favorable. It is also forecast that debts will be notably reduced thanks to the good progress of internal financing which, in the next three years, will be clearly in excess of requirements for investments. As far as quantitative aspects are concerned the program provides for: -- An increase of about 1.5 million subscribers to the fixed network, 600,000 of which business subscribers; an increase of over 800,000 subscribers to mobile services; a density (subscribers to fixed and mobile services) that will reach a value of 48.4 percent by the end of 1996; and a final total of over 300,000 ISDN [integrated services digital network] equivalent connections; -- A development of national traffic for which a growth rate of 6.7 percent per year is foreseen, and of international and intercontinental traffic for which notably higher increases are foreseen (respectively about 12 percent and over 13 percent); -- Further technological updating of the network, continuing with the digitization of the exchanges (77 percent by the end of 1996) and the extension of optical fibers to the distribution network too. As far as the industrial sector is concerned programs are aimed at improving productivity and increasing foreign market penetration. Special emphasis has been placed on the complete integration of the Finsiel group to exploit the potential synergies of information science and telecommunications services. Finally, the process of internationalization, which provides for investments of about 1.5 trillion lire, hinges on the acquisition of licenses to carry out services in areas of preeminently strategic interest as well as on the reinforcement of the supply system in an international environment through strategic alliances that also involve the industrial activities of the group.
