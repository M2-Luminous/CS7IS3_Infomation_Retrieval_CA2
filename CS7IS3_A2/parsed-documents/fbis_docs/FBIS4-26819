This was stated by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA today. Long is leaving for Geneva tomorrow together with the Chinese mission to the 17th working group conference of GATT, headed by Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. China attaches great importance to the 17th conference, hoping to conduct wide-ranging consultations with other parties on the "comprehensive file" governing China's resumption of its signatory status in GATT. The file, prepared by the chairman of the China group of GATT, has been distributed to other parties for consideration. "It is the first time in China's talks with GATT on its status over the past eight years that a file on China has been submitted to the conference by the chairman which contains the contents of multilateral protocols," Long said. "This represents an important step forward towards the resumption of China's signatory status," he added. Included in the comprehensive file is the gist of the separate protocols submitted by the United States, Japan, the European Community and other signatory parties. China had separate bilateral consultations with the United States, Japan and the European Community before they submitted these protocols. However, Long noted, China should by no means "underestimate" the difficulties it might face in the coming talks. China is still a developing country, Long said. Thus, in balancing China's "rights and obligations" in realizing its resumption of status in GATT, the relevant parties should take into full account its practical conditions of economic development, its ongoing domestic economic reform process and the capability of the country as a whole to cope with the required conditions, Long stressed. China's efforts to resume its signatory status reflect "mutual needs," Long said. "China needs the world trade organization, but the organization without China would be incomplete and less universal," he added. To exclude China, one of the world's biggest countries, from the organization "would itself be unfair," Long concluded.
