The new parliament starts work on July 19. Can it make the most of its new powers? Or will it sink into oblivion for the next five years? The parliament has strengths and weaknesses, some not of its own making. It must play to its strengths and try to eliminate those handicaps that can be eliminated. Some weaknesses are inherent. The need to work in nine (soon 12) languages means that debates will never have the cut and thrust of the House of Commons. Where the parliament does well, however, is in influencing legislation and carrying out the nitty-gritty of parliamentary scrutiny, shaping the budget and monitoring and questioning civil servants' actions. Every year the parliament adopts thousands of amendments to draft legislation reshaping the laws that affect us in important areas such as consumer protection, environmental standards, social legislation, equal opportunities and banking. Through its budgetary powers it redirects spending to priority areas. Even before Maastricht reinforced its powers, most parliamentary amendments ended up on the statute book in directives and regulations adopted by the Council of Ministers. Under Maastricht, important areas of legislation fall under the "co-decision" procedure and are adopted jointly by parliament and the Council. Parliament's influence on legislation can only grow. In particular, the right to say "no" -- to veto draft legislation, to blow the whistle on behalf of our constituents - will be crucial for the parliament's public perception. Some national parliaments act virtually as a rubber stamp in adopting legislation proposed by governments. In this respect, the European Parliament does better than many national parliaments. National governments want parliament to continue with the ludicrous system of spreading its activities over three countries. Most parliamentary work is carried out in Brussels but once a month the whole show moves to Strasbourg for plenary sittings, and a large proportion of the secretariat is based in Luxembourg. Brussels should be the single site of parliament's activities, close to the other institutions it has to scrutinise, and in the same town as the European press corps, representatives of interest groups and member states' embassies. Another problem is that the treaties negotiated and ratified by national governments now include far too many complex procedures for involving parliament in European legislation. The 1996 conference should seek to simplify and standardise these rules by applying a streamlined co-decision procedure to all areas where Council adopts legislation by a qualified majority. The press, too, having frequently pointed to parliament's increased importance, must follow this up by increased coverage. The parliament should also put its own house in order. A good start was made last year with a complete overhaul of the rules of procedure, allowing parliament to concentrate its time on more important matters where it has power, to limit possibilities for filibustering by small groups, and to improve management. In the new parliament, the centre-right will be far more divided and fragmented, with an extreme right contingent introducing instability and even conflict. Handling this will present a challenge. Even more than in the past, the Socialist group will have to lead the parliament despite the absence of an overall majority for any group. All in all, the new parliament has a good chance of using its new powers effectively. The big question is how national governments will handle the 1996 constitutional revision. We look forward to seeing how they face up to their responsibilities.
