In an article published in today's issue, Nafi' notes that the recent Sudanese measures against Egyptian interests in Khartoum are part of this strategy, which is directed against Egypt and its historic ties with sisterly Sudan. He points out that these measures include an attempt to undermine the Egyptian presence in Sudan and to incite the Sudanese masses against Egypt. Nafi' explains that by taking over Egyptian property, the government in Khartoum wanted to mask the failure of the Nairobi talks to find a peaceful solution to the armed struggle in south Sudan, an issue to which the Sudanese people, stricken by war and poverty, pay much attention. He adds that by adopting anti-Egyptian measures, the Khartoum government wants to focus attention away from the rising acts of opposition inside Sudan, the latest being violent demonstrations in western and central Sudan recently. Nafi' adds that the ruling regime in Sudan wants to cast doubts on the firmness of Egypt's position in support of the unity of the Sudanese people and Sudan's territorial integrity by claiming that Egypt cares about Sudan's unity only because it cares about its interests in Sudan. He asks: Where are these Egyptian interests in Sudan in which nobody has any interest any longer, after suffering poverty and seeing destruction and millions giving up hope of finding food and shelter under this bad regime? Nafi' points out that the regime in Sudan also wants to hide Sudan's deteriorating economic conditions, which have become a source of ridicule for Sudanese inside and outside Sudan. The middle class, a prosperous class for which Sudan has been famous, no longer exists in the country, where poverty has become widespread and those who can afford to live are members of the ruling clique or key figures in the al-Turabi [Islamic] front who have become top businessmen. To give an example of the bad conditions in Sudan, Nafi' notes that when it took power, the al-Bashir regime said it had come to save the country before a dollar could be traded for 20 Sudanese pounds. At the time of the revolution, a dollar bought 12 Sudanese pounds. Now a dollar buys 500 Sudanese pounds, he adds. Thus, Nafi' notes, the Sudanese people have failed to catch up with the rise in prices and are leading a bitter life. Some even wonder how the Sudanese people can live under these tough conditions. The AL-AHRAM chief editor says that the ruling regime in Sudan is instigating trouble with Egypt to whip up public sentiment and thereby camouflage the host of problems it is having with other countries and international organizations. Sudan, Ibrahim Nafi' points out, has been repeatedly condemned by the United Nations for its human rights violations. Eritrea filed a complaint against it with the United Nations over its interference in its internal affairs, accusing it of harboring subversive Eritrean elements. The U.S. Congress is putting pressure on Clinton's administration to take firmer action against Sudan because it has become a haven for terrorist elements. The ruling regime in Khartoum, with its recent measures against Egypt, also hopes to divert attention from its role in fomenting the current armed struggle in Yemen. Millionaire Usamah Bin-Ladin, whose country [Saudi Arabia] has annulled his citizenship, has set up a state within a state in Sudan. Bin-Ladin ordered his followers in Pakistan and Afghanistan to go to Yemen via Sudan and fight on the side of the northern troops, Ibrahim Nafi' writes. The Sudanese regime, with the measures it has taken, aims to test Egypt's resolve before it proceeds to the issue of water. But once it gets there it will no longer be gauging reactions. It will be taking direct action that will provoke an equally direct reaction, Nafi' declares. The AL-AHRAM chief editor concludes his article by saying that the Sudanese regime is swimming against the tide of history. Eighty percent of the Sudanese people know that. They also know that Sudan is passing through a gloomy phase.
