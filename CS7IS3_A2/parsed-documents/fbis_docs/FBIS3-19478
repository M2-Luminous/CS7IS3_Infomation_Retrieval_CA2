State help for company investments and the labor market in the new laender must be concentrated more strongly in the future, a study conducted by the Ifo Economic Research Institute in Munich and the Halle Economic Research Institute (IWH) at the order of the FRG Finance Ministry says. The balance sheet after three years of intensive subsidy policy is mixed. Promotion programs continue to be a cornerstone of economic development in the new laender. Without this massive help, unemployment would have risen even more strongly. The study, which is partly based on a poll among companies, also shows that both investment promotion and labor market policy primarily secure employment. So far, too few new jobs have been created. According to the poll, about half of the companies have used labor market policy help. Two-thirds of the 931 polled companies complained in particular about the excessive wage costs, seeing them as a hindrance of further development. In view of the competition in the East European low-wage countries, the two institutes especially point to the problem of the too fast adjustment of wages to the western level, which have a negative effect on the competitiveness of existing companies and the staring prospects of newly founded companies. The state's promotion policy is in danger of becoming only a "repair instrument for misconduct in wage policy." The key to a successful promotion policy primarily is, therefore, a moderate wage policy, linked with the fastest possible abolition of still existing obstacles in administration regarding problems with ownership or regarding old burdens.
