That's where he prefers to do most of his business. These are the least intimate of surroundings, but for the purposes of a discussion about Europe the 22 empty chairs serve a helpful purpose. The ghosts of Gummer and Redwood, Portillo and Heseltine, Clarke and Shephard flicker through the whispering gallery where the drama of Major's survival -- the pressures that define the choice he must now make -- is being acted out. The prime minister, however, is not prepared to read the script that I and others have written. He doesn't see it that way. He denies that the politics of survival have anything to do with his stance on Europe. In his first discursive interview since the enlargement row began, he portrayed himself as a broker working for the European cause, who would probably get what he wanted, and of whom it was "fatuous" to assume he was doing it because he was being pushed around by sceptic bastards. "There seems to be a position where on one day I'm a raving Europhiliac prepared to roll over and accept everything from Europe, and on the next day I'm a phobe supreme who is supposed to disagree with everything from Europe," he said. "The truth is of course a good deal more complex." For a start, the enlargement negotiation and the matter of the blocking minority -- shalt 23 votes or 27 be enough to stop some thungs happening? -- was nothing new. "Time after time you'll find solutions are reached at the 59th minute of the 11th hour in the Community. It is not an unusual proposition. I am not complacent about the difficulties on this occasion, but I have lived through this before and I think it is perfectly possible that a satisfactory compromise will be reached." He declined to speculate what this compromise might be. We were meeting on Wednesday [23 March] evening, just after a private audience of l922 committee members had misinterpreted him as talking about a "two-tier" solution. A false story, apparently. But how could we conceivably get the best end of a compromise when we had so few allies? This was another misreading. Only Spain is a public ally, but "a number of other countries have indicated that they are prepared to compromise, that they don't see 27 as a take-it or leave-it offer. The Portuguese prime minister sat in the seat you're sitting on and made it perfectly clear that he thought a compromise was possible." And later: "A minority feel very strongly about 27. A large number of them are prepared to compromise." So there was reason for hope reminiscent, he said, of the optout on the social chapter during the Maastricht Treaty. That occasion is big in his memory. He plainly rates his negotiating ability highly. And his point of principle over the votes, he revealed, has a longer-term purpose. "When we joined the Community, the blocking minority represented 30 per cent of the population of Europe. It has steadily crept up. At the moment it is 40 per cent, give or take a point something. If we move to 27, it would be over 41 per cent." This might be just for two years until the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, called supposedly to sort out many big institutional issues. The British fear is that in those two years a raft of Euro social law, killing jobs, would bypass our unavailing veto. But Major is just as fearfill of what will happen in 1996 itself, and later. "When the Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic) join, as I hope they will around the turn of the century, if we applied the same arithmetic we would be getting into the absurd position of Britain, Germany and France, who provide overwhelmingly the resources of the Community, being outvoted on the qualified majority voting (QMV) procedure." In other words: "If you increase the 40 per cent now, it makes it more difficult to reduce it within a very short period in l966, and I think that poses very great problems." Problems, moreover, not just for Britain. Here comes John Major, the self-proclaimed good European. "I don't accept the principle that the good European always accepts what happens to be the majority view on the day or the fashionable view of the moment." The good European, on the contrary, looked for policies that recaptured "the hearts and minds and enthusiasm that many people had for the Community a few years ago." Hardly a sceptic formulation: perhaps not very historical either. Heart, in fact, is not where he any longer locates the enthusiasm. "The vast majority are Europeans not in their heart but in their head." "Are you in your heart or your head?" I asked. "I am very much a European in my head. I believe it is essential for the economic wellbeing across Europe." "But not in your heart?" "I am more a European in my head than in my heart, but I want to see Europe succeed." This success, I put it to him, was now being imperilled by his tactics. If he was wrong about the compromise, he might delay, perhaps kill off, the enlargement Britain had promoted more keenly than anyone. This wasn't necessary, he said. "Even if it were genuinely impossible to reach an agreement, there is still no reason why the Community should not agree that the enlargement should go ahead on the present basis, knowing they can return to the debate after that, and in any event return to it in 1996." A plausible, but surely disingenuous, suggestion. Designed, perhaps, to shift the blame for any delay on to the countries still insisting on the 27-vote block. "You can go ahead with 23, as it is now, knowing it is going to be reviewed. The point I am making is that you do not have to agree a change in order to let these other countries in." If the others won't wear this, Major has steeled himself to accept a delay. There were various trigger moments. "It is not imperative that it should be settled next weekend" (when the Foreign Ministers meet in loannina). But the Swedes, in particular, needed to get moving on their own parliamentary votes "a little while after Easter." There was another limiting moment. "I think probably if you did not have an agreement until after the European elections, you could not have enlargement go ahead on the present basis. I would hope that will not be the case." Nonetheless, delay is now evidently on the British agenda. "Enlargement is extremely important. It would be a great shame if enlargement were to be delayed. But that is what it is. It would be delayed. I very much hope it will not be." "I believe we can reach an agreement that will mean it will not be. But there is an inevitability about enlargement of the Community. It is going to happen. I hope it is going to happen on 1st January next year. But because we are very much in favour of enlargement does not automatically mean that, on another particular issue, we surrender a British interest about which we feel strongly." Any such inevitability is, of course, challenged by anxious leaders in applicant countries. They fear a catastrophic loss of momentum for what is already a tricky cause. To Major what seems to matter more is getting the European system right now. Time and again, he returned to the problems of those who already belong. On the hard-edge politics of all this he gave a series of replies to scotch the wisdom of the moment. What about the European Parliament, often cited as the body most trenchantly defending the 27? Did he see it as infinitely flexible? "No. But I do think it is probable that if the European Council reach an accommodation the Parliament, who want enlargement, will accept that accommodation." What about the parliaments of the other 11, who all have to ratify the deal? He'd learned over Maastricht that these assemblies posed little problem to their leaders. "I do not think there will be any difficulty with ratifying elsewhere in Europe whatever the Council agrees." They were certainly less of a problem than the British Parliament. With this we reached the nub of Major's crisis, and the charges now being made against him: of duplicity, cowardice, desertion of principle kow-towing to the phobes, saving his own skin, retreating from the heart of Europe. I pointed out there were certainly more Tories now pushing him not to compromise. This idea gets on his nerves. "Can I mention a fallacy in that argument? The fallacy is that I am wholly reactive and only concerned with one side of my party or the other. It might perhaps occur to people that might feel pretty strongly myself about what was the right thing to do." If he hadn't felt pretty strongly, he wouldn't have brought back the Maastricht agreement, or seen it through Parliament. "It is simply fatuous to assume that I an only structuring what I believe we must do on QMV to take account of other people's views. I happen to be doing what I believe to be right." He couldn't understand why taking a strong line for Britain was regarded as disgraceful The French did it all the time They were doing it even as we spoke, blocking an increase of seats in the European Parliament until a deal was signed guaranteeing the Parliament would stay in Strasbourg. "Why is it," he added in seemingly genuine bemusement, "that only in this country is the debate conducted in these rather extreme terms of phobic and enthusiast?" He might well ask. Between these wrenching pressures, he struggles for survival. Or so it seems. But he rejects an interpretation of current reality which is one of the few things almost every Tory politician now agrees on. "If you're trying to pick up the stories that say I am deliberately trying to keep this going in order to bang a John Bull drum at the European election, I just have to say to you that is plain wrong." "But it has a sort of John Bull effect." "It is just plain wrong. I am concerned about the Community being a success. I am not interested in hauling the walls down. That doesn't mean I have to agree with every current fashion PR policy. But no, I am not seeking a campaign for partisan interest to damage the European Community, most emphatically not. I want it to have the respect and affection of people in this country." Was there not a close connection between the party's fate in June and his own fate as leader? "I have made it perfectly clear before that at the last election I was elected and the Conservative Party was elected, and I expect to contest the next election as leader of the Conservative Party and I will do everything to win it and I think we will." "Do you feel certain you will be leader of the party at that time?" "Indeed I will." "If a lot of Tory MPs see in the European election that their own seats have gone, they're going to panic, aren't they?" "The parliamentary party I don't believe will." "That's a very confident statement. They don't seem exactly unified." "This is all `if' stuff, isn't it?" "You can't pretend it's an academic question." "I have given you my answer as to what I expect." In this conversation, the prime minister exhibited much calmness. He thinks nobody understands the EC better than he does, especially in negotiating mode. He hadn't intended to go to the brink like this, though it's hard to see how his tactics, once committed against a deal everyone else thought had been struck at Lisbon in 1992, could have any other outcome. Unless he's a good actor, which he may be, he doesn't recognise the stark terms -- Machiavelli on a bad day -- in which he's portrayed. Neither phobe nor phile, he equally rejects the choice of fool or knave. He is, however, gambling. He intends to stay in Downing Street for the duration. He sincerely believes he is not sacrificing "Europe" to this end. And if he does, he will not believe it.
