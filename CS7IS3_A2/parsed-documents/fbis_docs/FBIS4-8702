Is this true? [Videnov] I would not say so. During these last four years of change the Bulgarian officers corps has displayed a high degree of statesman-like thinking and is not threatening any revolt. However, now certain circles that aim to provoke the officers corps to extreme acts and bring it into confrontation with the institutions of state are yet again undertaking ill-considered, chaotic, and perhaps even premeditated acts. We must not allow them to get away with this! [Petrov] Nonetheless, tension is rising among the servicemen. [Videnov] I completely share their anxiety about the planned mass dismissals based on length of service and the PSSD [Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] will do everything possible to prevent such a dangerous step, especially as it is not difficult to see the political motive behind this, namely to remove the so-called military cadres with a communist past by causing confrontation between young and "old" officers. If we allow this to happen, we may provoke a similar situation in the army to that which existed in the twenties, in 1934, and in 1944. However, I will reiterate that I am firmly convinced that "repetitions" will not be permitted and there will be no "revolts." [Petrov] Nevertheless, redundancies in the army appear to be unavoidable. [Videnov] No one is against them, but they must be made in a well-planned manner, within the framework of a process of reorganizing the army, not in the form of a "slaughter to the last man" under the pretext of lack of money. [passage omitted] [Petrov] However, the ratio between the numbers of command staff and the rank and file does make an impression. [Videnov] To the uninformed and prejudiced reader or listener, it would seem so. It is not difficult to mislead the uninformed citizen. It is true that the numbers of the command staff and the rank and file are approximately equal, but this is not due to us having too many officers, but because the numbers of conscripts are insufficient even to supplement the army's peacetime strength of enlisted men. Given that we have decided to have a small but high- quality army in peacetime, the second condition for guaranteeing our security is to have an adequate command staff that can ensure their deployment in time of war (if necessary) and provide a competent administration to form the basis of a professional army. Everything else is populism or pure lies -- I am thinking of the claims made by General Lyutskanov of the Reserve that the Turkish General Staff consists of barely 500 officers. [passage omitted] [Petrov] Defense Minister Aleksandrov plans not to pay monetary compensation to redundant officers, but to give them securities instead. [Videnov] First, this is illegal, because they are being compulsorily retired, and second, this compensation is granted to the officers to meet their essential needs and help them to adapt to civilian life. I hope that even Valentin Aleksandrov has managed to dispel his illusions of "military caps filled with cash." [passage omitted] [Petrov] What, then, is the solution to the present situation in the army? [Videnov] We consider the following is necessary. First, parliament should pass the law on defense and the armed forces as soon as possible. Second, parliament -- perhaps through the National Security Commission or the Consultative Council on National Security -- should hear what the Defense Ministry and the General Staff have to say on the course of the army reform and should approve redundancies only within the framework of the reorganization of the armed services and after guaranteeing the social welfare of the officer corps. Otherwise, we may find ourselves in the paradoxical situation of having no senior officers in the headquarters at corps level and above and also having a shortage of young officers to command the platoons and companies. This is a reality, because we will dismiss between 2,000 and 4,000 men annually, while only 600-800 men will graduate from the military schools. [passage omitted]
