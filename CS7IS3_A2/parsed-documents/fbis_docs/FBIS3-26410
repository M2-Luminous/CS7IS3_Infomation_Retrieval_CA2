He had long hoped U.N. authorization for military retaliation for atrocities on the Bosnian Muslim civilians, Clinton said in a speech in Houston, Texas. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in addition to the specific request by U.N. secretary-general, NATO allies will discuss a range of options later this week in Brussels. Christopher made the remarks after a meeting of senior Clinton advisors on the deteriorating situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. While responsibility for the Saturday attack, which led to the highest single civilian toll since war broke out in the Balkan Republic 22 months ago, Christopher said there was a strong presumption the the Bosnian Serbs were behind the attack. He did not elaborate what other actions might be taken. Christopher continued consultations with allied officials today. He had telephone conversations with foreign ministers of five countries, including Britain, France and Canada. The bulk of the U.N. forces on humanitarian missions in Bosnia came from these three countries. Clinton again echoed concerns of the countries over possible retaliation against their troops, criticizing some lawmakers that called for outright air strikes against the Bosnia Serbs. They do not have electorate on the ground, Clinton said.
