Enterprises would have to choose one of the four following methods to determine salary levels: --An agreement with the local Chamber of the Treasury [Izba Skarbowa]. --An agreement signed between the enterprise's establishing agency and the manager--so-called managerial contract. --Independent shaping of salary levels by the enterprise itself, on the condition that the ratio of aggregate profit and salary to one zloty of salary, as compared to the same kind of ratio last year, will not deteriorate. --Establishing salary levels based on a government-fixed index of growth of the average monthly salary (the basis would be provided by the average monthly salary from the second half of 1993, or from all of 1993). Enterprises would be forced to pay two zlotys on every zloty over established limits. Trade union activists received the draft this week. They now have a maximum of 30 days in which to conduct negotiations.
