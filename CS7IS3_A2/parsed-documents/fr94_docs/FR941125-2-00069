FR941125-2-00069 FR941125-2-00051 The prohibition on approval of ``[p]artial State programs'' at 40 CFR 233.1(b) comes into play at the time when a state is initially seeking federal approval of its Section 404 wetlands program. At that time, there is no Section 404 wetlands program in the state. If the state fails to address all of the Section 404 requirements, 40 CFR 233.1(b) would prohibit EPA from approving the program. The present matter involves review of possible revisions to Michigan's already approved Section 404 wetlands program. 40 CFR 233.16 contains the requirements pertaining to program revisions. 40 CFR 233.16(a) requires that a State keep EPA informed of changes in the State's statutory or regulatory authority or other modifications which are significant to administration of the State's authorized program. Under 40 CFR 233.16(e), EPA may request and a State must provide documents or information whenever EPA believes that circumstances have changed with respect to the State's program. Finally, whenever EPA or a State finds that the State program is in need of revision, EPA must review and approve or disapprove of such revision. 40 CFR 233.16(d). In the present matter, EPA requested that Michigan submit information to EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 233.16 on whether any revisions occurred in Michigan's federally approved Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. EPA has not requested information pertaining to any other issues regarding Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. EPA is therefore limiting its review to the effects of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. EPA appreciates the comments received on these matters, has forwarded them to Michigan and will consider them in the context of EPA's ongoing oversight of Michigan's wetlands program. If, in the course of its ongoing oversight, EPA determines that a program revision has occurred in any of the ways described in the comments, EPA will take the appropriate steps as set forth at 40 CFR 233.16 to review and approve or disapprove of the revisions. There was one other comment, in addition to the comment pertaining to the feasible and prudent alternatives test, which suggested that Michigan's wetland program failed to comply with the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations. This comment was that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 has ``substantially changed the criteria and burden of proof by which the permitting agency routinely reviews or decides upon permits, thereby allowing agency action to take place without assurance of minimum-floor compliance with the Section 404(b) guidelines as required by 40 CFR 233, part 50.'' According to the commenter, ``[t]he Michigan Department of Natural Resources's (``MDNR'') flow-chart for decision making *␣*␣* allows an agency to apply overly vague and broad evidentiary tests to routine agency decisions when considering issuance of wetland permits.'' EPA does not agree that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 has caused the changes suggested by the commenter. There is no indication in any of the materials submitted by Michigan regarding any changes in criteria or burden of proof for decisionmaking. EPA is not aware of any MDNR ``flow-chart'' that addresses wetland issues. The sole flow-charts in the documents submitted by Michigan to EPA are flow charts contained in a December 13, 1991 Draft Plan for the Implementation of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Those flow-charts specifically pertain to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits and permits to construct air emission sources. The December 13, 1991 Draft Plan also specifically states that the wetland permitting process remains unchanged by Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. The United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service provided comments noting that it agreed with EPA that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 did not effect any substantial revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetland program. The Fish and Wildlife Service also noted that there are a number of federally listed threatened and endangered species present in Michigan and that, if EPA determines that EPA's approval or disapproval of the revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program may affect these species, EPA would be required under Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service. As described above, Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 has not caused any substantive changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. Instead, the only effects that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 have had on Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program have been to reorganize the MDNR and transfer certain authorities and duties of the MWRC to MDNR. EPA therefore has determined that its approval of these revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program will not affect endangered species. A number of commenters noted that, pursuant to 40 CFR §233.16(c), a state may not transfer all or part of its Section 404 program ``from the approved State agency to any other State agency'' until the new agency is approved by EPA. These commenters claimed that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 effectively abolished the ``old'' MDNR and created a ``new'' MDNR. These commenters suggested that this transfer of authority from the ``old'' MDNR to the ``new'' MDNR constituted a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency to any other State agency.''
