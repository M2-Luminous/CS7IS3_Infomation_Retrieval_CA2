They had a detailed and frank exchange of opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual interest. Special attention was focused on the necessity to increase integration processes both in political and economic spheres. Soskovets, in particular, stressed the importance of removing the tendency to politization of economy, which has manifested itself of late. The sides expressed their belief that it is urgent to invigorate work and implement the agreements reached during Nazarbayev's first ever official visit to Russia in late March. Big hopes to this effect are placed on the Kazakh-Russian intergovernmental commission. Concurrently, in the interests of overcoming the decline of production, both states should actively use possibilities connected with development of direct contacts between separate regions and enterprises, and encourage targeted investment in business.
