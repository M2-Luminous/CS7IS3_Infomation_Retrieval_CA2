The running gunbattles in the CBD [central business district] that left as many as 36 people dead and hundreds injured affected the equilibrium of Johannesburg's normally stoic central city business people. Rumours of a regrouping of marchers led to several shops shutting on Tuesday morning and as sirens from ambulances, on their way to routine calls, sounded on the downtown streets pedestrians scurried for safety and shopkeepers closed their doors or rolled down their metal window covers. Rumours of driveby shootings came in from all over the city and although there was sporadic gunfire in the CBD, the reaction to it was exaggerated. Streets became congested as people jostled for positions in the traffic in a bid to flee central Johannesburg. Police were able to confirm one driveby shooting on Tuesday at the ANC's [African National Congress] headquarters, Shell House. Witwatersrand police spokesman W/O Andy Pieke said the occupants of a white car reportedly fired shots at shell house at about noon. Police rushed to the scene but found no one injured. Gunfire had broken a car's windscreen, he said. Police found no trace of the car allegedly involved in the shooting. The ANC said Shell House had came under fire from snipers in opposite buildings. "The building was similarly occupied by snipers on Monday during an aborted attack on the ANC head office by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters," the ANC said in a statement. The area was cordoned off by police and traffic officers. According to people in the vicinity of the shooting a white minibus fired at the entrance to Shell House and there was gunfire from buildings opposite the ANC headquarters. ANC security guards returned fire, SABC radio news reported. The occupants of the white vehicle allegedly fired random shots at pedestrians and beat up passersby, traffic officers said. No one was seriously hurt. Office workers in at least one highrise block near the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said their management had decided to evacuate the building in the mid-afternoon on the advice of John Vorster Square police who said "bad elements" were in town. The decision drew criticism from some senior personnel working frantically to make up time lost during Monday's violence. One manager said it appeared both police and management were working on the basis of rumours.
