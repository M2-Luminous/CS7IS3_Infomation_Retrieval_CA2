While attending a meeting of the Pan American Sports Organization in Mar del Plata, 400 km from the capital, Ramon Fernandez said the U.S. State Department has threatened those businessmen who intend to trade with Cuba. After saying the blockade applied by Washington against the island for more than three decades was criminal, the vice president of the Council of Ministers said that despite U.S. pressure, the number of potential investors in Cuba is on the increase. In statements to PRENSA LATINA and an Argentine television station, Fernandez noted there has been an increase of partnerships with foreign firms in the areas of tourism, petroleum exploration, and others. Regarding a recent UN resolution on alleged human rights violations on the island, Fernandez explained the resolution resulted from a "political vendetta" by the United States, which cannot forgive us for Cuba's example to the rest of Latin America. The Cuban leader discussed the progress made by his country in the area of human rights. He described the functioning of participative democracy in Cuba and affirmed that the people play an active role in the current ongoing process. Also, Fernandez cited the existence of important rights in Cuba, such as the right to have access to health facilities, education, food, social security, and assistance. He cited statistics that showed the island in a favorable light when compared to the most developed countries. Since the victory of the revolution in 1959, there has not been one single missing or tortured person in Cuba, Fernandez emphasized. When questioned about relations between Havana and Latin America, Fernandez said these ties were broad-based, and he insisted on the need to work toward regional integration. Cuba, he concluded, is seeking to strengthen everything that unites the region and to overcome insignificant issues that separate us.
