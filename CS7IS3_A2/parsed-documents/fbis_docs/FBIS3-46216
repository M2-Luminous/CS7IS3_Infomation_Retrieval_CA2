The spokesman said that Guangdong's gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- amounted to 314.7 billion yuan last year, up 21 percent over the previous year in real terms. The province's GDP has risen at an annual rate of nearly 14 percent over the past 15 years. He attributed the rapid growth partly to faster infrastructure construction and undertaking of top-priority projects. In 1993, Guangdong added a total new generating capacity of almost four million kilowatts, built 150 kilometers of expressways and nearly 2,000 kilometers of highways, and installed switchboards with a total of 2.2 million telephone lines. The spokesman said that Guangdong plans to undertake 31 key projects this year, involving investment totaling 70.3 billion yuan. These will include a railway line, an expressway, a subway in the provincial capital of Guangzhou and six power plants. This year Guangdong plans to add a total new generating capacity of three million kilowatts and install switchboards with 2.5 million lines, the spokesman said. Guangdong has also expanded an export-oriented economy, he said. Its imports and exports amounted to 45.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. Exports soared 43 percent last year to 26.3 billion dollars. As a result, Guangdong has exported more goods than any other province-level area in China for eight successive years. Guangdong's major export markets include Japan, the United States, the European Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and Australia, the spokesman said. He said that in 1993 Guangdong signed 19,000 cooperation contracts with foreign firms, involving a total overseas investment of 34.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 76 percent over 1992. The province also scored a big increase in major foreign-funded businesses in 1993, he said. It had 738 such businesses each with an investment exceeding 10 million dollars, 527 more than in 1992. "Guangdong Province will continue to achieve rapid economic growth in the new year," the spokesman said. GDP is expected to shoot up by 15 percent and its exports by 15 percent this year, he said.
