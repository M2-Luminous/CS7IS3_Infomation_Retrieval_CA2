Those who are called major commanders, accordingly, assumed a 24-hour standing-by posture at communication stations and the entire puppet Armed Forces assumed a combat posture. Also, the police are even more frenzied in fascist oppression. This is an intolerable criminal act aimed at further aggravating tensions by raising an outcry over us. The puppets are talking as if these measures were needed because of someone's possible southward invasion, but this is a preposterous sophistry that cannot convince anybody. As everyone knows, there is no threat of a southward invasion on the Korean peninsula. The puppets have been advertising a threat of southward invasion for the past scores of years, but it has never existed. This is demonstrated well by the many peace proposals we put forward and the fact that the South side was urged to accede to the proposal for a national meeting without hesitation at the conference of the government, political parties, and social organizations of the Republic recently held in Pyongyang. In fact, there is no southward invasion, but only a threat of a northward invasion posed by the U.S. imperialists and their puppet Kim Yong-sam group exists on the Korean peninsula. This is admitted [kongin] by the world. The U.S. imperialists are openly saying that they are ready for a war [chongjaengdo pulsa hageddago], mobilizing large scale updated war equipment and troops on and around the Korean peninsula over our so-called nuclear issue. The puppet Armed Forces have assumed a mobilization posture so as to immediately begin a war upon receiving an order. They also conduct large-scale joint landing operations aimed at a northward invasion and conduct frequent exercises to pass through the Military Demarcation Line. All these facts clearly show who is actually aggravating tensions and increasing the danger of invasion on the Korean peninsula. The puppets' outcry over us is nothing but a ruse for deceiving [kiman] public opinion at home and abroad and for justifying their war commotion for a northward invasion. Why then are South Korean puppets making a stir with a special and emergency alert order for the entire puppet Army and police? This is because their aim is to bolster [kochwi] the South Korean people's sense of confrontation [taegyol uisik], with the puppet traitor's overseas trip as momentum, and at frazzling [hanchung to kinjangsikyoso] the situation aggravated by themselves and driving it to a war phase. This is proved by the following facts: Kim Yong-sam called a security-related ministers meeting a few days ago and made very belligerent outbursts [hojonjok pogon] that a 24-hour alert posture should be assumed, that the South Korean-U.S. joint alert posture should be strengthened, and so on. In his so-called statement addressed to the people that followed the meeting, he loudly talked about the need for the people to have a firm security sense and security posture. This is not the only aim the puppets are pursuing. Traitor Kim Yong-sam has begun an overseas trip, but he feels uneasy. As everyone knows, South Korean people of various classes and strata are waging a large-scale struggle against the agricultural market opening, the antiwar and antinuclear struggle, the wage struggle, and the struggle for the fatherland's reunification all over the country. As the South Korean economy has been ruined by businesses going bankrupt and inflation, the mummers of grievance of the people who are disenchanted [hwanmyorul nuggin] by the Kim Yong-sam regime is ringing all over the country. Thus, the puppets are suffering a serious ruling crisis [simgakhan tongchi wigi]. Although traitor Kim Yong-sam is visiting overseas, no one knows what will happen in South Korea at any point. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's special and emergency alert order reflects this shaky situation [iron puransuroun chojiui panyonguroso] and it is also aimed at maintaining power by oppressing opposition forces [pandaepa seryok] with weapons [chongkallo] and by diverting the people's attention with other things. However, this is worthless. Aggravating North-South relations and threatening the people with weapons will only result in accelerating self-ruin. The South Korean people will never leave the Kim Yong-sam group, which makes treachery to the country and the nation its business, as it is [maeguk paejok haengwirul ilsamnun kim yong-sam iltangul choltaero kamanduji anulgosimnida].
