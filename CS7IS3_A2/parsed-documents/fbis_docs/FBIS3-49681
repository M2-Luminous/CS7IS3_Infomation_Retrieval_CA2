Asked by journalists when the Partnership for Peace, the American scheme which he called "small but beautiful" would become a "big step," the president said that it depended, among other things, on western public opinion as well as on how the mass media would present the participation of former communist states in NATO. Asked whether he assessed the Prague meeting as a success, the president replied: "As the birth of new concepts which certainly proceed in the same direction, but the issue is the tempo and how advantage can be taken of certain situations which are appearing. I am such an activist who takes advantage of any suitable moment-- there are other strategists who just, step by step, follow the marked out path." The president disagreed with an opinion that talks between Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow will decide on the real outcome of the Prague meeting. "Moscow does play a significant role on the map of the world and from that point of view we always have to take it into account," the president said. In the president's view the Visegrad Group does not have to "show its force" any more which was necessary when its member-states were demanding the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty. As Walesa put it, today the time had come for hard work for the countries which belong to the Group, the work based upon the establishing of economic cooperation.
