FR940512-1-00018 FR940512-1-00002 Applicability: Model BAe 146&hyph;100A series airplanes, serial numbers E1002 through E1199 inclusive; Model BAe 146&hyph;200A series airplanes, serial numbers E2008 through E2204 inclusive, E2210 through E2220 inclusive; and Model BAe 146&hyph;300A series airplanes, serial numbers E3001 through E3219 inclusive, and E3222; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. Note 1: Paragraph (a) of this AD merely restates the requirement of paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8754. As allowed by the phrase, ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05 has already been accomplished, this AD does not require that the action be repeated. To prevent hydraulic fluid leakage from the pump case drain line quick release couplings, which could fuel the flames in the event of an engine fire, accomplish the following: (a) For airplane serial numbers E3001 through E3207 inclusive, E3209 through E3219 inclusive, and E3222: Within 6 months after January 20, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8754), replace the quick release coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves, in accordance with British Aerospace Service Bulletin SB.29&hyph;31&hyph;01339A, dated May 24, 1993, or SB.29&hyph;31&hyph;01339A, Revision 1, dated July 8, 1993. (b) For airplane serial numbers E1002 through E1199 inclusive, E2008 through E2204 inclusive, E2210 through E2220 inclusive, and E3208: Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, replace the quick release coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic EDP on the number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves, in accordance with British Aerospace Service Bulletin SB.29&hyph;31&hyph;01339A, Revision 1, dated July 8, 1993. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) ยง21.197 and ยง21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 5, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
