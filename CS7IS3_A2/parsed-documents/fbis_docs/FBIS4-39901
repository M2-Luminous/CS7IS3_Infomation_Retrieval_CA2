Pishchayev; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Excerpts] A meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] at the foreign minister level in Istambul, Turkey, summed up the results of NACC's work over the half-year. [passage omitted] In a brief interview with Vesti prior to his departure by air Andrey Kozyrev noted that on the whole we have no fundamental differences with NATO. Meanwhile, he said, NATO members do not in all ways share the principle of the full equality of NACC members, on which we insist. They prefer the formula NATO plus partners. In particular this was reflected in the communique on the NACC meeting. [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] I could not agree with certain formulas, which to my mind take insufficient account of Russia's role. For instance, concerning Karabakh, a formula is being proposed that notes and stresses only the role of the CSCE. We do not demand anything special, but our interests must be taken into account.
