With the permission of the party Central Committee and State Council, the number of party and government departments in organizations directly under the provincial authority will be cut down after the reform to 55, which is 15 less than the present 70. Basically, the reform will be carried out simultaneously in the provincial people's congress, the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the provincial people's court, the provincial people's procuratorate, in nongovernment provincial organizations, and in democratic parties. The provincial party committee and provincial government held a work meeting on the reform of organizations directly under the provincial authority at the provincial party committee assembly hall on the afternoon of 20 April. At the meeting, there was a mobilization talk, and specific arrangements were made for reforming organizations directly under the provincial authority and for implementing the national public service system. The meeting was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang announced the plan to reform organizations directly under the provincial authority and made specific demands concerning its implementation. Liu Guangcai, standing committee member and organization department head of the provincial party committee, attended the meeting. Yang Yongliang delivered an important speech before the meeting concluded. Yang Yongliang said: Organizational reform and the implementation of the national public service system are one of the 10 major tasks proposed by the 14th national party congress and are a major event in the political life of our province. The effective implementation of the organizational reform is of great significance to efforts to deepen the reform in all aspects, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. Leaders at all levels and the vast numbers of government functionaries should be more aware of the importance of organizational reform; earnestly unify their thoughts around the arrangements made by the party Central Committee, State Council, provincial party committee, and provincial government; adopt an overall point of view; willingly subordinate local interests to overall interests, departments to the overall situation, and individuals to the organizations; and enthusiastically support and participate in reform. The vast numbers of party members, particularly those who are also responsible cadres, should lead cadres, workers, and staff members in organizations directly under the provincial authority -- and even cadres, workers, and staff members of province-wide organizations -- by setting an example in implementing reform. Yang Yongliang pointed out: Leaders at all levels should involve themselves in the organizational reform and implementation of the national public service system in a spirit of reform. They should use reformative methods to solve problems which occur during the transition from the old to the new system so that the organizational reform and implementation of the public service system can proceed from an advanced level in the initial stage. They should focus on completing the reform of organizations directly under the provincial authority and on implementing the national public service system at the fastest possible pace and in a relatively short time while ensuring quality at the same time. They should use organizational reform to achieve major breakthroughs in transforming government functions. They should regard organizational reform and the implementation of national public service system as the turning point, give government functionaries comprehensive public service training and education, further change their work style, and improve efficiency at work so that an honest, capable, steady, and highly efficient national public service team will be formed in the government. Yang Yongliang said: The difficult part of organizational reform is transferring and distributing surplus government workers. We must widen channels through which we can properly assign government workers, and we must open channels for cadres to show off their talent at the front line of economic construction. Yang Yongliang said emphatically: Departments at all levels should earnestly strengthen their leadership over this task and ensure that reform is implemented systematically and step by step. We should enhance our sense of organization and discipline, strictly observe all policies for organizational reform, and strictly forbid actions which violate laws and discipline. In conclusion, Yang Yongliang asked the vast numbers of government functionaries, workers, and staff members to stand fast at their posts, fulfill their duties and responsibilities, work hard at reform, and do solid work to achieve the desired objectives for the reform of organizations under the provincial authority and the implementation of the state public servant system, and to promote the organizational reform and implementation of the national public service system.
