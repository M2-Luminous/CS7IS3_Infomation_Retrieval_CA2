Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Karadzic said that such a meeting involving the presidents of Russia, the United States, France, Britain and Germany should be well prepared and put an end to the war in Bosnia not only through reaching an accord between the warring factions but also through signing an international treaty. "When new borders are set, we might need the guarantees of five great powers. We would welcome such international treaty," Karadzic said. Speaking about the role of the Russian peace-keeping contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic said "We do not expect that Russian `blue helmets' will support only the Serbs. It will be enough if they take an objective stand and will be able to defend our people." He said he wanted the Russian contingent to be bigger. There are fears that NATO countries may overstep the competence of the U.N. mandate and start acting within the framework of the military organisation of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian soldiers will be always following the tasks set by the U.N. and will never overstep their mandate, Karadzic stressed. He described the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a tragic event which had been long sought by Germany. Now that this has happened, it is necessary to set new borders and reach a settlement which would lead to durable peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic said Bosnian Serbs own 64 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina but whey control 72 per cent. He said the Serbs are ready to hand over these eight per cent to the rightful owner. He said they are ready to go even below the point of 64 per cent and swap territories for the sake of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the news conference, Karadzic left Moscow. Meanwhile, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic called on Bosnian Serbs to join the Croatian-Moslem talks on the establishment of Bosnian federation. The announcement was made after his talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Granic said Croatia shares France's position calling for reaching a peace agreement between all three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He noted that the Croatian side offers Bosnian Serbs to join the new federation on the same terms as the two other concerned sides, and expressed the hope that the Serbs will take part in the talks on this issue. He stressed that Zagreb stands for normalising relations with Belgrade. But this can become possible only if Serbs leave the territory they are holding in Croatia as envisaged by the Washington agreements.
