FBIS4-66769 "jpnea027___94010" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 1 April 1994 NEAR EAST EGYPT Minister on Regional Water Distribution Minister on Regional Water Distribution 94LD0039A Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic 1 Apr 94 p 6 94LD0039A Cairo AL-SHA'B Arabic CSO [Interview with Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi, Egyptian minister of public works and water resources, by Salah Bidaywi; in Cairo, date not given--first six paragraphs are AL-SHA'B introduction] [Text] A few short months ago, Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi was put at the head of the Ministry of Irrigation [title as published]. He stated immediately after assuming his duties that Egypt does not have one spare drop of water it can give to the Zionist entity. He also launched extensive dialogues with Egypt's African partners in the Nile basin in order to realize his long-stated objective of cooperation among those nations. Dr. Radi spent his youthful years conducting studies at water research institutions. Two years before he was given the [Irrigation] portfolio, he was given responsibility for the Encased Drainage Agency [title as published] and was selected to be deputy minister of irrigation. The minister of irrigation told AL-SHA'B that he will provide water for only 2,500 feddans in Sinai through the year 1997 when work on digging the Peace Canal would have been completed. This means that in the absence of an alternative to absorb the present inhabitants of central Sinai, they would have to be evacuated, leaving the area as a ready-to-serve meal, which the enemy may readily gobble up. Studies, on the other hand, confirm that central Sinai holds enough subterranean water to irrigate 1 million feddans annually and to settle hundreds of thousands in dozens of new urban communities in central Sinai. The minister reiterated his unwillingness to supply the Zionist enemy with a single drop of water and denied that it poses any threat to Nile sources or that it has attempted to pilfer Sinai water. The minister said that the public interest of the motherland requires him to stay clear from the details of cooperation with the Africans [as published] and their relationships with the Zionists because all those concerned would get upset and do not believe that opposition media should exist in the Third World. In point of fact, the minister was congenial to the extreme, but congeniality is not what national interests are about. I interviewed him twice for one and one-half hours, but he ultimately preferred to respond to written questions. I wrote the questions and left them for him. He answered and I left his office with his answers, but I was not totally happy with [his response]. I believe that his actions belied the esteem he professed for AL-SHA'B. [Bidaywi] We were delighted by your recent statement that you refuse to allow one drop of water outside Egyptian [borders]. Would you elucidate for us the scope of the current Zionist strategy to envelope the sources of Arab water in southeast Anatolia and in the Ethiopian plateau? And what about Ethiopia's dams, foreign bureau studies in their regard, and their funding by international institutions? What are your views on the al-Salaam [Peace] water pipeline proposed by Turkey for the Middle East? What is new with regard to Zionist cooperation with Ethiopia and other nations of the Nile Basin? [Radi] In all aspects of water resources Egypt focuses on the Nile as its main artery of water. Egypt's primary orientation, of course, is to foster constant and constructive cooperation with Nile Basin nations and to seek a suitable format for comprehensive cooperation in order to maximize the benefits of that river to all its peoples. We felt during our numerous meetings with Basin countries that all of them are likewise keen on the same objective. In light of that keenness, the various countries of the Nile Basin have adopted positions rooted in non-interference with the strong fraternal relations that presently exist. Therefore, as far as we know, there is no foreign intervention with impact on the Nile Basin. We have no fear of that because our confidence in ourselves and in our brethren propels actions rooted in constructive cooperation that would serve mutual interests without abridging the rights of any party or undermining any of those rights. As to Arab waters, the precept is that everyone should receive his entitlement and that occupation does not justify usurping the rights of owners of motherlands. None of the studies and other research by foreign bureaus and others are mandates. They are merely personal initiatives by their sponsors. The basic notion is respect for rights, commitment to principles, and organized recognition of water use. The previously proposed al-Salaam Turkish pipeline project is a political project in the sense that we don't believe in its technical or economic feasibility. Desalinating sea water is more feasible technically and economically and can be done within a state's borders and would therefore be easily controlled. [Bidaywi] Your studies published under the title "Water and Peace" discussed cooperation between Egypt and Nile Basin countries. Have you translated them into reality? How do the Africans justify their cooperation with the Zionists? What progress has been made in making water projects more productive in the Upper Nile? Also, what about the High Dam project, the removal of silt from its reservoir, and the true nature of refurbishment there? [Radi] The primary objective of the "Water and Peace" studies originally published in 1985 was to alert domestic and regional public opinion to the urgency of water issues and to the value of organizing, developing, and safeguarding our water resources. The studies also advanced a collection of strategies proposed by their author. We seek, within a context of integration and coordination with all the other agencies, to implement those strategies that are appropriate at this time. We have already begun to move in that direction in Ethiopia, and we hope that such moves will be fruitful. As to the question of silt in the High Dam reservoir, this is a matter currently under study by the Ministry's research agencies. Experimental projects will also explore uses for that silt and, once their viability is proved, will be implemented on a wider scale. It will be four or five years, however, before these experimental studies are completed. We have talked a lot about the High Dam, which will ever remain the center of and the basis for development in Egypt. It has been proved beyond doubt that its negative impact, decried by some, has been very limited and is fully under control. Important Issues [Bidaywi] How do you assess Libya's Great Manmade River project and the dam that Sudan is building across the Nile? Do these two projects threaten Egypt in any way? [Radi] The Libyan river is a project that the Libyan Government finds necessary to deal with water shortages and has therefore allocated for it all the funds it takes, without regard to economic value. Continued development and life require a shift of focus from economic feasibility alone. The Nile Water Organization had previously debated the proposed al-Hamdab Dam project in the Sudan and concluded that it would be beneficial for the Sudanese people. The project does not abridge Egyptian rights as long as the amount of water utilized for it does not exceed Sudan's assigned water quota under its 1959 agreement with Egypt. [Bidaywi] How do you plan to provide water for reclamation and agrarian development projects through the year 2000? What's new with the project to collect water at the northern lakes? How about the reservations expressed in that regard? [Radi] The expansion and reclamation plan through the year 2000 calls for reclaiming some 1.6 million feddans, which would require some 8.8 billion cubic meters annually. Irrigation water will consist of drainage water, mixed with some 5.3 billion [cubic meters] of fresh water annually. [Bidaywi] There has been a lot of discussion about the Peace Canal and its current track. Do you have confidence in that course and why? Also, how will it be possible to irrigate al-'Arish and central Sinai lands whose area is said to exceed 5 million feddans? What have you done about well-digging projects in central Sinai? What have you done with plans to dig wells in central Sinai and build dams so that the population is not forced out by the Peace Canal in the north? Is it true what expert studies have confirmed that the enemy pilfers 50,000 cubic meters daily of Sinai's subterranean water? How can this be dealt with and utilized to the benefit of Egypt? Do the Zionists have a role in the system for designing [as published] al-Salaam Canal and its networks? What exactly is the Ministry's role in that regard? [Radi] Plans for Peace Canal to be built east of the [Suez] Canal were drawn by the Ministry of Water Resources in 1975. Another study followed in 1978 titled "Horizontal Expansion in an Area of 2.8 Million Feddans; Planning for the Canal." This is considered to be the optimum plan and [calls for] terminating the Canal at al-'Arish City. As to Ministry plans for wells and holding dams in order to develop the region, 52 wells are being dug across central Sinai and will be completed over a five-year period ending in 1997 and will perennially irrigate some 2,500 feddans. The settlement of habitants have actually begun in al-Magharah, Jabal-al-Halal, Umm-al-Shahhan, and 'Arid-al-Naqah. We have also completed the construction of six underground reservoirs, with a capacity of 600 cubic meters each, in al-Jurafi Valley (al-Kantalah) in order to store rain and torrent waters for drinking purposes. Presently under study are 14 dams in al-Jurafi region which would make it possible to utilize rain and reservoir waters for irrigating certain areas and for feeding the underground reservoir instead of being lost to the sea. About enemy exploitation of subterranean water--studies proved that there is no extraction across the Sinai border. [Bidaywi] The International Monetary Fund is maintaining intense pressure on our country to exact a price for irrigation water, and the government is using all kinds of pretexts to delay action on issue. What are your views and why do Ministry of Irrigation agencies insist on metering the wells being dug on new lands? Are there plans to charge a price in the future? [Radi] There are no current or future plans to charge for water, and this is final. Metering wells is an operational procedure to control water extraction and avoid depleting the wells or salinating their content. This in no way means a charge for the water. Let us emphasize once and for all that irrigation water will not be subject to a charge of any kind, now or in the future. [Bidaywi] How about the development of irrigation networks in older lands? What system will be utilized? What will the costs be and how will they be covered? What progress has been made in the construction of encased drainage networks and in the agrarian utilization of encased drainage water and subterranean water? [Radi] The main objective of developing irrigation networks in older lands is to reduce water loss and consequently raise the efficiency of irrigation systems. Some 390,000 feddans are undergoing development, and the project will save some 3 million cubic meters of water by the end of plan when the development is completed of about 4.7 million feddans in Lower Egypt and al-Fayyum. The cost of developing the 390,000 feddan area is estimated at about 1,800 Egyptian pounds per feddan. As to encased drainage networks, the Ministry's plan hopes to supply some 5.6 million feddans of farmland with encased drainage networks at a cost of 875 million Egyptian pounds. Public drainage facilities will also be deepened and enlarged at a cost of some 820 million Egyptian pounds. [Bidaywi] Do any relations exist in any manner between Ministry of Irrigation agencies and the Zionist entity? If so, what are they and what are their purpose and objectives? Were any mutual cooperation projects brought to your attention? [Radi] The relations between counterparts anywhere in the world are based on mutual interests and the realization of assured benefits, provided there are interrelated interests and also interrelated circumstances. Egypt's water systems are different from all other such systems in the region and consequently no areas of potential cooperation currently exist. [Bidaywi] Farmers were surprised at your cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and we were all happy as a result because of the benefits that would accrue to our beloved Egypt as it suffers a severe irrigation water shortage that has already caused great harm to wheat crops in Lower Egypt and Bani-Suwayf. What is the real cause of the crisis? Has it dissipated? [Radi] There were two main reasons for the water crisis that occurred. The first was that the country's weather was unusually warm this year and temperatures were higher than their mean. The second was that the customary amount of rain did not fall on Lower Egypt this year. Meteorological measures indicate that rain fell considerably short of its mean. The two factors together caused a considerable and unusual depletion of farmland soil moisture, causing farmers to double the amount of irrigation water used in previous years. Add to this the psychological state of farmers, which also led then to higher water consumption. [Bidaywi] Does the Ministry of Irrigation have any fiscal problems in funding the al-Salaam Canal project? [Radi] Funding for all irrigation projects in general is adequate for the time being and will be increased in the future as our needs increase. The al-Salaam Canal has no funding problems. [Bidaywi] How about Ministry of Irrigation relations with the Sudan and with other Arab states? [Radi] Ministry of Irrigation relations with the brotherly Sudan have since the dawn of time been fraternal and based on mutual benefits linked by Nile waters. As to the other Arab states, technical cooperation exists at the highest levels of various Ministry departments as do exchanges in the fields of training and technical expertise.
