It is hard to disagree with all of this. Still, much in this respect remains unsaid. On one hand, fortunately, our country is indeed currently not crisscrossed by civil war fronts as it was in 1918-1920. But there also is another side to it. Unfortunately, armed conflicts are an almost inevitable companion of the political instability that is inherent in every revolution. And we do not have the right to close our eyes to armed conflicts in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and other places, which essentially have one common source--the revolutionary (or counterrevolutionary, if one looks at it from the position of left-wing forces) disintegration of the Union. Associations with the civil war also inevitably come to mind when one reads reports (I am almost tempted to say summaries of operations) from the civil war fronts in the former Yugoslavia. Yes, on the surface it is apparently religious and ethnic conflicts that are driving it in Croatia, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is clear to an attentive observer, however, that they are developing in the form of a full-scale civil war resembling in many respects the postrevolution events in Russia. One of the conclusions that should be drawn in this connection is that we should abandon the old habit of classifying as civil war only a clearly defined social armed conflict. As historical experience tells us, conflicts of other kinds may acquire the form of a civil war, although in each of them a social component is undoubtedly present (see on this also: P. Shevotsukov. "Civil War. A Look Across the Decades." SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1992, No. 10; Yu. Polyakov. "A Civil War? An Interethnic War?" SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1993, No. 8). Comparisons between the civil war in Russia and analogous events on the territory of Yugoslavia also evoke another thought. With all the differences that form a foundation of these conflicts, one cannot fail to notice a score of common features, which modern journalism frequently portrays only as specific to the civil war in our country. This includes a horrible bitterness that results in massive-scale homicide of the civilian population, hostage taking, terror, and so on. By the way, the same happened in France in 1793-1795, in the United States in 1861-1865, and Spain in 1936-1939. Hence, conclusions regarding the alleged special cruelty of the civil war of 1918-1920, ostensibly specific to our country, clearly need to be revised. In my opinion the time has long come to also sort out what content we place in the notion "civil war." One can see, as they say, "with the naked eye" that some researchers see civil war as a process of armed struggle between citizens of the same country, between different parts of society, while others see civil war only as a period in the country's history during which armed conflicts define its entire life. I believe that both approaches have a right to exist (naturally, provided clarification is made as to what precisely is meant), and attempts to reject one of them only complicates the substance of the matter. If we accept this postulate, however, it will also make it much easier to answer the question of when the civil war started and when it ended, as well as many other questions. If we look at the civil war in Russia as a process, it will become clear that its first act were the events in Petrograd and other cities at the end of February 1917. Armed clashes on the streets of the capital in April and July; the Kornilov offensive in August; the "peasant uprising" in September; the October events in Petrograd, Moscow, and a number of other places in the country, as well as certain episodes of the period which later was called "the triumphal march of Soviet power," also fall into this category. By the beginning of 1918 this phase had come to an end to a large extent. This state of affairs is what Social Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov actually meant when in his 5 January speech to the Constituent Assembly he expressed hope for an imminent end to the civil war. Of course, at the time seats of civil war were still smoldering in Ukraine, North Caucasus (the Volunteer Army), and a number of Cossack regions, but quite a few people felt at the time that the stormy preceding period was about to be replaced by a different, more peaceful one. Contrary to these expectations, however, new seats of conflict continued to flare up, and in the middle of 1918 the period of civil war had already begun, ending only in November 1920 with the defeat of P. Vrangel's army. Civil war (as a process), however, still continued after that. Among its episodes were the Kronstadt mutiny and Antonov's offensive in 1921; the military actions in the Far East, which ended in 1922; and the Basmach movement in Central Asia, mostly liquidated by 1926, but completely eradicated only by 1933. In my opinion, it is not only justifiable but also necessary to look into another side of civil war. I mean the civil war mentality as a very important part of the mass conscience. Here are the two most popular formulae of this psychology: "If the enemy does not surrender, he must be destroyed" and "Those who are not with us are against us." Once such views set in, it becomes impossible to speak of a "political adversary" (or even a "scientific opponent"). These notions are replaced by that of "enemy," which has to be unmasked and then destroyed unless he surrenders (and sometimes even after he has surrendered and even "admitted his guilt"). It is wrong to think that a civil war mentality comes into existence with the beginning of armed conflicts and dies after they end. Civil war (as a process) was already underway in October-November of 1917, but political adversaries who surrendered (and even participants in the armed struggle) not only were not being destroyed--they were set free on their "word of honor." These days it is considered improper to mention, for instance, that the Bolsheviks released on their word of honor not only many former ministers of the Provisional Government but also cadets--participants in the 29 October rebellion--after they promised not to fight against the Soviet power in the future. General Krasnov also was set free on his word of honor after being defeated on the battlefield--who, by the way, along with many cadets, immediately continued armed struggle against the Soviet power. It took a rather lengthy period of time for the civil war mentality to become part of the flesh and blood of the people of that time. It is hard (probably impossible) to tell precisely which of the opposing sides had the first decisive word. As witnessed by a multitude of documents the author of this article studied over many years, one of the first steps in this direction was General L. Kornilov's order to the Volunteer Army (January 1918): "Do not take any prisoners" (see in more detail G.Z. Ioffe. "The White Affair. General Kornilov." Moscow, 1989, p. 233). There is an ongoing argument as to which came first--the "white terror" or the "red terror." I think we should keep in mind this order by Kornilov, but there is another point that is no less important. Both types of terror were closely interconnected and served as justification for one another: If "they" do this, "we" also have an absolute right to. It is this "interaction" that produced this specific civil war atmosphere. In my opinion, at this point a clarification is in order. In our journalism (and sometimes in scientific literature as well) the word "terror" is used in a broad sense, mixing together two close but still distinct notions--"repression" and "terror." It would suffice to look into the most elementary dictionary to find out that repression is a "punitive measure, punishment," while terror is "a policy of intimidation, suppression of political opponents by violent means" ("Foreign Words Dictionary," Moscow, 1981, pp. 441, 505). Therefore, actions of official organs aimed against real participants in antigovernment actions cannot be classified as terror. Actions against innocent people, on the other hand--hostage killing or elimination of "persons of questionable background" ("bourgeoisie" on one side of the front line and "proletarians" on the other) should unquestionably be treated as terror. The usual purpose of terror is to suppress potential opponents' and their potential allies' will to continue the struggle. The experience of civil war shows, however, that it is impossible to break the will of a determined adversary by terror. Members of the fence-sitting strata are another matter. True, as historical experience shows, even among them the terror may cause a reverse reaction--the desire to avenge the slain innocent. So its practical effectiveness usually is not very high. It is my deep conviction, however, that without terror the civil war mentality could not establish itself and take root. It is not accidental that the civil war mentality remained one of the most important components of the mass conscience in our country many decades after the armed struggle had ended. I think that without it neither the mass violence against the peasantry during collectivization nor the "repressions" of the 1930's to the early 1950's would have been possible. I believe that the persistence of the civil war mentality was the result of a number of factors. They include the existence of a considerable anti-Soviet diaspora that attempted to organize its supporters inside the country in order to renew armed struggle. Also the actions of Western and Eastern powers aimed at the weakening (and subsequent overthrow) of Soviet power, which were used by the official propaganda. And finally the "Comintern" [Communist International] aspect of the mass conscience, one of the elements of which was interpreting quite disparate events in other countries as a continuation of the civil war in Russia. I think that the horrible decision to kill the captured Polish officers (the "Katyn incident") was made in 1940 precisely from the standpoint of the interests of "future socialist revolution in Poland." Neither should we forget that a certain component of the civil war also manifested itself in the Great Patriotic War. I mean the white emigration supporting Hitlerite occupiers, and the actions of Vlasov's and other nationalist units fighting on the side of the Wehrmacht. Essentially, we gradually began to overcome the civil war mentality only at the time of Khrushchev's "thaw." The completion of this process mainly fell on the years of perestroyka, when Stalin's real political opponents (N. Bukharin, G. Zinovyev, L. Kamenev, and others) were exonerated and for the first time the question of the necessity of making peace with those who had fought on the side of the whites in the civil war was put on the agenda. At the same time, it would be wrong to believe that the civil war mentality has been eradicated once and for all. Unfortunately, the political and economic instability in which we currently live contains an inherent potential of its resurrection. One of the most burning issues that attracts modern society's attention is: How do civil wars start? Sometime it is phrased somewhat incorrectly: Who is at fault in starting them? Asking the question from this angle essentially precludes the possibility of scientific analysis. Instead of studying the situations that lead to civil wars, people who phrase the question this way not so much attempt to find a serious, objective answer as to "brand" the guilty. And who exactly is to be branded, these people usually know in advance. So, for a researcher this approach is a dead end. In these conditions, I think, what we need to do is identify the most typical situations that lead to civil wars and look at each individually. In my opinion, there are two basic situations that start civil wars. One of them is related to an upcoming revolution, and the other is not. To start with, I would like to recall what Pitirim Sorokin once said. "The fall of a regime," wrote Sorokin, "is usually the result not so much of the efforts of revolutionaries as of the growing decay, helplessness, and inability to perform constructive work of the regime itself" (P.A. Sorokin. "The Long Road." Moscow, 1992, p. 37). I think the key word here is "constructive." In other words, in theory any revolution is preventable. But for this the government must undertake certain ("constructive") reforms that would remove the social tension that accompanies a revolution in the making. Because of "decay, helplessness, and inability to perform constructive work," however, neither the last government of the imperial Russia nor the Provisional Government found in themselves the strength to implement the necessary changes. And since the accelerating events required action, it found an outlet in the attempts at armed suppression against the people--more energetic in February and much less active in October. Therefore, in such a situation it is the government's actions that usually provide an impetus for armed confrontation. Naturally, I anticipate objections. Let us say, I can hear some people saying, that you are right with respect to February. But in October everything was different. The Bolsheviks were the ones who engaged in the most preparations for armed struggle--that is, the opponents of the existing regime--while the Provisional Government only defended itself, and even that it started doing too late. All this is true, but if we look attentively at the course of events, we will inevitably come to the conclusion that had it not been for the indeed weak and generally meaningless efforts at armed resistance on the part of the Provisional Government, the transfer of authority probably would have proceeded peacefully, without armed clashes, and therefore could not be considered as one of the episodes of the civil war. Politically, in the eyes of a considerable part of the socially active population the Provisional Government by then was doomed--this is confirmed in the memoirs of most contemporaries, with the exception probably of A. Kerenskiy and those who shared his views. Thus, there was the possibility of a peaceful transfer of power, which was not realized. I can hear another objection: And what about the armed resistance of the defenders of the Provisional Government in Moscow and in other places? In this connection it is worth rereading the reminiscences of October in Moscow of one of the "White Guard" fighters, S. Efron. There people, too, by October were quite disappointed in Kerenskiy and his government; after the failure of Kornilov's offensive "nothing good" was in store for the country; the Provisional Government was characterized as the "damned Kerenskiy rule;" and quite understandably, Moscow supporters of the Provisional Government looked at the "White Guard" "with certain distrust or even apprehension," fearing a "counterrevolution" (S. Efron. "October (1917)." BOLSHEVO literary-cultural almanac, No. 2, Moscow, 1992, pp. 59, 61, 81). But as long as the Provisional Government remained in power, the chance remained that the country would turn to the right, to order and stability. The "White Guard" of Moscow acted in defense of this potential turn of events rather than "in defense of the Provisional Government." The example above (when episodes of a civil war are directly tied to a revolution) may also be seen as a particular variety of a more general approach to the problem, when the situation in the country and society looks more stable. At the same time, we have to emphasize that civil wars do not start in an environment of social peace: One degree or another of social tension necessarily precedes civil war. But neither should we gloss over the difference between similar but still distinctly different situations. In the former, we are dealing with a struggle against a regime that has lost the real support of the population. In the latter--a crisis being experienced by a regime that enjoys the support of a considerable part of socially active population. This particular version of development of events is probably what we should look at attentively. The question of the conditions in which a civil war may start was considered by Lenin in his article "The Russian Revolution and the Civil War," written in the first half of September 1917. Lately it is being widely quoted in the press, but to my best knowledge it has not yet become the subject of a special study. Usually, only a part of Lenin's thesis is quoted--I believe, in a form intentionally truncated for a certain political purpose. The only words picked out are that "only a Bolshevik union with the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks... would have made civil war in Russia impossible," and then on the basis of this the conclusion is drawn that the blame for the civil war rests with the Bolsheviks for their refusal to form such a union. Here is, however, how the appropriate part of the article looks in unabridged form: "If there is a lesson of the revolution that is absolutely inarguable and absolutely proven by facts, it is only that only a Bolsheviks union with the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, only the immediate transfer of all power to the soviets, would have made civil war in Russia impossible. Because a civil war started by the bourgeoisie is unthinkable against such a union, against the deputies of the soviets of workers, soldiers, and peasants; such a "war" would have not progressed even to a single battle..." (V.I. Lenin. Complete Works, Vol. 43, p. 222). And further on: "The bourgeoisie's resistance to the free-of-charge transfer of land to the peasants, to similar transformations in other spheres of life, to just peace and a break with imperialism--such resistance is of course inevitable. But to see such resistance spill over into civil war, you need at least some masses, capable of fighting and defeating the soviets. The bourgeoisie does not have such masses and there is no place it can get them from" (Ibid., p. 223). As we can see, what is being abridged is the second part of the phrase, which essentially describes the conditions of entering such a union--that its participants would agree to transfer power to the soviets. And this is being dropped intentionally, since, as is known, the Bolsheviks not only were agreeable to forming a "homogeneous socialist government," but also themselves offered that other socialist parties join the Council of People's Commissars, but on one mandatory condition--that all the members of this government agree to be answerable to the soviets. It is this condition that the other participants in the negotiations, which were then conducted by Vikzhel, could not accept, and the idea of a "homogeneous socialist ministry" never got off the ground. This discourse has only an indirect bearing on our topic, however, since in this part of Lenin's article the topic was the possibility of averting a "minor" civil war stemming from the transfer of power from the Provisional Government to the soviets. Much more important, in my opinion, is another part of the article in which it says that civil war may start in Russia only when the opponents of the revolution "have at least some masses, capable of fighting and defeating the soviets" (ibid., p. 223). I think that this is precisely the key to understanding the process of how a civil war begins. It is not enough for the authority to have active political opponents. Also necessary are masses willing to support them not only in elections but also by directly taking part in an armed struggle. That this thesis is correct is best confirmed by an analysis of the events of the first half of 1918. Over the past few years a version that has become popular in our journalistic writing is that the disbandment of the Constituent Assembly at the beginning of 1918 was the cause and de facto beginning of the civil war. Meanwhile, the documents of the Social Revolutionaries Party--at the time the Bolsheviks' main adversary--and the memoirs of its leaders make it clear why the Social Revolutionaries did not respond to this act by armed struggle. At the time the Social Revolutionaries did not have enough popular support, without which it was hopeless to launch an insurrection. In these conditions, as the Social Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov reminisced later, the party leadership "came almost unanimously to the conclusion that the Constituent Assembly should be written off as a lost cause in the capitals; what is left is to search somewhere else on the territory of Russia for a place that would invite the Constituent Assembly and offer it protection (...). Thus, in a natural way, the idea began to form to move the Constituent Assembly to the Urals-Volga region" (V.M. Chernov. "On the Eve of the Storm." New York, 1953, p. 368). The Brest peace treaty; the left-wing Social Revolutionaries walking out on the Council of People's Commissars; the intensifying disagreement among the Bolsheviks, Chernov continues, strengthened in the Social Revolutionaries' ranks the irreconcilable opposition to the Bolshevik dictatorship and the readiness to raise the banners of insurrection against them at the first opportunity" (ibid.). Right here, let us pay attention to the provisional "at the first opportunity." This indicates an awareness that even in the spring of 1918, in March-April, such an opportunity did not yet exist. The situation had changed by the beginning of the summer of 1918, when the policy of Soviet power in the countryside--to a large extent forced by circumstances--and the arbitrariness of its local organs caused acute discontent among the peasantry. The Urals Cossacks rose against the Soviet power; anti-Soviet riots spread over a number of areas in the Volga and Urals regions; and at the end of May the Czechoslovak rebellion began. "In these circumstances," writes Chernov, "in June 1918 the Volga regional committee of the PSR [Party of Social Revolutionaries] entered an alliance with the Urals Cossack Host for the purpose of liquidating the Bolshevik dictatorship and proclaiming the rule of the Constituent Assembly in the Volga and Urals regions. The (PSR) Central Committee... ratified this alliance agreement" (ibid., p. 373). The events that followed are well known. On 8 June in Samara, occupied by Czechoslovak troops, the Social Revolutionaries formed a Committee of Constituent Assembly Members, which proclaimed itself the supreme authority in the country and began an armed struggle against the Soviet power. Mobilization into the "People's Army" was announced, and some time later the country was sliced apart by the first front of a "major" civil war. Now perhaps it is time to summarize the above. Usually, a civil war (with the exception of the instances of recent revolution described above) is started by forces that are in opposition to the existing regime, and only in circumstances when they are certain of success (or at least hope for such success). Without such an assumption, civil wars are not started. In 1917 many groups hoped to win: the initiators of the demonstration in April; the participants in the Petrograd rebellion in July; General Kornilov in August; the participants in the battles against establishing Soviet power in Moscow in October-November hoped for help from the Headquarters and the Cossacks; and so on. Sometimes such an appraisal of the situation is justified (for instance, in April 1917, when mass demonstrations resulted in the final analysis in the formation of a coalition government with the participation of the socialists). In other instances hopes for victory were crashed. However, the outcome of the events in many respects was predestined by the popular attitude to the participants in the action. It is no secret to anyone that the danger of a civil war also exists today. It is associated with the social tension that is growing in the country as what the West calls the "social security net" disappears, the standard of living declines, and the threat of mass unemployment grows. And the only way to avert a social explosion, and with it a civil war, lies, in my opinion, not in constitutional drafts but in such steps in the area of the economy and social policy that would remove social tension in society. If, however, at the same time we continue to contemplate only to what extent these steps are in line with "free market ideals" and the values of "world civilization," we may miss the opportunity, while civil war in some form or other will, alas, loom inevitable.
