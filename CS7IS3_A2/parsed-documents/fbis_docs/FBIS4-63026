A coincidence? Fire, as is known, is better than rain at removing all traces. At any rate, the people of Novonezhino are sure: "Look, it was the commander that did it.... He was selling guns, and now everything has gone sky-high," an old lady, Praskovya Ivanovna, lamented, as she was being evacuated with her meager goods and chattels from her now roofless little home. Thefts of weapons are the most widespread crime in the military sphere. Dumps are poorly guarded, the buildings are old and dilapidated, and instead of barbed wire often all you find is a rickety fence. The results of the Vladivostok disaster have never been published. There were rumors of a fire to remove the evidence of thefts. There were some rather garbled reports about seamen dropping smoldering cigarette butts near projectiles. The cigarette butts turned out to have a long fuse. What is being peddled now, two years on, is theories about the self-combustion of old projectiles, about a forest fire encroaching from the taiga.... "There could not have been a forest fire. I flew over the explosion area myself in a helicopter and the only black traces of fire I could see were inside the dump. They did not cross the strip of forest in front of it," Maritime Kray Administration chief Ye. Nazdratenko said at a news conference. But he refused to blame the fleet for what had happened, putting it all down to the rampaging democrats who had broken up the army. But it is not the first time the Pacific Fleet has been the main cause of disasters in the Maritime Kray. The mushroom cloud over Chazhma Bay, the nuclear submarine that sank in Bolshoy Kamen -- all that was in the eighties. In 1991 Vladivostok came under fire during trials of the guns mounted on the warship Admiral Vinogradov. The shells overshot the target and happened to expolode in the air above a residential district. Later, two navy aircraft exploded in the air as they were just reaching Vladivostok. Maritime Kray is still literally crammed with military equipment -- there are still around 15 similar ammunition dumps there. One of them is in the very center of Vladivostok, on the densely populated Egersheld peninsula. The fleet leadership assures us that there is no possibility of its being removed. Unless, of course, there is some assistance from cigarette butts.... Meanwhile Maritime Kray is counting the cost. According to the experts, there has been nothing in Russia before to compare with the disaster in Novonezhino. The dump (four kilometers long and 1.5 kilometers wide) is beyond recovery -- there is a massive gaping creater where it used to be. The remaining ammunition -- around 30 percent -- will be destroyed. Most of the houses in Novonezhino are beyond repair. Thousands of people were made homeless by the explosion and have now been moved to other parts of Maritime Kray. Hectares of sown land and neighboring villages have been showered with explosives. So the kray leadership's optimistic statements about there being "no casualties" could be premature, alas. Only a week ago KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about a boy who was blown up by a shell left over from the explosion of two years ago.... [Barabash ends] Sergey Avdeyev commentary: "Concerning Which" Yesterday fleet commander Adm. Georgiy Gurinov was added to the list of victims. He was removed from his post by an edict of the Russian president "because of continuing serious incidents in the fleet entrusted to him and an overall decline in combat readiness, and for personal negligence in his work." The dismissal of the commander, who had been in this post for a little over a year, in itself seems somewhat strange. How could the new admiral, appointed by an edict of the same president only recently, in such a short time have ruined a fleet which until recently was considered one of the best in the country? Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov has been appointed acting commander. While in no way doubting his professional capabilities and personal qualities, I will merely observe that when commenting on the lessons of the 1992 Vladivostok arsenal explosion Igor Nikolayevich gave the following firm assurance: From now on all fleet arsenals will be safe.
