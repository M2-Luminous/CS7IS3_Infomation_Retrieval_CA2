If negotiations must be held, he said, they must be held only after the existence of two communities having equal rights is accepted. Addressing PP deputies today, Erbakan said that the first thing to do is to strengthen the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] and to ensure that it is recognized. From the beginning, he said, we have been calling for the existence of two independent separate states on the island. [Begin Erbakan recording] Everybody knows that we never cared for these negotiations from the beginning. We have only one problem in Cyprus and it is to ensure that the TRNC is recognized first by the Muslim countries and then by the entire world, then to help strengthen the TRNC and increase its prosperity. That is our only Cyprus problem. [end recording] Erbakan said that if negotiations must be held, they must be held only after the equality of the two communities is accepted. The issues can be discussed separately in the negotiations, he said. The PP leader pointed out that the United Nations has been defending the same principles for the past 15 years, but that since Butrus-Ghali became secretary general, the UN started to ask for concessions. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish Grand National Assembly rejected this stand both on 10 June and with its resolution yesterday. On the economy, Erbakan said that inflation and foreign debt will increase fast and the growth rate drop. He said that for a solution either early elections or a new coalition is necessary.
