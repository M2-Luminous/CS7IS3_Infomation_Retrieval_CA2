Repairs are under way in these buildings to replace old fire-hazardous partitions. This was reported in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Russian President's Administration. In his opinion "the Russian Federation president's edict has written the final chapter in the epic of the State Duma's accommodations." The lower house of parliament will be temporarily accommodated in the Russian Management Academy in the southwestern part of the capital. The president's administration has counterarguments against protests from the Russian Management Academy collective. The point is that the audit carried out by the Control Administration under the Russian Federation president revealed numerous infringements of tax discipline by the Russian Management Academy leadership. Thus, numerous commercial structures which rent the academy's premises are either not officially registered at all or do not pay taxes to the state budget. As is known, under the Russian Federation president's edict the Russian Management Academy will move to the parliamentary center building on Tsvetnoy Bulvar.
