ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet Hernandez-Baquero was present. [Begin recording] [Gloria] Mr. Crombet, please refer to the results achieved so far here in Granma. It has been learned that some 547.9 tons of fuel have been saved. How would you appraise this? [Crombet] The overall work of the province in the sphere of energy is good, and I must stress the consistency in this area because it involves many areas of work. This task cannot be measured in figures. The work in the sugar industry is outstanding. We can certainly stress the work of the Basic Industry Ministry in electricity; the work of the Agriculture Ministry in agriculture; and as for water resources, this province, especially in the mountains, has great hydroelectric potential in its rivers and dams. Several municipalities in the mountainous region can become self-sufficient in energy, especially if we manage to complete all the minihydroelectric dam projects within a reasonable time, considering the available water resources. [Gloria] What can you tell us about initiatives to conserve fuel in this province? [Crombet] Saving is admirable. We have seen, however, that although potentials are great, there are still some negative points. Not everything is going well or efficiently. But, generally, I can say that the work done in this province is good and that workers here have been working in a continuous and systematic manner. [end recording]
