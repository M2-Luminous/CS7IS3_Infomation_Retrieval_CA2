His main target was the prime minister. Rene Monory likes to act the part of the unbiased observer. Lapses in self-censorship are not unheard of, however. Sometimes his rather grouchy disposition resurfaces. Such was the case yesterday during a press luncheon during which he directed a good many criticisms toward Edouard Balladur's policies. To be fair, Rene Monory does have cause for irritation. The regional decentralization bill scheduled for discussion in early July will not come before the Senate first. While the interior minister had promised publicly that senators would be given the first reading of the bill, Edouard Balladur has now issued a statement to the contrary, which suits National Assembly President Philippe Seguin just fine, but quite infuriated Rene Monory: "This is not a question of pride or precedence between the two assemblies. I just note that the government has not been true to its word," he fumed. Mr. Monory thinks that senators can legitimately expect to be given the first reading of the bill, since after two years of work under the direction of Jean-Francois Poncet (RDE [Democratic and European Rally], Lot-et-Garonne), they had become the bill's true initiators. "The government's attitude has a direct consequence: The bill has now been made toothless or, at the very least, discredited," thundered Rene Monory. "This is a difficult bill, which initially nobody can be pleased with since its positive impact will only be felt in the longer term. Only the Senate can shoulder this kind of unpopularity. National Assembly members are not in a position to do this due to electoral constraints. As a result, most of the effort put into the bill may now go to waste. This was a fine idea which foundered because of too many successive errors." There was more to come, however. When the Senate president feels the need to vent his aggravation, he does it steamroller-style. He went on to criticize the general political climate, which has been getting on his nerves: "It is all getting rather suffocating, is it not? Instead of remaining ostensibly reticent about it, would-be presidential candidates should step forward," he stated, steering well clear of anything remotely resembling a denial of the rumor which would have him enter the presidential race should [former President of the Republic] Giscard throw in the towel. An ambition that may explain his tactical ill-temper. The slight economic recovery which the government is perceiving does not impress him either: "Whatever the hope for renewed growth, no fundamental change will have taken place as far as employment is concerned," he explained. As for the government's employment policies, he feels there is room for improvement: "Obviously, the five-year employment act falls way short of what is needed. Its shortcomings are legion." In short, Rene Monory likes everything in Edouard Balladur's policies, apart from those concerning jobs, the economy, and regional decentralization. By way of conclusion to this onslaught, Rene Monory went for the jugular in a roundabout sort of way, insisting that Edouard Balladur has "the status of a statesman who may possibly lack a little something."
