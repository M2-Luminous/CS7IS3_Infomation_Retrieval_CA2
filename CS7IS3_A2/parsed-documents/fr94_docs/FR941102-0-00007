FR941102-0-00007 FR941102-0-00004 The OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal), on October 15, 1992, seeking public comment on proposed revisions to the OCC's regulations governing the offer and sale of national bank securities (57 FR 47,280). The proposal replaced the OCC's former regulations with a series of regulations based, to the extent appropriate for national banks, on the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (15 U.S.C. 77a through 77aa) and the SEC's rules (17 CFR part 230). The deadline for submitting comments on the proposal originally was December 14, 1992. The OCC extended that deadline to February 1, 1993 (58 FR 4600), after several potential commenters requested additional time to prepare and submit comments. Overview of Final Rule The OCC is issuing this final rule pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1 et seq and 93a. The final rule generally requires national bank securities offering documents to conform to the form for registration that the bank would use if it had to register the securities under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the final rule cross-references a number of provisions of the Securities Act and a number of SEC rules. The OCC's former regulations generally required the disclosure of similar information but in a different format than used by the SEC. And, unlike the SEC, the OCC did not provide for incorporation by reference of filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78a through 78jj). By conforming its securities disclosure rules to those of the SEC, the OCC believes it can reduce significantly unnecessary regulatory burden. Banks, bank counsel, and investors are familiar with SEC disclosure requirements. In addition to being well-known in the marketplace, the interpretation of SEC disclosure requirements is well established and benefits from a significant body of precedent. Moreover, because the OCC rules will now actually reference the SEC rules, rather than parallel or copy them, the OCC rules will automatically remain current. Thus, the OCC's adoption of the SEC registration requirements, while reducing regulatory burden through the elimination of a duplicate (yet sometimes slightly dissimilar) set of disclosure rules, will maintain the quality of disclosure received by investors. Similar to the OCC's former regulations, the final rule generally prohibits the offer or sale of bank-issued securities unless: (1) A registration statement for those securities has been filed with and declared effective by the OCC and the securities are sold through a prospectus that was filed as a part of that registration statement, or (2) the transaction is subject to an exemption. The final rule incorporates various SEC exemptions from registration requirements and adds an exemption for offers and sales of certain large denomination high-grade debt securities to accredited investors. For example, the final rule incorporates through cross-reference the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263), which sets forth the small issues exemption from registration requirements. Regulation A provides a simplified disclosure system for offerings of up to $5 million in any 12-month period. The OCC's former regulations included a similar exemption, but it was limited to offerings of up to $2 million in a 12-month period. The final rule also includes an abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of large denominations of nonconvertible debt to accredited investors (defined in 17 CFR 230.501). This abbreviated registration system reduces unnecessary regulatory burden on offers and sales of such debt in situations where purchasers do not need the more extensive disclosures provided by the full part 16 registration process.
