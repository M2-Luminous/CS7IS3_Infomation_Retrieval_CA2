The economy has experienced a high growth rate this year, the Chinese Business Times newspaper reported on April 9. But inflation has worsened. "The most serious problems we face are inflation and the recession in the State-owned sector," said Wu Jinglian, an economist at the State Council's Development Research Centre. In the first two months of this year, retail prices rose 20 percent over the same period last year, according to the State Statistics Bureau. And rising inflation is destabilizing. For more than 10 years, economic development has been subject to central government policy fluctuations, which have in turn prioritized reform, development and stability. And the economy has done very well encouraged by a policy of speeding up reform, which was affirmed during Deng Xiaoping's South China trip in the spring of 1992. But economic chaos, particularly in the financial sector, has been an unwelcome side effect. In July 1993 central government had to adopt measures to cool down the overheated economy and restore financial order. And since then the stress has been on stability rather than development, as was affirmed at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this March. Price control is essential for stability, said the newspaper. And the government will do all it can to keep inflation below 10 percent this year, three percentage points lower than last year, according to Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Administrative measures have been adopted to control inflation, although the government understands that economic steps hold the key to solving what are, after all, economic problems. Fresh milk has been set at O.9 yuan (10 cents) per kilogram in Beijing. And since this price is 0.2 yuan (2 cents) lower than its real cost, the Beijing Milk Company is providing subsidies of 1.5 million yuan ($170,000) for every 7,500 kilograms produced, according to Xiao Chunyuan, manager of the company. The company only earned 10 million yuan ($1.16 million) profit last year -- 60 percent of which came from its tertiary operations. And after paying out the subsidies and 8.5 million yuan ($980,000) of value-added tax, the company actually earned nothing from its production and sales last year. And the Beijing Milk Company is relatively healthy as State-owned enterprises go. Administrative obligations and the heavy burden of feeding retired and idle employees mean that many State companies are losing money hand over fist. And keeping these companies going is part of the State's stability plan. And inflation is better than unemployment, according to Li Yining, an economist at Beijing University. As long as people are in work, endemic violence and crime can be avoided. Social stability is at stake, he said. And stability does not mean stagnation, according to economists. Modification of the State sector would help the enterprises, said Wu Jinglian. Economist Du Runsheng said that privatizing State enterprises would reduce central government's financial burdens. Luo Zhaohong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the nation's funds should not be wasted on rescuing a sector guided by outworn economic principles. To ease the State's financial burden, about 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) treasury bonds are to be issued this year. The bonds are popular with investors because they pay more than bank savings, and are safer than stock and real estate investments. But problems have occurred with non-governmental fund-raising the first three months of this year, said the newspaper. Many companies took advantage of local development policies. They obtained local authority paper agreements promising favourable business terms, and then used these documents to lend credibility to local newspaper advertisements promising impossible returns. The government has adopted measures to crack down on these fraudsters, said the newspaper.
