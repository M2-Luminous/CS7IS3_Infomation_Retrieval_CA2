In the era of the Soviet Union, communist propaganda would describe similar military units as occupying forces. Even if foreign armed forces were deployed on the territory of certain country, for example Germany, they were financed and provided with all necessities by the state that had sent them, and to which they had pledged allegiance. Americans have always made payments to the governments of those countries in which their Armed Forces have been deployed, even for use of the land. Which military units deployed on Ukrainian soil pledged allegiance to the USSR, and are still living according to the laws of the deceased Union? No, this is not the Black Sea Fleet which has been proclaimed Ukraine's property following Russia's example, which has appropriated all former fleets of the USSR and property of units that were deployed outside the borders of the former Soviet Union. God bless the fleet, if no responsible official in Ukraine wants to even hear about its problems. Yet, the subject of this article is different. This is the Vinnytsya Rocket Army, the weapons and property of which belong to Ukraine according to agreements between Russia and Ukraine, which have also been recognized by the international community. The paradox of the situation lies in the fact that missiles with nuclear warheads remain in the hands of those who continue to serve the nonexisting totalitarian state. This can be confirmed by the fact that military leaders of the Army refuse to make officers and warrant officers take the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and fail to sign contracts with those who consider themselves servicemen of the Russian Army. Even today, symbols of the former Soviet Union remain on the headquarters and barracks of certain units, and officers and warrant officers wear uniforms with emblems of the nonexistent Soviet Army. Perhaps they all expect that the past will return? Exactly the opposite. This refuge of communist ideology is preserved thanks to the political speculations and intrigues of the Army leaders and top officials in divisions. They slyly gamble on today's hardships of officers and warrant officers, comparing Russians and Ukrainians. Each time the issue of administering the oath of allegiance to Ukraine arises, insinuations of violating the rights of Russian servicemen appear, and rumors are spread that as soon as they take the oath they will have to return to Russia. As a matter of fact, Russian troops are not going to leave until they sell the apartments provided them by the Defense Ministry. They are not pricing them too low, either: A one-bedroom apartment costs no less than $5,000. Let us figure the losses for our state. They curse Ukraine and threaten to drop from service, they do not leave their apartments, and they continue to consume their food rations and buy dollars with the money they receive from the Defense Ministry of Ukraine. This is the life of Russian soldiers according to the oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union, and nobody knows exactly who they serve. However, the last statement is not completely true, since at the beginning of November, the defense minister of the Russian Federation inspected the combat readiness of the units and conducted a training exercise for commanders of the Rocket Army of Ukraine. How can one understand this? What will the commander in chief of the Ukraine's Armed Forces say on this occasion?
