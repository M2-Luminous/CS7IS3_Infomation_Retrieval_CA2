[Correspondent Matskaviecus] Yegor Gaydar at his news conference today categorically denied rumors that he had supposedly called on the West not to give financial aid while Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin are in power. The former vice premier stated that the present government has acted erroneously and dishonorably by promising industry money which it is not in a position to pay. The Russia's Choice leader believes that this year's budget is in need of major changes. Gaydar also dislikes the excessive growth of expenditure on the state apparatus and the method of financing the provinces which in the future will lead to discrimination in favor of Russia's northern regions at the expense of the southern regions. Incidentally, the budget for 1994, according to Deputy Pochinok, who was also present at the news conference, will be adopted at the earliest only in June. Today, the head of Russia's Choice gave a dignified reply to the premier's fairly harsh words concerning heads of laboratories who jump into ministries, after whose tenure of administration the country is shaking as if in a fever. [Begin Gaydar recording] Laboratory head is the only scholarly level which I jumped over. I went straight from being the head of research workers to being appointed institute director. The only thing I can say in regret is that he [Premier Chernomyrdin] evidently did not manage to share his ideas with me about laboratory heads and ministers when he was working under my command as part of the Russian Government. [end recording] [Matskaviecus] The Russia's Choice faction will support the idea of a memorandum on concord, Gaydar said, only if it is convinced that it is not just another fig leaf covering up the political ambitions of individual leaders. Commenting on Nixon's visit and his choice of people to meet, Gaydar thought that the former U.S. president simply did not have a real opportunity to evaluate the sincerity of one political leader or another. Gaydar himself did not bother to meet Nixon today. [Begin Gaydar recording] Yes, I postponed our meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon in order to make a further study of the situation.
