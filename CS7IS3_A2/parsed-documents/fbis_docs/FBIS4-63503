It threatens to use force, including military force," says an appeal of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea, which was adopted today. It is addressed to the United Nations, the UN Security Council, the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the president of the Russian Federation, the Russian Federal Assembly, and the people of Ukraine. The document says, among other things, that "the Crimean Supreme Council adopted the law on restoring the constitutional foundations of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea on the basis of a poll taken among the Republic's citizens. This means that from now on the authority in economy, education, culture, and local self-government will be executed entirely by the people of Crimea." The Crimean parliamentarians think that "not a single item in the Constitution of the Crimean Republic infringes upon the territorial integrity of the Ukraine, nor does it lead to any revision of the existing state border. Chapter 3, Article 9 of the Constitution states: "The Crimean Republic forms part of Ukrainian and determines its relations with that state on the basis of a treaty and agreements." The Crimean Supreme Council confirms its adherence to the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Crimean Supreme Council expressed the hope that the international community will not permit lawless acts on the part of Ukraine's organs of state power nor any violation of the rights and freedoms proclaimed by the "Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man."
