We are the only ones entitled to defend the cause. We are being attacked, our villages, cities, and institutions are being occupied, and all we have contributed to the Yemeni unity and homeland is being destroyed. Whoever started the war should bear the responsibility for that destruction, for breaking the constitutional legitimacy, and for what happened to the country. ['Awn] You said that what actually exists determines world recognition. What is the reality today? [Muhammad] The war is entering its fourth week. Whoever said that this war will be settled within days has miscalculated. The war will continue for a long time and will give rise to other options. Hence, we still warn, demand, and raise our voices with an appeal to all to stop this war. ['Awn] Aden repeatedly implied that there are Iraqi POW's. It spoke yesterday about chemical weapons that Sanaa is using. Is there an Iraqi involvement and what is the official stance in Aden? [Muhammad] I regret to say, away from political oneupmanship or attempts to gain from this or that issue, that Iraq is involved. The evidence is found in the stance its Arab League representative has taken and the stance assumed by the Ba'th Party and represented in the statement the party's national command in Baghdad has issued. This is a clear sign of full bias toward the military action and the northern troops' invasion of the southern and eastern regions of the country.
