A source at the Russian Foreign Ministry has reported the signing of a trilateral pact on military cooperation between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. This plan to form a strong military coalition in Central Asia came as a surprise to Russia. According to available information, even Boris Gromov, Deputy Defense Minister of Russia, who visited Bishkek recently, was not informed about the treaty signing. During the talks, Subanov expressed his preparedness to sign a bilateral treaty with Russia. The parties agreed to begin immediate preparations of the documents. These documents will be signed during Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's visit to Kyrgyzstan in late February.
