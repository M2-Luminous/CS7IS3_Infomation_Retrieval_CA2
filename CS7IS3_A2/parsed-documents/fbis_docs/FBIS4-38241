Northern forces since late Monday were seen to have advanced five kilometers (three miles) south to the edge of Bi'r Nasir, the site of the water plant which southern officers said has already been destroyed. The advance to Bi'r Nasir, 15 kilometers north of here, followed the north's entry Saturday into Aden's western suburbs where it gained control of the city's power station and cut the road to the oil refinery. A southern officer told AFP that 1,000 shells were fired during the advance. Hospital officials said that one civilian was killed and 18 wounded overnight in shelling and rocketing of the northern suburbs and that three children died of dehydration. The city has been totally without running water since Sunday after a few days of availability due to partial repairs to the water plant which was first hit at the start of the month. Southern forces dug trenches and built sand barriers at the approaches to the city, withdrew artillery to the suburbs and the city center, and deployed Soviet-built surface-to-air missiles around the city. Several rockets were fired at the city's television station but daily programing had not started and it was not clear if it had been damaged. Aden Radio has been off the air since northern forces entered the western suburbs on Saturday and residents were glued to foreign stations. The breakaway southern leadership meanwhile urged the international community to stop talking and come to Aden's rescue, implicitly criticizing the slowness of UN efforts to end the fighting in Yemen. Five ceasefires have collapsed since the United Nations Security Council on June 1 adopted a resolution calling for an immediate truce and sending a special envoy on a 10-day mission earlier this month to set it up. Each side accused the other of firing the first shot. The United Nations was meanwhile considering another draft resolution. "The civilized world is not reacting and is holding only consultations while the bloodthirsty Sanaa regime scorns UN resolutions, pursues its bombardment of Aden and its repression of the (south) Yemeni people," the leadership said. In a statement carried by the official news media here, it said southerners were determined to "defend their land and their honor and to resist the occupation." It issued an "appeal to the international community to stand by the people and save the city of Aden." The statement denounced "Sanaa's determination to demolish the homes of Adenites and deprive them of water," accusing the northerners of taking as hostage women and children over six years old. "Who would agree to union with such a regime," the leadership asked. Southern Yemen declared a separate state on May 21 two weeks after war broke out between the former Marxist South Yemen and tribal North Yemen, which had formed a fragile four-year union. Northern forces are led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southern troops by his southern rival and former vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid.
