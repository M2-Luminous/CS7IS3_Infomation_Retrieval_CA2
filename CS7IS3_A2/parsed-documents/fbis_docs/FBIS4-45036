This is one of the most important conditions contained in the 10 import-financing measures that went into effect upon the dissolution of the Ad Hoc Committee. But it turns out that at least 450 private enterprises, despite the fact they are investing in so-called priority sectors or import substitution, will not be able to benefit from these finance modalities. As things stand now, they find themselves seriously indebted due to foreign exchange losses occasioned by the devaluation of the dinar. Exchange losses result from fluctuations in the value of the national currency against hard currencies. In the case of Algeria, the problem for private enterprises first arose in 1991, when the government of Mr. Mouloud Hamrouche devalued the dinar, and no concrete solution has yet been found. The results have been catastrophic for private-sector enterprises, since they have been obliged to pay back three, four, even five times the amount of loans extended to them. The situation has been such that a number of companies filed bankruptcy. Public-sector enterprises, though hit equally hard by the problem, were given more support. Several tens of billions of dinars were injected into them to make up for their losses, while nothing was done to cushion the shock for those in the private sector. This dichotomy--which national authorities deny but that is nonetheless a reality--has aroused the wrath of private investors. With the installation of Mr. Ghozali as head of government to replace Mr. Hamrouche, private entrepreneurs began to hope for a final resolution of the question. Mr. Ghozali had promised to deal with the issue by instituting the famous tripartite commission (government-National Union of Algerian Workers-employers). But things dragged on, and the problem was left hanging. Mr. Belaid Abdesselam, Ghozali's successor, made a similar promise on 6 February 1993 in a meeting with employer representatives. But while exchange losses of statal enterprises were completely resorbed as part of public-sector financial reform, the estimated 3 billion dinars in losses sustained by the private enterprises was ignored. In late 1993 another head of government, Mr. Redha Malek, proposed a "solution" that in fact would have served only to aggravate matters and bury private enterprises deeper in debt: a rescheduling of debt service over a 7-year period with interest set at 11.5 percent. This solution was never implemented, though, since the companies concerned rejected it. So four governments have come and gone while the exchange rate problem remains. Why? The CAP [Algerian Employers Confederation] monitoring committee, which was instituted recently to find a solution to the problem and met yesterday at the Hotel Aurassi, says quite simply: "There is a calculated campaign to destroy the private manufacturing sector. It would take only a single decision to save it, as was the case with our Tunisian and Moroccan neighbors, but it seems no one wants to do so. Paralyzing the private sector means paralyzing the country's progress toward economic opening, something that some decisionmakers do not want." The committee, which represents about 450 enterprises employing 20,000-25,000 workers, is calling once again on authorities to come up with a formula that would permit all economic operators to integrate exchange risk into their production and investment decisions. In that context, the committee is asking for an unconditional payoff of the exchange losses, with the resulting obligations to be rescheduled through primary banks at concessional interest rates. Will their appeal will heard this time? Will the issue at last be resolved? At this point, it is up to the government of Mr. Sifi to answer such questions, for the future of several hundred enterprises and several thousand employees is at stake. Another issue up for decision is whether to end once and for all the public-private-sector dichotomy that has become an integral part of our economic system.
