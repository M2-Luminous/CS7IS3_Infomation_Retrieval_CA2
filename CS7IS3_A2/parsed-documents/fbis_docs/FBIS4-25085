The agricultural problem has already drawn the attention of society as a whole. The party Central Committee and the State Council have called two meetings on rural work within a short time. Add to this the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, which was held before the 14th National Congress of the CPC and was devoted specifically to the study of agriculture and rural Problems, and we have the issue being raised three times. This indicates that the Party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about the problems in agriculture and rural China. In recent years, with the development of a market economy, some new situations and new problems have occurred in rural work. Some call these contradictions at a deeper level; others call them crises. I believe that, at the current stage, many significant signs of danger have indeed appeared in the countryside. If handled properly, the problems can be resolved. If not solved in a timely fashion, then problems may occur which have serious consequences. Since the rural reform was implemented after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, the development trend of China's agriculture has been very good. Farm products have increased on a large scale; farmers' income has risen substantially; township and town enterprises have sprung up as a new force; and the construction of small rural towns has also seen substantial development. Despite a few years of stagnation, the development trend, on the whole, has been good. Production development brought on by rural reform has enabled us to stockpile over 300 billion jin of grain and a large quantity of cotton reserves. The increase in output of various agricultural products has provided ample raw material for the development of textile and other light industries, and township and town enterprises have created an output value of 2.9 trillion yuan. Both rural work and rural production have seen great achievements. However, some new contradictions and new problems, or signs of danger, which have been exposed in recent years should draw our attention. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said long ago that the 1990's will either see no problems, or, if there are problems, they will be in agriculture. What, then, are the main problems faced by agriculture? First, the most important manifestation is a drop in the production enthusiasm of farmers, especially the enthusiasm for farming. When the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output was first implemented, farmer enthusiasm was very high, and the agricultural productive forces, held back for many years, were suddenly released. Hence the great achievement that was obtained. The drop in farmer enthusiasm in recent years cannot but catch our attention and alert us. The most active element in the rural productive forces is the farmer. If the farmers are not enthusiastic, how can agriculture move forward? Why then has farmer enthusiasm dropped? There are basically two reasons. The first is the slow increase in farmer income. During the two years of 1988 and 1989, farmer income saw negative growth; in 1990 and 1991 there was some increase; and during the recent two years it has again increased, albeit at the slow speed of 2 percent. The fall in farmer income has affected the material interests of the farmers, the urban/rural income gap has widened, and farmers have felt it very unfair. The second is the substantial reduction in farmland. This includes two factors: One is that development zones have occupied large plots of land, and the other is that, because the comparative benefits of farming have fallen, farmers have been unwilling to till the land and leave some land uncultivated, making China's traditional contradiction between a large population and the shortage of land even more acute. Second, the decrease or slow increase in agricultural output. Although last year grain output exceeded the 900 billion jin mark, many have expressed doubts about this because the cultivated area dropped last year, sales of chemical fertilizer were down, and grain prices went up. Therefore, although one can say that grain output broke a historical record, whether farm products can steadily increase still remains a very worrisome problem in the national economy. The output of cotton was over 47 million dan, while demand was 80 to 90 million dan. In addition, the output of sugar-bearing crops dropped, and oil-bearing crops were also in short supply. Another phenomenon worth noting is that, in the past, grain from the south was shipped north, but now grain from the north is being shipped south. Guangdong may purchase over 10 billion jin of grain this year (for human consumption, animal feed, and industrial use) this year. Third, the reduction of agricultural input. According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, at its highest point China's agricultural basic construction input occupied 10.3 percent of national basic construction investment (1978). Since rural reform, the investment scale for agriculture has been continuously depressed. During 1987 and 1988 it slowed to 3.3 percent, and, while 1989 saw a slight increase to over 4 percent, last year it dropped again to 2.2 percent. The government's input in agriculture has not been reduced; it is mainly that local input has been reduced. If the relevant departments continue to neglect this issue, the input in agriculture may continue to drop. Agriculture is also an industry, and without input there will be no output. Fourth, the gap between industry and agriculture has widened; the income gap between urban and rural residents has exacerbated; and the gaps between the eastern and coastal regions and the central and western regions have expanded. It should be pointed out that uneven development in urban and rural areas and in the eastern and western parts of the country is normal. Only through the relatively faster development of the east can the comprehensive development of the entire country be brought about. However, a disproportionate development of industry and agriculture will inevitably affect the entire national economy. Without developing agriculture, the whole economy cannot develop in a healthy manner. History has already given us good experience in this area. Now the disparity between the development of industry and agriculture has advanced to the brink of danger. If we continue to avoid adjusting it, and if agriculture continues to be denied real support, the entire national economy will be unable to bear the burden. The gap between agriculture and industry has expanded. Last year, urban per capita income grew 10.3 percent, while in the countryside it only grew 3.3 percent. The income growth ratio between urban and rural residents is 2.8 to 1. The ratio before reform was 2.4 to 1, but, some time after reform, it was reduced to 1.7 to 1. Now the gap between urban and rural areas has expanded again, and farmers feel it is very unfair. Recently, a Shanxi farmer wrote a letter to say that 2 jin of rice can only trade for 1 Hongtashan cigarette and 2 jin of wheat trade for 1 jin of chemical fertilizer. The scissor gap between prices of industrial goods agricultural products is becoming larger and larger. Fifth, the yearly expanding migrant labor tide reflects that the employment situation for rural surplus labor has already become very acute. In recent years the tidal wave of migrant laborers has risen ever higher. According to estimates, China's rural surplus labor force has already reached 130 million people. Several dozen million people traveling outside their provinces have a major impact upon society. This is the result of the rural employment problem. After liberation, China practiced a residence registration management system which tied farmers firmly to the land. Farmers had no freedom to go out to seek a living. Now there is a surplus labor force, and in many places it is "one month for the Lunar New Year Festival, three months for farming, and eight months with nothing to do." Since reform and opening up, especially under the onslaught of the market economy, those farmers who cannot find any occupation in their localities leave their home and land for the big cities and open coastal regions. Since 1989, the scale of migrant laborers has increased annually, and by last year the transprovincial migrant population exceeded 20 million. A few years ago this problem was still neglected and people had an incorrect understanding of the phenomenon. Some people tended to view migrant laborers as "aimless vagrants" and wanted to block them or even to use an iron broom to sweep them from the cities. Today the situation is better. Prime Minister Li Peng has cleared the name of migrant laborers in his report to this year's National People's Congress, pointing out that the movement of farmers is the flow of history and an unavoidable trend of economic development. The migrant labor problem has begun to draw attention from various quarters, and the people's understanding of this issue is becoming unified. Sixth, the contingent of agricultural science and technology workers is shaky and unstable. It should be pointed out that scientific and technological progress and popularization have played an important role in China's agricultural development. According to estimates, the role of the science and technology factor in agricultural growth has been approximately 40 percent. During the past two years, however, due to the impact of the market economy and the trend of increasing earnings, the contingent of rural science and technology personnel has become unstable. Many people have entered the business world to earn money, and some technicians have switched to other fields. This, too, is a danger sign for agricultural production. I have listed the danger signs above. On the whole, the most serious problem is the drop in productive enthusiasm among the farmers. Next is the migrant laborer problem. If this problem is not solved properly, the rural surplus labor force will not be able to find an outlet, the countryside will not be able to realize a relatively well-off standard of living, and modernization will not come about in China. That the aforementioned problems have developed to such an extent today is perhaps related to our failure to catch up with the study of agricultural policies. The forces studying agricultural policies are currently scattered. We should concentrate our forces in studying the new problems and new situations occurring in rural work. Many new phenomena and new problems have appeared in the countryside, and these all require that us to do in-depth studies and sum them up in a timely fashion. Danger signs have already appeared in agriculture. Fortunately, the party Central Committee and the State Council are already paying attention to and taking measures to solve these problems. Within a period of less than six months, two meetings on rural work have been called and some policy measures have been adopted. The key issue right now is implementation and execution. One should say that the policy measures adopted by the central government are good, but that execution and implementation measures are weak. So, for example, in the end how much diesel oil for farm use or chemical fertilizer should be supplied at fixed state prices? The central government's determination is great, but the execution at the actual grass-roots level will always be watered down. At present, I think the most worrisome problem is that the central policy measures cannot be implemented. This is the greatest problem. One of the key reasons why the central government's policy and measures cannot be implemented is structural. The central authorities have held several good meetings, but after the meetings there needs to be a forceful authoritative organ which can take charge of coordination and ensure implementation. All the decisions made in the previous meetings on rural work have been very good and very valuable. If they had all been actually implemented, China's agriculture would not have gone wrong. The current situation, in which each department does as it likes according to its own interests, should on no account be allowed to continue. Chen Xiwen, director of the Rural Development Research Department of the State Council Development Research Center: "The Central Government's Polities and Measures Are Good, But It Is Difficult To Implement Them at the Local and Departmental Levels" The importance of agriculture and the need to pay attention to the farmers' problems have been elaborated many times during recent years in the speeches of leading comrades, in newspapers and periodicals, and in documents. But many agricultural and rural problems remain, and people are still not assured about the future of agriculture. Where lies the problem? Investigation and study have not been conducted sufficiently or thoroughly; the basic situation of agriculture and farmers is unclear; and there has been a delayed reaction to major rural problems. Currently, one outstanding problem is that some leading organizations tend to react rather slowly in dealing with major rural problems. For example, although the problem of the farmers' burden has been talked about a great deal and much attention has been paid to it, many places still restrict their focus to increasing or decreasing farm products when judging the agricultural situation. Therefore, these people feel the situation is not bad, based on the increase in the supply of farm products in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Thus, they have actually neglected a series of serious problems brought about by the slowdown in the farmers' income growth or the reduction of income. This situation has caught the attention of the party Central Committee and the State Council. Actually, the burden problem is the other side of the income problem. If income rises rapidly, then a slight burden is no big deal. The main problem is that income has been rising slowly for three or four years in a row, and thus the burden seems particularly acute. For example, the increase in farmer income recovered a bit in 1992 and reached 5.9 percent. This, perhaps, caused some leading departments to lower their guard, thinking that the problem had been solved. Actually they did not see that, in 1992, the economy developed rapidly due to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches during his southern trip, especially in the southeastern coastal regions, and that there was a great deal of rapid growth in township and town enterprises. The 5.9 percent increase of 1992 actually covered up a great income discrepancy among farmers of different regions. I did some analysis of farmer income in 1991 and 1992. In more than half the provinces and municipalities, farmer income dropped. Even though 1991 saw a 2 percent growth, 1992 saw a 5.9 percent growth, and the national average was rising, in reality farmer income in more than half the provinces and municipalities was dropping. Seen from the perspective of the entire country, the problem of adequate food and clothing has been solved. After basically solving this problem, however, the supply of farm products is still an important problem. On the whole, in evaluating the situation of the entire countryside, the index carrying the greatest overall weight should be farmer income. If farmer income does not increase, then the product increases you want cannot, in reality, be realized continuously. The situation in recent years reflects this. As Comrade Wang Yuzhao said just now, the lack of in-depth investigation and study causes the response to these major rural problems to be delayed. Meetings are held, documents are issued, and understandings reach the higher levels, but if you want people to make real sacrifices, nobody will. The problem of "slogan agriculture" is far from being resolved. A very important problem now is that rural policies cannot be implemented. According to my information, the rural work conference held in October last year issued a document covering a dozen or so concrete policies, the majority of which have not been implemented. For example, central document no. 11 issued in 1993 says that the banking system should issue an additional 22.5 billion yuan in loans for agriculture. By the time of the rural work conference this year, when we were again drafting a document, we saw people from the Agricultural Bank and asked about that 22.5 billion yuan. The reply was: The notice they received was that the entire 22.5 billion yuan was only the scale of credit, not the actual funds, so no money had been issued. There are many similar stories. I remember that funds were very tight last year. The document sent to central leaders for discussion had brackets after each policy, listing how much money was to be involved in each project. All the various department heads discussed it and acknowledged their responsibilities. Then the brackets were taken out, because listing concrete amounts of money in a central government document looked too trivial. The result was that, after the document was issued, not a penny materialized. Another problem with agriculture is that, after the grain price fluctuations of last year, the party Central Committee and the State Council were very concerned and made a whole series of arrangements and held a series of meetings on stabilizing grain prices and on the shopping basket project. The purpose was to solve the effective supply problem. An outstanding problem in solving the effective supply problem is to keep an ample supply of means of production. However, looking at the current supply of means of production, the problem is still very acute. If this problem is not solved, then I think it will be very difficult for agriculture to recover and develop this year. According to the fertilizer supply situation of previous years, each year we have to import 5 or 6 million tonnes of chemical fertilizer before the year's end, when the current year's use of fertilizer is finished, to prepare for the spring plowing. Last year there was a shortage of over 2 million tonnes. So, during this spring plowing, when the spring wheat is sown, there will be no chemical fertilizer, and we may have to sow seeds by themselves. Another problem is that, due to the impending readjustment in this year's foreign currency exchange and oil prices, all departments were watching and would not make a move. It was not until February that the Planning Commission delegated quotas for the import of chemical fertilizers and called for the signing of contracts during the first half of the year for the importation of 6.2 million tonnes of chemical fertilizer. So I went to inquire. By March 31, order forms had only been filled for 322,000 tonnes, equivalent to 5 percent of the quota. Judging from the current situation of the order, only 122,000 tonnes of imported fertilizer will arrive before April 30. Up to now the first half year's imported fertilizer is still unaccounted for. In mid-February the State Council issued an emergency telegram asking local governments to organize chemical fertilizers. But when it comes to execution, it ends up like this. What is the reason for this? The Agricultural Materials Company says one of the major problems they encounter is the shortage of supplies. Compared with the same period last year, the first quarter lacks over 6 million tonnes of fertilizer. The chemical fertilizer for the spring plowing in northeastern China actually has no guarantees. Now we are solving the spring plowing problem for the south, and there are still no guarantees. First, supplies are extremely rare, and, second, we must deal with the prices of the means of production. There is no way to manage, and nobody has come up with a good method. Let us take the price of urea, a chemical fertilizer, for example. We will only talk about the prices allowed and fixed by the state. Before October 1, 1992 it was 538 yuan/tonne. The price adjustment of October 1, 1992 was approved by the State Council, adjusting it to 660 yuan/tonne. By March 1993, only 5 months later, again with the approval of the State Council, the hidden subsidy was changed to an open subsidy and volumes were kept the same, while prices were liberalized. The factory price permitted by the State Council was 1000 yuan/tonne, and the highest retail price was 1200 yuan/tonne. Thus, before October 1, 1992 the price was only 538 yuan/tonne, while prices after March 1993 were 1200 yuan/tonne. In less than a year and a half, the price had more than doubled. What compensation has been given to the farmers? On March 23, a national conference of managers from means of production companies was held. The factory price of major chemical fertilizers by then had actually reached 1100-1150 yuan/ton, representing another rise of 100-150 yuan. The price-limiting measure had not been canceled but prices had, in fact, gone up again. These problems have all been emphasized, everyone claims to be very concerned, and many documents have been issued. But when it comes to the execution of concrete guidelines, then there is no well-thought plan as to how to execute them, who is responsible, or how to solve problems. For example, with chemical fertilizer in very short supply and its price soaring this year, the means of production companies also find themselves in a difficult position. Should they buy or shouldn't they, and, if they import at such high prices, wouldn't the farmers curse them? It is not clear who is ultimately responsible for problems like this or who one should go to when problems arise. These are rather major problems, and more concrete problems are innumerable. It boils down to "slogan agriculture." When you really want people to make sacrifices, nobody will. The supply of agricultural products is the farmers' responsibility, and the prices of agricultural products are the farmers' responsibility. Just how much can the farmers bear? It is only fair to have the "three parties share it." I believe that, under the present situation, when the rural economy is facing so many difficulties, we must persist in the goal of reform. This is also an important issue worthy of note and serious study. When supplies are short, should we put them under unified control or liberalize them? There is currently great controversy over this issue. Actually, past experience has already told us: The more you put under unified control, the less you have; the less you have, the more you put under unified control. This is a vicious circle. Whatever is liberalized increases. Of course things are not that simple; for example, cotton output dropped last year. Here there is indeed the problem of guaranteeing a basic production capability. If we can't guarantee a basic production capability, there will be a major disaster. Even if supply is sufficient but prices are high, there will still be disaster. The government has to consider all these aspects. But I believe that, if we burden farmers with both the guarantee of supply and the guarantee of prices, then the farmers' burdens are too heavy. Society has many departments and many people -- what are the others doing to help? If the farmers have to be responsible for the supply of farm products as well as their price level, it becomes too difficult. The fluctuation of grain prices last autumn actually sent a signal to society. We now face a choice: If we do not raise grain prices, supplies will decrease and the farmers' enthusiasm will be affected; to motivate the farmers, prices will have to be slightly higher. The burden at least should be shared by the various groups of society. The issue of grain price reform was raised at least seven or eight years ago -- when it was said that the consequence of price rises should be born by three parties: farmers, urban residents, and government finance. Currently, many of the measures make it look like farmers have to bear all the burdens. This may lead to trouble. The measures that we are currently adopting to revive grain and cotton production so that the government can secure grain and cotton resources must take farmers into consideration. We must not make the old mistake of wanting the horse to run fast while not letting it eat grass. Wanting them to furnish supplies without raising prices is very difficult. For example, when we went out to investigate at the beginning of the year, the farmers thought the average price of 0.5 yuan a jin was acceptable. The problem now is that people, whether they are farmers or county and township cadres, don't know that you are going to come out with a measure which will adjust oil prices later on. That is why they feel the price is acceptable. However, by the time the price of oil is raised and the summer grain has not yet been harvested, they will surely not accept the price of 0.5 yuan/jin anymore. If they do not accept it, what measures will the government take to control the supply of grain? I think we need to seriously consider this kind of problem. At the rural work conference, it was decided that the new price of crude oil will come into effect on 1 May, but the farm-use diesel price will remain unchanged between 1 May and the end of June. This is to say, it is still necessary to watch the grain price situation. By postponing the change for two months, we will be able to take other measures if grain prices continue to rise. In a word, wait and see. I did some major calculations. For example, I discussed things with people from the means of production company at the beginning of April. They believe that, because of the price change in chemical fertilizer, farmers will have to pay 11 billion yuan more. The Ministry of Agriculture estimated that if the state fixed price for oil is canceled this year, farmers will have to pay 13.2 billion yuan more. Added together, farmers will have to pay 24.2 billion yuan more. It can also be clearly worked out how much grain purchases will compensate farmers. Say we purchase 130 billion jin of grain, and the price of each jin of grain rises by 0.1 yuan. This means that 18 billion yuan more can be given to the farmers. If we can harvest 70 million dan of cotton and if the cotton price is raised by 90 yuan a dan, farmers will get 6.3 billion yuan more. These two add up to 24.3 billion yuan. This implies that you will pay 24.3 billion more to the farmers, who will in turn have 24.2 billion more in expenses. The difference is 100 million yuan, which means that each farmer will get 0.1 yuan more, while prices of other goods continue to rise. If this is the situation, then the farmers will have no enthusiasm. Under the current circumstances, a visible problem in grain and cotton, especially groceries, is that the prices at which farmers sell are not high; it is the difference between wholesale and retail that is really large. Therefore, it doesn't solve the problem at all if you just tell the farmers to sell cheaply. The price of spinach doubles between Dazhongsi and Zhongguancun, and the farmers actually don't get much benefit from it. Therefore, the government needs to come up with reform methods, specifically, more methods to perfect the market. If we only take measures to coerce the farmers, we may end up in failure, and price fluctuations will be even greater. Keeping the prices of farm products stable will serve the purpose of maintaining social stability this year. If, however, the method we adopt in fact offends the farmers, then the goal of social stability will by no means be realized. As long as farm products can increase, the farmers' income can grow; as long as township and town enterprises can develop, the farmers' employment problem can be resolved -- this traditional way of thinking needs to be revisited. Currently, on one hand, there is a good situation in the countryside, while, on the other, problems abound. We must broaden our minds in reform and must realistically admit that the many problems we encounter now were not only unresolvable before reform, but the experience accumulated in the 15 years of reform is also insufficient to solve them. We need to create new methods and further emancipate our minds. Two examples demonstrate that our ways of thinking are very restricted concerning the two problems. First, according to the traditional way of thinking, as long as basic farm products increase, the farmers' income will grow. This method of thinking was actually shattered already several years ago. Sometimes grain production increases, but farmer income not only does not rise; it drops in some places. The method we adopt to increase farmer income requires serious thinking and study, with further emancipated minds. The second challenge is that township and town enterprises have sprung up since 1984, and many comrades, including myself, thought that, as long as township and town enterprises developed, we would be able to solve the employment problem for farmers. But in the 1990's, it doesn't seem that way at all. Township and town enterprise output value has grown extremely rapidly, but the tidal wave of migrant laborers has also been rising. Township and town enterprises cannot take in so many labor hands. The farmer employment problem and income problem are linked. Thus, any new increase in farm products alone cannot increase farmer income, and township and town enterprises bring only limited job opportunities for farmers. So with so many farmers, how do we solve the employment and income problems? This is an issue requiring serious thought for the remaining years of this century. To a certain extent, the increase in the supply of farm products during 1979-1984, the continuous increase in subsidies, and the rising prices have represented small-scale fix-it measures. So has the practice of allowing farmers to run township and town enterprises on the basis of one household, village, or township. It seems that, in order to appropriately solve this problem, one must consider farmer employment and the industrialization, urbanization, and modernization processes throughout society as an integrated whole. This is a consensus among Chinese and foreign scholars. The employment problem facing Chinese farmers is indeed the number one difficult problem facing global economics. The employment of several hundred million people is no trifling business. If it is solved well, the country will be prosperous and the people will be strong; if not, there is the possibility that the country will fall into chaos. Therefore, our minds need further emancipation in this respect. Chen Jiyuan, director of the Rural Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "Several Problems in the Rural Areas Which Urgently Need To Be Studied at Present" Fluctuations occurred in last year's grain prices, beginning in the south and then spreading to the north, and this caught the attention of the party Central Committee and the relevant departments. To address this situation, the central meeting on rural work held this March raised the slogan of three stabilizations and two balances, i.e. realizing "the stabilization of cultivated area, output, and grain reserves and the balance of total volume and different regions." In order to realize this goal, the conference put forward a leading-cadre responsibility system and said that cultivating grain and cotton was the sacred responsibility and duty of farmers. Currently, all these suggestions are necessary and correct, but, from a long-term point of view, in order to solve the problems of China's agriculture, one must treat the symptoms along with the causes and solve the problems from the roots. That is to say, one must solve problems by raising agricultural efficiency and increasing farmer income. Otherwise, no matter what harsh administrative measures are adopted, the problems facing the Chinese countryside and agriculture cannot be fundamentally solved. How do we fundamentally solve our problems in agriculture? I believe that we must first study and clarify the following questions by combining theory with practice. Our attitude toward the farmers: In solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems we must first consider the farmers' wallets. Under the planned economic system, for many years the state's view of farmers was mainly to request grain and cotton from them, while the farmers, based or their own needs, wanted to increase their income. This contradiction existed for a long time. Formerly, under the people's communes system, this contradiction was hidden by the system of everybody eating from the same big pot. After practicing the contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, farmers became commodity producers. This contradiction became even more acute after the complete switchover to a market economy. Up to now, however, this problem has not been solved very well. For example, solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems is a key component of guaranteeing supplies and curbing inflation. This is, of course, correct. But the purpose in solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems should not only be to guarantee supplies, curb inflation, and maintain urban stability, but should also increase the income of farmers who produce the grain and vegetables, letting them obtain some economic benefit. If we only were to solve the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems but paid no attention to the problem of the farmers' wallets, then in the long run, the shopping-basket will not be secure. In grasping agriculture, we should not only think about what to take from farmers but should also think about what the farmers get. If farmers increase their income by producing grain and vegetables and the wallet problem is solved, I believe the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems will also be solved naturally. The criterion for assessing the grass-roots cadres' work is the output value or the quantity of farm products. We have discussed the importance of agriculture for many years. We have continued talking about it in the past two years, and many words have been said about the correct understanding of it. It should be pointed out that Chairman Mao had already elucidated the importance of agriculture in "On the Ten Major Relationships." For example, we cannot take the Soviet road by working farmers too hard, nor can we ask the horse to run fast but eat no grass, and so on. In the early 1960's, after some problems had occurred nationwide, the party Central Committee reiterated the fundamental position of agriculture quite comprehensively. By 1978, when the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was held and the national economy was on the brink of collapse, from an economic perspective, it was important to solve the agricultural problem. The plenary session stated that it was necessary to stabilize one end first and let farmers rest and build up strength. Only by stabilizing the farmers can the whole country be stabilized. In recent years we have continued to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee made the decision on emphasizing rural and agricultural work. It was a very correct decision. After that, between last October and March this year, the central authorities called two meetings on rural work. One cannot say that we are not concerned about agriculture. However, while the central authorities have repeatedly emphasized the importance of agriculture and have made so many decisions about it, why is it so difficult to implement these decisions? Where lies the root of the problem? Perhaps one has to seek it in structure. I believe that using gross output value as a major criterion for evaluating local cadres is a cause. Our party's strategic goal of development has already been decided. The party Central Committee has made a decision to quadruple the GNP by the end of the century. But, in evaluating departments, local governments, and cadres, I think if we only judge them according to the growth rate, especially the growth rate of gross output value, this will inevitably lead to departments and local cadres paying attention to only those industries with high output value while neglecting those industries with low output value. Agriculture is an industry with great social benefit but low output value and low comparative efficiency. It is therefore very easily put in the most neglected position. If these problems are not solved, the problem of neglecting agriculture will be difficult to solve. We now include agricultural production as part of the criteria for evaluating achievements in cadres' official careers. Has this been implemented? It should be seriously checked. In the past, the evaluation of industrial enterprises always took gross output value as the central index. Now, changes have occurred through reform, but we still lack a scientific system for evaluating the work of local governments. Studies should be made on this topic. Otherwise, we may talk about the importance of addressing this issue every day, but the problems will remain unsolved. Conditions for nurturing in return: Are the conditions ripe for realizing the transition from agriculture nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture in return? We should start from the overall situation and take the perspective of combining theory with practice in studying the following question: Are the conditions ripe now, or are they in the initial stages of becoming ripe, for realizing the transition from agriculture nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture in return? We are basically still not clear on this question. The issue of making transitions in stages is a basic starting point in policymaking. If we say that conditions are already ripe or are initially ripe, then we have to come up with a series of new economic policies. If we think the turning point hasn't yet arrived, then of course it is another matter. Using agriculture to nurture industry is a process that any developing country has to go through. China has been in this process since liberation; that is, it is using the value created by farmers to support the development of industry and the development of the urban economy. After a few decades, industry has become very strong, and the ratio between industrial and agricultural output values has now been reversed, from the former 30:70 to 70:20-odd now. This demands that we study our development strategy, including issues concerning the expanding income gap between industry and agriculture and between urban and rural areas. Looking at these aspects, I personally believe that, although we can't say that the conditions are completely ripe, we can say that conditions are initially ripe for the transition from agriculture nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture in return. In fact, industry has already begun to nurture agriculture, primarily in the form of township and town enterprises nurturing agriculture. Township and town enterprises in the coastal regions have played this role. Of course, this is only my personal view. But this question is worth serious study. Only then can our agriculture have the opportunity to better develop. The application of protection policies. Should we lift price controls over the means of agricultural production, protect farmers, or do both? Currently, the prices of the means of agricultural production are up, and farmers cannot afford them. Hence the issue of protection has been raised. But how do we protect them? Some time back I attended a seminar on the mechanization of agriculture. Sales of farm machinery had dropped 30-40 percent since the latter half of last year. A RENMIN RIBAO reporter wrote a commentary which described it very vividly: Beginning in June last year, it was as if farmers had discussed and agreed on a course of action; suddenly, no one would buy farm machinery any more. It is impossible for so many farmers to have discussed and agreed on it. Yet the fact that "suddenly nobody would buy" indicates that economic laws are working. Why wouldn't farmers buy farm machinery? Why wouldn't they use farm machinery? The key is whether it was financially beneficial for them. When contradictions occur between farmers and the enterprises that manufacture farm machinery, what should we do? If we let the manufacturers all go bankrupt, it will be difficult to revive them later. So we must protect them a little. However, under the circumstances that large and medium enterprises are switching their mechanisms to enter the market, if we favor the farm-machinery manufacturing industry too much, then its ability to survive will not grow stronger, and that won't do either. Therefore, I believe that, in principle, industry -- i.e., the means of agricultural production -- should be liberalized. Let it go and compete in the market economy so that efficient enterprises will prosper, increase their vitality, and raise their product quality. But for farmers we should take certain protective measures -- for example, we can let the price of diesel oil rise, but we must take certain measures to guarantee that the farmers can buy it at a fixed state price. Chemical fertilizer is the same. The question boils down to either protecting both ends or only one. If, given the soaring prices of the means of agricultural production, we don't try to protect the farmers' interests, agricultural production will surely drop sharply. After farm machinery went into a slump, in many places it was just as the newspaper described, "selling the iron ox (tractor) to buy the farm cattle." In some places, such as Yanqing, some farmers sold their tractors and went to Shanxi to buy donkeys. In some places in Shanxi you can see professional plowers. They don't use animal power, but manpower. All these indicate that, if we still don't take measures and let the comparative efficiency of agriculture drop, farmers will be unable to afford modern production facilities, and the modernization of our agriculture will be difficult to achieve and will even hold other things back. Some people suggest transferring farmers from cultivating the land to conducting large-scale operations on the land. This will raise agricultural efficiency and increase farmer income. But this requires a long process and requires substantial development in the non-farming industries. Water in the distance can't quench an immediate thirst. At present, we urgently need to study how to implement protective policies toward farmers and agriculture. Wu Xiang, president and researcher of the Chinese Society for the Study of the Export-Oriented Economy: "How To Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Farmers as Viewed From the Practice During Several Stages of Agricultural Development Since the Third Plenary Session" Beginning with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, rural reform has been continuing for 15 years. Looking back, we can perhaps divide these 15 years into the following stages: First stage: From 1979 to 1984, grain and farm products increased rapidly, farmer income also rose rapidly, and the city and countryside were both happy. During the 1979-1984 period, grain production developed rapidly. Nobody thought that the problem of securing adequate food and clothing for the majority of the countryside could be solved so quickly. The number one factor behind the large increase in farm products was the implementation of the contract responsibility system on a household basis, and the number two factor was perhaps the rise in grain prices, which was fairly substantial. At the same time, the state also decided to import grain and let the countryside and the farmers rest and recuperate. These measures, therefore, greatly benefited the rural economy, and farmer enthusiasm was high. For a few years, grain production continued to advance past two major milestones, each milestone representing an increase of 100 billion jin in output. This type of large-scale continuous growth has rarely been seen in history. During those years, farmer income increased rapidly, reaching an average growth rate of over 10 percent. With a large increase in farm income, farm products increased rapidly. So the government was satisfied, farmers were satisfied, and everybody was satisfied. But this created an illusion among some, as if agricultural problems would all be solved by production contracts and it would be plain sailing from then on. Second stage: From 1985 to 1988, grain production dropped for one year and remained stagnant for three. Urbanites complained loudly, but farmer income still increased to some extent. Farmers, therefore, were basically satisfied. In 1984 there was a bumper harvest, but immediately in 1985 there was a great reduction in yields. Actually, the drop in 1985 was foreshadowed by signs some years earlier. I remember that Comrade Wan Li read a letter at the 1983 Rural Work Conference. It was written by someone to his older brother in Beijing. It said: You all say that the situation is very good. I don't think so. Farmers are no longer willing to grow grain. It could already be seen at that time that growing grain was not profitable. If cash crops were planted on the same field, then the income would be so much more. If the field was turned into a fish pond, then the income would be even higher. If a factory was built on the land, the income would be higher still. At that time, however, the contract responsibility system on a household basis was still being pushed forward. Before that, the state's grain output had been very low. Therefore, during the early years, development had the nature of a recovery. Because all areas that practiced the contract responsibility system saw the per mu grain output increase -- even though the phenomenon of farmers being unwilling to grow grain had appeared and grain-growing areas had been reduced -- on the whole the total output of grain did not drop or did not drop much. Nationwide, therefore, the grain output still rose by a large margin. After 1984, however, the situation changed. This recovery-based rising trend weakened. Plus, for several years in a row, some areas that had reduced their agricultural land had made profits, and farmer enthusiasm for growing grain dropped, which led to a drop in output in 1985. After document No. 4 of 1984 stipulated some preferential policies for township and town enterprises, the township and town enterprises developed rapidly. The result was that farmer income increased. Therefore, in the four years from 1985 to 1988, grain output dropped for one year and was stagnant for three. Even in 1988 the 1984 level was never regained. Urbanites shouted loudly. After three years of stagnant agricultural output, people from top to bottom began to pay attention. But farmers were still happy. The voice saying that without industry there is no prosperity greatly surpassed the voice saying that without agriculture there is no stability. The "peaceful" scenario left problems for later. Third stage: From 1989 to 1991, grain output went up, but the rise in farmer income slowed down. The income of over half of the farmers experienced negative growth. After the three years' stagnation, the leadership and the rank and file all made efforts, and grain output increased in 1989. But the rise in farmer income was negative. The total rise of income in the three years from 1989 to 1991 was 0.7 percent. This 0.7 percent was a national average (during that period, township and town enterprises in the coastal regions, especially in the Zhu Jiang Delta, rose on a large scale; the export-oriented enterprises developed; and the growth in their income surpassed this ratio). Actually, the income of more than half of the farmers experienced negative growth. We reflected on and recognized such an important situation very slowly and belatedly and failed to take timely and effective measures. It wasn't until 1992 that the situation began to change. Fourth stage: From 1992 to the present. Looking back and looking ahead into the future, I think the essential element of solving the current problems in agriculture and among the farmers is to pay great attention to the farmers' interests. The rural reform that began in 1979 has developed smoothly all along. But in 1985 grain output started to slip. Urbanites were very worried, and some people even began to doubt the contract responsibility system on a household basis. Later, measures were taken to increase grain production, but the farmers' income did not rise. Looking back on it now, the root of the problem was that, for a long time under the planned system, the state's concern in the countryside was only to ask for grain and farm products from farmers, while seldom devoting any energy to the construction of the countryside itself. It did not pay attention to increasing farmer income and paid little heed to the economic interests of farmers and the improvement of their living standards. This problem has been a long term one. In the state's construction plans, careful consideration has been given to the various industrial projects that need to be launched -- how much investment and what kind of equipment they require -- while agriculture seldom or never received this attention. For agriculture, the authorities usually just set quotas and demanded increases of so much grain or cotton. But what were these increases based on? The measures often were not implemented. And when contradictions occurred between the city and the countryside, the countryside was often sacrificed to save the city. Looking at the more than a decade of history since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we feel deeply that the spiritual essence of the policies of the Third Plenary Session was to end the previous "leftist" practice of many years, i.e. the practice of invariably asking something from the farmers while paying no attention to their interests. There has been real concern for the interests of farmers. Only when they had the political right to make their own decisions and got real benefits economically was there an unprecedented rise in the production enthusiasm among the hundreds of millions of farmers. That was what made the miracle in Chinese agriculture of the 1980's possible. Today the key to revitalizing agriculture still lies in truly mobilizing farmer enthusiasm. To this end we must genuinely solve the problems of farmers increasing output but not their income, the dearth of rural employment opportunities, and the fact that it is hard for farmers to get rich. Only if farmers get rich can the country become prosperous and strong. Countries throughout the world are watching us, thinking that China is a large potential market. But only when the purchasing power of the large numbers of farmers is raised can this market become the world's largest market. In order to raise farmer enthusiasm, we must first resolve the question of increasing farmer income and then address the rural employment problem. These two are linked. Currently, this is evident in the "tidal wave of migrant laborers." It is true that, when migrant laborers come, many problems are exposed, such as traffic jams and chaos. People, therefore, usually see its negative side. Fortunately now everybody has also realized that this is a historical trend. The Ministry of Labor has been thinking of ways to solve these problems. The tidal wave of migrant laborers is nothing other than farmers coming, on their own, to look for jobs. The experience of many years has shown that farmers will always think of ways to solve rural and agricultural problems themselves. The government just needs to be a good guide and summarize experiences. With regard to such major problems as rural employment, we may have to let farmers find their own way. LIAOWANG is a very influential news magazine which has always paid attention to propaganda concerning rural, agricultural, and farmer problems. It has published many influential reports and essays. I suggest that LIAOWANG continue this good tradition and method. So many new problems are occurring in the countryside today, and propaganda must be strengthened so that both the leadership and the rank and file will pay appropriate attention. I agree wholeheartedly with the kind of meeting you are holding today. It doesn't require a lot of people. Everybody can say as much as he wants. But one meeting is not enough. We should hold several meetings in a row, and get the relevant comrades to conduct penetrating studies and discussions on several major problems in the reality of agriculture and the countryside. Duan Yingbi, researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture: "Reform: The Only Way for Agriculture To Get Out of Difficulty" In recent years agriculture has encountered several new situations, and many new problems have appeared in the countryside. The party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about agricultural and rural work and have implemented a series of policy measures to support agricultural production and protect the interests of farmers. At the end of 1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin called a Six-Province Rural Work Forum in Wuhan, and Premier Li Peng called a National Rural Work TV and Telephone Conference in Beijing. These can be seen as a turning point in the rural situation. The problem of "IOU's" being used to purchase farm products and of the farmers' burdens being too heavy, which were common at the time, have pretty much been solved. Later on, by strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, the outflow of rural capital and the occupation of large stretches of land have been halted. Last October, the central authorities called a rural work conference and came up with various policy measures for accelerating the development of the rural economy. In March this year, a central rural work conference was again called, which made concrete arrangements for agriculture and rural work this year. The level of these two meetings was very high. The number one leaders of local party committees and provincial governors participated, and the general secretary and the premier gave long speeches. All these have played a very positive role in the development of agriculture and the rural economy. Although currently there are still many difficulties and problems in agriculture and rural work, we can imagine that, had it not been for the strong emphasis on the part of the party Central Committee and the State Council, rural problems certainly would be much more serious than they are now. What Policies Did the Central Authorities Give to the Farmers? After more than four months of preparation, the central rural work conference came up with 12-point policy measures in light of the major problems existing in the countryside. In terms of the operating system, it stipulated that, when the current term of contracts for cultivated land expire, they should be extended for another 30 years without changing the terms, and that compensated transfer of land according to the law should be allowed. In terms of the circulation system, it stipulated a rise in the purchase price of grain and cotton, the establishment of grain risk funds and a state reserve system, and that the "sale on credit" problem in the grain business should be solved within a fixed period. In terms of agricultural input, it outlined adjustments in the three structures and rises in the three proportions, i.e., the proportion of agricultural investment in the state capital construction investment, the proportion of agricultural aid fund in the state financial budget, and the proportion of agricultural credit and loans in the state credit and loans. In order to support the economic development of the major grain and cotton producing areas, it decided to designate 500 major commodity grain producing counties and 150 cotton producing counties across the country, and said that the state would make arrangements for 6.5 billion yuan in special loans in a concentrated effort to help these counties. In order to guide agriculture in the direction of high yields, excellent quality, and high efficiency, it decided to allocate 1 billion yuan in special loans for the establishment of a group of agricultural demonstration zones in various places. Targeting the phenomenon of the random occupation of cultivated land, it stipulated the establishment of a basic farmland protection system and the delineation of basic farmland protection zones. Apart from this, in terms of science and technology, education, and the work of assisting the poor by tackling development projects, many concrete measures were also stipulated. Putting them together, the increase in special agricultural loans comes to 22.5 billion yuan per year. All these measures are specific and feasible. They were put forward on the basis of a large amount of investigation and study and after many meetings were called by the leading comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council in order to coordinate with the leaders of the relevant departments. Now the problem is that some policy measures have not been implemented, and, naturally, the effect of these policies cannot be brought into play. That policy measures cannot be implemented is indeed a major problem in agricultural and rural work. Where Is the Obstruction? If one asks why some policies of the central authorities are not being carried out, this cannot be explained in a few sentences. It is caused by many reasons, among which three are worth noting. First, the macro environment of agriculture. For a long period, we used agriculture to protect industry and used the countryside to protect the cities. The countryside had to shoulder the task of accumulating funds for the nation's industrialization. This situation has not yet been turned around and probably will not be completely turned around for some time to come. On the one hand, we want to maintain a relatively high speed for national economic development; on the other, we want to make a transition towards a socialist market economic system. Under these circumstances, it is difficult not to encounter the pressure of inflation and is difficult not to harm the vested interests of some people, because reform itself is an adjustment of interest relations. However, since the interests of the city are inflexible and untouchable, a fair proportion of the risks will have to be born by the countryside. Of course, none of us want to have it this way. We all wish to give agriculture a better environment, such as rationalizing the prices of farm products and increasing inputs for agriculture. But this is truly difficult to do. I think the so-called "failure to implement policy measures" is related to this macro environment. Second, the situation of leadership at the county and township levels. These two levels are crucial for agricultural and rural work, because various policy measures have to be implemented through them. Currently many counties and townships are racking their brains over their inability to pay salaries; some county offices have kept a few people to man the phones and have sent the rest out to make money. Under such a situation, how can agriculture and rural work be strengthened? The work at the township level is indeed difficult to do. They cannot even accomplish the imperative tasks pressed upon them by their superiors; when do they have time for rural work? Of course, the situation is not the same everywhere, but at least this is not an isolated phenomenon. If this situation is not changed, it will be very difficult for agriculture to develop. Third, the situation in the rural work organs. On the one hand, the organization is incomplete because there is not a unified organization to grasp the work. On the other hand, there is the problem of spirit. During the 1980's, rural reform was heated. In the rural work system the leadership and the rank and file were all very enthusiastic. They would go deep down into reality, conduct investigation and study, and delve into problems. That spirit cannot be compared to what we are seeing today. Now, very few people actually go down to the townships, villages, or households to investigate, and very few investigation reports contain examples and analysis. On the contrary, there are many general articles. I think this is also one reason why policies "cannot be implemented"! Let the Countryside Heat Up To solve the current problems in the countryside, in the final analysis, we should continue to deepen rural reform, implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and advance toward the goal of a socialist market economic system. By now, rural reform is increasingly interwoven with urban reform. Many reform measures can no longer be independently implemented in the countryside but must be coordinated between the cities and the countryside. However, this on no account means that there is no room for rural reform. On the contrary, there are still many things to do. For example, in terms of the operating system, we can realize the optimal allocation of economic resources on the basis of stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and circulating the various production elements in the countryside by different means. In this respect, there have already been many innovations among the farmers. In some economically developed regions, many forms of moderately large-scale operations of farmland have been developed by using land use rights as shares or transferring land use rights for a price. Farmers in some economically underdeveloped regions have gone to contract fields in economically developed regions. Recently, in some places in the northwest, the development of noncultivated resources has been accelerated through the auction of the use rights of uncultivated mountains, hills, wasteland, and shoals. These innovations should be seriously summarized so as to study their applicability and conditions and gradually promote them. For example, in terms of the circulation system, we can do some pioneering in developing market intermediary organizations. Currently, the main reason why we do not dare lift price controls over cotton and part of the grain is the fear that, once they are liberalized, there will be chaos and all kinds of vendors will go and "loot" the countryside and disrupt the market and the prices. Will we then be able to develop farmers marketing cooperatives in the countryside? Take grain as an example. I think we can use the grass-roots grain management offices as a basis to establish grain marketing cooperatives. Each household can hand over its grain to the cooperative, which will sell the grain directly in the wholesale markets. After the deduction of costs and accumulation, the profit can then be returned to the farmers according to a certain percentage. Cotton can also have cotton cooperatives, with the processing stations as a basis. This way one can both reduce intermediate links, save on transaction costs, increase farmer income, and avoid the situation of the market becoming chaotic once it has been liberalized. As for the questions of adjusting the economic structure, developing township and town enterprises, building small towns, and transferring surplus rural labor, still more problems must be studied and still more work has to be done. In a word, we should not think that there is nothing more to do in rural reform. I hope LIAOWANG weekly will use this format to publish more articles on deepening rural reform and, as before, build up a momentum for rural reform.
