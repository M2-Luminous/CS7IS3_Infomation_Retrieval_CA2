FBIS4-38125 "drnes124_k_94006" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 IRAQ Interviewed on Export Capacity Interviewed on Export Capacity NC2706113694 Paris AFP in English 1035 GMT 27 Jun 94 NC2706113694 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Nicosia, June 27 (AFP)--Iraq now has the capacity to export more than two million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, its oil minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said in an interview published here on Monday. Iraq will also demand an output quota "at parity with Iran," currently 3.6 million bpd, from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) when UN sanctions are lifted, Jawad told the MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES). A United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil exports was imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq's production quota was set at the same level with Iran's quota in July 1990. Jawad said Iraq had met UN resolutions to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, the condition for the lifting of the embargo. "We feel that we will soon return to the market," Jawad told the specialist newsletter published in Cyprus during an interview in Vienna. "We can export more than 2 million bpd now. The export outlets are ready. We sustained heavy damage, but we have repaired around 90 per cent of the damaged facilities," he added. Jawad said Iraq could export between 1.2 and 1.3 million bpd through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which has a capacity of 1.8 million bpd, and 1.2 million bpd through the Mina' al-Bakr export terminal on the Gulf. Repairs on the nearby Khawr al-Amaya terminal would be ready in the next few months to provide an initial export capacity of 600,000 bpd, al-Habubi said. "We can also resort to exporting by trucks through Turkey and Jordan, as we did during the eighties. Hence the fact that we cannot use the Iraqi-Saudi pipeline will not affect our export capacity during the initial export stage." The minister said Iraqi officials have visited Italy, Ukraine and France recently to discuss joint oil projects, but said there had been no negotiations yet with Japanese firms. Jawad said Iraq would "give priority to those companies which have held negotiations with us during the embargo," after sanctions were lifted. Iraq discussed with Ukraine the construction of a spur line from the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline to Turkey's Black Sea coast, from where oil could be exported to the Ukraine.
