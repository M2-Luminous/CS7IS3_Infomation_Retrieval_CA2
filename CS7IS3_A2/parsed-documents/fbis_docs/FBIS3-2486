The mainland imported 25 million metric tons of iron and steel in 1993, ranking first in the world in terms of iron and steel imports; whereas Taiwan imported 15 million metric tons of iron and steel last year, ranking third in world, Kuo Chin-mao said, adding that the two sides' iron and steel imports accounted for more than one-third of the world's iron and steel trade last year; for this reason, it is necessary for the two sides to strengthen exchange of information on iron and steel, as this will benefit iron and steel businessmen on both sides. In addition, Kuo Chin-mao said: In recent years, more and more Taiwan bicycle and hand tool investors are investing on the mainland; if people in the steel industry still remain conservative and do not have a good idea of the mainland's market trends, their business will be affected. Although the government is energetically introducing a "southward-bound policy" to reduce industrialists' fever in investing on the mainland, the federation will still lead iron and steel manufacturers and businessmen to the mainland to seek cooperation, out of consideration of practical needs.
