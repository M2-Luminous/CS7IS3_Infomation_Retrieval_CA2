FR940810-0-00137 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA knows that some employers would like additional guidance on specifications for required work practices and controls. The EPA ``Greenbook,'' (Ex. 1&hyph;183), NIBS Guidance Manual (Ex. 1&hyph;371) and other sources of specific work practices are available. Appendix J OSHA method ID&hyph;191 for bulk asbestos analysis has been included as Appendix J, to provide a suggested uniform method for the identification of asbestos. This method uses polarized light optics on a phase contrast microscope. Using this methodology, fibers visible in phase contrast illumination can be viewed to assess whether there might be potential for asbestos exposure from a material which can be measured by a phase contrast counting method. This method also contains the criteria used by OSHA to differentiate between asbestiform and non-habit of minerals. The text of the method is informational and explains its limitations and proper use. Environmental Assessment; Findings of No Significant Impact OSHA has reviewed the environmental impact in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1500), and OSHA's NEPA compliance procedures (29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that these regulations will have no impact on air, water or soil quality, plant or animal life, or the use of land or aspects of the external environment. Therefore, OSHA concludes there will be no significant impact on the general quality of the human environment outside the workplace, particularly in terms of ambient air quality, water quality, or solid waste disposal. No comments made at the public hearing or submitted to the record contradict this conclusion. State Plan Requirements The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must revise their existing standards within six months of the publication date of the final standards or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because existing state standards are already ``at least as effective'' as the new Federal standards. These States are: California, Connecticut (State and local government workers only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (State and local government workers only), North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. Until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate. Federalism The standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. Additionally, the Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards. Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. The Federally promulgated Asbestos standard is drafted so that workers in every State would be protected by general, performance-oriented standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities that could alter work practices, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the performance nature of this final standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and contractors to provide as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health of workers. While the individual States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved; most have not elected to do so in the twenty-three years since the enactment if the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSHA Act would not be preempted by this final regulation and would be able to deal with special, local conditions within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at least as effective as the Federal standard.
