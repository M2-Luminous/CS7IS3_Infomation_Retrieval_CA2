With 90 new cases in 1992 and 58 new cases in 1991 the development is going as expected. "The industrialized nations have economic resources and medical competence and can control the spread of AIDS and HIV. Developing countries are poor and are unable to do so," noted Associate Professor Markku Loytonen. Loytonen and Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health Institute co-authored the book Kaikki AIDSista [All About AIDS]. Leinikki also stressed the problems developing countries struggle with when it comes to preventing the spread of HIV, as well as Finland's international responsibility. "Finland should do more on the international level," he said and mentioned Norway as an example. Norway has an organization for medicine in developing countries that uses state funds in its efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS in Africa.
