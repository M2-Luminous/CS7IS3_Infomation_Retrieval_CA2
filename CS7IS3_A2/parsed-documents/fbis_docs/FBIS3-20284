Bonn's problems in the financing of eastern Germany, and a continuing fall in industrial competitiveness, mean that real gross national product growth in the European Union [EU] this year will reach only 1.6 per cent, compared with an estimated fall of 0.3 per cent in 1993, the bank believes. German recovery will be "late, partly because the Bundesbank has adopted a cautious approach to reducing interest rates," says its report. By 1995, GNP growth in the EU will be 2.5 per cent "but this is no more than a return to trend." The importance of Germany to the health of Europe's economy is, if anything, increasing. "In the past it has been difficult for Europe to stage a robust upswing without Germany," writes the report's author, Mr Nigel Newman, Barclays' senior European economist. "During the past 10 years Germany and the rest of Europe have become more closely integrated. Faced with a (slow recovery) in Germany, the prospects for the rest of Europe do not look particularly promising." The result will be a "modest and probably erratic period of recovery" this year. The state of the German economy is compounded by high interest rates, low confidence, falling employment and "restrictive" tax policies which will continue to hurt demand from European consumers. Rises in long-term interest rates seen this month could also hinder recovery unless reversed. The prospects for France, where a "sluggish recovery" is under way, are seen as slightly better than for Germany. But the French trade balance could deteriorate as a result of falling industrial competitiveness as the franc remains tied to the D-Mark [German mark] in the European monetary system. Italy's improving competitiveness and exports should mean a significant recovery this year. "Export growth is leading the upswing, although an end to destocking will also provide support," says the report. Rising exports should also assist Spain, with higher consumer spending helping. The forecasts for the UK are optimistic, saying that consumer spending will continue to grow in spite of higher taxes next month. Across the EU, the outlook for interest and inflation rates is viewed by the bank as more promising than for growth. Inflation will stay just below 1993's 3.4 per cent for the next three years, says the report, while interest rates are forecast to slip from 7.9 per cent in 1993 to 5.2 per cent in 1994 and 4.5 per cent for the subsequent two years. The scheduled widening of EU membership next January 1 -- with the possible arrival as full members of Sweden, Austria, Norway and Finland -- will increase the size of the EU by 7 per cent in terms of gross domestic product. This "should give intra-EU trade a one-off boost in 1994 and 1995," says the report.
