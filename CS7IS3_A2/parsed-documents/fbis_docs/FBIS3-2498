At three previous meetings, Western countries also proposed similar bills, which all came to early ends. At this round of meetings, these countries once again proposed the bill on "China's so-called human rights condition," asking the Commission to vote on it. Regarding this, Jin Yongjian, head of the Chinese delegation, proposed a motion asking members not to proceed with the bill. His motion won strong support from the developing countries and was passed by 20 votes in favor, 16 against, and 17 abstentions. Jin Yongjian pointed out in his speech before the motion was voted on that some Western countries ignored the three refusals by the Human Rights Commission; ignored the actual situation in which China enjoys political and social stability, sustained and rapid economic development, and great improvement of living standards among its people; they insisted on proposing the draft bill which was against China, and their purpose was to exert political pressure on China, hinder China's economic development, and force the Chinese people to change the road of development which is chosen by themselves and which suits China's conditions. He pointed out that one of the important reasons for China's comparative backwardness today is because China suffered invasion and looting by imperialism for a long time. In this regard, among the countries which proposed the draft bill, some had played a very disgraceful role, and today they once again want to instruct China to do this and that and willfully criticize it. How can this not cause grievances among the Chinese people? He said that China is willing to begin international cooperation in the human rights domain on the premise of mutual respect and equality and based on the purpose and principle on the UN Charter, but China is firmly opposed to any country or group which slanders it in the name of "protection of human rights." Before the vote, representatives from countries such as Cuba, Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Iran expressed support for China. They stressed that the international community must look at China's great achievements in the areas of politics, economy, and society. They said that China is a big country and its population accounts for one-fourth of the world's total, and that the Chinese Government has endured the challenge of managing such a big country, enabled various ethnic groups to live harmoniously, and let the people upgrade their living standard continuously. Regarding these achievements, the international community should give commendation and encouragement. They pointed out that Western countries are accustomed to imposing their own thinking and ideologies on others, and that the bill on "China's so-called human rights conditions" has a clear political motive.
