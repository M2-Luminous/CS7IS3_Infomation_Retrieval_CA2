As is known, Russia has expressed a readiness to withdraw the forces from Estonia by 31 August 1994. [Begin recording] [Toom] How do you assess that statement by Svirin [head of the Russian delegation for talks with Estonia on troop withdrawal] that Russia has already presented to Estonia a schedule of withdrawal of forces on 2 (?September)? [Velliste] This corresponds to the truth, altogether, and Svirin has improvised a little on the theme of the schedule, that he has, by word of mouth, presented (?some considerations) approximately when [word indistinct] could go. But this has been a very approximate guidance, nothing has been put in writing and presented on paper. [Toom] The Estonian Progress Party held a news conference and expressed doubts on the subject of all these talks. The Progress Party somehow casts suspicion about some kind of secret protocols with these talks, that Russia has demanded something as compensation for the withdrawal of forces, and that Estonia has probably promised in connection with, for example, the forces' pensioners. [Velliste] If there was a secret protocol it would very quickly be revealed. There is no (?reason for) [word indistinct] in a democratic state. We have not a single essential thing that would not reach the newspapers, [words indistinct] (?in the nearest time) newspapers. Some kind of secret protocol could, in general, (?be checked) [words indistinct] living in a democratic state. [end recording]
