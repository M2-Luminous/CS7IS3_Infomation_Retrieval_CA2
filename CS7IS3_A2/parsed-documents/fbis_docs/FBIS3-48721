The new year 1994, which all our people have greeted with faith and optimism, is a meaningful year that will be recorded as a brilliant page in the annals of our revolution and socialist construction. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his New Year's address: The new year 1994 is a revolutionary turning point when our country's socialist construction will enter a new developmental stage, as well as a year of worthwhile struggle in which the entire party, the entire Army, and all the people will be mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge in all fronts. All our party members and working people are now faced with the honorable and responsible task to make the new year 1994 a historical turning point for our country's revolution and construction by upholding and vigorously struggling to implement the militant tasks presented by the great leader in his New Year's address. The road ahead is bright, but rough, because we have to overcome many obstacles and difficulties. The international environment for our revolution is very complex and tense and we are now building socialism in acute confrontation with the enemy. Thus, we should further increase the country's political, economic, and military strength by completely implementing the revolutionary line of independence, self-reliance, and self-defense and by vigorously carrying out the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in accordance with the prevailing situation and the demand of our developing revolution, as the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address. The complete implementation of our party's revolutionary economic strategy is more important than anything else in making this year a revolutionary turning point for our country's socialist construction to enter a new developmental stage. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the 21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee held last year is the most just and most revolutionary line for consolidating the country's independent economic base and for improving the people's living standard in accordance with the demand of socialism. When we completely implement this strategy, we can demonstrate the might of socialism of our own style more vigorously and can occupy a new attack position to reach a higher ground of socialism. It is important for us to adhere to the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy this year. Above all, we have to concentrate great efforts on developing agriculture. This year is a meaningful year, which marks the 30th anniversary of the presentation of the socialist rural theses. We should vigorously carry out the struggle to fulfill the historic tasks of the rural theses so we can make a new turning point in developing our rural economy. To achieve this, we should consolidate results of irrigation and electrification in rural areas, realize mechanization and scientization at a high level, and completely implement the chuche farming method. By doing so, we should develop all agricultural sectors, including grain production. The working class should produce more farming materials -- such as tractors, trucks [chadongcha], modern farm machines, chemical fertilizer, and agricultural chemicals -- and send them to rural areas. Cooperative farmers and all agricultural working people should do farming work in a frugal and tenacious manner with an attitude worthy of masters who are responsible for the country's rice supply so they can achieve the party's high goal of grain production without fail. It is also important for us to direct efforts to develop the light industry. We must adopt positive measures to improve and reinforce light industry factories, modernize them, and increase the production of chemical fibers, synthetic resin, and other materials for light industry. In this way, we should operate all the light industry factories at full capacity and maintain a high and steady rate of production. These are important militant tasks for the light industry this year. The heavy industry, by thoroughly carrying out militant tasks arising before them, must produce various kinds of consumer goods in large quantities, increase their variety, and improve their quality radically. Increasing foreign trade is one of our important tasks. In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many sectors of the national economy, increase their production, and improve their quality. All sectors and regions must further boost exports by exploring and using the resources for exports and also develop improvement trade [kagong muyok]. In order to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in construction and revolution, it is very important to give top priority to the coal and electric power industries, and rail transport--the leading sectors of the national economy--and to consistently develop the metal industry. In order to develop agriculture and light industry and to accelerate the country's overall economic construction, we must put efforts into the coal, electric power, and metal industries and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport. In order to triumphantly implement tasks of the economic construction to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in construction and revolution, all economic sectors and units of the national economy must launch a vigorous campaign for increased production and conservation as a mass movement. All economic functionaries must organize economic work and direct production efficiently in accordance with the party's economic strategy. Upholding our party's policy of cultural revolution, our intellectuals must strive devotedly to make new advances in all fields of developing socialist culture. This year, too, we must put efforts into strengthening the country's defense power by upholding the leadership of our supreme command leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with construction and revolution is all the more strengthening the single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses and highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. Our single-hearted unity is firmly hardened behind the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. All party members and working people should uphold, safeguard, and protect the leader [yongdoja] with the faithful single-hearted unity, acknowledge the justness of the leader's [yongdoja] idea and lines, and thoroughly carry them out under any circumstances. By doing so, the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks will be cemented rock-solid under the leadership of the party and, with its might, the cause of the socialism of our own style will be vigorously pushed ahead. The spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle is a traditional struggle spirit for our people who are doing revolutionary work and a revolutionary banner of triumphantly building socialism of our own style. "Let us vigorously accelerate the general march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle," this is the call of our party and the militant slogan our people must uphold today. Only when we march forward with this slogan can we resolutely safeguard and protect the socialism of our own style, smashing the imperialists and reactionaries' all sorts of maneuvers of obstruction and challenges. We can also solve the problems arising in the socialist construction with our own power under all difficult conditions. We, as in the days of the great Chollima upsurge after the war, should effect a new upsurge in the socialist construction by overcoming difficulties, upholding the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. In doing so, we should brilliantly adorn this year as a year of revolutionary upturn in which our country's socialist construction enters a new developing stage.
