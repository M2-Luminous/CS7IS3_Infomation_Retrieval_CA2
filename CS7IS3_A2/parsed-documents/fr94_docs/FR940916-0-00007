FR940916-0-00007 FR940916-0-00003 7 CFR Part 1468 RIN 0560&hyph;AD68 Payment Programs for Shorn Wool, Wool on Unshorn Lambs, and Mohair (1991&hyph;1995) AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the regulations that set forth the 1991&hyph;1995 wool and mohair payment programs as authorized by the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended. This interim rule provides that in determining net proceeds for shorn wool or mohair, effective for 1993 and subsequent marketing years, marketing charges for commissions, coring, or grading shall not be deducted. This interim rule removes the 1 percent assessment on 1993, 1994, and 1995 marketings and revises payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year. The changes necessitated by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act, enacted August 10, 1993, were effective for the 1993 marketing year beginning January 1, 1993. Since the Act made changes that affect the 1993 and 1994 marketing years which are currently in effect with payments in process, good cause is shown to make the changes effective immediately without prior notice and comment. Comments will be received 60 days after the effective date and be considered when the rule is to be made final. DATES: Interim rule effective September 16, 1994. Comments must be received on or before November 15, 1994 in order to be assured consideration. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to: Director, Emergency Operations and Livestock Programs Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharon Diel, Program Specialist, Emergency Operations and Livestock Programs Division, ASCS, USDA, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415, telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;6605. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This interim rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
