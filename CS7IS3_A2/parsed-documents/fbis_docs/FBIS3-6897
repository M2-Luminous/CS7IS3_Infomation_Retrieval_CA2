Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of economic affairs, told a news conference that measures for deregulation in priority areas such as government procurement, automobile and auto parts imports and insurance now are being scrutinized at the order of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hayashi added, however, that it would be difficult to complete a comprehensive package comprising all priority areas as well as policies for free competition. Referring to a U.S. threat to take retaliatory action against Japan under the controversial Super 301 clause, Hayashi said it is natural for Japan to seek judgment from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if such a step is invoked. Hayashi added Japan is allowed to take countermeasures against such moves under GATT rules.
