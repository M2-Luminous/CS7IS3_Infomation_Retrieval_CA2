"Police told my father that Wei Jingsheng was in a medium-class hotel in the suburbs," said Wei Ling, his younger sister told AFP. But they did not give the name of the hotel, she added. A security ministry official contacted by telephone refused comment. Wei was detained on April 1 on suspicion of having "committed new crimes" but his family has not been told if new charges have been brought against him. Last week a foreign ministry spokesman said Wei was a "criminal" and that his case had nothing to do with human rights. Wei, 43, was freed on parole last September after serving 14 years in jail for his role as a leader of the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-79. Since then he has given several interviews to the foreign press in which he said he planned to continue his fight for democracy in China. Wei's secretary Tong Yi, has also been detained by the authorities, but Wei's family is without news of her.
