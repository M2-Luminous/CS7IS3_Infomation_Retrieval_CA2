What the three presidents discussed and documented in Moscow is not an agreement, Chairman of the parliamentary Commission for International Affairs Dmitriy Pavlychko told journalists. "Therefore, for the moment we can only state our attitude to this document," he said. Pavlychko believes that the Moscow statement cannot replace the Ukrainian parliament's resolution. Such a resolution can only be replaced by an agreement, not by a protocol of intent, he said. "We can only ratify an agreement," he added. Pavlychko also believes that the final decision on the problem will be made by a new parliament. He said that Leonid Kravchuk shared this belief.
