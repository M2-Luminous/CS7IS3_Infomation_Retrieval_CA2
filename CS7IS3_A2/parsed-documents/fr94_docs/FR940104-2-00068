FR940104-2-00068 FR940104-2-00045 (A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes The purpose of the proposed changes is to establish fees for reports produced from individual files and new combinations of files in the MCC/MSTC File Transmission Service. MCC/MSTC's File Transmission Service (``FTS'') (File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;87&hyph;6 and SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;87&hyph;7) 2 provides a computer-to-computer interface for the transmission of data between MCC/MSTC and their participants. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25718 (May 19, 1988), 53 FR 19074 [order approving proposal to develop and implement the File Transmission Service to link MCC's and MSTC's computer systems with those of their participants]. The proposed rule changes are consistent with section 17A of the Act in that they provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable fees and other charges among participants using MCC and MSTC facilities. (B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on burden on Competition MCC and MSTC do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the proposes of the Act. (C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received from Members, Participants, or Others Comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule changes became effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(2) thereunder because they establish or change a due, fee, or other charge of the self-regulatory organizations. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule changes, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule changes if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purpose of the Act.
