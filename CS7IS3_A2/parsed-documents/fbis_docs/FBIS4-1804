This is nothing but an attempt to sow discord between China and its bordering countries and to incite an anti-China feeling. What is the reality? According to reports by the London Institute of International Strategic Studies and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, authoritative Western organs, China's national defense spending is not much in fact. Take, for instance, the years 1991 and 1992. The U.S. national defense budgets for these two years were $290.9 billion and $270.9 billion respectively but the figures for China were only $6.13 billion and $6.73 billion respectively, only 2.1 and 2.4 percent of the U.S. budget figures. The percentage of per capita military spending is even less. The per capita military spending figures for the United States in those two years were $1,155 and $1,076 respectively but those for China were only $5 and $6. The per capita military spending of China is only 0.43 and 0.55 percent of those of the United States. Even if compared with those of the bordering countries, China's national defense budget cannot be ranked among the top three and the ranking of its per capita military spending is much lower. China has increased its national defense budget by a small amount this year. However, as Vice Premier and concurrently Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: "As a matter of fact, this is mainly to make up for the increase in commodity prices." How can China's military spending be considered large when viewed from the facts? China has always pursued a foreign policy of peace and has made efforts to safeguard world peace. This is known to all. Racking one's brains in an attempt to make use of the issue of military spending to incite an anti-China feeling is completely to no avail.
