As was already reported, the so-called puppet prime minister -- who visited the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff on 25 March and openly agitated for national reunification through a northward invasion by ordering it to be in thorough readiness -- visited the puppet frontline Army units on 26 March and the police stations in Seoul on 27 March and ordered them to assume a thorough readiness, to thoroughly maintain public peace and order, and to be alert. This shows how the puppets are unsteady in their mind for their Northward invasion. As everyone knows, the present situation on the Korean peninsula is rushing to the dangerous phase of a touch-and-go situation [ilchokchugbalui wihomhan kungmyon]. The puppets, who intentionally blocked North-South dialogue, held successive meetings -- such as the so-called meeting of security-related ministers and the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- to formulate war plots as if they are waiting for an opportunity and have babbled about a so-called retaliation or the security posture. Also, they have decided on the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea and on the resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise and ordered all puppet armed forces to be put on alert. In this situation, the Kim Yong-sam clique visited the Japanese reactionaries and plotted to crush [apsal] our republic in collusion with outside forces, thus talking about the cooperative system or sanctions. Also, the United States has largely mobilized its aggressive arms, including nuclear aircraft carriers, to South Korea and the sea areas surrounding South Korea. By so doing, the United States conducts nuclear war exercises -- in the sky, land, and sea of South Korea -- aimed at us every day. These serious situations created by the South Korean puppets, with the U.S. imperialists, will never be a thing that can be overlooked. According to the recent remarks by the puppet national defense minister, the puppets formulated a northward invasion war plan, the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, made up of a five-stage operational concept, with the United States in September 1993. The bustling military movement that has been shown recently in South Korea is a part of its schemes to put the adventurous Northward invasion war plan into practice. After artificially creating an obstacle to the working-level delegate's contacts for the exchange of special envoys appointed by the North-South highest authorities, the puppets have finally broken them up. Needless to say, it is clear that their purpose is a deliberate plot based on their criminal intention to do harm to the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces under the so-called nuclear issue. The Kim Yong-sam ring is the servant of the U.S. imperialists' nuclear war, as well as the vicious national betrayers who want to maintain their dirty lives in return for their act of making the nation become the victim of a nuclear war, thus only being a shock brigade for the imperialists' war of aggression regardless of the destiny of their country and nation. It is natural that trouble causes trouble. As shown by all these facts, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has actually plotted to provoke the northward invasion war and to ignite a fire on the point of a war. Under these conditions, there is no guarantee that a war will not be waged in any place on the Korean peninsula [chosonbandoeso chonjaengi tojiji anhuriranun tambonun odiedo opsupnida]. In collusion with outside forces, the Kim Yong-sam ring has plotted to irritate [kondurida] our republic by eagerly seeking an opportunity for the northward invasion. These are foolish and indiscriminate remarks and acts. Our people want peace, but will not beg for it. Also, they do not want war, but will never be afraid of it. If the puppets force us to carry out war, our people and our People's Army will rise up as one to retaliate the aggressors in tens thousandfold and safeguard socialism of our own style to the end. Only a bitter defeat and tragic death will be given to provokers. This is a lesson learned from the Korean war waged in the early 1950's. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that their war provocation is just the way to their shameful destruction, and they must not act recklessly.
