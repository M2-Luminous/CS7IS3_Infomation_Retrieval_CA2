Every Development Needs Visions as well as Promoters. Economy and Science Must Adapt to Internationalization of Markets HANDELSBLATT, Wednesday 24 Nov 93. The less than satisfactory growth of the German economy during the past few months has made it clear how an even most stable boom can come to an end. Despite all the austerity measures and consolidation required at this difficult time, we must not neglect to also provide for tomorrow. An essential requisite for this is, among others, a tight international dovetailing of economic management and science: above all in the so-called "high-tech" area. When viewing the status of scientific organizations at the threshold to the next millennium from the economic standpoint, we must ask ourselves whether we are adequately equipped to deal with anticipated developments and problems. We have to recognize that flexibility and productivity of scientific effort will be adversely affected by overregulation and inadequate budget authorization for smaller R.& D. units. A further impediment is the widespread adherence to the regionalization (territorial demarcation) principle. The Bonn University is beholden to the City of Bonn, the universities of North Rhineland - Westphalia are beholden to the provinces, and the German universities are beholden to the German Federal Republic. Europeanization must not pause while science is organizing itself. For a model let us look at the U.S.A., where private American universities are internationally oriented. Japanese universities and research organizations, for instance, are in this way gaining a foothold in Germany. ICSI: Bridgehead for German Scientists Globalization of the economy as a necessity must also include international extension of national research organizations and, therefore, German participation in the international contest between science systems. This means that there is a need for a presence of German scientific organizations acting as business enterprises abroad, because a target of the international contest is always one or another national entity. In order for the changeover from a service-oriented society to a science- based society to be correctly understood, it is necessary for the "science industry" to follow the overall global economy distribution pattern. The developments point unequivocally to globalization of institutional structures. It is in these terms that one should look at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, established by both economic and scientific communities. Development has been found to need visions as well as promoters. The success of this initiative hinges on the trilateral relation between the University of California in Berkeley, the ICSI, and the German support association: a consortium of companies serving as a bridgehead for German scientists as well as for private and public research and development organizations. The consortium formed by Daimler-Benz, Mannesmann, Siemens, Krupp, Bertelsmann, and SEL, also the Mathematics and Data Processing Society (GMD), and the president of the German Patent Office takes all the credit for having opened a technological front window to most advanced research and development by launching this joint venture with the University of California in Berkeley with the establishment of its International Computer Science Institute in 1988 and by thus successfully integrating German scientists into joint projects with top American researchers. Results of U.S. Research Hardly Made Available to Europeans Technology transfer from the U.S.A. is particularly important, because crucial developments in these key technologies take place there and yet the results of those developments are hardly or not at all available to Europeans. This protectionist stance is taken by the U.S. Department of Commerce on behalf of industries fearing that an outflow of know-how will adversely affect their competitive position internationally. The technology transfer through the ICSI is yielding impressive results, which German member companies can utilize and evaluate at no cost and without restrictions. The outpost in Berkeley plays here a double bridging function: in the transatlantic German-American axis and in the significance of California's Bay Area to the Pacific region. Neither is the technology transfer from California to Germany meant to be a one-way street but rather, and this is especially important in the keen international contest, California is also meant to serve as a base for dissemination of German products and processes. It is precisely this aspect of German-American cooperation within the framework of the "Joint Venture" which is promoted by the Governor of California ("... My administration recognizes the value of developing global ties at the early stages of research, in order to ensure international cooperation through the commercial development stages. ... Our administration looks forward to playing an active role through the implementation of this joint venture" wrote California's Governor George Deukmejian on 9 May 1990). The requisite for global competitiveness of the German economy is that it not only be represented by a production and marketing organization abroad but also be tightly linked, through research and development, to the scientific community abroad. It is exactly in medium-size enterprises where the ability to innovate is assuming an increasingly important role. While opened up to innovations, however, they must also be in a more vigorously manner given the opportunity to utilize newly acquired scientific and technical knowledge. Professor Syrbe, former president of the Fraunhofer Society, has found the distribution of expenditures by an enterprise to be so skewed that per 80% of its outlays today only 5% is allotted to research and development. Japan's Machine Manufacturing Industry Enhances Its Competence This lop-sided distribution pattern indicates how necessary it is to boost joint projects involving science and economic management so as to accelerate research and technology transfer to the medium-size industry. For new products and processes are being developed predominantly in the area of research-intensive technologies and a key role here is being assumed by the information technology, a technology which has already penetrated all sectors of industry at a breathtaking pace. A glance at Japan reveals that there for instance the machine manufacturing industry, also structured as a medium-size one, consistently invests in enhancement of its R.& D. competence. Up to 20% of its investments have gone into R.& D.: above all in areas of control engineering, robotics, and materials research, where the top technologies yield highly innovative and intensely worth-creating processes and products. Information science and information technology are crucial driving forces in other sectors of industry: one DM worth of output in information technology results in about 7-8 DM worth of output in other sectors as, for instance, in machine and plant construction. Today about one third of Germany's national product is built around a microelectronic kernel. New information techniques have meanwhile reached a level of development and thus become focally significant for our middle-class economy as well. Until now the German medium-size industry has been completely bypassed by the much needed technology transfer. Cooperation with science is of vital importance to precisely this industry, inasmuch as it has only a limited own research capacity available. Conversely, science depends on confrontation by problems of industrial practice for working out competitive solutions. The key results achieved by the Project ICSI in neural information technology and high-capacity computer networks have become decisive future- outlook factors in the global contest. Among the 500 principal enterprises in the U.S.A. there is today hardly one not intensely involved with these concerns and not assigning inside development teams to deal with them. Establishment of the European Domestic Market and the increasing globalization of trade will continue to increase the dependence on innovative telecommunication and telecooperation systems. It is to be feared that companies which do not have this technology at their long-term disposal will not be able to hold their ground in the international contest. Door to Development of Intelligent Technologies We cannot afford to be represented internationally by Goethe Institutes only. We must get our foot in the door to development of intelligent technologies such as those which the International Computer Science Institute is making available to us. Let us not forget that it takes less and less time to convert the results of research and development into producible items.
