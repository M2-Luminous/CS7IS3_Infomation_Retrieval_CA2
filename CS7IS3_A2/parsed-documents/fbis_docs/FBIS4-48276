However, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] would like to state the following: Since a section of the Kigali-Gitarama road fell under the control of the RPA, the latter swiftly informed UNAMIR about it. Second, the convoy that was scared off by shots fired by the RPA included vehicles belonging to the Rwanda Government Army and to UNAMIR. Let us also recall that the same government Army has confiscated several UNAMIR cars, using them at its own discretion. This is witnessed by the fact that the blue berets' vehicles were recovered [words indistinct] in the hands of the RPA. In addition, UNAMIR has in fact reported the confiscation of vehicles by the government (?Army) to the RPF. [passage indistinct]
