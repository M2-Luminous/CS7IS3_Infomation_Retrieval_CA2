The meeting was presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government; Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in the city of Havana; and Pedro Ross Leal, CTC Secretary General; along with Alfredo Morales, top union leader in the city of Havana. Alfredo Morales read a detailed report on the main proposals submitted by the Havana workers. The report also makes a political assessment of these heated discussions in which a spirit of willingness to carry out our main tasks stands out. A group of participants in the meeting also gave their opinions on the report and on the parliaments. They underscored such aspects as a greater demand by the administration to control resources, costs, accounting, labor discipline, and other essential matters. Several suggestions on the banks' role in receiving payments and in paying accounts by different organizations; the need for efficiency indicators to be posted in each workplace; the reduction of annual sick leave figures; and the need to subsidize consumers rather than products, among other topics, were some of the most debated points. Jorge Lezcano thoroughly explained the country's economic situation, namely in Havana city. He stressed the political outcome of this process, the need to continue the process and made an analysis of the salary tax, currency exchange, labor discipline, and the attitude toward the money hoarders [macetas]. He made it clear that workers will not be laid off but that the measures adopted will surely imply sacrifices and that these measures would be in effect for some time. Costs are the key factors in the economic efficiency process, Lazcano concluded. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada also stressed the need to find efficiency as a result of internal measures and not by increasing prices. He also underscored the need to review the inflated payrolls, to prioritize self-consumption areas, stressing that there was no need to wait for the National Assembly, that decisions must be made concerning everything that can be implemented in the workplaces. Alarcon also made a valuable assessment of the Cuban socioeconomic situation before 1959. In conclusion, Pedro Ross Leal stressed the importance of keeping up this style of work and the need to strengthen it. He said we must now continue with the second stage of parliaments which consists of implementing measures in each workplace and discussing them with workers.
