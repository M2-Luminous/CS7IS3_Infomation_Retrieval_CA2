He said these reports meant sensation-seeking and attempts to pass "white for black". Chiefs of the administration now draft a resolution connected with the Russian law on the state border. Jurists consider the proposal to allocate in a number of districts of the Sakhalin region five kilometre frontier belts with special regulations for the stay of Russian and foreign citizens, but not the prohibition of their stay. It is yet early to dwell on specific features of the document. One thing is certain: it will be fully in keeping with the law on the Russian border. The Sakhalin governor himself favours the freedom of travel of citizens in the territory of their country in accordance with accepted norms.
