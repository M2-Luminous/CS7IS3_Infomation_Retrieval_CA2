FR940323-2-00128 FR940323-2-00100 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;213, 50&hyph;245, 50&hyph;336 and 50&hyph;423] Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding fitness-for-duty (FFD) refresher training to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensees), for the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut, and Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3, located in New London County, Connecticut. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would exempt the licensees from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding FFD refresher training on a nominal 12-month frequency. By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) to allow the licensees to consolidate their response to several training requirements by extending the time requirement for providing FFD refresher training to approximately 21 months. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees. The licensees state in their February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) indicates that the granting of the exemption will not impair the level of knowledge of personnel involved in the FFD program. Moreover, there will be no changes in plant operating conditions or associated routine or accidental effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives will either have no environmental impact or have a greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts attributed to this facility and would result in forcing the licensees to separate the FFD refresher training from other annual training. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements for the Haddam Neck Plant (October 1973), Millstone, Units 1 and 2 (June 1973) and Millstone, Unit 3 (December 1984). Agencies and Persons Consulted The Commission's staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated February 10, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut 06457 for the Haddam Neck Plant, and the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 17th day of March 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ronald W. Hernan, Acting Director, Project Directorate I&hyph;4, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
