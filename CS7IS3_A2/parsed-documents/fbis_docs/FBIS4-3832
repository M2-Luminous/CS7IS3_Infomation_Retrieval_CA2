A joint message of greetings was sent today to all the fire- fighters by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the State Council and the Central Military Commission. The message praised the good job done by fire fighters despite unfavorable weather conditions. There were no deaths or houses burnt, and damage to the forest was kept to the minimum, sources said. Some of the fire-fighters have begun to leave the area, and it began to snow this morning in the forest. However, forest police stayed on to watch the final dying out of the fire. A concentrated effort was made from about five o'clock yesterday afternoon when the wind weakened and the fire finally was completely extinguished by six o'clock this morning. Sources at the fire-fighting command headquarters said that more than 7,000 policemen, People's Liberation Army soldiers and local workers joined in the efforts to extinguish the fire, which broke out seven days ago. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and acting premier Zhu Rongji and other Chinese leaders had earlier sent messages to encourage the fire fighters.
