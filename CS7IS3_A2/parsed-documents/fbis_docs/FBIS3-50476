The PRI candidate said there is nothing to justify jeopardizing the lives of the inhabitants of these municipalities or threatening their peaceful coexistence. Luis Donaldo Colosio issued a press bulletin saying he was convinced that violence is not the way to solve poverty. The Confederation of Labor Organizations condemned Bishop Samuel Ruiz and his close supporters as well as the armed groups for having acted irresponsibly during the last few days in Chiapas. The organization says that the church has been the main player in many of the confrontations between the Indian community and the government, thus endangering human lives. According to a document issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the three Chiapas bishops reaffirmed their willingness to serve as mediators in the conflict between the EZLN and the authorities. In the first point of a communique, the three bishops of Chiapas State, Felipe Aguirre Franco, Felipe Arizmendi Esqivel, and Samuel Ruiz Garcia, offer their mediation based on the church's moral recognition in the region.
