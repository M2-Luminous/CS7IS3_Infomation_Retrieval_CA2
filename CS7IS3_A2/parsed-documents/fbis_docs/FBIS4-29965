FBIS4-29965 "dreas121aa_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Meeting Urges Sustainable Cities Meeting Urges Sustainable Cities OW2206143594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1126 GMT 22 Jun 94 OW2206143594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Omiya, Japan, June 22 KYODO -- Representatives from 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ended a two-day environmental meeting Wednesday [22 June] with a call for the development of sustainable cities and the protection of island nations from the effects of global warming. The call was included in a document adopted at the environment congress for Asia and the Pacific (Eco Asia `94) in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture. Senior officials from 16 governments, including five ministers, as well as representatives from eight international organizations attended the congress. The congress, the third since 1991, reviewed progress in achieving environmentally sustainable development in the region since the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), otherwise known as the earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The document, issued in the name of the conference chairwoman, Environment Agency Director General Toshiko Hamayotsu, said the region needs to shift from theoretical considerations to "concerted political and practical actions, international cooperation, and sufficient institutional and capacity building." Countries represented at the congress are home to more than half the world's population, with millions of people concentrated in rapidly growing cities. The document notes the concern of delegates over pollution and urban crowding in the region caused by rapid economic development at the expense of the environment. It urges, for the first time at an Eco Asia meeting, the development of the concept of sustainable cities. It also calls for developed countries to "change their mass consumption lifestyles, provide support for realization of sustainable development in developing countries and prevent the export of pollution." "Solid waste disposal has become a critical issue in this region," the document says. The document also incorporates a call made Tuesday by Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja to "tackle the problems" of small island states. Indonesia and a number of other Pacific nations incorporate thousands of small, low-lying islands which could be threatened if global warming causes a rise in sea levels. Although many delegates favored establishment of an Eco Asia secretariat in Japan, opinion was not unanimous and the document merely calls for "development mechanisms for smooth and effective implementation of Eco Asia activities." Malaysian Environment Minister Hieng Ding Law, who served as congress co-chairman, told a press conference after the congress that there was "a general feeling that Eco Asia should continue." "It is high time Japan should play a more significant role in implementing UNCED," Law said. "It is important to have a secretariat and a data bank."
