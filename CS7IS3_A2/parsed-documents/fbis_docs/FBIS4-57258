Besides agreeing on this, on 11 May both countries signed an agreement providing for bilateral political consultations. Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, who is making a state visit to Brazil, met with President Itamar Franco on 11 May and expressed his country's interest in signing another two agreements -- one on the promotion and protection of investments, and another one to do away with double taxation. Two business deals between both countries that are deemed promising are the supply of railroad ties and equipment for the Soybean Railroad [Ferrovia da Soja] which is currently under construction, financed by businessman Olacyr de Moraes; and the export of the SIAF [Integrated System of Financial Administration] of the Federal Data Processing Service (Serpro) for accounting and budget control. According to a source close to Itamaraty, the IMF has recommended the SIAF. This system has already been bought by Angola and Paraguay. The problem Romania encounters in purchasing this system is lack of financing. According to Vacaroiu, his country is interested in mounting an assembly line for ARO-24 all-terrain vehicles. This business venture is being undertaken with the Brazilian company Embramil [Brazilian Missile Company], which is interested in the transfer of Romanian technology for the manufacturing of different types of bombs. The prime minister announced that the Romanian company Rocar is also interested in manufacturing utility vehicles in the Manaus free zone. Rocar would also like to supply ambulances to Rio de Janeiro State, which has yet to obtain the funds for this business transaction. Vacaroiu will visit Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] and the Rio Doce Valley Company today, and will have a luncheon with businessmen from the Rio de Janeiro Trade Association. Tomorrow he will travel to Sao Paulo, where he will visit Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] and Fiesp [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries]. Romania intends to purchase planes without engines from Embraer. The engines would be supplied by a Romanian company, which manufactures the product under license from a foreign company.
