Qiao described Sino-Danish ties as "good" and reiterated that China wants to have still better relations with Denmark on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. Qiao also briefed the visitors on the reform and opening up in China, particularly the development in Tibet Autonomous Region. Peter Duetoft, leader of the visiting group and chairman of the foreign policies committee of the Danish parliament, told Qiao that the purpose of their visit is to learn about China's economic development, which is of significance to Denmark. Denmark wants to see more exchanges between the two parliaments and stronger economic ties between the two countries because China is a vast market, he said. Earlier today, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met the visitors and explained China's position on some international issues including China's view on the role of the United Nations. Qian and the Danish parliamentarians agreed that the two sides will make joint efforts for the development of Sino-Danish political and economic ties, according to a Chinese official.
