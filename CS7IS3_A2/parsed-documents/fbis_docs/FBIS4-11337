Decree No. 147 of the Cuban Council of State approved the creation of the Ministry of Economy and Planning, which will takeover the duties of the Central Planning Board and institutions such as the State Committee for Standardization, State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, and the Office of Industrial Design, among others. It also created the Ministry for Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation to replace the state committee dedicated to this sector. There is also the brand new Ministry of Tourism to replace the institution that oversaw this area. This reorganization also brought the Ministry of Finance and Prices that is tasked with fulfilling the duties carried out up till now by the State Committee for Statistics and the duties of other institutions linked to the economic field. According to the legislation, which was textually published by GRANMA, the goal is to reduce the number of institutions and adjust the duties of the government apparatus to the special period during peace time (which is the name given here to the program of special measures being implemented to face the crisis created by the blockade and the disappearance of the former socialist bloc). The legislation also states that the purpose is to better adapt the institutions to the exchanges and cooperation activities carried out by the country under the current international conditions. The State Committee for Labor and Social Security is now a ministry and the Science Academy was made the super Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment. The Ministry of Metallurgy and Electronics Industry replaced the National Institute of Automated Systems and Computer Technology (Insac) and the Combined Producer and Exporter of Electronics Technology [Combinado Productor y Exportador de Tecnica Electronica - Copextel]. The other ministries (16) and the Institutes of Civil Aeronautics, Radio and Television, Sports, Physical Education and Recreation, and Hydraulic Resources and State Reserves remain intact, the decree stated. The implementation of this decree should produce adjustments to rationalize the attribution authority and duties of the organs and organizations that were eliminated. The Council of Ministers Executive Committee will create a commission responsibility with the evaluation of adjustment proposals within 90 days. [sentence as received] In keeping with Decree-Law No. 147, the Cuban Council of State appointed Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin as the minister of science, technology, and the environment, and Osmany Cienfuegos Gorriaran as minister of tourism. Antonio Rodriguez Maurell is the new minister of economy and planning; Jose Luis Rodriguez of finance and prices; Ignacio Gonzalez Planas as minister of metallurgy and electronics industry; Ernesto Melendez Bachs as minister of foreign investment; and Francisco Linares Calvo as minister of labor and social security. The high-ranking state organ relieved Ramiro Valdes Menendez and Joel Domenech Benitez from their duties and posts of vice presidents of the Council of Ministers. It adds that the other deputy ministers, who are not also serving as ministers, will head programs and activities of various organizations or head specific tasks that will be commissioned for their importance.
