FR941019-2-00144 FR941019-2-00081 Preliminary Statement ITC, in the parlance of the proposed final decree, is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE. ITC competes in the sale of float process technology on a worldwide basis, using float technology which it independently developed from information in the public domain, supplemented by sound engineering practice and extensive expertise in the construction of float process facilities. ITC is not, nor has it ever been, a Pilkington licensee. ITC's business activities are confined to the worldwide marketing of float process technology and associated engineering and technical services. ITC has no involvement in the production or distribution of manufactured glass. The government complaint, proposed decree and the competitive impact statement evolved from a CID investigation of the license arrangements between Pilkington and its licensees, the principal focus of which was the variety of license provisions utilized by Pilkington illegitimately to perpetuate its patent monopoly of float process technology. (See complaint, ¶␣27.) The Department's conclusion that the Pilkington licensing scheme constitutes an illegal effort to perpetuate and maintain its monopoly far beyond the expiration of the core float process patents and its consequent decision to confront this deeply entrenched, aggressive foreign-based cartel is to be commended. The proposed decree represents an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible license provisions, but unfortunately it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitely eradicate the Pilkington cartel, thereby finally permitting a competitive environment to exist in the flat glass industry. The need to revisit and rethink the efficacy of the proposed decree with a view to tightening its provisions was amply demonstrated by the reaction of senior Pilkington officials to the filing of the litigation. The company's May 26, 1994 press release dismisses the government case as unprovable, and unworthy of the cost and time required to achieve judicial vindication. The Release then describes the official Pilkington interpretation of the decree as follows: The Consent Decree␣*␣*␣*␣recognizes the subsequent evolution of float technologies and that some recent float bath technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing arrangements. Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology throughout the rest of the world, remains unaffected.␣*␣*␣*␣Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the processes is protected and that the normal licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology are secure. These comments must be read against the evidentiary record developed by the Division via its CID investigation which unambiguously demonstrates that Pilkington deliberately, and with full knowledge of the illegality of its actions under United States antitrust law, proceeded to adopt and aggressively implement its illegal licensing scheme in order to shore up its monopoly position to combat the erosion of its patent base. Given its longstanding distaste for antitrust law as enforced in the United States (a common malady among British corporate officials), which continues unabated as evidenced by the above referenced reaction of its senior officials to the instant litigation, common sense and prudence dictates that the Department must take unusual precautions to ensure that the substantial time and public monies expended in the investigation and prosecution of this worldwide cartel translates into lasting and meaningful pro-competitive results. Because ITC is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE, its specific comments relative to the proposed decree reflect its perspective as one as one of the few non-Pilkington licensees to make a sustained effort to enter the float process design market in competition with Pilkington and its licensees. ITC defers to the U.S. LICENSEES in respect of the efficacy of the proposed decree in addressing the anti-competitive license provisions of particular concern to them. Specific Comments 1. Agreements or Understandings Between Defendants and U.S. LICENSEES Aimed at Preventing. Handicapping or Otherwise Interfering With Efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES to Enter the Float Process Technology Market Worldwide a. Discussions Part B_Litigation of the Competitive Impact Statement (``CIS'') at pp. 12 and 13 describes the litigation by Pilkington against AFG and Guardian, respectively, to prevent them from violating the territorial provisions of their respective licenses with Pilkington, thereby eliminating (or at least carefully controlling) competition between each of them and Pilkington. The CIS alludes to the fact that both cases were settled on the basis, inter alia , that each licensee defendant would abandon its aggressive competition with Pilkington, thereby preserving the Pilkington cartel against uncontrolled competition from its own licensees. 1 Significantly, the CIS omits any mention of another important element of the aforesaid settlement, namely agreements with each such defendant licensee to cooperate (conspire) with Pilkington to forestall the emerging competition from non-licensees which threatened to undermine the Pilkington cartel by entering the float process technology market and ending the cartel's control over both the production and sale of flat glass. 1 PPG thus remained the sole Pilkington licensee to persist in an effort to become an independent competitive factor in the industry, thereby engendering a sustained counterattack by the cartel which has effectively blocked PPG's entry date. ITC recognizes that the Department opted to file suit against Pilkington before it had proceeded very far with its broader investigation of the above-described collusive conduct among Pilkington and various key licensees designed to protect the cartel against the entry of NON-LICENSEE competitors over whom the cartel would have no control. Through discovery undertaken largely subsequent to the filing of the government suit, ITC gained access to and reviewed many of the documents previously submitted to the Department in response to the CIDs. The CID documents pertaining to the conspiracy issue deeply implicate two of the U.S. LICENSEES_AFG and Guardian_who are principal beneficiaries of the proposed decree, along with various other U.S. NON-LICENSEES. This documentary record is sufficiently compelling that in the normal course the Division would have been expected to proceed with CID depositions and otherwise aggressively pursue the investigation. In our view, had the Division completed the comprehensive formal investigation justified by the evidence in its possession before filing its complaint, not only would there have been a broader complaint involving more parties, but the proposed decree would of necessity have been much more comprehensive. As it is, ITC must now secure relief against this broad conspiratorial conduct through its own litigation efforts. Be that as it may, the complaint and proposed decree as filed nonetheless represents an important first step in a long overdue attack upon longstanding anti-competitive license provisions which Pilkington used in its increasing futile effort to prop up its monopoly position vis-à-vis its own licensees as its key patents expired. As noted, the principal beneficiaries of the lawsuit and the decree as currently structured are the U.S. LICENSEES who have finally achieved an important measure of freedom to engage in meaningful competition with Pilkington. However, neither the complaint nor the proposed decree displays any understanding of the critically important competitive role played by the U.S. NON-LICENSEES, nor does the decree contain provisions essential to enable U.S. NON-LICENSEES to freely enter and compete in the float process technology market, thereby achieving an even broader pro-competitive effect. It is, in short, all well and good for the government to take action which permits AFG, Guardian and other U.S. LICENSEES to free themselves from the anti-competitive constraints central to the Pilkington licensing scheme. However, U.S. NON-LICENSEES also have a right to expect their government to protect them from blatantly anti-competitive conduct undertaken by certain U.S. LICENSEES, albeit at the insistence of a foreign cartel manager desperate to protect itself against the competitive in-roads of NON-LICENSEE competitors. Indeed, one would expect that the Department would have a particularly acute interest, not to mention a solemn obligation, to ensure that, at the very least, Pilkington is enjoined from enforcing or implementing any agreements or understandings extracted from any of its Licensees as a condition to the settlement of litigation it initiated. Further, given what the evidence in the government's possession reveals, it is incumbent upon the Department to take corrective action to eliminate the remaining barriers to entry by U.S. NON-LICENSEES, thereby finally achieving and creating a truly competitive marketplace.
