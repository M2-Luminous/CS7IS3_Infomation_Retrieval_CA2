However, during the intensive debates in the past few weeks, those who are against rejecting the coalition offer have gradually gained a majority. "The parliamentary consequences of the elections cannot be confused with people's desires," [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto told MAGYAR HIRLAP. We interviewed Peto on the reasons why the Free Democrats had accepted the Socialists' request for starting coalition talks. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The SZDSZ convention on 5 June decided in favor of starting coalition talks, with a surprising majority for many people. According to my information, a major role was played in this by the fact that the party's prominent representatives and leaders collectively supported this idea. [Peto] The executive committee was generally united. Out of the 11 members, only Gabriella Beki and Peter Tolgyessy voted against starting the talks. Tolgyessy had not taken part in drawing up the proposal that was submitted by the executive committee to the national council and on which the convention voted. He presented his alternative proposal at the convention. Apart from this, the party's leaders were indeed united in the view that we have to start talks with the MSZP. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Immediately after the second round of the elections, you and Gabor Kuncze said that society had voted against the coalition and in favor of a one-party socialist government. Why did you change your views within a week? [Peto] On the night of the elections, we indeed said that society had voted against the coalition and had not sufficiently supported our intentions directed at setting up a balanced government. Later, we realized that the parliamentary consequences of the elections cannot be confused with people's desires. The public opinion poll results published last week clearly prove that a significant section of the electors would prefer a coalition government to a one-party government. The other reason for the gradual change of our views was that we had analyzed the consequences of a possible one-party government. It became clear that our country's international image would be different in the case of a coalition government than in the case of a one-party government. Third, the entrepreneurs who regard the SZDSZ's program as promising are expecting that we will try to implement it, but this can only be done from a governmental position. We also had to take it into consideration that, in addition to the voters of the MSZP and the SZDSZ, large groups of society find it justified to create a balanced coalition government in spite of the Socialists' absolute majority. Our decision was also influenced by the fact that, unusual in parliamentary democracies, the MSZP made a coalition offer to the SZDSZ although it had an absolute majority. The rejection of this request would have clearly had negative consequences for us. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Between the two rounds of the elections, the SZDSZ's leaders emphasized that an absolute majority gained by the Socialists would make the conditions for setting up a coalition rather difficult. Does this mean that we can expect very difficult talks? [Peto] It is perfectly obvious that, from the point of view of setting up a coalition, the situation is different when a party has absolute, rather than only a relative, majority. In a given situation, the MSZP can assert its will in Parliament on its own, therefore, it is much more difficult to conduct coalition talks under these circumstances. If the MSZP did not have an absolute majority then we would have to face different kinds of problems at the talks. In this case, the coalition would be a condition for forming a government. However, we now have a different situation because the Socialists would also be able to govern without us.
