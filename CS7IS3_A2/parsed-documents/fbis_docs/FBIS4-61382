ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI leads with a report about the signing of the treaty of civic peace and concord by a large group of representatives of the country's public organisations and business community. More than 100 public and entrepreneurial organizations and banking structures signed the treaty in St. Vladimir's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on Thursday. "The participation in the signing of representatives of the business circles signals that the nascent entrepreneurial community sees its interest in the stable development of society and is ready to shoulder its share of responsibility for stability," the newspaper writes. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Tajik Leader Emomali Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow: "There is no doubt in principle that Russia is ready to feed Tajikistan as long as it remains in the sphere of Russian influence. The time for the visit is not quite good: judging by all appearances, the opposition has finally rejected any dialogue with (Tajikistan's) government and is planning to settle the problem by military means. In this situation the powers to be in Dushanbe are forced not to discuss with Moscow economic problems but to plead for a further increase of the already sizable military assistance". The same newspaper reports from the Crimea that "President Yuriy Meshkov (of the peninsular republic) is planning to address the newly-elected parliament with a package of five bills, which form the conceptual framework of the state and legal system of the peninsula. The bills, which Yuriy Meshkov will submit to the Crimean parliament, cover such matters as citizenship of the Crimean republic, its relations with Russia and Ukraine and reform of its executive power so as to create "a strong presidential republic". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Professor Valentin Larionov, entitled "Pluses and Minuses of Partnership for Peace", which says: "It is no time to demonstrate unpredictability in foreign policy. It looks like the period of excited romantic relations between Russia and the West is coming to an end, or probably has ended already. Time is now coming for mature partnership with every subsequent step carefully weighed at home with due consideration of all pros and cons". The newspaper TRUD publishes an interview with Austrian Ambassador to the Russian Federation Friedrich Bauer under the title "Russia Must Regain Confidence in Herself". The ambassador says: "I think Russia's revival will begin in its component parts, in the provinces, in the countryside but not in the cities and not among the intellectuals. And it will proceed on the basis of a balance of interests". PRAVDA carried an article by academic Valentin Koptyug who says that "the insane policy of privatisation has dealt a stunning blow to the country's national economy and continues to shower such blows". Koptyug says he has only one description for the privatisation drive underway in the country -- "A fantastic affair on the state level". The same newspaper reports that "Karelia (Russia's northwestern autonomy) is looking forwards to the arrival from Boston, New York and other cities of America of several tens of high-class policemen, who, jointly with Russian militiamen, will patrol the streets, hunt criminals and investigate crimes from May 16-26. They will also teach Russians the art of using rubber sticks which they will give them as presents. The American police force that will land on Karelia will include experts in self-defence, preventing sexual abuse of minors, combatting drug-addiction and crime in schools and controlling infectious diseases.
