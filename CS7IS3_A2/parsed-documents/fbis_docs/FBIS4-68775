The necessity for the consultation was evident: For a number of weeks already, on both sides of the Atlantic--in the American, European and Russian press--a great deal has been said about the noticeable deterioration in the health of this "patient", who became the victim of the collateral consequences of the espionage horrors and the, in the opinion of the West, too independent initiative of Moscow in Yugoslavia. In Washington people simultaneously took offense and were distressed. They took offense when they discovered a Russian spy in the CIA. They were distressed since the Kremlin did not even consult with the White House in taking decisive steps in regard to the guarantee of the security of Sarajevo. However, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who met on the Far East shore with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, saw the problem in a different light: The signs of disharmony that called forth alarm are only growing pains. Moscow realized that it should not play in world affairs the role of the "younger brother" of the United States, which the creators of policy in Washington regarded as quite suitable for the former superpower. The Kremlin clearly declared its equality. Before the beginning of the talks, Andrey Kozyrev told an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We are conducting this meeting at the remote edge of our land and we will hold talks from the positions of mature strategic partnership." Very likely, "mature partnership" are the key words that determined the position of the Russian side. In Vladivostok it had to be clarified how the Americans view this declaration. The prelude to the negotiations--a visit by Kozyrev to the anti-submarine ship "Admiral Panteleyev"--is also perceived as a demonstration of the justification of the Russian claims. Here the minister uttered all the words necessary for the occasion. "A fleet," he declared, is one of the most powerful and flexible instruments of statehood." The guest of the Far East sailors spoke for the expansion of the Russian presence in the World Ocean, having added that "in so doing our partners will only respect us more." Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, who received the minister, picked up the subject, having mentioned that this ship completed a cruise in the Persian Gulf and cooperated there with ships of the United States naval forces. In the words of the admiral, the exercises confirmed that "the military technology and training of our ships is not at all worse than among the Americans." Christopher flew to Vladivostok a bit downcast. The day before he had held talks in Beijing that had proceeded in a rather harsh tone. Psychologically, the U.S. secretary of state, it seems, was ready to listen more favorably to Russian independence considerations: What diplomat will assume responsibility for the deterioration of relations with two great powers in the course of one trip! Although, of course, Christopher in the main followed the scenario worked out earlier. In the words of a WASHINGTON POST correspondent who had flown to Vladivostok, Christopher cautioned Kozyrev against "uncoordinated actions" that could have an impact on the Mideast peace process. According to information of a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent, the secretary of state made it clear to Kozyrev that "the United States does not perceive Moscow's actions as something natural and tried to dissuade him from too independent steps in such regions as Bosnia and Hercegovina, as well as the Near East." In his turn, Kozyrev explained that Russia cannot be kept on the sidelines when global problems are decided. Among correspondents, however, the impression was created that the discussion was quite civilized, because Christopher understands very well when Washington will act jointly with Moscow and thereby will reserve for itself the possibility of influencing the policy of its partner. It seems that Kozyrev, too, had no reasons for rejecting the American proposal with respect to a fuller exchange of information and consultations. Moreover, the Russian minister took away from Vladivostok a number of tangible confirmations of the readiness of the United States for "mature partnership." I have in mind, above all, the agreement of the Americans to Russia's participation in the work of the Coordination Committee for the Control of Arms Exports (COCOM). This organization in its time was created basically for the purpose of blocking the Soviet Union's access to Western technology. Kozyrev was also "completely satisfied" with the United States position on the transformation of the "Big Seven" into the "Big Eight" leading states through the inclusion of Russia. In short, Christopher and Kozyrev agreed that there are no serious threats to the health of the patient, and after Vladivostok he will recover completely. "Mature partnership" does not exclude disagreements, but there is no need to draw far-reaching conclusions from them.
