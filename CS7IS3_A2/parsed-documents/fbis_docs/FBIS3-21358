Karim: "Rabah Kebir Persona Non Grata in Germany"] [Text] According to a statement issued yesterday in Bonn, Rabah Kebir will be forbidden to engage in any political activity on German soil. The German foreign minister announced that Kebir had made public statements about Algerian political matters in a manner conflicting with the foreign policy of the German Federal Republic and endangering Germany's interests. The German Foreign Ministry statement added that the situation in Algeria was disturbing. Many assassinations of foreigners had been reported. The danger to foreigners in Algeria, continued the statement, had real effects on German citizens. The German Foreign Ministry indicated that Kebir had requested political asylum some time ago. The declaration forbidding him to engage in political activity on German soil follows the statement that AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE carried quoting from a close associate of Kebir, the head of the FIS' [Islamic Salvation Front] provisional executive body overseas. The statement, made in the name of this body, announced that in the period between 26 and 31 January, 45 persons had been killed by armed groups in Algeria. The source close to Kebir said that the executive body was announcing these assassinations but not claiming credit for them. The announcement forbidding Kebir to engage in his political activities, including contacts with FIS partisans and statements to the press, will be made by the interior minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, who made the request to the German federal foreign minister. Kebir has made the state of North Rhine-Westphalia his headquarters since 6 September of last year. Last Saturday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an appeal to Europeans in which he indicated that a fundamentalist regime might come to power and that this would represent an immediate danger to the Mediterranean basin. Referring to the influence of the Algerian Islamists, the German chancellor added that the missiles that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf war could be refurbished and placed in other countries. Following these changes in the official German position on the presence of Algerian Islamists in Germany, German authorities are expected soon to announce a decision forbidding Kebir from engaging in political activities. If his request for political asylum is rejected, he may be asked to leave German territory. One should bear in mind that his German residence card has almost expired. Rabah Kebir, 36 years old, a high school teacher, head of the FIS' information committee following the Batna conference in summer 1991, became the FIS's official spokesman after the arrest of Abdelkader Hachani. He was placed under house arrest in the city of Collo after January 1992. He has lived in Germany since August 1992 with his wife and five children after being able to leave Algeria in the company of Oussama Abassi. He began to move politically in November 1992 and requested political asylum from the German authorities. Although he has received no response to date, he continues to enjoy German laws that allow foreigners to engage in political activities normally, including making statements to the press. At the end of May 1993, the special court in Algeria sentenced him to death in absentia in a case involving the bombing of the airport. Through Interpol, Algerian authorities presented the German Federal Republic with a request for his detention. The German police detained him on 7 June 1993. He was released three months later, on 6 September 1993. The Munich court stated that the documents submitted did not prove that Kebir had participated in the bombing of the airport. Kebir subsequently chose the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he has resided until now. Perhaps for security reasons, Rabah Kebir has chosen secrecy during the last three months. His contact with the press now takes place through one of his close associates. On 17 December, he emerged to hold a press conference in Bonn, where he enunciated positions described as "a positive turn" in the position of the overseas FIS leadership regarding the appointment of President Liamine Zeroual and continued dialogue, though with conditions. With the decision to forbid Kebir from political activity, the EC's appeals to combat violence and terrorism and tighten the grip on FIS partisans on European soil have gained a response from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after an initial step taken by Charles Pasqua [the French interior minister] last December.
