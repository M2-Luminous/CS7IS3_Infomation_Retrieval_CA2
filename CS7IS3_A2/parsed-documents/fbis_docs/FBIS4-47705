This was the view of senior ANC executive Mac Maharaj who said on Sunday [1 May] the movement's concern in heading the next government was stability. "Mr Mandela will reach out to these minority parties and bring them into government," he predicted. The one condition would be that they were parties of "substance", he said, "not like the Federal Party or KISS [Keep It Straight and Simple Party]". "For instance (Freedom Front leader) Constand Viljoen; he may only get four per cent. The law requires five per cent (to get a cabinet post) but he will be brought in for the sake of stability." Other parties which may fail to make the cut-off, such as the Democratic Party, are certain to meet the requirement of "substance". It is also certain that any such inclusions would not be agreed to by what is emerging as the ANC's only real opposition, State President F. W. de Klerk's National Party [NP] which appears to be exceeding intitial expectations by a large margin. The NP is nevertheless not likely to exceed the one-third mark by much and will jealously keep whatever cabinet posts it is entitled to. Any "gift" cabinet posts for smaller parties will have to be at the cost of the ANC.
