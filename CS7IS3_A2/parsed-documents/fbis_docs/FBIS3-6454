Wisber Luis, director general for foreign economic relations in the Department of Foreign Affairs, said this to reporters in Honolulu today in conjunction with the two-day informal meeting of APEC finance ministers that starts there today. According to Wisber Luis, currently the institutionalization of APEC is not proceeding normally because its activities are taking place outside of normal senior official and ministerial meetings. Indonesia -- which will host this year's informal APEC summit -- will call for more dialogue and consultations on macroeconomic matters during the finance ministers meeting in Honolulu.
