Hydro-Congo announced, according to state radio, that petrol and diesel fuel supplies must be limited to 30 litres (eight U.S. gallons) per vehicle per day, while selling in jerrycans is totally forbidden. The latter measure aims to counter the flourishing black market of recent weeks, which has seen a litre of fuel selling for 1,000 CFA francs (3.4 dollars) instead of the official 600 CFA francs (two dollars). Political trouble has led to the closure of the rail link from the capital to the west African nation's oil city, Pointe-Noire, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) to the east, which has a refinery. Bacongo, an opposition stronghold in the capital, was calm Monday, following clashes on Friday between armed supporters of the government and the opposition which left four people dead, according to witnesses. Relative calm was reported from other parts of the capital, but sporadic shooting was heard overnight in the Talangai district in the north of the city. Several women's associations called Monday for an end to the violence, which has left at least 93 people dead since early December, according to a tally compiled from hospital reports.
