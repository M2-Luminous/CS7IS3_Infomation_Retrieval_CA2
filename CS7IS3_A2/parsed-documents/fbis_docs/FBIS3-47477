The official said Japan thinks there is no need to change the summit format from that of the Seattle meeting last year, and added that other APEC member countries are of the same opinion. At China's insistence, the U.S. Government did not invite Li to the first summit in APEC's four-year history in Seattle on November 20. Instead of Li, Taiwan's top government economic planner Vincent Siew attended the 17-member APEC economic forum before the summit meeting. The original members of APEC, founded in 1989, are Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, and the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan joined the consultative forum in 1991. Papua New Guinea and Chile were also granted admission at the Seattle summit.
