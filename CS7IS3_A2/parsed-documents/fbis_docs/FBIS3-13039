FBIS3-13039 "drnes046__a94011" FBIS-NES-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 09 March 1994 ANNEX Israel Commentary on `Giving Into Demands of Hamas Via PLO' TA0603164294 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (SHABAT supplement) in Hebrew 25 Feb 94 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA0603164294 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (SHABAT supplement) Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Commentary by Ze'ev Binyamin Begin: "Talking With Hamas"] [Text] Shim'on Peres has been treading a tortuous road from the "malodorous maneuver" of Jerusalem 1990 to the malodorous maneuvers of Oslo 1993 and Davos 1994. Two weeks ago he proudly recounted how he overcame disagreements with 'Arafat in Davos. "You were once a terrorist," Mr. Peres told Mr. 'Arafat, "but today you are an ex-terrorist." The exterminator of vermin sprinkled some holy water on "the chairman," and peace descended on Israel. So much for sycophancy and its wages. In an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES last week, 'Arafat accused Israel of conducting an "evil plan" by giving out weapons to Arabs in the Gaza District in a bid to bring about a civil war. "Procrastination in the negotiations will lead to anarchy," the bearded righteous man warned, thus rewarding Peres' holy water with a shower of spittle. The PLO leader is preparing himself an irrefutable alibi. He says that even after he is given control of Gaza and Jericho (first) terror will continue from there ("anarchy"), and he preemptively holds Israel responsible because it is "giving out" weapons. This ignoble murderer is being defended by the Israeli Government, and cabinet ministers say he should not be defeated too often. This is not a new excuse. "If we do not talk with the PLO, we will have to talk with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]." On the eve of Purim, the following verse from the Book of Esther can aptly be applied to the issue of terror: "Before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him." The moment one begins giving in to terror one will go on capitulating to it, and whoever decided to talk to the PLO is actually conducting a dialogue with Hamas. Pieces of evidence accumulated recently show that the Israeli Government is giving in to the demands of Hamas via the PLO. Two weeks ago in Cairo the foreign minister signed an Israeli undertaking to grant amnesty to terrorists, and Nabil Sha'th hastened to explain that the PLO cannot let Hamas members, "the enemies of peace," rot in prison. Of course, all of them will be released within months so as to uphold 'Arafat's status. At the PLO's demand, the prime minister promised two weeks ago in the Cairo agreement not to arrest Hamas murderers who stand to be released from jail at the border crossings "only" on the basis of suspicions that they are planning terror attacks. They will cross the Allenby Bridge with their amnesty papers so as to uphold 'Arafat's status. At the PLO's demand, it was decided in the Cairo talks that membership in Hamas alone will not be sufficient grounds for an Israeli demand to question (or even interrogate) a person wishing to enter Gaza and Jericho from either Egypt or Jordan. Hamas members will freely roam through the border terminals so as to uphold 'Arafat's status. In a meeting with high school students last week, the chief of staff asserted that the murders committed by Hamas serve the PLO's objectives well and complement them. The prime minister does not have a plan. He gets dragged after events, trudges to meetings with "the chairman," suggests that he sweat it out, makes his foreign minister sweat it out, and signs -- after perfunctory cringing -- the documents presented to him by his notoriously tireless adversary. In yet another of his well-known witticisms, Mr. Rabin announced last week that it is his job to say "no" to the striking university lecturers, just as it is his job to say "no" to the PLO. However, in recent months he has been neglecting the latter "so as to uphold 'Arafat's status." After the signing of the Oslo agreement, the prime minister warned 'Arafat not to use the title "president of Palestine," and last week he declared that any attempt by the PLO to run its affairs from Jerusalem would be a gross violation of the agreement. It did not take long for 'Arafat to retaliate. He published an advertisement in the East Jerusalem paper AL-NAHAR in which he announced the opening of the Palestinian Center for Statistics in...Jerusalem, and signed it with his three titles: "Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, and chairman of the National Palestinian Authority Council." Mr. Rabin has kept mum so as to uphold the status of his friend Yasir, in light of the pressures by Hamas. The Israeli Government's policy has had a simple and destructive result: The PLO has become a lever with which Hamas is pushing Rabin's government to make concessions with regard to the rights of the Jews in their land and the minimal demands for their security. What follows is ceding the chances of peace.
