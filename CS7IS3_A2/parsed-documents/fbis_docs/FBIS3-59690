However, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries compiled test results showing that at the present time there is no such worry about Japan's young reactors. It is thought that a reactor vessel will be damaged by the weakening of the vessel walls as the reactor gets older, and in the U.S. there is the argument that such damage is linked to the age of the reactor. When a reactor vessel is used for a long time, it is known that the materials weaken because of the vessel's exposure to the neutrons resulting from the nuclear fission within. If the emergency reactor core cooling unit goes into operation in an old pressurized water reactor, there is the danger of the vessel cracking because of the sudden temperature change. Although that sort of brittleness breakdown has never yet occurred, there are indications that the danger of breakdown increases when the deterioration of the vessel due to its age is added to poor conditions such as the presence of small cracks. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Takasago Laboratory (Takasago City, Hyogo Prefecture) produced simulation test materials that behave the same as actual reactor vessel materials with respect to the force applied to the vessel because of cooling, the deterioration of the vessel materials due to neutron irradiation, and the existence of cracks. The researchers then verified what happens during cooling under a variety of temperature conditions. The results of the tests showed that, even in a reactor vessel that has been used for 40 years, the destructive force resulting from thermal shock would not exceed the strength of the materials. The laboratory's judgment is that that will not occur in Japan's reactors, which have been in operation for as long as 20 years. The tests, which have been carried out at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Takasago Laboratory since 1983, were commissioned by the Electrical Power Facilities Technology Inspection Association, a non-profit corporation that is an auxiliary corporation of MITI.
