Depending on whether the government and the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] change their stance, the DP said it would publicly condemn, or bring suits against, those involved in the scandal. The opposition party also threatened to publish the records of investigations by the prosecution or the military as newspaper advertisements, taking the case directly to the people. The decision was made at a meeting of the party's supreme council presided over by Chairman Yi Ki-taek Friday morning. The meeting concluded it was meaningless to pursue the National Assembly investigation into the scam because of the government's and the DLP's non-cooperative attitude, especially in checking out official documents and tracing checks, sources said. Consequently, the parliamentary investigation that started May 21 was suspended nine days early. The National Assembly had originally decided to conduct the probe until June 19. The DP had demanded the investigation, claiming that a construction company owned by Cho Ki-hyon created a slush fund out of profits it made from a defense contract. The opposition party alleges that part of the fund was funnelled into the ruling party during the 1992 presidential election.
