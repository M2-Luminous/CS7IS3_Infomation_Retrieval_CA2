FR940418-0-00044 FR940418-0-00012 The language of §2.2, Agent for receipt of process, is amended to reflect that the General Counsel is also the agent for receipt of process for each individual member of the Board when the member is acting in his or her official capacity. The language of paragraph 2.4(b), which describes the Postal Service emblem, registered by the U.S. Patent Office, is moved to §221.9 of part 221, General Principles of Organization. Part 3_Board of Governors (Article III) Former §§3.1 and 3.2 are combined into a new §3.1, Responsibilities of Board, and language duplicating 39 U.S.C. 202 is deleted. Duplicative language is likewise deleted from renumbered §3.2, Compensation of Board. For ease of reference, §3.3 is amended to contain only matters reserved for decision by the full Board. New §3.4, by contrast, contains matters reserved for decision by the Governors only. Other changes in part 3 were made. New paragraph 3.3(c)(2) is added to provide for Board approval of the Postal Service operating budget. Language is added to paragraph 3.3(e) to provide that projects above an amount specified by annual Board resolution must be brought to the Board for approval. New language in paragraph 3.3(j) (approval of borrowing authority) clarifies what is intended by the term ``short-term borrowings,'' and it eliminates the phrase ``purchase money obligations,'' which is no longer used in the finance industry. Paragraph 3.3(k) (approval of terms and conditions of obligations issued by the Postal Service) also is updated to parallel the new language in paragraph 3.3(j). Paragraph 3.3(m) (determination of number of officers) is simplified to remove the titles of specific officer positions that could change. Likewise, the names of specific positions were removed from paragraph 3.3(n) (compensation of officers at Level II of the Postal Career Executive Service). Section 3.6 is revised to specify the types of key reports currently provided to the Board. Paragraph 3.7(d) is added to enhance program information provided to the Board. Section 3.8 is changed to provide for furnishing the Board with information concerning proposals for exclusive licenses to use Postal Service intellectual properties, other than patents and technical data rights, or proposals for joint ventures involving the use of such property. Section 3.9 is deleted; its language describing the Office of the Board of Governors was transferred to §2.1. Part 4_Officers (Article IV) Section 4.3, Postmaster General, is simplified to delete language duplicating statutory language found at 39 U.S.C. 202(c) and 203. Similarly, §4.4, Deputy Postmaster General, is simplified by removing language duplicating 39 U.S.C. 202(d) and 203. Section 4.5 is shortened by deleting outdated titles for officers. Section 4.7 is changed to describe more closely the current duties of the Secretary of the Board, and to clarify that the Secretary is appointed by the Governors. Part 5_Committees (Article V) Section 5.3 is deleted as duplicative of the statutory language on compensation of the Board in 39 U.S.C. 202(a). Part 6_Meetings (Article VI) Section 6.1 is amended to reflect that the Board meets normally on the first Monday and Tuesday of each month. New language provides that the time or place of a regular or annual meeting may be varied by a unanimous vote.
