FBIS4-4334 "dreas062_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 South Korea Circulates Draft Statement on DPRK Circulates Draft Statement on DPRK SK3103072194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0702 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK3103072194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] United Nations, March 30 (YONHAP) -- China circulated a draft of the U.N. Security Council president's statement Wednesday urging North Korea to accept additional inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The mildly worded draft statement was being offered by Beijing, Pyongyang's only remaining major ally, as an alternative to a U.S.- drafted resolution on the North Korean nuclear dispute. Although the contents of the statement and the resolution are similar, the Chinese draft does not set a deadline for the IAEA director-general to report back to the Security Council on the progress of IAEA inspections. The Chinese version also modifies a clause in the draft resolution that says the council will consider follow-up measures if necessary, changing it to "the council can consider the North Korean nuclear problem again if necessary." Meanwhile, the four other permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- circulated the U.S.-drafted resolution among all council members after they failed to strike a compromise with China on its contents. At Wednesday's meeting, China and such non-aligned members as Pakistan, Rwanda, Nigeria, Oman and Djibouti said they preferred that the Security Council adopt the "consensus" formula, which calls for the consent of all members. Since this consensus formula means in effect a presidential statement, the council was leaning toward adopting the Chinese version after modification of its wording, according to sources. The Security Council is expected to hold another informal closed-door meeting Thursday (local time) and, depending on the outcome of negotiations on the wording, the council could adopt a presidential statement the same day. The Chinese representative at the United Nations, Chen Jian, told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that an absolute majority of Security Council members favored the consensus formula. "This is a positive signal that the Security Council would adopt a presidential statement," he added. Chen also reaffirmed that China would never go along with a resolution, but he gave no indication that he would veto the resolution if the council was forced to vote on it. The council president, Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, said negotiations between the United States and its allies and China will continue as their positions remain far apart.
