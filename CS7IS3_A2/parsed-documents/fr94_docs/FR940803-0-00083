SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of March 23, 1989 (54 FR 12009), which announced that Miles, Inc., Agricultural Division (formerly Mobay Corp., Agricultural Chemicals Division), P.O. Box 4913, Kansas City, MO 64120-0013, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9F3724 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for residues of the fungicide tebuconazole ( alpha -[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]- alpha -(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on the raw agricultural commodities barley grain at 2.0 parts per million (ppm), barley grain forage at 5.0 ppm, barley straw at 5.0 ppm, grapes at 2.0 ppm, grass seed cleanings (including hulls) at 25.0 ppm, grass seed straw (including chaff) at 30.0 ppm, peanuts at 0.05 ppm, peanut hulls at 3.5 ppm, peanut hay at 50.0 ppm, raisins at 3.0 ppm, wheat grain at 0.40 ppm, wheat grain forage at 4.5 ppm and wheat straw at 19.0 ppm. Miles, Inc., has amended the petition to propose amending 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit the residues of the fungicide tebuconazole in or on peanuts at 0.1 ppm and peanut hulls at 4.0 ppm. This was announced as a notice in the Federal Register of June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29291). In previous amendments to the cited pesticide petition, requested by Miles, Inc., all commodities other than peanuts and peanut hulls (peanut hay, barley grain, barley grain forage, barley straw, grapes, grass seed cleanings including hulls, grass seed straw including chaff, raisins, wheat grain, wheat grain forage, and wheat straw) were withdrawn. Comments on the Amended Notice of Filing Comments have been received in reponse to the June 6, 1994 notice of filing. Comments were received asserting that tebuconazole concentrates in peanut oil, based on the previously proposed food additive petition (FAP) for tebuconazole in peanut oil and the assumption that tebuconazole therefore concentrates during processing in peanut oil. The commenter asked how EPA could proceed to grant the section 408 tolerances for peanuts without also addressing the section 409 food additive regulation for peanut oil. EPA's response . Tebuconazole does in fact concentrate in peanut crude oil. However, EPA does not regulate peanut crude oil; instead, EPA regulates the peanut refined oil used in commerce and consumed by humans. Initial tebuconazole peanut processing studies and the resulting proposed food additive regulation in/on peanut oil indicated concentration of tebuconazole in both peanut crude and refined oil, but those studies did not represent commercial peanut oil refining procedures since they did not include oil bleaching and deodorization. A subsequent peanut processing study did include oil bleaching and deodorization and these additional refining operations, which are used in commercial peanut oil refining, resulted in a 93-percent reduction in tebuconazole residues. Therefore, a section 409 food additive regulation for tebuconazole in/on peanut oil is not required. Tebuconazole has been shown to concentrate in peanut soapstock. Based upon recently acquired information, EPA has found that peanut soapstock is no longer used as an animal feed. Therefore, an FAP for tebuconazole in peanut soapstock is not required. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance include: 1. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 34.8 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day) (400 ppm) and a lowest effect level (LEL) of 171.7 mg/kg bw/day (1600 ppm) in males, based on decreased body weight gains and histological changes in the adrenals. For females, the NOEL was 10.8 mg/kg bw/day (100 ppm) and the LEL was 46.5 mg/kg bw/day (400 ppm) based on decreased body weights, decreased body weight gains, and histological changes in the adrenals. 2. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 200 ppm (73.7 mg/kg bw/day in males and 73.4 mg/kg bw/day in females) and a LEL of 1000 ppm (368.3 mg/kg bw/day in males and 351.8 mg/kg bw/day in females). The LEL was based on decreases in mean body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption, and an increase in liver N -demethylase activity. 3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day (40 ppm) and a LEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day (200 ppm), based on lenticular and corneal opacity and hepatic toxicity in either sex (the current Reference Dose was determined based on this study). A subsequent 1-year dog feeding study, using lower doses to further define the NOEL for tebuconazole, defines a systemic LOEL of 150 ppm (based on adrenal effects in both sexes) and a systemic NOEL of 100 ppm. 4. A 2-year rat chronic feeding study defined, a NOEL of 7.4 mg/kg bw/day (100 ppm) and a LEL of 22.8 mg/kg bw/day (300 ppm) based on body weight depression, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and MCHC, and increased liver microsomal enzymes in females. Tebuconazole was not oncogenic at the dose levels tested (0, 100, 300, 1000 ppm). 5. A rat oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 60 mg/kg bw/day based on elevation of absolute and relative liver weights. For developmental toxicity, a NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 60 mg/kg bw/day was determined, based on delayed ossification of thoracic, cervical and sacral vertebrae, sternum, fore and hind limbs and increase in supernumerary ribs. 6. A rabbit oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day based on depression of body weight gains and food consumption. A developmental NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day were based on increased post-implantation losses, from both early and late resorptions 7. A mouse oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 20 mg/kg bw/day based on a supplementary study indicating reduction in hematocrit and histological changes in liver. A developmental NOEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day based on dose-dependent increases in runts/dam at 30 and 100 mg/kg bw/day. 8. A mouse dermal developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 60 mg/kg bw/day based on a supplementary study indicating increased liver microsomal enzymes and histological changes in liver. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in the dermal study in the mouse is 1000 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested (HDT). 9. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a dietary maternal NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day (300 ppm) and a LEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day (1000 ppm) based on depressed body weights, increased spleen hemosiderosis and decreased liver and kidney weights. A reproductive NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day (300 ppm) and a LEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day (1000 ppm) were based on neonatal birth weight depression. 10. An Ames mutagenesis study in Salmonella that showed no mutagenicity with or without metabolic activation. 11. A micronucleus mutagenesis assay study in mice that showed no genotoxicity. 12. A sister chromatid exchange mutagenesis study using CHO cells that was negative at dose levels 4 to 30 m g/ml without activation or 15 to 120 m g/ml with activation. 13. An unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) study that was negative for UDS in rat hepatocytes. Additionally, a mouse oncogenicity study at dietary levels of 0, 20, 60, and 80 ppm for 21 months did not reveal any oncogenic effect for tebuconazole at any dose tested. Because the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was not reached in this study, the study was classified as supplementary. A followup mouse study at higher doses (0, 500, 1500 ppm in the diet), with an MTD at 500 ppm, revealed statistically significant incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in males and carcinomas in females. The initial and follow-up studies, together with supplementary data submitted by Miles, Inc., were classified as core minimum. The Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effects Division's Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee (CPRC) has classified tebuconazole as a Group C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen). This classification is based on the Agency's ``Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment'' published in the Federal Register of September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33992). The Agency has chosen to use the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from tebuconazole residues. EPA believes any cancer risk to humans from consumption of tebuconazole residues to be negligible. The Reference Dose (RfD) is established at 0.01 mg/kg of body weight (bwt)/day, based on a lower NOEL of 1 mg/kg bwt/day from the first of two 52-week feeding studies in dogs, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from the current action is estimated at 0.000007 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 0.07 percent of the RfD for the general population of the 48 States. The TMRCs for the most highly exposed subgroups, children (1 to 6 years old) and children (7 to 12 years old) are 0.000024 mg/kg bwt/day (0.24% of the RfD) and 0.000017 mg/kg bwt/day (0.17 percent of the RfD), respectively. The nature of the residue in peanuts is adequately understood. An adequate analytical method, high-pressure liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Miles has withdrawn proposed tebuconazole tolerances in animal tissues, milk and eggs. The Agency has determined that, with the label restriction against feeding peanut hay, there is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs or meat of livestock or poultry as a result of the proposed use on peanuts. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
