FR940523-2-00060 FR940523-2-00040 Health Care Financing Administration [BPD&hyph;782&hyph;PN] RIN 0938&hyph;AG45 Medicare Program; Noncoverage of Electrostimulation of Salivary Glands for the Treatment of Xerostomia (Dry Mouth) AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Proposed notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the Medicare program's proposal not to cover electrostimulation of the salivary glands for the treatment of xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome, and electrostimulation devices, such as the Salitron System. Public Health Service (PHS) studies show that there are insufficient data to establish the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate its long-term effectiveness, and to identify those xerostomia patients who would benefit from this procedure. Also, PHS reports that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as a treatment for xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Therefore, it does not meet HCFA's criteria for effectiveness. DATES: Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail written comments (1 original and 3 copies) to the following address: Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Attention: BPD&hyph;782&hyph;PN, P.O.
