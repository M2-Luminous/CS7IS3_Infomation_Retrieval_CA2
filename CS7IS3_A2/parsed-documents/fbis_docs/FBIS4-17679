They are Yegor Gaydar (Russia's Choice), Sergey Shakhray (Unity and Concord Party), Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party), and Ekaterina Lakhova (Russia's Women). The document will be signed in the St. George's Hall in the Kremlin on April 28. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yavlinskiy's faction) and Gennadiy Zyuganov (Communist Party) said they did not intend to sign the accord. Yavlinskiy told journalists that he has no need to sign an agreement with Gaydar, but he does not want to sign such an accord with Zhirinovskiy. The Communist Party at an all-Russian conference over the week- end declared that the signing of the document was not meaningful since "sources of confrontation" remain. The Agrarian Party, led by Mikhail Lapshin, links its signing of the accord with the conclusion of an agreement between the cabinet and farmers on the guaranteed state purchase of crops. The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, is to adopt a decision on Tuesday. Although Zhirinovskiy sets a number of terms (including the resignation of six cabinet ministers), he considers signing the accord possible "as a compromise, enabling further progress." The New Regional Policy faction, led by Vladimir Medvedev, has so far been undecided since some members have been for and others have been against signing.
