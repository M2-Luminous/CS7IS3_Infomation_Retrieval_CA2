On one stood three old Bolsheviks and two old Bolshevik women, in ripped shoes and threadbare clothing. Their demands: "Down with the Bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and Balashov! Long Live the USSR!" Only two out of the five inscriptions were in Ukrainian. Across the street stood three UNA-UNSO leaders and one person from Rukh. They were equally old and wore similarly shabby clothes. They were in full agreement with part one of the others' slogans, which concerned the bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and Balashov, who were here additionally described as `kikes'. As to point two, concerning the USSR, their point of view was diametrically opposed. The sides could not find a compromise and, in the absence of the `bourgeoisie' and `kikes', tediously cursed one another. Before the picket lines was the band of National Guard, cheerfully playing four pieces which included "Higher and Higher," "The Slavic Woman's Farewell" and "Red Cranberry Tree". The "Cranberry Tree" song was played when Grynyov made his appearance, and when Kuchma showed up he was greeted with "Aviator's March." O, Ukraine, the red beet country! The MBR Grand Ball brought together more than 1,000 people. But the girls manning the tables where delegates from western Ukraine were registered seem unemployed; nor were there many people around tables assigned to central Ukraine. But those for the Left Bank, the South and the Crimea were swarming with people. The proceedings began with the throne speech by Leonid Kuchma. It was convoluted and long. The speaker announced that the process of building a state on national romanticism has been a failure and condemned the "manic reform movement." Then he developed a profound idea that some forces of darkness stuck a wedge between fraternal peoples and "knocked them out of the market". Having declared that the USPP-MBR block is as strong as ever, he offered a three-point program, consisting of stabilization, fundamental restructuring and a geopolitical course toward a union with Russia. Then he discussed regions and a federal structure. At the end, the speaker reassured the audience that "the election is not being left to its own devices." Immediately following was Balashov, the leader of the city's MBR, the head of the Political Initiative Center and the king of Dnepropetrovsk's pedestrian underpasses, which are filled with his stores. Getting to the heart of the matter off the bat, he declared that the first thing would be to get rid of Kravchuk and to elect a responsible president, and it was obvious who that would be. At that, both Grynyov and Kuchma smiled. After that came the best part. Mr. Balashov spelled out the path of reform. It was a very smart path, since it easily and quickly threw together everything: free circulation of all existing currencies combined with strict controls over the export of resources, a federal system combined with centrally allocated investment funds. At that point my neighbor, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine and a professional economist, turned very pale and inquired of no one in particular: "Lord, what is this nonsense?" Then there was the usual: one speaker after another chewed over the few general ideas. Primarily, these were a federal structure, the introduction of Russian as a second state language and, of course, an "economic and political union" with Russia. They mentioned that union so often that our picket lines at the Supreme Council could easily have competed with them. The intensity of their wish for a union seemed to match Galicia's bitter hatred of it. Another theme was the need to kick out Kravchuk and to get in "our" president, with every third speaker complaining that the party in power would sabotage the elections and then introduce presidential rule. Blessing the podium with his presence was a special guest, a people's deputy to the Russian Duma, the head of the Budget and Planning Commission, who touchingly addressed the meeting as Brothers and immediately stated that "it is not the people who have decided to draw borders." Judging by the reaction in the audience, the portion of the people who gathered there in fact did not like borders. Among other things, speakers proposed to transform the MBR into a party. Volodymyr Filenko, the PDVU leader, showed himself in the best light by announcing that he was ready to build such a party along with everybody else. Well, he is an experienced fellow: having built two parties already, the PDVU and the New Ukraine, he has not tired of it yet. But the strangest thing was that this glorious bloc of reformers said almost nothing about the economy. There were some vague statements about the market for land and even more vague ones about privatization, but nothing concrete. In Galicia, it is our habit to criticize our dear National Democrats for their insufficiently developed economic programs. But life can be understood only by comparison. I suddenly realized that next to the MBR conference, Pynzenchyk, Chernyak, Shandryuk and Zlupko together with Pylypchuk, and even our oblast assemblage of Rukh, URP and New Wave adherents, are a veritable economic academy. The only person who disturbed the calm and quickly became distasteful to the high and mighty Grynyov-Kuchma gathering was Serbin, the construction minister, who began to introduce overly concrete proposals on the economy, infusing a dissonant note into the proceedings. He left the podium amidst sarcastic silence. At the end of two sittings the situation was sufficiently clarified. Mr.Grynyov moved that candidates for deputies sign forms declaring that they represented the MBR, which was a type of pledge which carried all of the bloc's principles on the obverse. There were some arguments about them: apparently, disagreement centered on the formulation "demanding a federal-regional structure for Ukraine." But everyone wanted bilingualism, and immediately. As to the Union, everything went smoothly in this area. The same was true about the economy; apparently, no one even bothered to read that part. Adventures started only during the press conference. Responding to questions, Kuchma ardently defended federalism and the regions, but then suddenly declared that he did not like the regional economic experiment in the Donetsk-Dniestr region. After that, following half an hour of holding forth by Grynyov about the market for land and private land ownership, it turned out that Kuchma believes that the most promising economic structure in agriculture is the kolkhoz. Things got even more jolly when Grynyov and Kuchma were asked who of the two of them would be president. To this, Volodymyr Borysovych replied that they might find a third and split it three ways. In the presidium, there was a third man, Balashov, the king of pedestrian underpasses, and this suggestion caused much hilarity in the audience; it only grew when Balashov, the number one specialist in buying and selling issues, began to hold forth about the importance of the producer. A healthy journalistic laughter greeted Leonid Kuchma's reaction to the question about the connection between the MBR an the Civic Congress. To his credit, Leonid Danylovych found no appropriate lie but blushed and muttered: "Yes." It is always a pleasure to see a real person, especially if it is your fellow-Ukrainian, suffering from a desperate case of the "little brother" syndrome. Emboldened, we too asked Grynyov whether he understands that the MBR's platform starts an open conflict in Ukraine. I hope that Volodymyr Borysovych will forgive me, but his response was like a hedgehog in the fog: in general, he fears confrontation, but sticks a conflict on the outside. It is not difficult to sum up the second MBR conference. A force representing western and southern Ukraine, and partially the Center and the Trans-Carpathian region, has been formally organized and will take the field before 1 December. It functions much more elegantly than the crude Bloc-239, and in general it is much better packaged. These are no odious Commies but very polite gentlemen. They all have education, money and image. They are the old economic bosses and other nomenklatura, of course, but in the past four years the old first, second and even third party secretaries and their entourage have become completely acceptable pros, now labeled as pragmatic reformers, bankers and entrepreneurs. The dream candidates for the Russified East. Perhaps the reader already feels horrified and is getting ready for a military confrontation on the banks of the Zbruch. But let us not rush, since I have saved the best for last. The most interesting thing about the MBR gathering was not who was there but who was not. Thus, there was not a single person from Markulov's Liberal Party, which has considerable influence in Donetsk. There was no one from the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, which is very popular around Kharkov. There was Retelnish, but as an observer; they summed up the event laconically as a "gathering of the political dead." There were no regional PDVU organizations from Odessa, Lugansk, western Ukraine and many central oblasts. More than a dozen of regional civic organizations from the South and East were missing, ranging from the Kharkov Professional Union to the Odessa Forum, which are very influential in their own oblasts. The Constitutional Democrats and many others were absent, as well. Dnepropetrovsk's major powers that be, their highnesses the directors, were not present. I purposefully go through the entire Russian-speaking political spectrum of the East and South, without mentioning an Ukrainian-speaking parties, centrists or rightists; let us be realistic, they are rather weak there. Finally, ABSENT was the uncrowned king of Russian-speaking free-market reformers of Ukraine and the god of the liberal camp, Volodymyr Lanovoy. Their absence is very telling. It indicates a process that has been going on quietly for three years. The Russified East has split in two. Some, although continuing to insist on their Russian language and even ethnicity, no longer want to joint the one indivisible Mother-Russia. The problem is that the dear land stinks: it has Zhirinovskiy, chaos and confusion. It also likes to pick others' pockets, which nobody likes. So they worry about facing a home-grown Karabakh and want no federations or unions. At the most, they want a supply of concrete inputs for their factories. A stamp in the passport and Ukraine citizenship are gradually becoming a reality for them. It is interesting that the Russian-speaking intellectual elites have joined this camp. Meanwhile, our dear nomenklatura, true to form, is marching toward its coveted Russian shore, which is natural: folks of their own kind are there, perhaps turned from red to white, pink and even crimson, but their own kind none the less.
