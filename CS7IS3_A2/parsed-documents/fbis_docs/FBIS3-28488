FBIS3-28488 "dreas026_c_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 North Korea Remarks by Japan's Ozawa on Nuclear Issue Decried SK0802105294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1040 GMT 8 Feb 94 SK0802105294 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Japanese Reactionaries Must Immediately Stop Anti-DPRK Smear Campaign" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), reportedly appeared on the TV scene on February 6 and spun out a string of spiteful words against the DPRK, saying "North Korea has already completed nuclear weapons" and it "has no doubt equipped itself with nuclear arms". This is malicious slander and unpardonable, open challenge to the peaceloving DPRK which has no nuclear arms. Ozawa unhesitatingly spread the fiction of "nuclear armament", going far beyond the limit of "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK over which the Japanese reactionaries have raised a hue and cry up until now. Judging from this, one can see to what extremes their anti-DPRK intrigues have gone. Ozawa made such tricky remarks adding fuel to fire at a time when a grave crisis that might push the situation to a catastrophic phase has been created due to the despicable perfidy of the United States, prompted by an extremely sinister intention to force the DPRK at any cost to accept the demand of the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a total inspection, and seek international "sanctions" and pressure to isolate and stifle the DPRK by misleading world opinion. It is not hard to gather that lurking behind it is also a wicked intention to justify Japan's nuclear armament and design to turn it into a nuclear power and hasten this in real earnest by spreading the fiction of the North's "nuclear armament". Japan launched a large nuclear-capable carrier rocket H-2 on February 4 and is soon to ignite Monju, its first fast breeder reactor. A series of facts clearly prove in practice that the Japanese reactionaries' moves toward a nuclear power now are being stepped up in a very grave phase. This is, indeed, a grave obstacle to the denuclearization of Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and poses a big threat to the Korean and other Asian people. The Japanese reactionaries' stepped-up nuclear armament is aimed at gratifying their criminal design of overseas aggression the first target of which is the Korean peninsula. Such aggressive design of theirs was fully manifested in the fact that Ozawa made no scruples of uttering meaningful words saying Japan's countermeasure for the event of "contingency" on the Korean peninsula should be examined. It is as foolish as trying to destroy a rock with their heads to attempt to stretch their tentacles of reinvasion against the DPRK in collusion with the United States. We are following with heightened revolutionary vigilance their anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves, and our people and People's Army will never pardon those who try to infringe on their national sovereignty and dignity. The Japanese reactionaries must look squarely at the steadfast will and determination of the Korean people and act with discretion and promptly stop the anti-DPRK intrigues.
