We had thought we might be spared this peril, but now it is upon us. Nearly one French-speaking voter in 10 decided on Sunday [13 June] not just to show their dissatisfaction with the traditional parties, but also to reject the democracy which is a credit to our European countries. That is the sad but important lesson of this European vote, in addition to the collapse of the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] and the victory of the PRL [Walloon Liberal Party]-FDF [Brussels French-speaking Democratic Front]. Experience abroad has shown us that these extremist votes cannot be eradicated in just a few years. They reflect a lasting malaise which requires long-term action by the democratic parties. But let us first forcefully remind all those who wanted to "vent their frustration" by voting for the FN [National Front] or Agir [Act] that these votes will remain a surface irruption, without real effect. These parties will never share in the exercise of power and are no more than a movement of negation, a turning inward that offers no solution to the serious problems to which they are seeking to draw attention. A vote for the extreme right is in fact a "cry for help." Very often the cry of people directly hurt by the crisis, whose lives are affected by insecurity, poverty, and unemployment. Sometimes people who believed in the solutions of the PS but feel let down by the scandals that have brought disgrace to the political class. This electorate, often inhabiting areas with a high immigrant population, seeks and finds a scapegoat in "them." The democratic parties, those who have won today and those who have lost, must be careful not to console or absolve themselves by simply pointing to the -- real -- danger of this extreme right. They must attack the very roots of the evil. They must restore ethical values to the political debate, combat the pockets of poverty and exclusion that are the breeding ground for extremism, and take real account of the problems of society that were so discussed in November 1991 but that so often, in the interests of government budgets and state reform, failed to result in action. Insecurity remains a sensitive point. The democratic parties were wise to keep silent on the problem of immigration during the campaign. But what have they really done to support the former Royal Commission on Immigration, and now the Center for Equal Opportunity, in the struggle for the harmonious integration of communities which are in any event here to stay, whatever the dangerous harbingers of the far right may like to think? The far right has now come crashing into our political system. The essential task for the future is to provide a democratic solution to the sickness which has found such scandalous expression.
