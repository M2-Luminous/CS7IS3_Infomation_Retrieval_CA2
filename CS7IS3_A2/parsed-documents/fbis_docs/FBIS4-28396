Today's session was a continuation of two previous sessions held in the past two weeks. The bill contains 78 articles. During today's session the debate by opposition MP's continued to attack the government's presentation of the bill to parliament. They said the bill does not benefit the Thai people. The motive for enactment of the copyright law is to exchange it for trade privileges from the United States. The debate by opposition MP's opposed protection for computer software, which is considered a type of literary work. Any duplication or use without consent by software copyright holders is punishable by law because it constitutes a violation of copyright. To protect copyright software amounts to hindering national progress because opportunities for students to study computers and programming will be limited despite the fact that computers are a technology and equipment for modernization. Opposition MP's also asked the commission in charge of the copyright bill to withdraw the bill for review. They said they disagreed with the bill from the beginning, as evidenced by their rejection in the first reading and their refusal to join the commission in the second reading. They will boycott any deliberations at the next reading. They then walked out of the session at 1600. Before concluding at 1655, the session voted to approve the copyright bill in the third reading so the bill will now be forwarded to the Senate for consideration.
