Angeloz stated that "nobody has rejected the idea of sitting down around a table to discuss the UCR's future," although he acknowledged that "everyone is trying to talk it over with friends, and with the other members of their faction." He added: "De la Rua asked for more information, more details. I told him all I could, and next week we will probably continue the conversation we started this week." [passage omitted] Angeloz also denied having considered the possibility of becoming the UCR's presidential candidate for next year. He asked "what is the point of a ticket if the appropriate tool, that is, the party, has not been sharpened?" He added that it is "much too early" to talk about an electoral alliance between the UCR and the Grand Front for the upcoming presidential elections. "The Constituent Assembly is the first step that we must take to find out when the incumbent president will step down, when the elections will be held, and what it is that the people want," he said. He concluded that he was "absolutely sure" that the people's interests were "different" from those of the politicians, and urged the leaders to "understand and grasp" what it is that the people want.
