FR940314-2-00014 FR940314-2-00005 A wide range of alternatives will be considered in managing the insect impacted timber stands. A preliminary list of alternatives includes: _No change to current management _Harvest the dead and dying trees _Burning of infested areas _Stand treatment based on its visibility from the Scenic Byway _A combination of any or all of the above _Other considerations identified in the analysis process There are no known permits or licenses required to implement any of the proposed alternatives. The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the Federal Register . It is very important that those interested in the proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact Statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC , 435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Environmental objectives that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement. City of Angoon v. Hodel, 9th Circuit, 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final. It is estimated that the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) will be released for public review in August 1994. The Final EIS is scheduled to be released in November 1994. Implementation of the project could occur by late fall of 1994 or the Spring of 1995. After the 45 day comment period ends on the Draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the Final EIS. The Forest Service is required to respond to the comments received in the Final EIS. The responsible official is the District Ranger. The responsible official will consider the comments, responses and environmental consequences discussed in the EIS and applicable laws, regulations and policies in making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to review under 36 CFR part 215. Dated: March 4, 1994. Tom L. Tidwell, District Ranger. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5802 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
