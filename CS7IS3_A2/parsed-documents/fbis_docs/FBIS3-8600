The Czech Government also needs a partner. This is why we hope that the Slovak Government crisis is quickly over. I would like to thank Prime Minister Meciar and the outgoing Slovak Cabinet for their correct attitude with regard to Czech-Slovak relations and, above all, for our joint patient search for constructive solutions in the tense moments when our common state was splitting.
