Thus, the nuclear powered submarine Kasatka commanded by Captain 1st Rank A. Yefanov made a transit from the Northern Fleet to the Pacific Fleet in the period from 16 August through 12 September. After covering thousands of nautical miles in the watery depths of two oceans and beneath Arctic ices, the Kasatka moored safely at a berth in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. In the opinion of Rear Admiral M. Motsak, senior officer of the deployment, the submariners demonstrated a high training level and the ship showed the reliability of equipment. The traditions of Arctic under-ice deployments, which you can read about on pp 91-94 of this journal issue, continue. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.
