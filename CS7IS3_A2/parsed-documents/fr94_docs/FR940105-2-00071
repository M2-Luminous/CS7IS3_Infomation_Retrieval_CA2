FR940105-2-00071 FR940105-2-00031 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;52 (Sub-No. 76X)] Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co._Abandonment Exemption_in Harper County, KS The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (SF) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon a 1.84-mile line of railroad on its H&S Subdivision from milepost 258+2,120 feet to milepost 256+2,993 feet at or near Harper, in Harper County, KS. SF has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic can be rerouted over other lines; and (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirement at 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies), 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), and 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expressions of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on February 4, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 3 must be filed by January 18, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by January 25, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be routinely issued by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Energy and Environment in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt, of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Peter M. Olson, 1700 E. Golf Road, Schaumburg, IL 60173. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. SF has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effect, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Energy and Environment (SEE) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by January 10, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEE by writing to it (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEE, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: December 28, 1993. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr. Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;169 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
