In the first defection of its kind since fighting began in Bosnia over two years ago, the two pilots landed here near the headquarters of the Bosnian army's Third Corps last Wednesday at 3:00 pm (1500 GMT), according to a senior officer who wished to remain anonymous. Their Russian MI-17 "HIP" helicopter, painted in the Bosnian Serb colours of red-blue-white, was quickly repainted in Bosnian army colours and is still making test flights at a Zenica barracks. An AFP journalist saw it in flight, two days after its arrival. The story was confirmed to AFP by western military sources in the sector. The motive of the defectors remains unknown. An officer at the barracks, speaking to two western journalists Monday morning, confirmed the presence of the two Russians but said it was "impossible to see them or speak to them without the agreement of the Third Corps command." The corp's press service refused to confirm or deny the story and said the command was not informed about the affair. Another Bosnian Army officer said the two Russians did not plan to stay and fight with the mainly Moslem army, which in any case "needs arms rather than men to defend itself." He said the two had brought "presents to prove their good intentions," but did not specify what the gifts were. The MI-17 is a heavy transport or assault helicopter, a valuable catch for the badly equipped Bosnian airforce. A western military source said the pilots -- whose motives for defecting were not revealed -- arrived from the east, apparently from Serb lines in the Mount Vlasic area. They first flew over the outskirts of Zenica for a long time, probably to allow time to negotiate their defection over the radio, he said. There have been many cases of Russian soldiers fighting alongside Bosnian Serb forces, either as mercenaries or sympathisers. On May 5 IZVESTIYA interviewed a Russian mercenary who said he had served for three years in Bosnia for 200 deutschmarks (120 dollars) per month.
