Movladi Udugov, head of the Chechen Department of Information and Press, told this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent today in a telephone interview. He noted that the preliminary analysis of the new decree "on the introduction of a state of emergency in parts of the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Republic of Ingushetia" has not led to any undue concern on the part of the Chechen leadership. Movladi Udugov said that the villages in Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons, which have been included in the state of emergency zone, are not under dispute. They were Ingush before the administrative and territorial division of 1934, when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was set up. At the same time, Movladi Udugov said, official Groznyy considers it unjustified to extend the state of emergency zone on the territory of Ingushetia. In his view, "Boris Yeltsin is artificially pushing the expansion of the emergency zone in order to create tension with Chechnya." Movladi Udugov believes that because Ingushetia is a part of Russia, whereas Chechnya regards itself to be outside Russia, in principle the Chechen-Ingush border should be defined. Ruslan Aushev and Dzhokhar Dudayev have therefore signed an appropriate treaty on the principles of defining borders. The borders established before 1934 were taken as the basis for this.
