Seen as one of Cambodia's bid to woo investors, funds may be remitted freely out of the country. Even investors who do not export their goods or services and deal solely in local currency are entitled to the benefits of this regulation, as they can convert their revenue into foreign currencies without restriction. But there is a need for the legislation, when passed, to be backed by strong legislative support pertaining to the definition of investment returns which can be remitted home. If there was a strong need for legislative support, there is a more urgent note to provide a framework within which the transfer of investment will work. In Cambodia, the responsibility lies with two bodies to perform these functions. They are the National Assembly and Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC). CDC, a regulatory body set up to study and make recommendations on investments and development, is presided over by the First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Its main function is to advise investors, define incentives that investors are entitled to, grant them approval and very quickly check any questions that the investors might invoke. With CDC, the bulk of responsibility of administration and bureaucracy will generally be taken away from ministries and be delegated to the organisation to function as a "one-stop investment service" centre. Therefore, CDC should take the initiative to carefully structure a set of rules to act as a guide to investors on dos and don'ts. This is the time to put Cambodia's house in order. There is no point in crying over spilt milk and making amends after going wrong. This is especially important as CDC will also serve as the industry and trade justice council. If CDC can lead the way in putting order to Cambodia's economy, it will not only benefit the country, but also lend credibility to the organisation.
