President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has imparted instructions for full execution of the government's 2 March pledges, and after the EZLN's refusal to comply eight days ago, the same orders were imparted. The reached agreements, as well as changes in the judicial system, Hernandez has said, are needed by the communities that will benefit from them. Regarding the funds earmarked for the war zone, 1 billion pesos, the Peace Commission member has said a large percentage of that money is for such services as health and highway infrastructure in three areas: jungles, mountains, and border regions. Another considerable portion will be used for education, although productive projects will not be neglected. The federal government must finalize its programs for electricity, a rural telephone system, and potable water for the townships by October. Efforts are also being made in the area of education. A significant number of elementary school children will be included in the school system in September, particularly in communities that have irregular school systems. It is expected that production projects will have been agreed upon and operational by June and July if the federal and state governments finalize their plans and clearly prove their desire to execute actions which, once and for all, will create a better future and a more optimistic outlook on life for the Chiapas communities. The government wants a return to peace that will foster better living conditions for the communities in that state. Hernandez said it is necessary for both sides to yield. We will be able to find ways of reaching agreements and working together as long as they have the resolve to do so. Hernandez concluded that as the elements emerge, "we will solidify in time, form, and space the general agreements reached at the beginning of March in San Cristobal de las Casas.
