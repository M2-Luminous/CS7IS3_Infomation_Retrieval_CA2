FBIS4-13399 "drnes076_m_94009" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 JORDAN Two `Religious Extremists' Reportedly Arrested Two `Religious Extremists' Reportedly Arrested JN1704105894 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 17 Apr 94, p 3 JN1704105894 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [Text] Amman--Police have arrested the leader and a member of a group affiliated with the so-called Arab Afghans after a chase and gunfight in Amman, security sources said Saturday [16 April]. They confirmed a report in the local press that a 38-year-old man identified as the head of the group described as religious extremists who sought to undermine national security and a member of the faction were detained on Thursday. The sources identified the leader by his initials as W.I. and said his arrest was a major breakthough in investigations into a series of sabotage and attempted sabotage in the country over the past few months. A car used by the two was intercepted after a chase and gunfight during which a policeman was wounded in the leg, the report said. The vehicle yielded an assortment of weapons, it said. Investigations were continuing. Friday's arrests raised the number of suspects detained in connection with extremist plots in the past few months to 35. Twenty-three of them were earlier expected to be put on trial in mid-April charged with plotting and carrying out subversion through bombings at public places. But, with the new arrests, it is expected all the 35 could be put on trial together as a single group, the sources said. Most of the suspects have confessed and reenacted the crimes and attempted crimes in the presence of prosecutors, security official said. The trial was expected to start in mid-April, but investigations and gathering of evidence are continuing. "It might take some weeks before the cases are sent to court," said one source. Details of the charges faced by others and the time of their arrests remained sketchy, but the sources affirmed that there was enough evidence to prove that most of them had plotted to destabilise security and create chaos in the country. It was also not clear whether all the suspects were linked with each other. The sources said there appeared to be two or three small groups operating independent of each other, possibly under orders from a single faction or individual. However, one of the threads that bound all was their background as "Arab Afghans"--volunteers who fought with the Afghan Mujahedeen against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan--of affiliation with them, according to the sources. Apart from the 23 who are expected to go on trial soon, at least 10 others are reported to be members of a shadowy organisation calling itself "Jihad Islami Organisation," whose leader was arrested on Friday. The group's members had carried out several hold-ups of taxi drivers and other places and were planning to rob banks to raise funds to buy arms before they were arrested, reports said. Parliament members representing the Islamic Action Front (IAF) met with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali last week with an appeal for the release of some of the detainees, whose number they put at 73. According to the sources, some of those who fought in Afghanistan were detained for interrogation immediately upon their return home over the past months. It was not immediately clear whether prosecutors had been able to establish any link between them and those who were arrested in connection with the bombings and attempted attacks in Jordan. IAF officials stressed that they were not intervening on behalf of any of those who were found to have been involved in subversion, but that many of the detainees were innocent of any crime and therefore should be released. Most of the "Arab Afghans" are believed to be ex-members of the Muslim Brotherhood who broke away in protest against the moderate policies followed by the leadership, experts on Jordanian Islamic movements say. "Although they are no longer active members, the Brotherhood has no choice but to intervene on their behalf to protect its own image with the ranks and file," said an expert and long-time observer of the movement. Senior Brotherhood leaders have dismissed as baseless report in Europe-based Arabic-language magazines that some of the suspects were directly linked to the movement. The Brotherhood might even file lawsuits against those magazines for defamation, the leaders said.
