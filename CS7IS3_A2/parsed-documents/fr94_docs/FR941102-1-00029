FR941102-1-00029 FR941102-1-00006 Section 42.6␣Notice of District Manager's Decision After an informational meeting, if requested, has been held, the district manager would proceed to issue a decision on the proposed action issued under §42.6. Proposed §42.6 would provide guidance to the district manager for the form and content of his or her decision. Proposed §42.6(a) would set a time limitation for the district manager to act after the administrative record closes in a decertification case, and would provide that the decision be based on a complete evaluation of the whole administrative record. The district manager would have 30 days to issue a decision once the administrative record closes. MSHA believes that the 30-day period is an appropriate amount of time for the district manager to carefully review and consider all of the evidence, and to issue a written decision. Under proposed §42.6(a) (1), (2), and (3), the Agency's district managers would have the power to suspend a person's certification for a finite period of time; permanently decertify the individual with no opportunity for reapplication; or allow the district manager to take any other appropriate action such as requiring the individual to undergo additional training or testing to retain his or her certification. This range of options would give the district manager authority to address each case in a manner that would be tailored to the facts presented by each case. For example, while the Agency has recently permanently decertified seven people after criminal convictions stemming from respirable dust fraud, 73 people have also been temporarily decertified for periods ranging from one to four years for respirable dust fraud. Additionally, two training instructors have been permanently decertified and one training instructor has been temporarily decertified for a three-year period. One person has been temporarily decertified to perform noise surveys for a two-year period and two individuals have been permanently decertified from performing noise surveys. One individual has been temporarily decertified as an approved electrical qualifications instructor for a two-year period. The above pleas or convictions, and related decertification actions, were the result of criminal charges for offenses ranging from the creation and/or submission of fraudulent respirable dust samples and cards, noise surveys, and training certificates, through conspiracy, mail fraud and charges under the Racketeer Influence Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. When the district manager determines that temporary decertification is appropriate under proposed §42.6(a)(1), MSHA contemplates that at the end of the suspension period the temporarily decertified person would not be automatically certified but would make application as any other person to obtain certification. He or she would be required to fulfill all procedural steps for certification, as well as any additional special conditions that the district manager might have imposed when the certified person was temporarily decertified. For example, if a certified person was temporarily decertified and allowed to reapply for certification pending the completion of certain training, the certified person would need to demonstrate that the training had been completed prior to reapplying for certification. MSHA has provided procedural guidance for recertification under proposed §42.10 of this rule. The proposed rule under §42.6(a)(2) would allow a district manager to order permanent decertification for any person who had shown evidence of a significant disregard for the health or safety of miners. For example, the Agency believes that egregious behavior, which may constitute a serious violation of safety and health regulations, exposes miners to unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and presents a clear disregard for the safety or health of miners, would warrant the sanction of permanent decertification. MSHA's aforementioned permanent decertifications to date have focused on such demonstrated behavior. The proposed rule under §42.6(b) (1) through (6) would require the administrative record to include certain information. The content of the administrative record is important in that it would give the certified person a basis for understanding the nature of the action being taken against him or her and would provide documentation of the evidence underlying the action. In addition, the district manager would have the ability to review all the relevant facts and information in the case before reaching a decision. This information would include the notes or transcript from any informational meeting which was held, as well as other relevant evidence. MSHA believes that other relevant evidence may include background information such as information on the mine or mines where the certified person worked; relevant correspondence between the district manager and the certified person concerning the decertification action; any relevant documentary evidence such as certification papers, or certification examinations; possible district investigation reports on the actions of the certified person; and any witness statements which were made as part of the informational meeting or submitted separately to the district manager. Within 30 calendar days after the close of the administrative record, the district manager would review and evaluate all submissions to the record, and send a written decision to the certified person informing him or her of the results of the district manager's review.
