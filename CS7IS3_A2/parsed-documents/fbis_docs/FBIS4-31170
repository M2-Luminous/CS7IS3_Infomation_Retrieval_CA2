Efforts to Enter Difficult Japanese Market"] [Text] The meeting of both countries' economic committees demonstrated that, in many areas, cooperation is developing dynamically, while the Japanese Government's decision to unblock the granting of guarantees for merchandise contracts and investment activity in the Polish market may particularly enliven the cooperation, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak after a meeting with Toshikuni Yahiro, chairman of the Japanese-Polish Committee. Polish firms have a chance to enter the Japanese market provided their products are qualitatively perfect and meet any standards observed in Japan, and that they know how to win the confidence of Japanese customers. How this should be accomplished was the subject of the second day of debates at the 15th Session of Polish and Japanese Economic Committees. The Japanese stressed that, in the new reality, Poland could occupy a central position in the region, being placed between Russia and countries of the European Union. But the Poles should learn to promote their merchandise because export capabilities and product competitiveness are a guarantee of commercial success in the international market. Marketing success depends on product quality--the Japanese have particularly high standards in that regard--and on price, distribution, and promotion, said Hideo Kimura of Sophia University. The Japanese will help us with the promotion part. Hajime Yoshioka, director of the Tokyo International Fair, officially invited Polish firms to participate in the 1995 fair. Within a program of acceleration of economic reforms and development of the countries of Central and East Europe, we can also count on help in organizing the firms' stay in Tokyo and on product promotion provided by the JETRO Japanese Foreign Trade Agency. Speaking about the sources of Japanese success, Hideo Kimura stressed the role of state interventionism and of management and collective decisionmaking. He emphasized that state policy and a specific strategy, as defined by multiyear plans, were being consistently implemented. The role of corporations and holdings in the economy is also worth emphasizing. Only such strong industrial/commercial/financial organizations are currently capable of meeting the requirements of international markets. But, due primarily to a big cultural difference, not all Japanese experiences can be directly implemented in Poland. Japan is a large and perfectionist market, while Polish products are often far from meeting the quality standards in effect in Japan, Wladyslaw Szczepankowski, chairman of the Agropol company, told NOWA EUROPA. But my company has been active in the Japanese market, and we score quite decent results--$80 million in mutual exchange. We sell mostly grocery products but also crystal and furniture. But it is hard to speak of promotion or marketing because that requires very high expenditures, which Polish producers simply cannot afford.
