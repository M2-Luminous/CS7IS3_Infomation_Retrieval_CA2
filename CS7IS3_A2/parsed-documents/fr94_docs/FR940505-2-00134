FR940505-2-00134 FR940505-2-00096 Environmental Impact Statement: Marion and Ralls Counties, Missouri AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed project in Marion and Ralls Counties in Missouri. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald Neumann, Federal Highway Administration, P.O. Box 1787, Jefferson City, Missouri 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;636&hyph;7104; or Mr. Bob Sfreddo, Design Engineer, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, P.O. 270, Jefferson City, Missouri 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;751&hyph;2876. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to relocate U.S. Route 61 in Marion County. MHTD has determined that the relocation of U.S. Route 61 would accomplish several goals: (1) Provide a dual-lane bypass around the city of Hannibal, (2) improve safety and capacity for through-traffic on U.S. Route 61 and reduce local traffic congestion, and (3) promote economic development and planned growth in Marion and Ralls Counties. 1. The proposed highway project begins in the vicinity of the intersection of U.S. Route 24 and U.S. Route 61 and runs generally southeasterly for about 11 miles where it rejoins existing U.S. Route 61 just south of State Route M. The proposed facility would provide a four-lane, limited-access roadway with interchanges at major arterial crossroads. 2. Alternates under consideration include ``build'' alternatives and ``no build'' alternative. 3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping process will be initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. Public hearings will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or MHTD at the addresses provided above. Issued on April 22, 1994. Donald Neumann, Program Review Engineer, Jefferson City. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10824 Filed 5&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
