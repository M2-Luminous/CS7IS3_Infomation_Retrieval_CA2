FBIS3-57616 "drsov019_a_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Jan 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Ministry Denies Japanese Article on Secret Report LD2701162094 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1430 GMT 27 Jan 94 LD2701162094 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Vladimir Gondusov] [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan -- The Information and Press Department of Russia's Defense Ministry today described an article in the Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN as "utter fiction and a provocative fabrication." The article claimed the existence of a secret report entitled "The Military Policy of the Russian Federation Toward the Asian-Pacific Region in New Political Conditions." Extracts from the report were reprinted in several Russian publications, which cited SHUKAN BUNSHUN as the source. The SHUKAN BUNSHUN report alleges that "the center for military-strategic analysis" of the General Staff of Russia's Ministry of Defense prepared a report, marked "especially secret," on the involvement of 160 Russian nuclear scientists in nuclear research in North Korea. It said that Russian specialists had helped to develop North Korean nuclear warheads and the medium-range Nodong-1 missile. Extracts from the report were supposed to have been forwarded to the U.S. Defense Department on 22 October 1993, under the serial number 001 SM-137, after it had been read by Boris Yeltsin and Pavel Grachev. The Defense Ministry told ITAR-TASS that "there is no such center for military-strategic analysis." "There is a center for military-strategic research" but "not only did it not prepare such a report, it has never even heard of it." The Defense Ministry does not use serial numbers of the type mentioned in the article. It does not have the classification "especially secret." It uses "top secret" instead. The Information and Press Department describes this "sensation" as "totally concocted."
