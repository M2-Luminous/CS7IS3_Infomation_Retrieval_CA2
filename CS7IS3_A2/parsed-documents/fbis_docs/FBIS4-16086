We Do Not Conceal This Fact"] [Text] Visiting Card Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus. He was born in the village of Savichi, Dyatlovskiy Rayon, Grodno Oblast, in 193? [precise date illegible]. His father died at the front in 1945. He graduated from the Lvov Fire Technical School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Later he graduated by correspondence from the law faculty of the Belarusian State University and worked in internal affairs organs. His last post before being elected a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus in 1990 was as chief of Vitebsk Internal Affairs Administration. In parliament he headed the Standing Commission on National Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime. He was elected to his present post 28 January 1994. He is a lieutenant general in the reserve. [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, your election to the post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belorusia [Belarus] came as a surprise to many people. Moreover, you won in a contest with two other aspirants who had, as they say, a clear advantage.... [Hryb] Quite honestly, the voting results came as a surprise to me too. I was not burning with a desire to take up the post of Supreme Soviet chairman, realizing perfectly well what a heavy burden this would prove to be, given the situation that had taken shape in the Republic. When my candidacy was proposed at a session of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I refused categorically at first. But members of the Presidium persuaded me to run, and my deputy colleagues supported me by voting for me. After that there was no getting out of it, and I had to get down to work.... [Kovalev] It has to be thought that you are familiar with the views of certain of the mass media on your election. In particular, IZVESTIYA viewed the replacement of the Belorusian parliament's leadership as a "quiet," procommunist, nomenklatura coup.... [Hryb] These are nothing but journalists' fabrications. We have had no coups -- neither quiet nor noisy. The majority of the deputies simply elected in a legal, constitutional manner the person whom they evidently trust more. In all parliaments in the world a representative of the majority is elected speaker, not one of the minority. If he suddenly stops expressing the opinion of this majority, someone is elected in his place. Then again, any coup, if one really takes place, pursues the aim of changing the former course. But we still abide by all the previously concluded treaties and agreements, and we still intend to build a market economy and a democratic state. It is only to be regretted that individual journalists invent something that does not, in fact, exist. [Kovalev] All the same, Mechyslaw Ivanavich, how would you define your position in the political spectrum? [Hryb] I am not now a member of any parties, movements, or factions. I adhere to a firm principle: Party membership and excessive political blinkeredness might affect the objectivity of judgments and decisionmaking by the state's top official. I am ready to cooperate -- I say this sincerely -- with representatives of any trends, ranging from extreme right-wingers to extreme left-wingers, if they have an equally sincere wish to work in the name of the Republic's interests. My aim is to find accord and to reach a consensus, although I realize that it is a supercomplex task to unite left- and right-wingers, but it is possible and necessary to seek a compromise when resolving individual questions -- within the bounds of what is reasonable, of course. [Kovalev] The adoption of the Republic's new Constitution was, to a certain extent, confirmation of the correctness of your position. Contrary to predictions, the constitutional process, which had long been marking time, has gotten moving. Although, as far as I know, both the parliamentary opposition --the Belorusian People's Front -- and the communists' faction had serious objections to many points in the Fundamental Law.... [Hryb] Yes, there were many disagreements -- fundamental ones, too. It is probably immodest to view this as being to the personal credit of the Supreme Soviet chairman, and yet I believe that I succeeded in convincing the majority of deputies that there must be no more delay: The Republic cannot go on living without clarity in the state system. [Kovalev] The new Constitution is a very long document, and it is hard to evaluate it in a few words. And yet.... [Hryb] I believe that we have adopted a normal democratic constitution of a normal democratic state. It was worked on for more than two-and-a-half years. During that time it underwent more than one expert juridical appraisal, including abroad, when it was confirmed that it complies with international legal norms. Human rights take pride of place in the Constitution, the state system of Belorusia as a sovereign, unitary, social, legal power is clearly defined, and the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are separated. I believe it is destined to have a long life. Of course, certain changes might be made -- there are no limits to perfection -- but it will hardly be necessary to alter the spirit of the Fundamental Law cardinally. It accords with the interests of our society and with the aims we have set ourselves. [Kovalev] However, significant and important an event for Belorussia the adoption of the new Constitution was, it does not, alas, push into the background the many very acute problems which the country has encountered. What, in your view, is the root of the troubles? Why does the Republic, which always stood firmly on its feet, now find itself in such a complex situation? [Hryb] The main reason is obvious: the breakup of the former Union. Name just one Republic where people are prospering today. There are difficulties everywhere, problems everywhere. Therefore, I find it hard to agree with the assertion by the former speaker of our parliament, who declared recently that he was proud of his involvement in signing the agreement at Viskuli. I believe, however, that, since the Soviet Union was fated to die, it was necessary to do everything possible to make that process less dramatic and less painful. To go our separate ways with the smallest losses in the economy, to maintain ties, to adopt clear pledges, not to try to survive at the expense of others. Unfortunately, it all happened according to the worst scenario. We have what we have. But what is the point in grieving? We must seek the way out of the present situation. Nobody will do this for us. [Kovalev] On what do you pin hopes of a better future for the Republic? [Hryb] Above all, on our people, who are sensible, competent, calm, industrious, and patient. I very much hope that they will not have to resolve all their problems on their own. We do not conceal our vital interest in union with Russia. Our countries are very closely linked in all spheres, and our peoples have regarded each other as brothers from time immemorial. Even if we take a purely pragmatic look at our ties, then -- and this is a fact -- more than 70 percent of all the industrial output produced in Belorussia is delivered to the east. Who, now or in the very near future, could take Russia's place as our trading partner? [Kovalev] But Belorusian national radicals are being heard to say that such a one-sided orientation threatens a loss of sovereignty for the Republic and its transformation into a virtual colony of Russia.... [Hryb] This talk is groundless. Let us investigate. Does the Russian leadership really impose political terms on us? No, we are talking of an economic union, of which there are many in the world. Incidentally, those who believe that integration is advantageous to our country alone are mistaken. Pardon me, but Russia is also interested in Belorusia in terms of many parameters. True, we hardly have any of our own energy sources, and we have few raw materials, but we are in an advantageous strategic, geopolitical position, and there is transit of gas, oil, and huge freight flows via our territory. Russia needs the output of our enterprises, including defense output. So we are not poor relations, and we build our ties with our eastern neighbor on an equitable, mutually advantageous basis. Regarding political unification, which allegedly threatens our sovereignty, there have been and are no top-level talks on this topic. Russia does not encroach upon Belorusia's independence -- I state this unequivocally. The precise conclusion of an economic union between our states is now on the agenda. The unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorusia must be the first step toward this. Unfortunately, this is a very protracted matter. Finally, it is necessary to decide: What is to be done now? If it is not possible to sign the treaty in its entirety, let us bring it into force in sections, on which the sides have already reached accord. For example, on lifting customs barriers and on tax policy, if this does not work, it means that it is necessary to draw up a new text of the agreement. Just one thing is inadmissible: to sit idly by and watch the destruction of the age-old ties between our peoples. Our descendants will never forgive us for that. [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, with the adoption of the new Constitution the first presidential election clearly looms ahead. Who, in your view, might win it? [Hryb] I believe that the candidate for those forces which represent the majority in the present parliament is most likely to win. I will refrain from a more specific prognosis, for the official registration of candidates is still to come. [Kovalev] Do you intend to run for the presidency? [Hryb] I have not yet decided. I must give serious thought to everything and weigh it up -- it is too crucial a step. [Kovalev] Do you not exclude the possibility that a representative of the Belorussian People's Front might attain presidential power? You will agree that in that case Belorusia's foreign policy priorities might undergo serious changes -- the opposition has never concealed its anti-Russian sentiments.... [Hryb] I do not believe that this will happen. Any realistically thinking politician must reckon with the fact that the majority of the republic's population pins its hopes of a better life on Russia. Therefore, attempts by any of the contenders to play the anti-Russian card during the election campaign are doomed to fail. The people will not support such a politician -- I am sure of this. [Kovalev] Before being elected to the post of Supreme Soviet chairman you headed the parliamentary Commission on National Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime. You are now ex officio chairman of the Republic's Security Council and supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces. How would you rate the condition of the national army today? [Hryb] In my view we have succeeded in creating perfectly battle-worthy armed forces. Their reduction and reorganization have taken place and are taking place strictly according to plan. The process of reforming the army will be virtually complete by 1 January 1995, and it will attain its optimum strength of approximately 100,000. This does not mean, however, that there are no problems in military organizational development. The chief problem is the shortage of funds to buy hardware, arms, fuels and lubricants, spare parts, ammunition, and much besides that the troops need. The situation is complicated by the fact that the enterprises that exist on the Republic's territory are now able to meet only approximately 3 percent of hardware and armament requirements and to repair just 2 percent of the more than 4,000 existing models of these. In this connection the question of close cooperation with other countries -- with Russia above all -- in the military sphere is once again thrown into sharp relief. This is the very reason why I always advocated Belorussia's subscribing to the CIS Collective Security Treaty. And yet, despite the considerable difficulties, I hope that we will succeed in maintaining the combat potential of the Belorusian Armed Forces at the proper level. Even under the present complex conditions we have not allowed the curtailment of the training process in the armed forces. Measures are being taken to enhance the prestige of military service and servicemen's social protection. Work has begun on creating a military academy in the interests of resolving the Army's personnel problems. [Kovalev] But approximately 25,000 servicemen of Russia's Strategic Forces are also stationed on the Republic's territory.... [Hryb] I am sure that Russian officers and soldiers do not feel out of place on Belorusian soil. None of us will ever call them occupiers. Incidentally, we are not raising the question of an accelerated Russian troop withdrawal -- here everything is proceeding according to the agreed schedule, with due regard for the wishes of the Russian side. The Belorusian Ministry of Defense has established good, comradely ties with colleagues in the Russian military department. I hope that this will continue to be the case. I would like to take this opportunity to send very best wishes to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers and to the editorial collective. Your newspaper seeks to provide objective and balanced coverage of events occurring in our Republic and in its Armed Forces. This is valued highly nowadays.
