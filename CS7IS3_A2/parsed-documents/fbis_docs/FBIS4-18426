He added that the process for implementing the CBM's has been terminated due to the negative stance of the Turkish side. The UN secretary general's representatives, the spokesman said, submitted proposals that they considered to be fair and to meet the concerns of each side. The Greek Cypriot side, the spokesman continued, cooperated in full and reacted constructively, in contrast with the Turkish side. Kasoulidhis also stressed that no political advantage the Turkish side is trying to gain through the CBM's process can be accepted.
