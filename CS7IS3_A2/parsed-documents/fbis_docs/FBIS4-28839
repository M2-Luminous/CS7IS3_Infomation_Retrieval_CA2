"The government expresses serious concern at North Korea's announcement that it will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation for the IAEA Board of Governors' recent sanctions resolution against North Korea," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. "The government warns North Korea against worsening the situation regarding the nuclear problem," he said. Pyongyang should know that the international community will take a harder line through a U.N.

"The government advises that North Korea accept the will of the international community and return as a responsible member of the world community," the statement said.
