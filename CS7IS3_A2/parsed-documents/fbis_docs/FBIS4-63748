General Podkolzin Relies on False Information"] [Text] When SEGODNYA published in its 19 May issue a statement by General Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops, that Russian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia have helped slash Russia's debt to the United Nations from $1.5 billion to $200 million, it expressed its doubt as to whether the information was relliable. Now we have full justification for calling it false. According to our information, Russia's debt to the UN Fund of Peacekeeping Operations stands at around $550 million. In the past two years (the period to which Yevgeniy Podkolzin referred), not only has the debt failed to shrink, but it has even grown. Payments due to Russian servicemen for participation in UN operations do not count toward debt payment. The Russian paratroopers receive from the UN fund just as much as servicemen of other countries -- around $1,000 per person per month. The rest is paid by the countries that have sent their contingents. Alas, the Russian Government does not pay any extra money -- hence a significant gap in wages. Therefore, the "export" of peacekeepers does not bring Russia any earnings. Nor does it have any bearing on the Russian contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Fund -- this is another sum of money and another debt.
