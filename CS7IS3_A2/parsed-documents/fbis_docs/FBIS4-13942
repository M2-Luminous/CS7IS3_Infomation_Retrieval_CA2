The Algerian diplomat's address unveils a total ignorance of the stances of each side and of the evolution of the UN secretary general's efforts, the source said adding the address was all the more amazing as the Algerian Government has repeatedly claimed it was observing "restraint" regarding the Sahara issue. The Algerian ambassador's statement was all but conform to the pledge to restraint [as received], a fact that leads us to wonder whether the statement reflects the official position of Algeria or only a personal opinion, said the source. The Algerian ambassador had stated that the present deadlock in the Sahara issue was due to "hesitations of one of the two sides ... while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high spirit of maturity." On which basis does the Algerian ambassador make such allegations, the Moroccan official source wonders adding that seemingly the Algerian diplomat had not even consulted germane resolutions of the Security Council and particularly resolution 907 which gives the secretary general until next June 30 to have the Polisario adhere to the compromise on interpretation and implementation of eligibility criteria. If the Algerian ambassador had consulted the latest report of the secretary general, he would have learnt that Morocco has accepted a year ago the compromise and consequently the one responsible for the deadlock is the Polisario. The Moroccan Government would have wished that participants in the conference examine the situation in Bosnia where hundreds of innocent victims are killed every day while others are living in inhumane and deplorable conditions, the same source said.
