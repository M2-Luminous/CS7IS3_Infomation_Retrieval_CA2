"The things that have been already achieved here over the past three years have not even started in other areas," he said at an East Thuringia regional conference in Gera. "The GNP in eastern Germany has increased by over 7 percent since 1993, in Thuringia itself it has even increased by a double figure." According to Kohl, private and public investments in eastern Germany in 1994 will probably rise to 160 million marks, a level of investments that was not even reached during the so-called economic miracle years. Germany is heading toward a good future, said Kohl. The size of unemployment is still dramatic, therefore all efforts will be be made to guarantee growth and employment opportunities. In Gera itself, a new Benefits Department of the Federal Insurance Fund for Office Employees will be set up, with 1,000 jobs. Earlier on, Thuringian Minister-President Bernhard Vogel had pointed out the difficult situation in East Thuringia. "Nowhere else in the world has uranium ore extraction caused such damage as here," he said. Federal Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt promised further support for the restructuring of the region. The general redevelopment of Saxony and Thuringia will last up to 15 years and cost about 13 million marks, he said. But the federal enterprise Wismut GmbH also represent a major economic factor, he said. The uranium ore extraction areas are developing into model areas for environmental and redevelopment technology.
