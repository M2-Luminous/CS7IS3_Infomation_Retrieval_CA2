The Cyprus Government cannot threaten. However, it has the right to protest and warn against the consequences of the criminal policy being followed by the governments of the two countries. The confidence-building measures are dead, even if Hurd, Christopher, and Cetin do not want to accept this reality. Our side's appraisal of the confidence-building measures is also supported by the secretary general, his representatives, and even by members of the Security Council. It is only the United States and Britain who do not want to be convinced and are actually plotting to undermine the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, which they allegedly recognize, to satisfy the desires of Ankara. The press reports that the contents of Kliridhis' letters was leaked out by the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia prove the coarse policy that Washington wants to impose. However, it must have realized that the decision to terminate the confidence-building measures has already been made. No substantial results will be achieved by the scandalous and provocative U.S. and British behavior to drag us once again into procedures that have served the Turkish side's intransigent tactics and filibustering.
