He expressed his hope of reaching a security protocol before 'Id al-Fitr to offer good news to the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories. In a statement after the Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee, he said that issues relating to the side roads in the Gaza Strip were discussed. The two sides also discussed operating joint patrols in the security belt of the settlements and on roads in the Gaza Strip. They agreed to call these patrols "Help Patrols" [Dawriyat Najdah]. 'Asfur said: We have also reached an agreement on defining the security belt of the settlements and the security belt in the Palestinian areas in accordance with the Cairo agreement. He noted that particular points will be discussed next week. Regarding security in Jericho, he said this issue has not been broached. He stressed that this round was generally positive, noting that understanding was reached on numerous issues. He said the negotiations are proceeding positively. The Palestinian delegation has left Taba for Cairo, where the Security Committee is scheduled to meet for the next round. Head of the Israeli delegation Amnon Shahaq said at the end of this round of talks that the negotiations proceeded positively, noting that this progress does not mean there are no problems. He pointed out that we have completed discussion of the part relating to security cooperation and coordination. He said the two sides have not yet settled the size of the Palestinian police force. He noted that both sides discussed security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho and the issue of Palestinian detainees but refused to give details. Shahaq said the Civilian Affairs Committee settled many issues relating to the transfer of power and will discuss the remaining issues next week. The issues of antiquities, water, and city planning have been adjourned until next week along with the issue of communications, notably the Palestinian radio and television, which will be discussed at the next round. Shahaq stressed that the next round of talks will be held in Cairo and the round after that in Taba, noting that it is difficult to say when these rounds will end. He noted that substantial issues on which no agreement has been reached are still under discussion. He said these issues relate to the authorities and powers of the two sides. He voiced his hope that an agreement will be reached to implement Palestinian self-rule.
