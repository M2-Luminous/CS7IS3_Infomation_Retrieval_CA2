FR940302-2-00009 FR940302-2-00006 [A&hyph;588&hyph;829] Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: Defrost Timers From Japan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Magd Zalok, Office of Antidumping Duty Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4162. Scope of Order For purposes of this investigation, defrost timers are electro-mechanical and electronic defrost timers for residential refrigerators. Electro-mechanical defrost timers are comprised of several components that make or break electric circuits by activating two sets of electrical contact points_one to disconnect the compressor (the cooling mechanism) and the other to connect the defrost heater. The articles are equipped with a synchronous or subsynchronous motor. The defrost timer disconnects the compressor by opening an electrical circuit after the compressor itself has run for a length of time predetermined by the manufacturer depending on the specifications of the model. Upon completion of the compressor run cycle (and simultaneously with the compressor's disconnection) the defrost heater is activated and runs for a preset time (again depending on the model), as predetermined by the manufacturer. Electronic defrost timers have a similar function but operate with greater efficiency. This is because a microprocessor in the device uses information gathered during the defrost cycle to adjust the compressor run time. This system defrosts only when needed, thereby improving the efficiency of the refrigerator. The defrost timers subject to this investigation are currently classifiable under subheading 9107.00.4000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Antidumping Duty Order On February 22, 1994, the International Trade Commission notified the Department, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) that imports of defrost timers from Japan materially injure the U.S. industry. Therefore, in accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of defrost timers from Japan. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of defrost timers from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 24, 1993, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the Federal Register (58 FR 44655). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , Custom officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following cash deposits for the subject merchandise: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Weighted-average margin percentage Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co.
