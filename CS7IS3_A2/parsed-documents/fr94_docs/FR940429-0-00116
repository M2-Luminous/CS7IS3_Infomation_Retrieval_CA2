FR940429-0-00116 FR940429-0-00012 Comments: Most commenters agreed with the Secretary that the SPRE's review priorities should reflect the objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality, but differed on the methods to best accomplish those objectives. Many of these commenters agreed strongly with the proposal in the NPRM that a SPRE be provided maximum flexibility in selecting institutions to review, except as provided by the statute; i.e., under section 494A(b) of the HEA, a SPRE must review referred institutions on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying those institutions. Several of these commenters suggested that the SPRE be required to publicize its review priority system to assure consistent selection of referred institutions under that system. Many commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should first review referred institutions that meet multiple referral criteria. Many other commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should consider, in addition to the referral criteria, other factors, such as data measuring student outcomes (for instance, graduation and placement rates), and other information a State might have that would indicate that a referred institution was not properly providing its educational programs. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary set the review priorities to ensure that all SPREs select institutions on the same basis. A number of commenters contended that an overwhelming number of institutions scheduled by the Secretary for recertification would also meet a referral criterion. Those commenters feared that this pool of institutions would be so great that a SPRE would never be able to select institutions under the State's review priority system. To alleviate this problem, the commenters recommended that the NPRM be revised to allow a SPRE to select institutions for review under the State's priority system from among the pool of referred institutions the Secretary scheduled for recertification. Discussion: If a State's allotment is less than will be needed to review all referred institutions, the Secretary believes that a SPRE is in a better position than the Secretary to determine which institutions to select for review from among all the referred institutions. The Secretary also believes that any of the review priorities suggested by the commenters could be effective in selecting ``problem institutions'' for review under this program, provided that those priorities reflect the objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality. Therefore, the Secretary will not require a SPRE to adopt any of the commenters priority suggestions for establishing priorities. The Secretary agrees with the commenter who noted that for some States for some years, the number of institutions scheduled for recertification by the Secretary may exceed the money allotted to the State for reviews. Under that circumstance, the SPRE will use its priority criteria to select for review only institutions scheduled for recertification by the Secretary. The Secretary agrees with the commenters who recommended that a SPRE should make known its review priorities. Changes: Section 667.(23)(b) is revised to require a SPRE to make available information regarding its review priority system after its plan submitted under §667.12 is approved by the Secretary and prior to conducting reviews of referred institutions. Also, in response to comments regarding review priorities under §667.5, a new §667.12(c)(3)(ii) is added to permit a SPRE to place an institution in the lowest priority for review if the institution was referred because of a late audit or a change in ownership and a previous SPRE review found no significant violations of State standards. Comments: Several commenters suggested that the final regulations contain procedures, in addition to the reallotment procedures, under which a State could request a supplemental allotment to carry out the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review Program. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. If a State needs additional funds and those funds are available through reallotment, the Secretary will allow States to apply for those funds. Funds for the program's purposes are provided through annual, discretionary appropriations from Congress. The program is not an entitlement. The Secretary does not have the authority to award ``supplemental allotments'' beyond reallotment through these regulations. Changes: None. Section 667.14␣Allowable Costs and Activities Comments: Several commenters suggested that information sharing be added to the list of allowable activities. Discussion: The Secretary agrees. Changes: Section 667.14(c) is revised to include as an allowable direct cost sharing of information by a SPRE with other SPREs, the Secretary, other State agencies, accrediting agencies, institutions, private organizations, and others. Comments: Several commenters suggested that the training of employees of private organizations, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, and peer review systems by considered allowable activities when the training is necessary for those employees to perform required activities contracted by a SPRE. Discussion: The Secretary believes that in establishing a contract with a private organization, nationally recognized accrediting agency, or peer review system, the SPRE may include in the contract any training that is required for the contracted organization to carry out required activities, and the SPRE may pay for that training with SPRP funds. Changes: None. Section 667.15␣Fiscal Procedures and Records Comments: One commenter recommended that an audit of a SPRE's activities be performed annually instead of at least once every two years as proposed in the NPRM. The commenter indicated that annual audits are needed to protect Department and taxpayer interests in light of the fact that the SPRP is a new program.
