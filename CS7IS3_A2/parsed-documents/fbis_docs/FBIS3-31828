He said many Serb heavy guns were still in position against the mainly Moslem Bosnian capital. In a statement read to reporters by Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, Izetbegovic gave a list of weapons not pulled out since the NATO ultimatum expired Monday. "According to reliable data, the realization of the ultimatum is not accomplished," the statement said. It listed sitings by Bosnian sources from Monday to Wednesday of eight tanks, three armored personnel carriers and at least 16 artillery pieces in the 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone NATO had called for around Sarajevo by last Monday. NATO threatened air strikes as of Monday to destroy the arms. Whether these weapons remained Thursday could not be immediately confirmed. UN spokesmen here say there is effective compliance since Serb forces have been pulling out artillery and have not shelled Sarajevo. UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said Thursday, however, that there were still at least eight weapons sites to be checked. Aikman said there were in addition sites where Serbs were refusing to hand over arms to UN troops. Ganic charged that the 260 pieces of artillery UNPROFOR has collected so far from the Serbs included many obsolete arms and many below the high calibre weapons the Serbs possess. He spoke of UN Bosnian commander British General Michael Rose "saying he was going to go to sleep comfortably (at the time the deadline fell Monday at 0100 GMT) since the job was done." "Now it is a mess," Ganic said.
