FR940404-2-00124 FR940404-2-00083 5. Applicants seek to impose a charge to compensate AUSA for bearing certain mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The charge is equal to a maximum effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Account. Of that amount, approximately 0.80% is attributable to mortality risks and approximately 0.45% is attributable to expense risks. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will be borne by AUSA. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to AUSA. AUSA does not anticipate making a profit from this charge. The mortality risk borne by AUSA arises from its obligation to make monthly annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants may live. The expense risk borne by AUSA is that the annual contract charge AUSA may impose under the Contracts may be insufficient to cover the actual administrative costs incurred by AUSA. The cost of distributing the Contracts will be paid from AUSA's general account funds, which may include amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charge. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense. 2. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable and proper insurance charge to compensate AUSA for assuming the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts and for the risk that the administrative expense will be greater than amounts that may be derived from any annual Contract charge imposed. 3. AUSA represents that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon AUSA's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. AUSA will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. 4. Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by a sales charge. AUSA has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Account and the Contract-holders. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by AUSA at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. 5. AUSA also represents that the Account will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1. Applicants' Conclusion Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act meet the standards set out in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
