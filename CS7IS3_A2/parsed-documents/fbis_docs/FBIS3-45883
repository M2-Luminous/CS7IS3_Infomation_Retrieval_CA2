The talks were conducted in a warm [re qing 3583 1906] and friendly atmosphere. President Suessmuth warmly welcomed Chairman Qiao Shi's official friendly visit to Germany, and assessed highly the development of German-Chinese relations and the friendly cooperation between Germany and China in recent years. She said that the ties between Germany and China, especially since 1992, had been very close. Although the two countries were wide apart in distance, relations between them had been sound in the 20-odd years since the establishment of diplomatic relations. She indicated that German- Chinese relations maintained long-standing traditions, which were very important for the future too. She said that China was undergoing great economic reform, for which Germany had shown great concern. China had a population of 1.1 billion, with 50-odd nationalities. China had maintained stability and unity; that was a tremendous accomplishment not easily achieved. Chairman Qiao Shi expressed his thanks for President Suessmuth's welcome on behalf of the FRG Federal Assembly. He said that the ties between China and Germany had a long history; such ties involved not only economic relations and trade, but also other fields, including culture and science. Since the PRC's founding, it had all along cared about developments in Germany, while paying attention to and showing concern for the reunification of the German nation. Therefore, when the new change came, we did not find it too sudden, and correctly handled the relations between China and Germany. Since diplomatic relations between China and Germany were established, their bilateral relations had enjoyed sound development, with all sorts of resistance gradually eliminated, and the bilateral relations of friendly cooperation accumulated and developed. Over the past few years, Sino-German economic and trade relations had been sound in their development. In 1992, the trade volume between the two countries rose to some $6 billion, and it was around $9 billion in 1993. At the same time, exchanges and cooperation in all arenas, including culture, science, technology, and education, thrived. Of course, in the course of making progress, difficulties were inevitable; however, the two countries had done their best to overcome difficulties; consequently, bilateral relations were forging ahead. Last November, Chancellor Kohl headed a large delegation visiting China, with satisfactory successes scored; thus a new phase of Sino-German relations has begun. Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the relations between the NPC and the German Federal Assembly had also developed continuously. Two vice presidents of the German Federal Assembly had already visited China, in addition to some other Federal Assembly members visiting China one after another. Because of the two sides' joint efforts, President Qiao Shi believed that his current visit would be successful. He formally invited President Suessmuth to visit China at a suitable time. Chairman Qiao Shi said that China is developing; it has a vast territory and 56 nationalities; there are many aspects that call for Germany's understanding, and there is a need for mutual understanding and exchange of information between the two countries. He said that at present China was focusing its efforts on pursuing construction, and hoped for the maintenance of a peaceful and stable world environment. At home, China hoped to maintain long-range social stability; because without stability, China's economic and cultural construction would be out of the question. In more than a century of modern Chinese history, China had not really been unified and stable, and the Chinese people had to lead lives without stability while enduring great suffering. It was precisely because of this that China was implementing a peaceful foreign policy characterized by independence, taking the initiative in its own hands, and safeguarding Asia-Pacific and world peace, while maintaining a social environment of stability and unity internally. Chairman Qiao Shi said that in the several years when the former Soviet Union was going through the most drastic changes, China had taken the road of reform. Taking the road of reform meant that at the beginning, the influence of the USSR had been done away with, while conducting political and economic reform according to China's actual conditions. In the 15-year reform, China's economy had been improved and would continue to be improved; furthermore, the people's political status had been greatly elevated; they could freely air their views, and their minds were at ease. He said that China was a vast country, and the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control were indispensable; at the same time, it was imperative to give full play to the enthusiasm of various localities. Those two aspects were equally important. Last year, China set forth the principle of building the socialist market economy, and the Constitution was revised at the NPC, with that point set down in the Constitution. That had great effects at home and abroad; and at the same time set arduous tasks for us. China was to set up the framework of the socialist market economy by the year 2000; in the current NPC session, China must set up the legal framework of the socialist market economy. He indicated that the tasks for economic legislation would be numerous; and there would also be legislation in education, science and technology. China was doubling its efforts to do a good job of building its legal system. Participating in the talks were major members of Chairman Qiao Shi's entourage Cao Zhi, NPC Standing Committee secretary general; Ye Gongqi, Shanghai Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee chairman; Redi, Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing Committee chairman; Dai Jie, NPC Standing Committee member and concurrently NPC Financial and Economic Committee vice chairman; Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu; and Chinese Ambassador to Germany Mei Zhaorong.
