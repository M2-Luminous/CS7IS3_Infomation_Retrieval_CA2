The National Space Development Agency (NASDA) originally scheduled the launch for Monday, but postponed it because of bad weather. NASDA officials said the rocket would lift off between 7 AM and 9 AM from the Tanegashima Space Center on Tanegashima island, off the southernmost main island of Kyushu. The 50-meter, two-stage vehicle is the first space rocket developed autonomously with Japanese space technology. It is capable of sending a two-ton payload into geostationary orbit. The H-2 rocket will carry a vehicle evaluation payload satellite, which will confirm the launch performance of the H-2 as well as its compatibility with the new range of facilities at Tanegashima. It will also carry an experimental vehicle called the orbital reentry experiment, which is part of a program to prepare a Japanese space shuttle called Hope to be launched around 2005.
