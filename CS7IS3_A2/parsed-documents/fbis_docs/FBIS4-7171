I am moved at the president's fine words about the Vietnamese fatherland and people and the relations between our two countries. These words demonstrate the Indonesian people's profound feelings for our people. Being in the Southeast Asian region, the peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia struggled under harsh conditions for national independence and both won victories in 1945. Over the last 49 years, we have built a fine relationship of friendship, sympathy, and mutual understanding. Our people always remember the Indonesian people's honest support for the Vietnamese people's legitimate effort for national unification. Today, our two peoples share a common aspiration in building a prosperous country and changing Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and cooperation. That is the firm basis for the continuous consilidation and development of our long-term friendship and cooperation relations, making it a long-lived relationship as our beloved President Ho Chi Minh said 35 years ago when he visited Indonesia. Dear President Suharto, ladies, and gentlemen; Visiting the fraternal Indonesian country, we are happy about the great achievements made in the past 25 years by the Indonesian people under the president's leadership and under the national ideology of Pancasila. On this occasion, we sincerely wish the Indonesian people greater achievements in taking Indonesia into the taking-off period in national development and international and regional cooperation. As the president of the Nonaligned Movement, Indonesia has actively contributed toward a Southeast Asia region of peace and cooperation and for a more stable and prosperous world. On that basis, Indonesia has an increasingly important role in the world and region. Vietnam wholeheartedly supports Indonesia's active role in that direction and stands side by side with our Indonesian friends in the struggle for peace and equal cooperation among nations. Dear Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen; The international and regional situations continue to change in a swift, profound, and complicated manner, thus presenting all nations great opportunities and challenges. In our region, the trend of peace, stability, cooperation, and development has been increasing. We believe that Southeast Asia is enjoying the most favorable conditions since the end of World War II for solidly building cooperation for regional long-term peace and prosperity. We always attach importance to improved relations of friendship and cooperation for mutual benefit among regional countries on unilateral and bilateral bases. We are content at the fine development of the Vietnam-ASEAN relationship, and with ASEAN's active support, Vietnam is energetically preparing to become a full member. We hold that this conforms with both Vietnamese and ASEAN interests and is beneficial to peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region. We strongly believe that my official friendship visit to Indonesia will contribute to solving problems of mutual concern and further accelerate our multi-faceted friendship and cooperation relation for the benefit of the peoples in our two countries and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world. In the atmosphere of friendship and fraternity between the peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia, I invite all of you to toast President Suharto and his wife to good health and happiness, the prosperity of the Indonesian people, the consolidation and development of the Vietnamese-Indonesian multi-faceted friendship and cooperation, and Southeast Asia becoming a region of peace, friendship, cooperation, and development. I wish you all good health.
