SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 431 in Barbour County, Alabama. The purpose of the proposed project is to provide a safe, efficient, cost-effective, multi-lane facility, capable of handling existing and future traffic demands.

The proposed project will begin on U.S. Highway 431, south of the City of Eufaula near Cheneghatchee Creek. The route will extend to the northeast, passing around the City, and terminating with the intersection of U.S. 431 near Hoboken. The length of the proposal is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4 miles). Alternatives under consideration include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in this proposal. A public involvement meeting and a public hearing will be held in the City of Eufaula. Public notice will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties.
