FR940804-2-00058 FR940804-2-00027 [Project No. 10942&hyph;001] Skykomish River Hydro; Intent to Conduct Environmental Scoping Meetings and Site Visit July 29, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a license of the proposed Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 10942&hyph;001. The Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project is located on Martin Creek, about 7 miles east of Skykomish, Washington, in King County. The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on this hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. In the EA, we will consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis. The draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration by the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. Scoping Meetings Staff will hold two scoping meetings. A scoping meeting oriented towards the public will be held on August 24, 1994 at 6 p.m., at the Skykomish School, 100 Railroad Avenue, Skykomish, Washington. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will be held on August 25, 1994 at 9:30 a.m., at the Conference Room_Skykomish River Hydro, 1422 130th Avenue NE., Bellevue, Washington. Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meeting. Objectives At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views. Procedures The scoping meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceedings on the Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record. Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA. Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, until September 30, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project, FERC Project No. 10942&hyph;001. Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name appears on the official service list.
