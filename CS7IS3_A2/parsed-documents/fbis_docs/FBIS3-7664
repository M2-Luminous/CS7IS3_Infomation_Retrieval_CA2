Cruz and Rose B. Caparas] [Text] Puerto Princesa, Palawan -- After a boom-and-bust cycle, which has become the trademark of the country's economic performance, government is faced with a critical task of sustaining the momentum of the reform process that has scored economic gains, NEDA [National Economic and Development Authority] Director-General Cielito Habito said during the first day of the national consultative workshop of the Philippine Futuristics Society. Despite the challenge though, Mr. Habito is confident sustainable growth would be achieved. "There are a number of factors that underline an optimistic growth scenario for the country in the next few years and beyond." He said current economic reforms have provided comfortable reasons to expect an enhanced productive capacity. Projections by the National Economic and Development Authority estimated investments, as share to real GNP, would grow 9.9 percent in 1994. Correspondingly, Mr. Habito said construction and manufacturing are expected to improve. Mr. Habito observed this trend was, in fact, manifested since 1993. "The manufacturing sector showed signs of good health and is expected to improve further." Construction was likewise noted to have improved. Mr. Habito said during times of economic expansion, productive capacity will improve. Exports, as share to gross national product, are also expected to grow 11.12 percent by the end of the year and a robust 15.7 percent for the 1994-98 period. Growth of imports will be slower vis-a-vis exports. For the 1994-1998 period, imports are targeted to grow 13.6 percent. In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD, Mr. Habito expressed optimism inflation will remain at a single-digit average by the end of the year despite the effects of the momentary increase in oil prices and increasing labor cost. Meanwhile, with the outward oriented economic reforms put in place, Mr. Habito said the economy is in a much better position to weather both internal and external shocks. Towards the year 2000, the rapid growth within the Asia-Pacific region and its participation in the AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area] is expected to propel the country to a higher growth path. The country's industries are thus expected to gain world competitiveness.
