FBIS4-153 "drafr064_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Intelligence Reports Cited in Natal Decision Intelligence Reports Cited in Natal Decision MB0204085794 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 2-3 Apr 94 p 1,2 MB0204085794 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] [Excerpts] Chilling intelligence reports predicting a sharp increase in KwaZulu/Natal violence fatalities as the election approached finally persuaded President de Klerk to declare a state of emergency in the region, according to Government sources. The reports -- some of which are understood to have referred to a tenfold increase in deaths prior to the election -- came shortly after the Independent Electoral Commission's blunt and decisive call for political intervention in the crisis-torn province. One source described the intelligence reports presented to De Klerk as "hair-raising" and said they had indicated a massive potential for increased violence as the election approached. The sources declined to comment on whether specific campaigns of violence were planned. They believed gravest threat to stability lay in already volatile areas on the ground where violence was expected to break out and spread to other, more stables areas. Troops began to arrive in KwaZulu/Natal yesterday as security chiefs gathered to plot how the tough state of emergency regulations proclaimed by De Klerk would be applied on the ground. There was no immediate indication from the KwaZulu government or the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] on whether there would be active resistance to the imposition of the emergency regulations, but it was clear that there was considerable unhappiness in Ulundi. It is evident from the proclamation in the Government Gazette that steps have been taken to directly inhibit the continued training of Inkatha "self-defence units" and the carrying of "cultural" weapons in public. Both steps were met with anger by senior Inkatha members yesterday. The organisation's national chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose said: "No doubt, training people out of the country in Uganda is exonerated. But the small, little training at Umfolozi must be punished." It is estimated that some 5,000 self-defence unit members have undergone limited training at a camp in Umfolozi. It has been widely speculated that the imposition of the regulations might scupper the summit that would have bought King Goodwill Zwelithini, IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC President Nelson Mandela and De Klerk together in the next few days. However, SAPA reports that Buthelezi said yesterday the meeting appeared to be on, and he held out some hope for it -- otherwise I wouldn't be going". But he added that if it went ahead it would be in a "sour atmosphere" because of De Klerk's "appalling and shameful" declaration of the state of emergency and Mandela's remarks that the KwaZulu Police (KZP) would be confined to barracks. The emergency regulations contain no reference to the KZP being confined to barracks. Senior KZP officers were present at day-long discussions with the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF [South African Defense Force] in Durban yesterday to plans security operations under the state of emergency. One of three additional companies of SADF troops that are to be deployed in KwaZulu/Natal arrived in the region yesterday. The remaining two companies of between 100 and 150 members each are expected today or tomorrow. [passage omitted]
