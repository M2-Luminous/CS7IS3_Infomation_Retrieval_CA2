In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine Tuesday, he pointed out he was referring to Russia's experience of aggravated relations between different branches of state power which should be taken into account in Ukraine. "With great difficulty, we have surmounted the worst. Actually, the first stage of civil war in Russia has taken place," Zatulin was quoted as saying. The interviewee said Russia would conclude "the most extensive agreements, the most extensive trade and economic ties" with Crimea. A number of unsolved issues remain, the main one being the future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol, he said. "Without support from both Russia and Ukraine, Sevastopol will find itself in the most difficult situation," he said. Zatulin did not preclude "Russia proposing to Crimea participation in a package of programs, in the first place economic ones." The Russian deputy has been participating in the Crimean parliament's session since its opening.
