Indeed, what can be expected of a government headed by a person by the name of Chernomyrdin? That is not even funny. That is mockery.... Make It Through the Day and Hold Out Through the Night From the very beginning nobody believed in the reforms. Yeltsin was a populist but not a reformer. It is one thing to drive out the communists, to destroy the previous system, to promise everything and anything, but it was something altogether different to build something new in a country. A new economy, new property relations, a new order. It is one thing to speak about a transition to the market, at the mention of which the hungry voter begins to salivate: 50 kinds of sausage, a lot of meat and vodka. And quite another--to make the transition to this same market--through increasing prices, property stratification, and unemployment. And here Gaydar appeared. Where he came from and why Yeltsin trusted him--nobody knows for sure. Possibly the president read one of his articles. But the post of prime minister could have been taken over with the same success by Vasiliy Selyunin, Nikolay Shmelev, or Larisa Piyasheva... As early as a week before Gaydar's appointment leading observers were asserting: Yeltsin is not capable of any transformations in the economy. He simply does not understand what needs to be done. And if it is explained to him he will never decide to do it. The same opinion was held by Yavlinskiy and Fedorov, who had already worked in the Silayev government. Everything will go as it goes. It will collapse and be plundered. Rot and decompose. Until everything gets as bad as it can be. Until Russia ends up on the brink of complete collapse, until it sinks amidst bloody rebellions, hunger, and poverty. The first to shut down will be the railroads. The cities will be deprived of light and heat. The peasants will hide grain from the state and the workers' food detachments will be met with axes. The army will become insubordinate and try to seize power. But it will be almost impossible to keep it. Hunger is stronger than fear. State institutions will collapse before our eyes. Everyone will begin to try to save himself as best he can. Banditry, crime, epidemics. War by everyone against everyone else. Demarcation of territories, borders with machine gun bursts along the roads, local money used for toilet paper.... Actually, everything was proceeding toward this. Every little town near Moscow was printing its own paper money--coupons for sugar, tea, tobacco and vodka, for eggs and cereal, macaroni and flour. In Moscow some things could be bought freely, but 50 kilometers to the south or north--there was almost nothing. They would get in line to wait for milk at 0500 in the morning. Cheese, meat, and sausage were not seen for months. Bread could be bought only after waiting in line for hours. Canned goods required a certificate. It seemed that there would never be an end to it. But now three years have passed and who remembers it? Nobody. Now everyone puts on an intelligent air and discusses the idea that the reform could have been conducted with lesser costs: It was not necessary to rob the people, to destroy the enterprises. That Gaydar's methods turned out to be flawed and destructive. That "the whole country is shaken from these experiments." And now everything will have to be done over again, corrected, restored. Others, conversely, reproach Gaydar for being too soft and inconsistent. It was necessary to bring what was started to completion: to decontrol all prices, to completely refrain from subsidies, to destroy inefficient productions. And each is right in his own way. But reflections about the idea that what Gaydar did was not what he should have done and what he should not have done emerge from the present-day reality for some reason. And this is unfair, to say the least. Gaydar did what he could do at the time. And we still do not know in what kind of country and under what kind of authority we would be living today if he had not managed to convince Yeltsin that it was impossible to keep controls on consumer prices any longer and, consequently, they had to be decontrolled. True, we do not know what would have happened otherwise: What kinds of plans the government would have come up with today and who would be in charge there if only Gaydar had managed to persuade Yeltsin. What, for example, would have happened to industry and agriculture if oil and coal prices had been decontrolled all at once, during the first months of the reforms, and not gradually? Collapse. Paralysis of the economy and the social sphere. Hyperinflation which could not have been stopped.... In a word, not everything is as simple as it seems: Gaydar's reforms are market reforms, which are useful and correct, and everything that is not included in these reforms is bad. In general I do not believe that the country's economy has been managed by anyone at all in recent years. All this time we were being carried along on the waves; there simply was no independent course and there could not be one. Ryzhkov, Pavlov, Gaydar, and Chernomyrdin--all of them were just hanging on to the helm and at best were checking to make sure that the ship did not dive into the water and sink. Gaydar had to cut down a couple of masts and throw superfluous items overboard. At least he kept the ship afloat. That was his assignment. And that was good. Now, of course, we can regret the things that we lost or, groaning, we can throw up some boards to take the place of the masts. But this will not change the essence of things. Whether it is with Gaydar or with Chernomyrdin, we are still tossing about without a rudder until the winds bring us up to some shore. Of course this does not mean that we must grow weak and not try to do anything. We must strengthen discipline, pump out the water, swab the deck, or sharpen the anchor with a file--as long as we do something. Otherwise, the inactivity will cause the team to start to drink, to be depressed, and to hang the captain and his assistants from the mast. Incidentally, this is already psychology. But what is the difference? There Will Be No Anesthesia! When Gaydar left the first time it was indeed perceived as a tragedy. Leaving along with him were the hopes that life in this country could change for the better at all. For the first time people had been given at least some sign of hope: Goods appeared, the waiting lines disappeared. That alone could serve as a confirmation of the correctness of the course that had been chosen. And if Gaydar had been allowed to finish what he had started.... And in fact what could have happened if Gaydar had not been interfered with? Yegor Timurovich asserts that with a strict financial policy, inflation could have been curbed fairly quickly. Against a background of financial stabilization, investments in production would have been advantageous. There would have been billions' worth of capital investments in the most promising branches of the economy. Real money, dollars. As a result--a construction boom, technical retooling of enterprises, the introduction of new technologies, development of the infrastructure.... It is another matter that it would have been necessary to pay a considerable price for all this. The only ones that would have been likely to stay afloat would have been the extraction branches, enterprises involved with initial processing of raw material, an insignificant proportion of the defense plants, and the agrarian sector, without which you cannot get anywhere in any case. And 20-30 million unemployed would have become a reality. These people would have been discharged all at once, within a half year. Even today, according to calculations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the proportion of enterprises operating at a loss is 35 percent. If prices of energy sources were to be raised just a little more, according to all canons, 60 percent of the Russian enterprises would go bankrupt. But these, as it were, are pure calculations--in terms of profitability and production outlays. But in fact not only the weak ones but also the ones they would grab hold of would sink. It is sufficient for one bank to be destroyed in order for hundreds of its clients to be left without money. It is sufficient for one monopoly enterprise to go bankrupt for all the recipients of its products to be on the verge of collapse. But the ones that survived would be in perfectly good shape. And, possibly, their profit would be quite enough to feed the unemployed and to import a sufficient quantity of goods and food products. In time, and fairly soon, the first green shoots would begin to appear on the scorched fields of reforms. Opening up in the premises of the former shops and factories would be new private enterprises which would produce products completely in line with the world level--under licenses, using imported equipment and technologies. In principle it is not so difficult to make vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, and washing machines. And who these enterprises would belong to--our capital or foreign capital--does that make any difference? The patriotism would lie in the fact that the economy was finally working. So that foreign goods would gradually be crowded out of the domestic market. So that domestic products would be just as good and inexpensive. So that they would penetrate into foreign markets and increase the influx of currency and technologies to us. A few small things, as they say, would be lacking: To live through the first two years of mass unemployment, to quell the dissatisfaction of millions of people who had been thrown out into the streets, and not to allow theft, violence, and rebellion. To create new jobs, organize social work, to pay people for merely sitting quietly at home.... Are the government and president ready for this? Is our entire system of social protection capable today of finding jobs, retraining, or even supporting all 3 million people with stipends. With full mobilization--5-6 million. What about the rest?... Hypnotists and Horses What is remarkable about Gaydar? He hypnotizes us with the simplicity of his solutions. There is no need to invent anything new. It is a typical three-move problem: Compress the money supply--stabilize finances--attract investments. And that is it. You can calculate the profit. It is very modern: Without doing anything you can put together the capital. Today 10,000, tomorrow--a million, day after tomorrow--a billion. It is not important how. The main thing is the result. Why waste your time on concrete producers? Let them solve their own problems. Why regulate investments? Money knows where to flow. There is no need to exercise the muscles of the state; on the contrary, it must relax its grip--and the fear of ruin combined with prospects for getting rich quick will do everything for us. We have tried it--it does not work. Fear, of course, is an excellent motivater, but what if, for example, a person does not become frightened the way he is supposed to, or he will not run faster than a horse in any case--he cannot. The same thing with enterprises: Whether you frighten them or not, using the equipment they have and the technologies with which they are armed, not to mention the qualifications of the workers, you will not get far. Things have not worked out with material incentives either. If the administration had officially had a share of the profits of its plants and factories, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, perhaps it would have managed these enterprises differently. But as it is--what difference does technical progress make? You quickly democratize and jump ahead--and you sit there and wait for subsidies. For the first year and a half Gaydar struggled with the consumers. With all its might the government stifled pensioners, doctors, and teachers, and allotted no money for science and art. It simply gave the enterprises no cash to pay wages. They thought they had to restrict consumer demand. Then the prices would stop rising as well. Nothing of the kind. State enterprises could not care less about consumer demand. There were mutual nonpayments, working for the warehouse. Instead of lowering prices, they began to curtail production. Then they decided to approach from the other direction: To drive domestic prices up to the level of world prices and let foreigners have domestic monopolies. Anyone who could not withstand the competition with foreign goods would perish. He would be shown the door. And what difference did it make to the consumer what he had: Russian cheese or Dutch cheese? The Dutch cheese is even tastier. For an entire year they were moving toward finally decontrolling prices. By last autumn they discovered that domestic prices might very well exceed world prices--and nothing! The economy was operating just as inefficiently as it was before. Domestic producers, instead of reducing production costs and improving the quality of their products, demanded one thing: protection from foreign goods, high customs duties, and protectionism. Theory is one thing, and how it is manifested is another. Try not paying wages to miners. Or put the automotive giants to rest. In the former case they were unable to hold down consumer demand, and in the latter they could not hold up under the pressure from the producers. Gaydar failed in the social sphere and the nonpayments crisis. Chernomyrdin raised customs duties. How is the one better than the other? Gaydar's return to the government last year was marked by nothing at all except a scandal over the elections. He did not even try to do anything in the post of first deputy prime minister. And they would not have allowed him to do anything radical. All that time he was something like a table decoration--some kind of stuffed pig which nobody could eat, but they would stick a fork into him from time to time out of ignorance. Understandably, in order to conduct reforms or, rather, to destroy domestic industry, Gaydar at least had to become a majority leader in the State Duma and hold a position of deputy prime minister. Then he could have looked to the president less and conducted an independent policy. But apparently, he went against logic here: A dentist who, without anesthesia, pulls the teeth of everyone who ends up in his chair cannot hope for his patients to love him. To them he is primarily a sadist, a torturer. And although things will get better--they still had to pay for this with their teeth. They cannot grow new ones. And there is always a suspicion that there was no need to pull them out at all, that it was possible to fix them.... The Magic of the Circle Chernomyrdin, as distinct from Gaydar, was convinced that it was still possible to change things. Here is his logic: Let us earmark the priority branches--the ones without which we cannot live--transportation, energy engineering, communications, the agro-industrial complex. We must help to support them. Not give them money thoughtlessly, but for concrete projects. For instance, we could buy imported equipment for the food industry. Everyone knows that one-third of the agricultural products are lost during processing and storage.... There are enterprises that need only the first impetus, to be put back in shape--and they will make their way to world markets. Many need no help at all. Simply leave them alone and do not oppress them with taxes. Do the petroleum and gas workers not know how to increase their output? It is necessary to increase the controllability of the national economy. If an enterprise is financed by the treasury it must be answerable to the state. Price restrictions. In a year it was clear that if you raise transportation rates and the cost of electric energy, all the other prices will increase immediately. In a couple of months the energy engineers and railroad workers will begin to operate at a loss again. The situation reproduces itself. Only with each new spiral, more enterprises become unprofitable. We must sit down and reach an agreement: We will not raise rates any more, it is better to let a couple of branches exist on subsidies than all industry and agriculture. But you too, gentlemen users, keep your prices within reasonable bounds, do not crank up profitability, do not try to live well at someone else's expense. The treasury is not made of rubber. If we get rid of the subsidies it will be the worse for you.... But what do you say to this? Logic! But in reality? Were the state enterprises not previously controlled by the ministries and departments? The plan for the year, the quarter, quotas, funds, statistical reporting--this will be harder than the contract system to which Chernomyrdin wants to switch the directors. What fool would live on wages now if he had untold resources at hand? And investments from the state pocketbook? So far the return from 1 ruble invested has not exceeded 8 kopeks in the state sector. Let us say that their conscience awakens--15 kopeks will be returned from the ruble. For a million in expenditures--150,000 in profit. Not very effective! No budget in the world could take this. And in general it is ridiculous to speak about "nonmonetary" methods of fighting inflation. The agreement is worth more than money where there is control and failure to keep one's words can cost not simply money, but all the money. And it is out of the pocket of the ones who make the agreement. Monetary methods, incidentally, are not worth much either. For the first half year or year they worked: Inflation depended almost entirely on the amount of money in circulation. If we constrict the money supply, do not pay for grain purchases, and do not give wages to the miners--prices grow more slowly. Once financing is opened up, there is a burst of inflation. But today, whether you constrict money supply or not, prices will grow anyway. Specialists say that inflation has manifested its character. Nonmonetary. Neither Gaydar nor Fedorov would achieve anything with his devices today. They did as much as they could in the autumn--to curb inflation for one month, until the elections. And they did it shabbily: They simply did not pay money to the people to whom it was promised. And then they left, shutting the door in such a way that the dollar collapsed on Chernomyrdin. Let the winner pay. The Heavy Hand of Invisible Reforms I do not know, it seems to me that all these reforms--Gaydar's, Chernomyrdin's--are useless busy work, something to distract the people. Gaydar drove the money supply here and there, Chernomyrdin intends to do selection work on the enterprises. It is all the same--nothing will come of it. As long as it stands as a monolith, the state economy--monopolized, militarized, dull-witted, scarfing up resources--you will not be able to do anything with it. Gaydar wanted to break it--they would not let him. And he could not have: The first to be ruined would be the government, along with the president and the minister of internal affairs. Chernomyrdin wants to cure it. But such a thing cannot be cured. No matter how many trillions you throw into our agriculture--we still will not receive a good crop. No matter how many benefits you give the Volga Automotive Plant--the Toyota will still be better than the Zhiguli. Nothing will happen in this country as long as we rob the state and tear it apart. As long as bureaucrats, bandits, and businessmen divide it up among themselves. When all this stops, everything will suddenly calm down. As soon as chaos and the lawlessness cease to bring us maximum profit--a strong power, a new order, and a government with the people's trust will appear. These invisible reforms have been going on for a long time and soon will come to an end--according to all the signs there may be five or six years left, no more. Then we will achieve financial stability and vigorous economic growth. But until then--expect nothing. We have had no other reforms, and we could not have had them. Neither under Gorbachev and Pavlov nor under Yeltsin and Gaydar. But there is also another viewpoint. Larisa Piyasheva, for example, states that immediately after the August putsch--two and a half years ago--it would have been possible to conduct any ultraradical reforms. The people would have lived through price increases and unemployment--if only to rid themselves once and for all of the previous hated power, an existence of semistarvation, and the unremitting hopelessness of socialist realism. The more so since in exchange people could gain economic freedom, ownership of the means of production, and the land. The breakdown of state monopolies; rapid, landslide privatization; the land reform; decontrolling of prices; reduction of taxes and halting of budget financing--this is what was required of the authorities after the overthrow of the communist regime. But Yeltsin went only so far as to liberalize prices. This is actually where all the reforms ended. Gaydar became obsessed with financial stabilization, perhaps letting go by his only chance to carry out more radical transformations in the economy. He limited himself to half measures, essentially changed nothing, and as a result he was defeated. But it is not even a matter of Gaydar himself. The problem is that over two years the social base for the reforms melted away. Society was split. The president has no unconditional support from the population. The people are disenchanted with the idea that the results of the reform can never meet their expectations. We no longer have a liberal option. There will be neither a peaceful democratic breakthrough to the market nor even a Chilean dictatorship. Of three possible paths of development, Russia has only two left, writes Larisa Piyasheva in an article entitled "There Will Be No More Russian Miracle." Either the sluggish Yeltsin dictatorship, step by step abandoning all its democratic positions and being transformed before our eyes into Brezhnevian timelessness. Or an out-and-out communist-fascist dictatorship, at the end of which we can expect complete collapse of all our hopes and illusions, more isolation from the world.... And in my opinion, all these changes of governments, programs, and presidents, all these elections and putsches will not change anything in principle. Global reform will go the way it has been going. At best the advantage will be gained by various groups of privatizers. Gaydar played into the hands of foreign capital. Chernomyrdin--to the benefit of the directors of state enterprises and big-time bureaucrats. If Zhirinovskiy comes to power--he will help the bandits or someone else. Relax, this has almost nothing to do with us. Work on yourself.
