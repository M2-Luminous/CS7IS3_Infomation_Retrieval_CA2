It is believed in Jerusalem that the Palestinian reply will be received in the coming days, but not before the UN Security Council passes a resolution on the massacre. The PLO hopes the Council will endorse some of its demands concerning the safety of territories Palestinians. Several telephone conversations were held yesterday between Jerusalem and PLO-Tunis and between Jerusalem and the U.S. and Egyptian foreign ministries. In addition, two meetings were held in Jerusalem regarding Israel's replies to the PLO demands made in the wake of the Hebron massacre as presented in Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser, in Cairo on 7 March. The first meeting was a private conversation between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Minister Peres. The second meeting was also attended by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, his deputy, Amnon Shahaq, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planning Branch Chief 'Uzi Dayan, Jacques Neriya, and Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir. This forum had also met on the night of 6 March, when it drafted the guidelines for Neriya's Cairo mission. It was stated at yesterday's consultation that 'Arafat had presented reduced demands in his meeting with Neriya. For instance, the PLO demand to prohibit settlers from carrying arms throughout the territories was replaced by a demand that the settlers should be permitted to carry arms only inside the settlements; instead of the demand to deploy an armed international force throughout the territories, the updated demand was that an unarmed force should be deployed in Gaza, Jericho, and Hebron. (Israel is willing to accept an unarmed international force in Gaza and Jericho in accordance with the Declaration of Principles [DOP].) The Palestinians demanded that Israel adhere verbatim to the DOP, withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and Jericho no later than 13 April 1994, even if the PLO-Israeli withdrawal accord is not finalized by that date. The Palestinians further demanded -- contrary to the DOP -- that the talks on settlements, including Hebron, be launched immediately after the withdrawal. Contrary to the agreement reached in the 'Arafat-Neriya meeting that an Israeli envoy would convey the Israeli replies to Tunis, it was decided in yesterday's consultations at the prime minister's bureau in Jerusalem that no such envoy would be dispatched. The replies were communicated via the telephone. It was decided to propose to the Palestinians to hold a summit meeting between Minister Peres and a senior Palestinian figure. No PLO response was received yesterday. Also yesterday, Peres met in his Jerusalem bureau with seven Palestinian journalists representing five East Jerusalem newspapers: AL-QUDS, AL-NAHAR, AL-TALI'AH, AL-MANAR, and THE JERUSALEM TIMES. Three days ago Peres was interviewed by MBC, the Saudi television network. In yesterday's meeting, Peres said that with the implementation of the DOP, Israel and the Palestinians could establish a new reality. [passage omitted]
