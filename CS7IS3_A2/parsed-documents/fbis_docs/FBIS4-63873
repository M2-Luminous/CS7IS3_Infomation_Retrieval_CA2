The restoration of the former union or the establishment of some sort of a confederation is out of the question. The new union must be a logical culmination of the basically new community of states, former members of the USSR, which now make up the Commonwealth of Independent States, provided they are really interested in the establishment of deeper and more effective multilateral relations," press secretary of the Kazakh president Nurlan Danenov told the newspaper "KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA". Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he said that he was compelled to make this statement due to recent speculations around Nazarbayev's Euro- Asian union idea. In his opinion, the Kazakh president's statement on the Euro-Asian union, made during his official visit to the Russian Federation last March, was now being used for unseemly political purposes. Some analysts are trying to use the differing approaches of some CIS leaders to Nazarbayev's proposal in order to drive a sort of wedge between the commonwealth members. The press secretary expressed the conviction that the CIS potential was still not exhausted. "The commonwealth has already played and continues to play an important role in the legal corroboration of inter-state relations within it, contributing to the civilised `divorcement'of the republics after the collapse of the Soviet empire. However, the pace of the intergrational processes, mildly speaking, could have been much faster. Most telling is the absence of structures that would ensure the fulfilment of the already concluded agreements. Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was behind the Euro-Asian union idea," Danenov noted. As to press allegations that "President Nazarbayev had allegedly dropped the Euro-Asian union idea, well, they can evoke nothing but surprise. The idea was not officially raised anywhere. There was nothing but a call to exchange views on the possibility of finding ways for promoting constructive cooperation with CIS countries that are particularly important for Kazakhstan and which experience the same need for our republic. Hence, the Euro-Asian union subject can in no way be officially excluded from further discussion," Danenov explained.
