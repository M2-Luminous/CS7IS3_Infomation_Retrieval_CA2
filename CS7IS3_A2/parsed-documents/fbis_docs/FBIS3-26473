In order to learn about the work of the new organization which began operation under its new name last June, we recently talked with relevant personnel at the Light Industry Council Building. Being chiefly involved in the production of consumer goods for daily use, light industry is closely related to the masses' daily life and its production performance has a bearing on the prosperity of our country's markets, and on economic and social stability. In the past, due to the planned economy and its difficulty in forecasting future market changes and of guaranteeing an effective market supply, there was the recurrent phenomena of commodity shortages or stockpiling. Since China's implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, light industry has achieved quicker development than other industries, thanks to its early embracement of the principle of a market economy. Since its inception, the Light Industry Council has been faced with the problems of how to do a good job managing the industry and its changing functions. The council's Chairman Yu Zhen, who assumed the post six months ago, briefed us on reform of the industry. He said the key to bringing about a change from past planned management to the present industrial management lies in changing functions. The council was required to accomplish a quick change in its operations: A switch from the past practice of taking complete charge of the production and operation of enterprises to the present one of providing them with good services. Yu Zhen said that from now on the Light Industry Council, while preserving certain administrative and management functions, will devote more energy to employing industrial management means well, and indirectly guide enterprises to engage in production and business activities; in short, the council will try to play its role mainly in giving enterprise advise on decisionmaking. To achieve that end, the council called on its personnel to change their workstyle and to show that their role is to provide enterprises with services. As an industry council, it should give priority to doing a good job in industrial and regional planning, and industrial policy formulation. It has been learned that a number of documents on light industry's goals during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan"; documents concerning opinions on the basic thinking of the long-term plan until the year 2010; and on further promoting the industry's opening to the outside world, were formally introduced at the recently-held light industry national work conference. At the same time, an industrial policy -- with the main contents of maintaining a high growth speed, readjusting product mix, and adopting the strategy of developing famous-brand products -- has also been publicized within the entire industry. Light industry is also stepping up work on devising measures to meet the challenges which will be faced after China resumes its position in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A report on formulation of those measures will be disclosed in the next six months. In addition to doing a good macroregulation and control job, the Light Industry Council has also stepped up providing microlevel guidance to enterprises. On the heels of the experimental publication of a guide book on the restructuring and transformation of light industry as well as on market information, the council recently publicized the 1994 market trends for light industry through the public media, and presented an analysis of the market prospects for several categories of major light industrial products. The council's purpose was to provide enterprises with specific references for their decisionmaking. Hu Dongguang, responsible person of the production and trade department under the Light Industry Council, told us that except for the maintenance of a small number of products such as newsprint and edible salt on the lists of products under the mandatory plan, it has included other products on the guidance plan lists. He told us the phenomena of people at the former Light Industry Ministry's busying themselves with the allocation of funds and materials, and assigning planned quotas will not be found at the Light Industry Council. The main areas of the council's planning work include: Suggesting which line of business requires restrictions and should not be expanded; to point out the gaps that exist between domestic and foreign business counterparts; and ways to transform and restructure the industry. A lot of work needs to be done following the council's establishment. For instance, there is the problem of solving pollution in the paper-making industry, of redesigning refrigerator compressors, and of changes in supply and demand on the sugar market. All these require the council to work out countermeasures. Another aspect of improved industrial management lies in the development of information services. The reporters visited the expanded Chinese Light Industry Information Center and saw a scene of bustling activity. Wang Qingren, an official of the center, told us it provides information services to the leadership as well as enterprises. He said: The center is developing statistical and commercial information networks for light industry; it is also building data banks regarding imported equipment, large and medium-sized enterprises, and light industrial products. Its services are available to enterprises without any restrictions. In addition to the dozens of light industry trade magazines, the council will step up construction of an information medium by investing huge sums in computers and other advanced means of communication to increase the center's capacity to collect, store, and analyze information. A source who worked in the Light Industry Ministry for many years observed that changes at the Light Industry Council are stunning, when you compare what it is doing now to what it was doing before the policy of reform and opening up was introduced. At that time, all light industrial products, which involved huge volumes of a wide range of miscellaneous items, were manufactured according to plans. A minor oversight here or there was inevitable. For example, pots were once in short supply. Nowadays, enterprises organize their production according to market demand and markets are well stocked.
