FR940804-2-00022 FR940804-2-00008 We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other SSB grades which Foroni sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Valbruna requested that the Department reconsider the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna, we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of SSB from Italy to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible. United States Price Foroni All of Foroni's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore, we based USP on exporter's sales prices (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. In accordance with section 772(d) of the Act, we calculated ESP based on FOB warehouse and FOB port prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, ocean freight (including foreign inland freight and loading/unloading charges), U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. inland freight, U.S. import duties, and export taxes. For those sales of subject merchandise with FOB U.S. port sales terms, we made no deduction for the U.S. inland freight charges reported in respondent's U.S. sales listing. We also deducted credit expenses, warranty expenses, product liability premiums, quality control expenses, and commissions paid to an employee, in accordance with section 772(e)(2) of the Act. We also deducted U.S. indirect selling expenses, including pre-sale warehousing costs incurred in the United States, advertising, and inventory carrying costs. We did not make an adjustment for payroll taxes reported by Foroni for the preliminary determination because Foroni did not provide sufficient explanation as to how these expenses should be treated. We will review these expenses at verification and reconsider the issue for the final determination. In addition, we made no adjustment for U.S. packing expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense. Valbruna For Valbruna, we based USP on both ESP and purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772 of the Act, because Valbruna made sales both before and after importation into the United States. We calculated both PP and ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, for both PP and ESP sales we made deductions, where appropriate, for ocean freight (including foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance and foreign brokerage and handling), U.S. import duties, U.S. merchandise processing and harbor maintenance fees, U.S. inland freight, U.S. brokerage and handling, and containerization expenses (including drayage, stripping, and storage expenses). We added freight income ( i.e., freight charges paid by the customer but not included in the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales. For ESP sales only, we further deducted credit expenses and warranty expenses, in accordance with section 772(e)(2) of the Act. We also deducted indirect selling expenses incurred in Italy on sales to the United States, as well as indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States, and inventory carrying costs. We recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States to reflect respondent's reported methodology. We also made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Italy in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT October 7, 1993). (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France, 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994). Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets with respect to sales of SSB during the POI. Foroni We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices charged to unrelated customers in the home market. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we deducted credit expenses and quality control expenses. We also deducted home market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses (including inventory carrying costs), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b). We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.
