Defence Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken said the Skynet 4 Stage 2 satellites would replace the existing satellites as they approach the end of their operational life. They will become operational in 1998 and will be for the sole use of the UK's military forces. British Aerospace is the prime contractor for the work. The main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for the satellite communications equipment and U.S. giant McDonnell Douglas and Europe's Arianespace for the launch rockets. "This is an important contract which will ensure the continued well-being of the UK's space industry and contribute to its long-term future," said Mr Aitken.
