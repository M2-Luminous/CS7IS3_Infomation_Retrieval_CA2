FR941110-1-00081 FR941110-1-00011 Another option EPA is considering would require all importers of used controlled substances to apply each year for a permit. Such a permit application would need to be submitted to EPA between November 1 and November 15 in the year prior to the control period for which it would be applicable. The permit application would include the person's name and address, their importer identification number, and the intended quantity of used controlled substance that the person estimates will be imported during the control period. The estimates would not be binding, but would provide EPA with information on the total potential import of used controlled substances for the U.S. for that year. EPA would need to make a determination within 30 days of the receipt of an application. If the application is denied due to insufficient information, the person would have 5 days in which to appeal the decision. EPA would then have an additional 5 days in which to deny or grant the permit. If EPA did not act in the 5 days, the permit would be granted automatically. A person wishing to import used controlled substances who did not apply for a permit during the designated time before the control period, may submit an application at any time during the year. However, EPA would maintain the right to review the application within 60 days of its receipt. A 60-day review of the application is justified by the fact that the person is applying outside of the designated time for processing permits. Any person receiving a permit outside of the designated time period for application would be required to apply again for the following control period, during the designated period.
