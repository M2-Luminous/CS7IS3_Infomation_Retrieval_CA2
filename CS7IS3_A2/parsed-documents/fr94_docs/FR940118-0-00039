FR940118-0-00039 FR940118-0-00011 Comment: Many commenters suggested that the Secretary change §644.22, relating to prior experience points. None of the commenters asked the Secretary to change the wording of the criteria; all requested that the Secretary describe in greater detail how the criteria are applied. Some commenters argued the regulations should require the Secretary to notify grantees as to the number of points they received for prior experience before the funding determinations are made. Commenters argued that such a procedure would allow grantees to ``correct errors'' in the Secretary's evaluation of their prior experience. Other commenters suggested that the regulations should require the Secretary to award a portion of the prior experience points each year based on a grantee's annual performance report. They suggested that each grantee should be informed within a specified period as to how well each performance report was scored. Commenters also noted that the regulations should require the Secretary to award prior experience points based only on a grantee's performance during the first two years of its grant. This procedure, they argued, would ensure that a grantee's prior experience would be measured against actual outcomes rather than speculation about what the grantee is likely to have accomplished by the end of the project period. Several commenters offered suggestions on how prior experience points should be allocated under the two-year evaluation schedule. Discussion: The comments suggest a high degree of anxiety over how the Secretary rates prior experience. The comments imply that the assessment process should be continuous, extensive, and interactive. The Secretary, however, has no intention of unnecessarily burdening grantees with such a process. Under §644.20(2)(i) of the regulations, the Secretary only evaluates prior experience when a grantee submits an application for ``a new grant to continue to serve substantially the same populations or campuses that the applicant is serving under an expiring grant.'' Prior experience is not evaluated until the Secretary receives such an application. This procedure reflects the mandate expressed in section 402(A)(c)(1) of the Higher Education Act, which states: ``In making grants *␣*␣* the Secretary shall consider prior experience.'' The law requires the Secretary to evaluate prior experience only when the Secretary is deciding to make a grant; the Secretary only decides to make a grant if an application has been submitted. Thus, the final assessment of prior experience is conducted as part of the overall process for selecting new grants. This process begins when applications are received and ends when applicants are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. The application process is not an interactive process. After the closing date, no additional information is accepted or considered. Therefore, any information that an applicant feels should be considered during the course of the selection process should be provided before the closing date. The Secretary does not disclose information relating to the rank of applications until all applicants are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. After applicants receive notification, they may request copies of documents that reflect the prior experience assessments. Changes: None. What are allowable costs? (§644.30) Comment: Many commenters suggested that the Secretary amend §644.30 of the proposed regulations to include college admission fees and college entrance examination fees in the list of allowable costs. The commenters noted that many adult EOC participants cannot afford to pay examination and application fees and are therefore discouraged from pursuing postsecondary education. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that admission fees should be included in the list of allowable costs because some adult participants may be discouraged from applying to postsecondary institutions because of the expense associated with examination and application fees. However, the Secretary strongly encourages Educational Opportunity Centers to work with higher educational institutions to secure waivers whenever possible. Further, application fees will not be an allowable cost under §644.30 if the fee is paid to the grantee institution because the Secretary encourages grantees to provide meaningful support to the Educational Opportunity Centers that they administer.
