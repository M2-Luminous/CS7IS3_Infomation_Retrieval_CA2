But he said he had never sought to attend the D-Day commemorations this year and would have declined any invitation to do so. Mr. Kohl was speaking at the end of a day-long summit with the Prime Minister at Chequers and in London. Other British ministers met their German counterparts at the same time. Mr. Major told a news conference at the Foreign Office that "the Anglo-German relationship is in very good heart indeed." Mr. Kohl agreed: "The relationship is an excellent one and has been for a long time. I don't think we should make any bones about that. But in every family there are obviously disagreements. As to the events that happened 50 years ago, quite frankly I really do not understand what people are talking about. At no point did I seek to get invited to the commemorations for D-Day. Had I been invited I would not have attended. This was very well known and it has not been an issue between us." Chancellor Kohl spoke of his wish to join with Britain in commemorating the end of the war. He said it would be both countries' duty to "remember the dead and pay our respects to the victims." He said both nations felt obliged to see to it that no generation would ever be in such a situation again in Europe. The Prime Minister said that during the talks the two leaders spent some time discussing the Bosnian situation. "There is no doubt that after the setback earlier this month, the UN has taken a step forward today with the withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons from the surrounds of Gorazde." Mr. Major said this had been due to the "skilful and courageous work" of UN forces on the ground. "We are both determined to help NATO and the UN deter aggression against any of the safe areas. But the real prize is a negotiated settlement." Turning to the South African elections, Mr. Major said: "Both Britain and Germany have worked for many years, very often very closely together, to help bring about change in South Africa. We both wish to do all we can to assist the incoming government after the elections are concluded. We hope to see business investing there develop and harness the economic potential we both believe exists in South Africa." The Prime Minister said that both he and Mr. Kohl wished to bring the young people of Britain and Germany closer together and to improve mutual understanding of each other's country. "The Chancellor and I agreed we would ask our officials to come up with specific and imaginative proposals on this." Mr. Major said both he and the Chancellor wished to see "a substantial reduction in the regulatory burden on business" because this would help economic growth and competitiveness. "You are going to hear a good deal more about deregulation in Europe," Mr. Major added.
