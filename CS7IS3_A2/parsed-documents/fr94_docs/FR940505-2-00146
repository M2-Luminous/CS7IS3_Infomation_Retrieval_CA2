J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1971 Rolls Royce Corniche, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
