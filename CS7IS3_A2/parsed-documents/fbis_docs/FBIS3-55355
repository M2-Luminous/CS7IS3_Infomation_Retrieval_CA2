"Estonia is monitoring very closely the developments in Russia and the directions of Russian foreign policy," Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement says. "The result of the recent elections should have made it clear to the world community that the democratic reforms in Russia may not be irreversible." Therefore, it is equally important for the world community to "support the reformers as well as to send a clear signal that the policies espoused by the extremist politicians will not be accepted," the statement continues. According to the statement, this must include "tying the Central and Eastern European countries closer to NATO, inter alia through the `Partnership for Peace', in conjunction with their increased ties with the European Union." "As NATO enlargement should be seen in harmony with European integration, so should the Baltic and Visegrad states be included among the group of countries first to be offered the possibility of NATO membership," Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement stresses. "This approach must be coupled with an invitation to Russian democrats to cooperate with expanding European structures," it adds. "Separating the Baltic and the Visegrad states, however, either implicitly or explicitly, could be interpreted by some countries as a `green light' to restore `spheres of influence'," the statement concludes.
