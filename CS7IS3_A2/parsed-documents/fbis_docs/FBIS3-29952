The revolutionary monument "You, the land thriving under the rays of the great rural theses hand down the feats through generations" is an immortal monument which will convey down through generations the tireless efforts and leadership feats of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in unfolding a grand plan of rural construction and carrying the socialist rural theses into effect. Visiting Sinmi village there on February 12, 1946, President Kim Il-song met the villagers and showed them deep trust and inspired them with a new hope, saying that the farmers were the master of the land now that the country was liberated and they should build a prosperous country by reaping rich crops. Comrade Kim Chong-il called at the Haksan cooperative farm in early January 1964 and took a meticulous care of all the affairs of the farm, walking through snow-covered fields and going round farmers' houses and the shop in order to realize the great leader's plan of rural construction, and afterwards, energetically guided the farm in the implementation of the rural theses. Present at a ceremony for unveiling the monument Wednesday were Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea So Kwan-hui and officials concerned.
