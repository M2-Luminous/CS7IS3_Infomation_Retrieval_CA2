To date, the use right of a total of 500,000 hectares of wasteland in north China's Shanxi, Shaanxi and Heilongjiang Provinces had been sold to farmers, according to a national wastelands auction held in Mudanjiang city of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. China has more than 300 million hectares of wasteland suffering from serious water loss and soil erosion, over ten percent of which (about 30 million hectares) can be developed. State Councillor Chen Junsheng sent a message, hailing the opening ceremony of the auction, saying the new move is an extension of China's household contract responsibility system, with remuneration linked to output, that started in rural areas in the late 1970s. It is a new step, under the new market economic conditions, to initiate a mass movement to tackle soil erosion, he said. According to the state councillor, the right of development and use of wastelands sold legally allows farmers to explore and use the land for a period of 50 to 100 years. It can be inherited and transferred, he said. The move helps to bring into full play the initiative of local peasants to control water loss and soil erosion and tap natural resources and further develop agricultural production, Chen said. He added, it also opens a new way for the surplus labor force in the rural areas to find jobs and helps raise necessary funds for the country's water conservation projects. Due to various historical reasons, he said, soil erosion in China is still serious. It is of great significance to tackle the problem by mobilizing the masses of people, he said. He urged governments at all levels to understand and carry out the policy in spirit and to the letter and in the light of the real situation in each locality. According to the meeting, the main bidders for the use right of large tracts of wasteland are farmers, but personnel from governmental bodies, workers and staff members from state-owned and private enterprises, as well as overseas business people, are also encouraged to participate. Wasteland that suffer from serious soil erosion, including barren mountains, valleys, hills, rivers and streams, will be given priority in the sales. Money raised will be used solely as a special fund in tackling soil erosion problems in other areas. More than one hundred representatives from the governmental water and soil conservation departments at all levels across the country are taking part in the meeting.
