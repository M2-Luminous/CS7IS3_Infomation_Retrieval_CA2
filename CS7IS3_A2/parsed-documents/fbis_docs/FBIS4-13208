Here is the full text of the royal speech delivered before delegations of over 124 countries: "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, We, and the world at large with us, have just crossed a watershed, one of those decisive moments in history in which mankind unfailingly taps its wellspring of energy and psychological strength to launch a new grand design, conjure up hope of a brighter future and dispel the specter of despondency or disheartenment. The atmosphere of this moment we are sharing calls to mind the unforgettable memory of the Anfa conference that took place in Casablanca in 1943, at which we had the privilege of accompanying his majesty our father, may God have him in his mercy. The purpose of the conference, attended notably by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, was to prepare the allied disembarkation in Europe, but it marked the beginning not only of the allies' long march to victory but also of the far-reaching movement of liberation of the people still under colonial rule. Those men, whose action and abnegation restored freedom and democracy in the world, knew that the cessation of hostilities was not the same thing as peace, and that as the same causes will produce the same effects, they would be unable to establish enduring peace except in a setting favorable to lasting economic growth. The lessons they drew from the 1930s and in particular from the impact of protectionism on world-wide economic activity and security decisively shaped the drafting of the San Francisco Charter and the Bretton Woods Agreements. The aborted International Trade Organization would have rounded off the institutional framework for the multilateral management of the world economy, but the vagaries of politics dashed the hopes of those architects of the peacetime world. Thus, we have had to wait almost half-a-century in order at last to manage to bring the privileges of power within the sway of law. By bringing into being the world trade organization today, we are enshrining the rule of law in international economic and trade relations, thus setting universal rules and disciplines over the temptations of unilateralism and the law of the jungle. This collective profession of faith actually marks the end of the colonial pact and embodies genuine interdependence. Regardless of the size of our economies, from now on we shall all enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same obligations. we share the same goals and must meet the same challenges: Tackling the scourge of unemployment, redressing the problem of social exclusion, or finding appropriate ways of responding to our environmental or other concerns. The fact that the trade negotiations that we have just solemnly concluded were launched in Punta del Este and ended in Marrakech, in other words, in two countries of the south, must be seen as heralding a new age in which the antagonisms between the industrialized and developing countries will fade away. The alliances forged during these negotiations between partners having different levels of development show that this process is now under way. It is up to us to deepen it and strengthen it. The rise in the number of contracting parties, which lends a universal dimension to the agreements just signed, together with the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, mark the end of the ideological cleavages that have hampered the smooth development of the world economy. Henceforth, four fifths of the world's population live in market economies and over a hundred countries have embarked on the privatization of public-sector enterprises. Lastly, the fact that the Marrakech meeting coincides with the implementation of the agreements between the PLO and Israel is a good omen. Those agreements, enabling the Palestinian flag to fly over part of its territory, are the beginning of a process that will finally extinguish the oldest hotbed in the world. All of this means that the world of tomorrow can scarcely resemble the one in which we have lived until today. Changing production systems and consumption patterns, the emergence of new multimedia technologies and the rapid growth of related services will further speed up the globalization of markets for goods, services and capital. This globalization could herald greater inequalities among countries and aggravate the symptoms of social exclusion which may be observed in the rich as the less prosperous countries. It therefore calls for the creation and use of new machinery of collective solidarity as well as a new approach to economic and social development problems. The reason why many developing countries have courageously restructured their economies in order to integrate them better into the international economy is that they are convinced of the virtues of financial discipline and of the need to cushion the ensuing transitional social cost. This cost requires a counterpart from the developed countries in the form of corresponding adjustments favoring markets access and transparent conditions of fair competition, in particular through greater monetary stability. The special situation of Africa deserves a particular attention. Morocco, a Muslim, Arab and African country, was a pioneer of emancipation movements in Africa and it is fully aware of the challenges to be faced. We must assess the situation with lucidity and admit that the results of forty years of independence are mixed. Of course mistakes have been made, successes have been achieved here and there, but no one can ignore the latent risks of a situation in which the imbalance in levels of development is so sharp. We must not misjudge the shape of the future nor the danger of excluding a whole continent from the global economy. After all the measures taken to save Africa, we should ask ourselves if the time is not ripe for a veritable Marshall plan to alleviate the poverty and suffering of millions of people." "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, When we invited you to consider signing the final act of the Uruguay round in Marrakech, an invitation which you did us the honor and pleasure of accepting, we were motivated by a number of important considerations. To cite only some of them, for many centuries Marrakech has been a crossroads of trade and civilization between Africa and Europe and between the latter and the Arab world. It was in Marrakech, in 1788, that the exchange of letters between Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben 'Abdellah and George Washington led to the Kingdom of Morocco being the first nation to recognize the independence of the United States of America. These texts are still in force and deal with peace, friendship, and freedom of navigation and trade. It was also in Marrakech, in 1856, that an exchange of diplomatic instruments took place between Queen Victoria and Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane. The trade agreement which was the subject of this exchange set up the frame for the majority of treaties of the time. Its modernity and conformity with the rules and disciplines we have just adopted today would surprise many people: The most-favored nation clause was used in it for the first time. Thus it is in one of the oldest trading nations in the world that the most complex and most important trade negotiations in history have been concluded. By putting its signature beside those of the contracting parties present here, the Kingdom of Morocco is reaffirming a tradition of free trade from which it never swerved from its origin through the last world war. This tradition is not simply confined to trade, but embraces the wider area of the options facing society. In adopting pluralism and prohibiting a single-party regime in its first constitution proclaimed upon independence, Morocco was fully aware of the fact that a truly liberal economic policy must first of all be based on the values of democracy, and of political and trade union pluralism. Its steadfast determination to promote an economic system which gives pride of place to private initiative and the stimulus of equitable competition has allowed Morocco to follow the path of sustainable growth, remedy structural imbalances and attract foreign investment. The experience we have gained over the centuries has allowed us to establish our vocation as a land of reflection, courage and innovation and has taught us the virtues of humility and the essential need for lucidity. This leads us to conclude that, although the Marrakech agreements constitute a cornerstone of our common structure, they cannot be considered as an end in themselves. These agreements should rather give us food for thought and spur our creative imagination for building a new international order. We believe that the conditions have just been provided for a collective and calm reflection on the functioning of the global economy in the next century. Trade is only one element in a trilogy in which monetary and financial issues are interdependent. The impact of the monetary policies followed by the major actors in the international economy often leads to counterproductive effects which jeopardize what has been achieved by our restructuring efforts. In this respect, we propose studying with your respective heads of state the possibility of establishing an intergovernmental group to study the new mechanisms for international economic negotiations with a view to: -- improved coordination of action by the IMF, the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the WTO [World Trade Organization] -- a greater contribution by countries of the south to concerted implementation of a strategy to give the global economy a new impetus so as to come up with the appropriate response to the scourge of the twenty first century, which will be unemployment. "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, We give thanks to God for having allowed our meeting to be one of those which, in contributing to international cooperation, widen its scope, strengthen its bases and consolidate its rules. The Marrakech charter which concludes this meeting is a further valuable contribution to the series of international conventions on which our world of today has based its unity, turning away from the causes of strife and enmity to become part of the cycle of relations promoting the reign of peace and understanding. When Morocco expresses the pride it takes in having hosted the meeting, it simply is rightfully expressing its aspirations and its choice to always remain open onto the world and adhere to the principles of international cooperation. We should all therefore welcome the gigantic step forward towards broader and more intensive international cooperation, this progress towards the international solidarity which we hope will be the hallmark of the next century. And more than any other promise, it is the confirmation of this solidarity that we hope for from the proposed new world order."
