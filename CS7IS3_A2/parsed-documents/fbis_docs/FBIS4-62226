The "NTI" joint-stock company, set up jointly on an equal footing, will most likely be wound up in the near future. The editorial office was forced to conclude the contract with the U.S. publisher last August as an alternative to the increasingly complicated relations with the "Novoye Vremya Publishing House," headed by Sergey Dubov, former staffer on the magazine and entrepreneur. The magazine's financial position deteriorated following Dubov's murder this February. At the same time the editorial office leadership had begun to realize that the contract with the American would not bring the promised prosperity. The contract itself testifies to the naivete of the journalists who signed it and the U.S. businessman's romantic aspirations. The $100,000 invested in the joint business by the magazine and the $50,000 by Mr. Bausman personally is clearly an inadequate sum to revive the once-popular magazine, whose print run has fallen to 30,000 copies. Consequently the U.S. side's expenditure has already exceeded the $150,000, most of which went on the purchase of a computer publishing system, and the magazine is on the brink of bankruptcy. The contract has been canceled despite the fact that work on a new model of the magazine has been virtually completed and talks with a Finnish print shop have been held. NOVOYE VREMYA, which is in debt to the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA print shop and "Rospechat," cannot continue to publish the weekly's next issues. The editorial office is counting on getting its affairs in order by subletting part of the four-story building it rents in downtown Moscow. An active search for investors has begun in Russian financial circles.
