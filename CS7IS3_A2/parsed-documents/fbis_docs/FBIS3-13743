Christopher told a House subcommittee on appropriations that the US is pursuing an even-handed policy in South Asia, after Congressman James Moran asked some questions about Indian violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir and East Punjab. In recent months, the American in South Asia, and keeping a careful eye on relations between Pakistan and India. American policy-makers clearly see the region as a potential flash point, and have appointed a senior State Department man, Strobe Talbott, to watch the situation. Though generally considered an expert in US- Soviet relations, Talbott has probably been asked to observe the Pakistan-India situation because of his expertise in nuclear strategy and confidence building techniques between two hostile parties. Talbott is expected to visit Pakistan and India next month. Talbott's new assignment is a clear indication of how seriously Washington is viewing the tension in South Asia. The worst nightmare for the American administration is a conventional confrontation between South Asia's two largest powers, which could escalate into a nuclear conflict. Christopher told the House sub-committee that the US wanted India to cap its nuclear programme, which India insists is for peaceful purposes despite concrete evidence that it is forging ahead not only with the development of nuclear weapons technology, but is also perfecting an indigenous delivery system. But the key difference between Pakistan and India, vis-a-vis the Pressler Amendment, which applies only to Pakistan and not to India, was a subject that Mr Christopher did not comment on when asked to do so by Congressman Moran. If the United States is truly committed to an equal, even-handed approach to the two countries, then the application of the Pressler Amendment to Pakistan will have to be examined. New Delhi will have received the new about Christopher's statement with frigidity and some trepidation. There were also some questions about human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and Punjab to which Mr Christopher acknowledged that there were more "problems" in Indo-US relations are likely to deteriorate in this regard. There have been discernible shifts in US foreign policy regarding India over the past few months and it is becoming increasingly clear that American administration is no longer as gullible as it used to be. Pakistan had felt singled out by the US on several counts, with the general impression being that Washington was inclined favourably towards India on various issues. While Pakistan is still not off the hook, India is no longer being treated with myopic favouritism. A balanced American initiative in South Asia could go a long way in defusing the tension in the region. The key issue will, of course, be how even-handed American policy really will be. Anything less will be unacceptable and equally unsuccessful.
