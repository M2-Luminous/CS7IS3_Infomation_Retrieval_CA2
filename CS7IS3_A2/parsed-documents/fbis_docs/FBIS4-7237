This was upon the invitation of the Government of South Africa. As most of you already know, especially the old timers, the Philippines has had a long and distinguished record in being at the forefront of the anti-apartheid crusade. As one of the founding fathers of the UN special committee against apartheid, the Philippines prominently and consistently took the lead in the cause for equality for all South Africans. Among the members of the vice president's delegation are Ambassador Taday, who is our ambassador and envoy extra ordinary and plenipotentiary to South Africa; Mrs. Estrada; the chief of staff of the vice president, Buddy Abentajado; Mrs. Abentajado; and a senior officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Miguel Bautista.
