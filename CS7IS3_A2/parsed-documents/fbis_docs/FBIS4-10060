The legislator, finance committee chairman, and chairman of the commission studying reforms to the electoral and political parties laws, was shot several times, but there is still no information on the seriousness of his injuries, Radio Sonora reported. The motives of Chinchilla's attackers are still unknown. Chinchilla was the target of another attack months ago which caused him to lose one eye. This attack has occurred five days after Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his house. No one has claimed responsibility for that attack. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2342 GMT transmits a report which states that "Chinchilla was transferred in critical condition to a private hospital."
