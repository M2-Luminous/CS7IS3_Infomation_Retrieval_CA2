In a statement to an AZERTAC correspondent, Zeynalov, vice president of the Azergas Company [Azerbaijan Natural Gas Company], said that Azerbaijan planned to receive 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas. The supply will be a little less because of Turkmenistan's request that we repay 700 million cubic meters of the natural gas we wish to buy in the form of diesel oil. However, there is a great demand for diesel oil in Azerbaijan. In view of this, we were unable to agree to that proposal. The sides are currently working to change the agreement. Our republic will receive another 700 million cubic meters of natural gas if an agreement is reached on repaying that amount with other products. Zeynalov also said that Azerbaijan received 6.3 million cubic meters of natural gas from Turkmenistan on 22 February.
