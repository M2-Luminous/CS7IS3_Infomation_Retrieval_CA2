FR940613-0-00038 FR940613-0-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [PA 19&hyph;1&hyph;6225; FRL&hyph;4890&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Pennsylvania; Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This revision establishes and requires the use of Stage II vapor recovery at gasoline dispensing facilities in ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate, serious, or severe in the Commonwealth. The effect of this action is to approve, in a limited fashion, the Pennsylvania regulation requiring Stage II vapor recovery gasoline dispensing facilities (Chapter 129.82) and the associated definition of gasoline dispensing facility in Chapter 121.1. It is also the effect of this action to disapprove, in a limited fashion, Pennsylvania regulation, Chapter 129.82. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; Air and Radiation Docket & Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources Bureau of Air Quality Control, P.O. Box 8468, 400 Market Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia H. Stahl, (215) 597&hyph;9337, at the EPA Region III address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62560), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The NPR proposed two actions: (a) A limited approval/limited disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82 submitted on March 4, 1992; and (b) approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h) and section 17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June 29, I992. EPA proposed the approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act in the event that Pennsylvania submitted those sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as a formal SIP revision. Since Pennsylvania has not submitted the applicable sections from its Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June 29, 1992, EPA is withdrawing its proposed approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h) and section 17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act, as amended on June 29, 1992. Therefore, this notice is a final rulemaking action of the March 4, 1992 submittal alone. Other specific requirements of Pennsylvania's Stage II regulation and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. Only one comment pertaining to the NPR was received. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER) requested that EPA withhold final action on the Stage II vapor recovery regulation submitted on March 4, I992 until EPA resolves the issues concerning applicability of Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. EPA has no issues to resolve concerning Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. The onboard vapor recovery requirements required to be issued prior to January 22, 1994 do not affect requirements in the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82. States are free to continue to enforce Stage II regulations in moderate ozone nonattainment areas, even after the promulgation of onboard vapor recovery requirements by EPA. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its limited approval/limited disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, and the associated definition of gasoline dispensing facilities located in Chapter 121.1, which is applicable in moderate, serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas in the Commonwealth. Final Action EPA is approving the definition of gasoline dispensing facility in Chapter 121 and the Stage II vapor recovery requirements in Chapter 129.82 as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP. EPA is also disapproving the Stage II vapor recovery requirements in Chapter 129.82 for the limited purpose of allowing Pennsylvania the opportunity to correct the testing and certification requirement deficiencies previously identified by EPA. This final limited disapproval begins the 18 month sanctions clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation. Because of the previously identified deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 110(k)(3) and part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule(s) under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does not meet the section 182(b)(3) requirement of part D because of the noted deficiencies. Thus, EPA is approving the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82 submitted under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA for the limited purpose of strengthening the Pennsylvania SIP. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA , 427 U.S. 246, 255&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). EPA is also disapproving the Pennsylvania Stage II rule because it contains deficiencies that have not been corrected and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and offsets. The 18 month period referred to in section 179(a) begins at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). The 18 month sanctions clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation begins on June 13, 1994. EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements and impose any new Federal requirements. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, pertaining to the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
