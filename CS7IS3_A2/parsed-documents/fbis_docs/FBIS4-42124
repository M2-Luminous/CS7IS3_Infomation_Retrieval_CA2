FBIS4-42124 "drweu104_p_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 GREECE Reports From Gjirokaster Reports From Gjirokaster NC3005201694 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network in Greek 1700 GMT 30 May 94 NC3005201694 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] Sotirios Kiriazatis, the president of Omonoia, who was forcefully brought in for interrogation yesterday afternoon by the Albanian police, was finally released this morning. At the same time, the Albanian authorities brought in for interrogation other immigrants, including Vasilios Bileros, Delvine's elected nomarch. Yesterday, some Albanian newspapers and the state television published a forged letter attributed to Kiriazatis which he had supposedly sent in 1992 to Konstandinos Mitsotakis, Greek prime minister at that time, in which he supposedly thanked him for his help in Hellenizing North Ipiros. In a statement today, the president of Omonoia stressed that the letter published by the Albanian newspapers was forged and it was obviously intended to incriminate him. At the same time, the Albanian Foreign Ministry yesterday launched an attack against Greece, saying that with its statements the Greek Government is trying to create another Bosnia in the southern Balkans. In a statement to Albanian television today, President Sali Berisha claimed that he has a positive attitude about resuming the dialogue with Greece and stressed that the Greek minority in Albania enjoys all its rights. It should be noted that the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN today reports that NATO has asked the Albanian Government to get rid of its nationalistic elements. Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis in Gjirokaster has the following report: [Begin recording] [Kirousis] The Albanian Government's provocations against the Greek minority in North Ipiros continue. The head of Omonoia here in Sarande, Sotirios Kiriazatis, was arrested. He was questioned for several hours by interrogators sent from Tirana and then was released. [Kiriazatis] We are indeed going through difficult times. This is because there were mass interrogations, which cause a climate of fear, so to speak, and concern in general within the Greek community. What we can advise during these situations is to find solutions through good judgment. [end recording]
