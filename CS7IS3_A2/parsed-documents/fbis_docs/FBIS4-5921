In past years, the patriotic emulation movement by Catholics as well as activities of the Catholic solidarity committees of provinces and cities countrywide have been focused on implementing the resolution of the Vietnam Catholic Solidarity General Committee's third plenary session. Catholics of all strata have placed their confidence on and carried out pretty well the policies of the state in all socioeconomic aspects. In many localities, Catholics have positively contributed suggestions and opinions on drafts to amend laws such as the Law on Land, Tax Law, on so forth. They also responded well to social and charity activities. Many localities have effectively provided poor Catholics with material help or cash amounting to many million dong. In anticipation of the National Congress of the Vietnamese Catholicism, which will be held in 1995, the Catholic solidarity committees of all localities have actively continued to consolidate their organization and reformed their activities; have motivated Catholics to step up their production and business activities in all fields of agriculture, industry, forestry, and so forth; and have encouraged young Catholics to participate in the national defense movement, in campaigns to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, in campaigns to reward family with meritorious deeds, as well as in campaigns to fight social vices.
