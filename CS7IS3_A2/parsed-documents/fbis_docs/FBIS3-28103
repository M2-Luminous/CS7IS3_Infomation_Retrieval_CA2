[Reporter] [question indistinct] [Murayama] That is the way I think. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Murayama] No, since there will be a meeting of the party Central Executive Committee [CEC] tomorrow -- I mean today. We will reconfirm the party position at the committee meeting, and inform the prime minister. We will have to draw a clear line one way or another. That will be the steps we will take, I think. [Reporter] Naturally, cabinet members [of the party] then will entrust you with what to do. Will you pull them out of the cabinet? [Murayama] I have their understanding that they will follow -- in unity -- the party's policy decided on at the CEC meeting tomorrow [today]. So, that can happen. [Reporter] Is it possible that this will not happen? [Murayama] Well, that would never happen unless the prime minister changes his mind. [Reporter] If this situation persists, it is possible that the cabinet will resign en masse or the Diet will dissolve for another general election. Of course, you have arrived at this decision after thinking about all this, right? [Murayama] At the joint meeting [of coalition party representatives], I said that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree [to the prime minister's decision] and that a forthcoming decision by the party can affect the cabinet's foundation. I asked him if he was aware of all this when making the decision -- even though the prime minister's response to the question was that he was asking for the SDPJ's cooperation so that such a thing would not happen. [Reporter] Had there been no prior consultations on the matter of raising the consumption tax to 7 percent? [words indistinct] [Murayama] No, not at all. Actually, I have heard him speak negatively about raising the consumption tax. I have never thought, even in my imagination, that he would make such a decision. It has a new name of public welfare tax, but is, in substance, just a general revenue source. It is not different from the consumption tax. Only its name has changed. Even when the consumption tax was first instituted, the government insisted time and again that money therefrom would be used for welfare. That precedence is only being repeated indeed. Nothing has changed in substance. [Reporter] Is there no room for the SDPJ to reconsider its position as long as [words indistinct]? [Murayama] First, the government should present its vision on welfare, and then submit a list of funds needed to carry out projects under such a vision. It should say how much money can be raised from insurance and how much money should come from tax revenue. If this step is taken, maybe the people will be able to agree on the need for the money. But in his announcement, there is no mention of such a thing, and only a tax rate is presented. However hard he may try to explain it, the people will accept it as raising the consumption tax rate, using a new name -- the public welfare tax. I told him so. [Reporter] To keep the coalition government in power, your party supported the political reform bills even though some in the party were against it. Will not some of your party object to the party's stand on the tax this time? [Murayama] As long as the prime minister does not change his mind, that sort of thing will not happen, I think. [Reporter] That means that as long as the prime minister does not change his stand, the SDPJ will come to act as an opposition party [several words indistinct]? [Murayama] Either way, tomorrow -- I mean today -- the party will decide on a policy. I will talk about that after that is done. [Reporter] Will your party object to a budget formulated by the government? [Murayama] I think it will if the government formulates the budget's taking the tax into it. [Reporter] Is it impossible for the SDPJ to rethink its policies on such issues as the rice market liberalization, political reform, and so forth now that [words indistinct]? [Murayama] That is something we can think about -- only in the future. [Reporter] As far as only this tax issue is concerned, is the party in complete agreement? [Murayama] The CEC makes a decision only with a unanimous agreement. The committee will reconfirm the party policy on that in a unanimous agreement, and then will entrust the party chairman and general secretary with the decision making. [Reporter] Do you think there are some party Diet members who will not agree to the CEC decision? [Murayama] No, I think we can make a decision unanimously this time. [laughter from reporters] [Reporter] In passing the political reform bills recently, even though you disagreed with some government concessions to the Liberal Democratic Party, you decided to support the bills eventually. Is it possible that your stand on the political reforms will now change again? [Murayama] Our party would like to make a judgment on other matters only after the party's decision on this question has been set. [NHK breaks off relay of the news conference here]
