The Bosnian Croats' constitutional rights and right of self-determination can be exercised through the Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna in a union of three republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, provided that the right is observed of the other two constituent nations, Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, to have their own republics based on the same principles -- says a declaration adopted by 400 participants in the parliament session of the Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna late on Tuesday. According to this document, Mostar, the largest town in the Herzegovina region and its administrative centre, in which pitched battles are being fought between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem troops, is to be the capital of the Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna and 'an indivisible urban entity.' The participants in the parliament session held in Livno, a town in western Herzegovina, have supported Franjo Tudjman's policy i.e. his 'peace initiative,' in particular the agreement on the normalization of relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia signed within the international conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva last month.
