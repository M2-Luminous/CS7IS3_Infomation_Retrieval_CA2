The second reading of the law has brought no results, as the deputies failed to agree on categories of responsibility of officials. In the opinion of Deputy Artem Tarasov, "One cannot compare the responsibility of the Central Bank head and the minister of education". He also thinks that the prime minister should not resign without giving an account of his work. Tarasov gained no support of deputies. The deputies want to prohibit high-ranking officials to deliver lectures for payment. They also want state secret information submitted to the tax inspection to remain undisclosed. Some suggested to demand that all officials produce their income declarations. After a break the deputies will continue to discuss the draft law against corruption.
