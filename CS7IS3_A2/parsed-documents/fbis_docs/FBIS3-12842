The KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, an English-language newspaper, said a "solution may be found to the animosity" between Iran and the United States if Washington could prove it was "sincere" about improving ties. "As a first step, Washington should release" billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in the United States since 1979, when Iranian students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held U.S. nationals hostage, it said. The call by KAYHAN was the first since Tehran ruled out negotiations with Washington in November, on the anniversary of the embassy siege, and appeared to put to rest speculation about attempts to improve ties. Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties since 1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the pro-American shah. The paper also urged compensation for the relatives of the passengers of an Iranian civilian airliner downed by the U.S. Navy over the Gulf. The Iran Air Airbus was shot down by two missiles fired from the cruiser USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988, shortly after taking off from Bandar-e 'Abbas to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. The United States has maintained that the shooting was an accident, the plane being mistaken for a military aircraft. The daily however voiced doubt that Washington would "ever be able" to come to terms with the Iranian revolution, or understand that Iran "could never be forced to yield" under pressure.
