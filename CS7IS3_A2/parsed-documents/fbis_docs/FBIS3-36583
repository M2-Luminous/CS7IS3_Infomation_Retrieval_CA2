The Leader of the Belarus Government Has Given Our Correspondent an Interview in Which He Talks About the Problems Connected With the Solution of This Question"] [Text] Republic of Belarus -- [Gulyayev] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, in one of your speeches you said: "The Government has a concept. The cornerstone of that concept is cooperation with Russia..." But the opposition regards putting the question that way as opposing the sovereignty of Belarus and the agreement on the creation of a single monetary system as yet another manifestation of a "pro-Russian, pro-empire" policy. On the other hand, to judge from the reaction of Yegor Gaydar and some other Russian politicians there are differing attitudes toward the agreement there, too. Hence the following questions. First, how does your government's policy tally with the sovereignty of the republic? Second, is the unification of the monetary systems a manifestation of normal business partnership? Or is it pure philanthropy on Russia's part? [Kebich] As for the opposition, these people represent a very small part of the republic's population. According to the latest polls they represent around 4 percent. Their opinion is that held by politicians who will do anything to get power. For some of them any means will do, and that includes distortion of the facts. How can there be any question of an infringement of sovereignty in the process of normal economic integration? If that is the case you would have to say that those European figures who are working for the introduction of a single means of payment for Europe are bad patriots, too! Both there and here it is a question of economic union among states, each of which has its own state organization, Constitution, culture, and traditions... But as for philanthropy... Yes, different people cite different figures -- trillions of dollars -- which Russia is allegedly losing in the ruble zone. Well, let us examine the situation. Let us start with the fact that powerful production units created in the republic are a constituent part of major technical cycles in Russia, too. That is why Russian producers and consumers (unlike some politicians) are keenly interested in economic union with Belarus. But no one should forget that the oil fields in Siberia, the processing enterprises, and the gold and hard currency assets were created by the joint labor of the peoples of all the republics of the former Union. Including to a considerable extent the labor of the Belarusian people. Not to mention the oil pipelines running across the republic's territory and transit routes to the West... If we start adding everything up, I do not think that it will run to trillions. I mention all this not because I want to make any claims. I would just like public opinion in Russia and Belarus to be formed on the basis of a sober and all-around assessment of the situation. After all, the rate of our currency (we did not dream of introducing it, incidentally, and did not dream of leaving the ruble zone) against the Russian ruble was initially one to one. It then fell for two reasons: The first is that prices for energy sources rose sharply for us, the second is the Russians' indebtedness for output already supplied. If Russian enterprises paid us back the money that they owed us for that output the ratio would have been different. No, philanthropy simply has nothing to do with it. Equitable partnership alone -- the most sober-minded and honest politicians in Russia understand that. [Gulyayev] However, the resistance to the ruble zone in Russia looks very serious. Once again, this is Gaydar's demarche... [Kebich] You know, I do not think that the signing of the agreement on the unification of the monetary systems was really a serious reason for Gaydar's resignation from the government. It goes far deeper. In my view, it may be expressed in general terms as a difference of views between the premier and the vice-premier on the path of the continuation of the reforms. And the convenient pretext is... Belarus. Or it could be the construction of the Russian parliament building, for example. This is not a subject for discussion for serious politicians. But as a pretext, I repeat, it will do. [Gulyayev] You are doubtless right. But you know that there are quite a few people in Belarus who say: Kebich's policy will not work. There are too many forces in Russia who are opposed to it... Tell me, have you taken the disposition of forces into account? In particular, President Yeltsin's opinion? [Kebich] I can cite my recent meeting with him. It lasted three hours 30 minutes. I remember the president's words well: The union with Belarus must be concluded as quickly as possible. We stand to gain from this politically and economically. [Gulyayev] Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that under pressure from various political forces the decision on the ruble zone will be postponed. Does your government have an alternative option? [Kebich] Of course it does. That option is our own currency. We are ready for its introduction and, if necessary, we will be able to carry it out fairly quickly. [Gulyayev] But it is a question of orientation. After all, recently in the republic there has been much debate about the turn toward the West in counterbalance to the traditional preference for the East. Increasingly often the option of the Baltic-Black Sea market comes to mind. How do you regard this idea? [Kebich] In itself it is not new. The People's Front's plans for the creation of a Baltic-Black Sea union have existed for a long time. This union is based on a clearly expressed desire to sever ties with Russia. But to lend the idea plausibility, they cite various economic computations, of course. I do not regard the question that way. I cannot even tolerate the very title of the "Baltic-Black Sea union" (or market as you put it). Because Belarus has always had market relations -- production and economic relations -- with the Baltic. Even when the question of the economic blockade of Lithuania was being raised Belarus did not take part in that. We traded and continue to trade with our neighbors in Poland and Ukraine... These ties have never been broken off. So there is no reason to talk of creating some special market here. Russia is a completely different kettle of fish. So long as my heart beats I will continue campaigning for a union with it as I always have done and am doing now. It is not just a question of economic circumstances. We are all linked by the closest spiritual bonds. We have a common history and similar cultures. There is no family which does not have kin or close friends in Russia. Severing those ties would really cut to the quick. However, as we have already seen for ourselves, there are people on both sides who want to do just that. In NARODNAYA GAZETA, the organ of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet, recently, Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the People's Front, wrote yet another article that was insulting to our Russian brothers. What is more, this man, who regards himself as a serious politician, made impudent territorial claims on Russia, Lithuania, and Poland publicly for the first time! I repeat that his followers are few. Whereas those who support the union with Russia are industrial enterprise and collective and state farm leaders and business structures who are aware of the threat of further disintegration. The majority of the Belarus population favor union, a fact which is eloquently demonstrated not just by opinion poll findings but also by the many letters sent to the organs of state power and administration. I think that with such support the government will succeed in implementing the decision on the economic union. And in this way my government's main political will be achieved! [Gulyayev] One of the most important conditions for economic integration is the equality [adekvatnost] of economic systems, you said in a new year's eve address to diplomats. But does this not mean that Belarus will be forced to ape the economic and political decisions of the Russian Government? Including those which have led to the disintegration of collective farms in the countryside? [Kebich] You would have been entirely right if it were a question of a political and economic union. But the ruble zone is not a political and economic union. It is first and foremost a single financial and monetary system. And that is all. Russia will still have its Law on Land with all its idiosyncracies. Just as we will still have our law which envisages private ownership in very restricted limits -- less than 20 percent of the land resources. We will still have our law on the priority of agriculture and it is being implemented. In any event, whereas industrial enterprises have already stopped working because of the shortage of electricity not one milking operation on a single collective farm has been disrupted for that reason. And the main field campaigns have always been supplied with fuel. Our policy of support for collective farms as the main agricultural producers and the development of measures for the social protection of peasants remains unchanged. Recently, for example, by special government decree the national bank opened a line of credit amounting to 715 billion rubles to finance costs incurred in the preparation for sowing work... We are not going to blindly copy the state system in Russia either. In short, under the single monetary system Belarus will still have the possibility of following its own path. Just as Russia will. We have reached full understanding with Russia's leaders on this point. [Gulyayev] Understanding is a good thing. But our rural readers are eternal pragmatists. They are accustomed to assessing all events from the standpoint of what actual benefit they bring. That is why we are putting the question in these terms: How will the agreement on the single monetary system affect the well being of the peasant, whether Belarusian or Russian? [Kebich] To begin, let me say that I, too, am a pragmatic man. I do not like bombastic words, I prefer concrete and down-to-earth matters. That is why I propose to examine the situation using concrete examples. Here is example number one: The energy sources presently being supplied to the republic from Russia reach our peasants at prices approximately one and one-half times higher than their Russian counterparts. But the existence of the single monetary system presupposes standard prices. So all the fuels and lubricants for peasants will become cheaper. This means that life will become easier for the Belarusian collective farm member and private farmer. Example number two: Customs duties alone add about 35-40 percent to the cost price of a tractor, for example an MTZ, the moment that it crosses the border near Smolensk. But the agreement on the ruble zone envisages a single customs area. This means that the Smolensk peasant will be able to buy a Minsk tractor (or a feed combine harvester, or an MAZ vehicle, or a refrigerator) at almost half price. This means that life will become easier for them too. I could cite a great many examples of this kind. But they all amount to the same thing: The economic union with Russia will bring real, tangible advantages not just to the peasant but to every citizen in our countries. And more and more people in Belarus understand that... [Gulyayev] Do you mean the people who form the so-called "Kebich party"? After all, you know that this term has appeared in some politicians' speeches, don't you? In other words, your government is being viewed not even as a team of like-minded people but as something considerably broader -- as a political force. Do you agree with this assessment? If so, how do you rate the chances of the "Kebich party" in the coming elections? [Kebich] Yes, there has always been much hullaballoo and the use of labels and stock phrases around me and my supporters. First there was talk of a "team." Then they began saying that this is not simply a team but a party. Generally speaking I am not afraid of this word. Although there is an opinion that the government should be outside party politics. But in real life that is not the way of things. Thus it is possible that a party will appear in the future... It is not ruled out. One thing is clear: Whatever name is used, we, the sensible politicians and economic managers, represent a real force which one way or another is influencing political processes. Life will show how powerful that influence is going to be.
