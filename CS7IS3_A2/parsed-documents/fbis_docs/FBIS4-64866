In a letter cited by the ZDF "Bonn Direkt" program on Sunday [8 May], Verheugen suggests that the democratic parties should hold counterdemonstrations against Republikaner election campaign rallies in communities, cities, and rural districts. According to Verheugen, people react helplessly time and again, by counterdemonstrations that often end up in violence and "provoke civil war-like scenes." Meanwhile, Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber told a ZDF reporter why he is so often absent from committee meetings in the European Parliament. He said he does not want taxpayers to pay for the presence of a deputy who "cannot move anything anyway" in the committees.
