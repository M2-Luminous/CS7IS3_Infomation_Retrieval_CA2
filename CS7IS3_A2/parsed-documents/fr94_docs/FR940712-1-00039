FR940712-1-00039 FR940712-1-00011 One individual and two citizen groups, in addition to the Maine and New Hampshire State conservation agencies, suggested that the northeastern part of the Northern States Recovery Region be separated and considered distinct. The Northern States Recovery Team, which has representation from the Northeast, has also considered this question and does not recommend separating the northeastern States from the present Northern States Recovery Region. The Service concurs with the Northern States Recovery Team. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for reclassifying species on the Federal lists. A species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These five factors and their application to the bald eagle are as follows. A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The bald eagle is associated with aquatic ecosystems throughout most of its range. Nesting almost never occurs farther than 3 km (2 miles) from water (Gerrard and Bortolotti 1988). Fish predominate in the typical diet of eagles. Many other types of prey are also taken, including waterfowl and small mammals depending on location, time of year, and population cycles of prey species. Dead animals or carrion, especially in the wintering areas, are also taken when readily available (Lincer et al. 1979). Nest sites are usually in large trees along shorelines in relatively remote areas. The trees must be sturdy and open to support a nest that is often 2&hyph;3 m (6&hyph;9 ft) across and more than a meter (3 ft) thick (Bent 1938). Bald eagles also select cliffs or rock outcrops for nest sites where large trees are not available. This dependence upon very large trees associated with water makes the eagle vulnerable to water-associated development pressures. One of the two major threats to the bald eagle at present and for the foreseeable future is destruction and degradation of its habitat (the other major threat is environmental contaminants_see Factor E below). This occurs through direct cutting of trees for shoreline development, human disturbance associated with recreational use of shorelines and waterways, and contamination of waterways from point and non-point sources of pollution. Contamination enters bald eagles through the food chain and may impair individual birds' reproductive success and health. It may also reduce the abundance of preferred prey. Steps to reduce these threats are underway at all levels of government and public organizations nationwide. Increased protection of nesting habitat and winter roost sites have occurred in many areas throughout the country. Guidelines to minimize human disturbance around nesting and winter roost sites have been developed in all parts of the country. Areas of contamination continue to be identified and reduced. Rehabilitation, captive propagation reintroduction, and transplanting programs have all worked toward increasing the viability of the U.S. bald eagle population. Current threats to the bald eagle's habitat and range in the United States by Recovery Region are as follows: Chesapeake Bay Region: Buehler et al. (1991) reported that the bald eagle feeding and resting use of Chesapeake Bay shoreline was directly related to the distance of development from the shoreline. Eagles tended to avoid shorelines with nearby pedestrian or boat traffic. With human activity and development increasing, preferred bald eagle habitat is diminishing. Associated land clearing reduces bald eagle nesting and perching sites. To offset these impacts, the Service has expanded its National Wildlife Refuge System around the Chesapeake Bay area to protect bald eagle habitat. For example, the Service acquired 3,500 acres of nesting and roosting habitat in the James River area of Chesapeake Bay in 1991 to be protected and managed for bald eagles. Acquisition of an additional 600 acres is planned. The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which provides important eagle habitat on Chesapeake Bay, is also proposing to acquire more land. Nickerson (1989) estimates that enough suitable unoccupied nesting habitat remains that, if unaltered, it could sustain continued growth of the bald eagle population through the remainder of the 20th century. Northern States Recovery Region: Development, particularly near urban areas, remain as a primary threat. In spite of these localized problems, bald eagle nesting activity in the Northern States Recovery Region has more than doubled in the past 10 years from fewer than 700 to over 1600 territories known to be occupied. There also is ample unoccupied habitat still available throughout this region. In the Great Plains States, loss of wintering habitat is a major concern. Wintering areas have been lost through development of riparian areas for recreational, agricultural, and urban uses. Loss of wintering habitat also occurs due to lack of cottonwood regeneration. This results from changes in floodplain hydrology from construction of reservoirs and dam operations. Grazing also inhibits regeneration. A threat to some wintering populations of eagles in the Great Plains States is the destruction of prairie dog colonies and other important foraging areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992).
