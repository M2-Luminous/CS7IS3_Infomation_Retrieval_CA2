He was seen off on departure from Tunis-Carthage international airport by the president. Following the visit, a joint statement was issued. The statement said that during the visit, in which the Algerian president was accompanied by an important delegation, the two presidents held comprehensive talks where the spirit of understanding and friendship and the belief in a common destiny prevailed. The talks showed much harmony in the points of view on bilateral, regional, and international matters discussed. Regarding bilateral relations and ways of strengthening and promoting them on the basis of the strong political will of the two leaderships, the two presidents praised the achievements made in the process of enlarging existing spheres of fruitful common cooperation and their diversification in a way that will serve the aspirations of the two brotherly Algerian and Tunisian peoples and achieve their longing for more development and strength in a climate of solidarity and integration. The two presidents noted with great satisfaction what the two brotherly countries achieved in the border demarcation issue and considered it a great achievement embodying the spirit of brotherhood and good neighborliness that built a strong bridge of fruitful cooperation and interaction between the two countries in faithfulness to their common history. Presidents Ben Ali and Zeroual hailed the creation of several economic and social joint projects, particularly within the framework of the development of areas on the borders between the two countries. They stressed their determination to carry on bolstering this fruitful cooperation and their eagerness to guarantee the viability of the joint projects and make the Maghreb Bank for Cooperation an effective instrument to finance these projects. In this context, they agreed to convene the 11th session of the Higher Tunisian-Algerian Joint Committee in September 1994. The two presidents also stressed their strong commitment to the progress of the two countries on the path of democracy, pluralism, the promotion of human rights, and the establishment of the civil society by preserving the constituents of the Arab and Islamic identity and promoting values of tolerance that are the pride of the Muslim religion -- distinct from all aspects of fanaticism, isolation, and extremism. The joint Tunisian-Algerian statement added that in their review of the progress of the building of the Arab Maghreb Union, the two heads of state blessed the important steps the Union had made. They extolled the new push the sixth session of the Presidential Council had given to the Maghreb march. They reaffirmed their determination to continue to support the Maghreb edifice as the best way to rise to the challenges that are thrown up by the developments on the international stage and to embody the ambitions of the Maghreb peoples toward progress and invulnerability in the shadow of solidarity, integration, and merger. Regarding the situation on the Arab and international levels, the presidents renewed their concern over the continuation of the crisis between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and some Western states. They stressed the need to work together to find a peaceful, just, and honorable solution to this crisis; a solution that will secure the interests of all sides on the basis of respect for international legitimacy and safeguard the Libyan people's sovereignty and dignity. They reaffirmed the importance of continuing efforts to rebuild trust and harmony in Arab relations and to establish firm and stable foundations for these ties based on respect for the sovereignty of countries, their choices, and the well-being of their entities and cooperation to utilize all these resources to serve joint interests. They also confirmed their full support for the Palestinian people in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights, which include self-determination and setting up their independent state on their land, with Jerusalem as its capital. They denounced the barbaric massacres, particularly the Hebron mosque massacre, committed against the Palestinian people. Presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Liamine Zeroual confirmed the importance of solidarity between Arab and African peoples and the effective role of the Arab League and the OAU to boost and develop cooperation to serve joint interests. They noted with optimism the steps achieved to lift the apartheid regime from the people of South Africa and to lay the foundations for a new epoch based on a just, democratic, and multiracial system. The two heads of states expressed their deep interest in coordinating positions on security and cooperation with Mediterranean countries. They said they supported the initiative calling on Arab states overlooking the Mediterranean sea to coordinate between them to reach a unified stand reflecting their interest in making peace and tranquility prevail in this region. The Tunisian-Algerian joint statement added that the two presidents welcomed their talks on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the agreement between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, saying it was the first step toward ending the tragedy of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed the necessity that international and UN efforts continue to ward off Serb attacks, protect the sovereignty of country -- which is a member of the United Nations -- and preserve the right of its people to exist and live in peace and security. President Liamine Zeroual expressed his admiration for Tunisia's revival in all fields under the wise leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. [passage omitted] He invited President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to go on an official visit to Algeria. The invitation was accepted and a date will be set later.
