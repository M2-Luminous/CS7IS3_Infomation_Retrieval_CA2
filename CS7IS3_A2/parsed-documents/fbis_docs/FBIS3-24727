A special IFP general conference in Ulundi on Sunday rejected the 1993 interim constitution but resolved to "pursue every last opportunity to seek agreement in negotiations", and mandated Inkatha's Central Committee to take a final decision on the April poll. IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told the conference on Sunday he had spoken earlier to State President F W de Klerk who had assured him he would do all he could to arrive at an all inclusive constitutional settlement. Mr Buthelezi had told the president he did not want to "shut the door" and that negotiations should continue and "take their course". He told a media conference later, however, that it would take "almost a miracle" for an acceptable agreement within the next few days, echoing the views of one of his top negotiators, Walter Felgate, who described the latest ANC [African National Congress] proposals to break the constitutional impasse as an "insult to our intelligence". The IFP would continue last-ditch negotiations with the African National Congress and the government on Monday and had only 10 days to make a final decision on elections after Mr De Klerk had proclaimed the election date -- probably on Monday -- explained Mr Buthelezi. Party negotiators Dr Ben Ngubane and Mr Joe Matthews flew to Pretoria on Sunday morning to prepare for the talks. The IFP conference stood fast on the Freedom Alliance proposals to have the constitution amended and instructed Inkatha's Central Committee to receive a final report from its negotiators for review. It would also review achievements in negotiations on the Zulu monarchy. It further resolved to seek common cause with the Pan Africanist Congress on objection to a single ballot and would try to bring in the Democratic Party and others opposed to this system of voting. The IFP leader made it clear that this was one of the major stumbling blocks to his party's participation in elections. The IFP's other main constitutional demands include greater regional autonomy and the right for provinces to draw up their own constitutions and for these to be constitutionally entrenched. Earlier, IFP negotiator Walter Felgate warned the deadline for a settlement was midnight on Monday but said there was still time for the African National Congress and the government to "come to their senses". Mr Felgate was a strong force behind an election boycott, charging on Saturday that negotiations would not deliver for the IFP. He also branded government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer a "liar". Leading the anti-election stance was IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi who on Saturday told a few thousand delegates the interim constitution was "specifically designed to promote ANC power and was an instrument for the IFP's destruction". Mr Buthelezi told the media conference on Sunday that his party had more to lose than any other by boycotting elections but laughed at predictions that the IFP would be relegated to the political wilderness by adopting this stance. The IFP leader said his party would resort to "resistance" politics but this would be non-violent. Mr Buthelezi on Saturday, said he would not subject his supporters to a constitution which was "totally wrong for South Africa", adding while he had never rejected the notion of reconciliation with the ANC, "this constitution as it now stands is an arena for a struggle to the finish". "Within its provisions there is no scope for constitutional or political settlements," he said.
