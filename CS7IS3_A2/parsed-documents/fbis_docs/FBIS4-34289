The article adds: "The National Party, which received significant support in April, continues growing and has improved, but by only one percentage point. The Colorado Party has grown 3 percentage points compared with last month's support, probably thanks to the PGP followers who will vote for the Sanguinetti-Batlle ticket. The FA standing has remained unchanged since April."
