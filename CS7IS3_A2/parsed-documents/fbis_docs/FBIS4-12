FBIS TRENDS-06APR94-JAPAN-EU Japan-EU: Tokyo Seeks EU Support Against U.S. Trade Policy Japan-EU: Tokyo Seeks EU Support Against U.S. Trade Policy Recent Japanese press reporting has suggested that the Japanese Government is attempting to enlist the support of the European Union (EU) against U.S. efforts to force open Japanese markets, particularly Washington's recent revival of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Bill. Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai, for example, appears to have used French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's 31 March-3 April visit to Tokyo to coordinate Japanese and French strategy toward any possible U.S. use of Super 301, which permits Washington to identify countries that discriminate against U.S. exports and impose sanctions if those countries fail to remove barriers to U.S. products. According to a 1 April Kyodo report, Japanese officials reported that during a 1 April meeting, Kumagai and Juppe agreed that Tokyo and Paris would "oppose unilateral U.S. trade retaliation" such as that mandated by Super 301. In comments suggesting that the two countries might attempt to lobby against Super 301 during the upcoming 12-15 April ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, Juppe reportedly told Kumagai that he hoped retaliatory measures, such as Super 301, would be abolished after GATT members sign the final accord of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks in Marrakech (Kyodo, 1 April). Japanese media reporting about Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's plans for the Marrakech meeting also suggests that Tokyo has been lining up European support against Super 301. According to a 6 April Kyodo report, an undentified Japanese Government source stated that, during meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Hata will urge Washington not to invoke Super 301 against Japan by citing European and Asian criticism of the provision. Hata may have solicited support from EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan for this effort when, according to the 29 March Mainichi Shimbun, Hata called Brittan on 29 March to explain the Japanese market opening package announced that day.
