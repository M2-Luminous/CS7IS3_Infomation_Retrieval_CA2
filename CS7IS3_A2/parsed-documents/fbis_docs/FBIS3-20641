According to data from the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, impressive gains have been made in offshore oil and gas prospecting as 40,000 kilometers of linear seismic survey were completed in the year, 17 exploratory wells were drilled, 16 new prospecting structures were found, and 7 oil and gas discoveries were made for a success rate of 44 percent, including 11 new structures independently discovered, yielding 6 oil and gas finds for a success rate of 54.5 percent. Between August and October last year, 3 offshore oil fields went into production, and that raised the daily offshore oil output level up to 17,000 tons. Calls for petroleum bids for nearby offshore areas in the East China Sea were very successful as China joined 15 corporations from 7 countries in forming 9 groups and signing 18 petroleum contracts and agreements. Bids were concluded for an area of 64,246 square kilometers at 18 locations, covering 90 percent of the total area for which bids were sought. The foreign corporations working at their own risk, drilled over 50 exploratory wells in the contracted areas, at investments of over US$300 million. The successful bidders were such major oil corporations as Texaco, Chevron, Esso, (AGIP), Shell, and Japan Oil. The main reason for the successful bidding for East China Sea oil is said to be the progress of reforms in China, the stable and rapid economic development, and the cooperative image and reputation of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, as well as the attractiveness of East China Sea oil resources for foreign corporations.
