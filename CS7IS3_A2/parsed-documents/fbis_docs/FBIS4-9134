In the declaration, there is a statement that care for the rehabilitated soldiers, retired soldiers, and widows of professional soldiers, plus assistance in building a modern army of our democratic and sovereign state, are the goals of this social organization. The number of soldiers and civilian employees of the Military Administration who were persecuted for political reasons between 25 February 1948 and 1989 is about 18,000. They are officers, warrant officers, and others. Some of them were even executed or emigrated from the country. After November 1989, some 11,000 applications for rehabilitation were submitted. The Central Rehabilitation Commission found 2,000 cases to be unfounded. A total of 9,000 people were rehabilitated. The VSR associates 3,826 members in 81 organizations. Josef Svab, commander of the Military Hospital in Olomouc, was elected new chairman of the association at a conference on Saturday. In his speech, he said that, in view of his profession and the age of the members of the association, he considers his main task to be solving the social and health problems of the rehabilitated soldiers. In the social sphere, the association wants to push for the completion of the rehabilitation of people persecuted for political reasons in the 1950's and 1970's. The association also wants to put legal responsibility on the officers who participated in the preparation of repressive actions of the communist regime, such as "Norbert", "Vlna", and "Zasah" [cover names for actions conducted by former State Security], and the suppression of the 1969 demonstration commemorating 21 August [anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion]. In cooperation with parliamentary deputies and the Defense and Security Committee, the association is interested in drafting new legal documents applicable to the Army, and a consistent implementation of democratic changes in the Army. Some participants in the meeting have shown dissatisfaction over the absence of Defense Minister Baudys, who did not excuse himself. Jiri Nekvasil, General Staff commander of the Czech Army, was also criticized, mainly because of the letter he had sent to the meeting and that was described as offensive by the participants. This applies mainly to the passage in his letter in which he said that he would not participate in the meeting because "our ideas about the activity of your civilian association with respect to the Army of the Czech Republic differ." Commander Nekvasil also said in the letter that "he cannot accept the idea that some members of the association are trying to establish a separate group of soldiers within the Army." However, he appreciated the activity of those who contribute, using their experience, to the fulfillment of the current tasks of the Czech Army. The participants in Saturday's meeting are writing a letter to Nekvasil in which they express surprise at the fact that no representative from the Defense Ministry or the General Staff took part in the conference, despite the fact that the association is interested in cooperating with both bodies. "A difference of opinion alone should not be a reason for a negative stance of the Army command toward our association and activity," the letter by people who were persecuted by the communist regime and rehabilitated after November 1989 states.
