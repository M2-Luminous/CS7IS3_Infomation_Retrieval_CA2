A Finance Ministry source said that US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is expected to repeat the call at his meeting with Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin on January 19. The topic will be on the agenda, which includes a double taxation avoidance treaty, the bilateral Treaty of Amity, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Last year, U.S. officials urged their Thai counterparts to introduce a law to prevent money laundering, following bilateral talks on how to curb the narcotics trade. At that time, Thailand informed the U.S. that it would consider the matter. The source, however, noted that the Thai government is unlikely to introduce such a law as it would burden local financial institutions. Another source noted that it might be difficult for the government to even pass the required bill in the current political situation. Moreover, Thailand currently has some laws related to money laundering practices. The first source added that the introduction of a new law might run counter to the country's plan to move towards financial liberalization since it would lead to restrictive regulations on the remittance of money. At any rate, the Finance Ministry has set up a working committee to study the pros and cons of such a law and whether it's timely for the country to introduce a bill. Recently, Finance Ministry officials also flew to Singapore to discuss procedures in that country's money-laundering act. Singapore is the only ASEAN country which has a money-laundering act because, being a free-port nation, the industrialized island sees a need for tight control of money remittances. The source said that Secretary Bentsen is likely to urge Thailand to introduce a bill by citing the healthy growth of the economy, Bangkok's current financial liberalization and its ambition to become a regional financial centre.
