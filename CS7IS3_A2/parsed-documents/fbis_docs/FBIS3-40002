The suspect lives in Germany, belongs to the extreme-right scene, and possibly assembled the fiendish envelopes while on a visit to Austria. The Wiesbaden Federal Office of Criminal Investigation searched the suspect's apartment in Germany with "interesting results." Further investigations are in progress, but the man has not been arrested. No further details were reported because of the news blackout. Commenting on Peter Binder and Franz Radl junior, who are imprisoned in Vienna, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said that there are 25 pieces of evidence in their case. Moreover, there are two witnesses who have incriminated the two neo-Nazis. According to Loeschnak, all in all, this incriminating material should be sufficient to bring charges in a few weeks -- charges "that will stand." Regarding the new "hot scent" leading to Germany, the police assume that this right-wing extremist might have made the letter bombs during a visit to Austria.
