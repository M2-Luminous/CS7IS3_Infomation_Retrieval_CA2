The declared war between the two state branches is placing the implementation of basic laws for the state's legal regulation at stake. The Executive Branch's declared war against Congress, which is reflected in the veto of laws of vital importance for the state's legal regulation, threatens to affect the country's political and economic panorama even more. The Executive Branch, rather than proposing, has vetoed seven laws, of which two refer to social issues (expropriation of land), one is socio-economic nature (the rescheduling of small farmers' debts to the CAH [Agricultural Development Fund]), one related to the prison system, the radio broadcasting law, and, last, three of a political nature, that is, the Military Organization Law, the law banning soldiers and police from political party affiliation, as well as the Council for Magistrates (that the Executive Branch still has not vetoed but has threatened to do so.) [figures as published] Due to its conflict with Congress, the Executive Branch seems to have exhausted its power to generate draft bills. In the economic field, for example, it has not submitted a single draft bill for the rationalization of its public expenditures.
