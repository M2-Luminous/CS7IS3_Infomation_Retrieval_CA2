Of 35 electoral coalitions 17 have met the requirement of collecting 35,000 signatures and are nominating their members to run for the city assembly. Our correspondent interviewed Aleksandr Filippov, one of the leaders of the All Petersburg electoral coalition. [Lebedeva] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, your bloc's desire to put together a team of professionals willing to take the responsibility for solving the city's key problems is admirable. A considerable share of these problems, however, is decided on a different level. One does not have to go far for examples. As a member of the higher learning community, are you prepared to assume responsibility for the government not fulfilling its obligations to people working in our institutes and universities? [Filippov] There is nothing to justify such a government's actions: Every person must keep his word. Especially persons vested with authority. The state has no right to remove itself from the spheres of life that ensure cultural, moral, intellectual, and physical dignity of the people. Therefore, I am bothered by Petersburg residents' current apathy toward elections to the city assembly. I was born in Leningrad; I love my city and will never agree that our lot, according to Pushkin, is "a yoke with rattles and a whip." How long can we count on rulers? My colleagues in the electoral coalition--finance professionals--have drafted a concrete program for increasing budget revenue and, accordingly, reorientation toward financing of socially significant spheres, including institutions of higher learning. The city as a federation component has been given sufficiently broad powers in matters of culture, education, and health care which we must use, including setting up an influential lobby in the government. I am not talking about pulling a blanket to our side; this is about conceptual things: Throughout the entire world culture, education, and social protection are under the patronage of the society. And it is at the very least irresponsible to leave workers in the nonproduction sphere to the mercy of fate and engage in demagoguery by proposing that they earn a living through commerce. [Lebedeva] You, however, not only chair a department in the Petersburg University, but also are a successful businessman, the head of the Business Link company well known in the city, which was the first in the city to undertake implementation of the idea of territorial agencies for city reconstruction... [Filippov] Three years ago when my university colleagues and I decided to start a consulting company, it was more an attempt at self-realization than a need to make money. Then came the idea of territorial development with the help of outside investors--a structure vested with sufficient powers, organized in order to carry out a concrete task needed by the city, with the right to make operational decisions. The idea was further developed and fine-tuned in the mayoralty's economic development committee. The city hopes that setting up a whole network of such agencies will help attract additional investment. We have already registered a territorial agency for the development of the northwestern part of Vasilyevskiy Island. The plan calls for construction of a large business center in undeveloped territories of Vasilyevskiy Island with the help of foreign investment. Part of the revenue from the center's operation will go toward meeting the needs of the city. Companies will be registered in the rayon, which means that taxes and rents (which will be high) also will produce revenue for the rayon. The Vasilyevskiy Island Development Fund is the agency's cofounder. The money going into the local budget from business center utilization (which will be considerable) will be used to build apartments for those on the waiting list; in the social sphere, elimination of communal apartment living, and reconstruction of old buildings. We are talking about very specific projects that have the support of Vasileostrovskiy Rayon administration. By the way, the head of the rayon administration, Valeriy Golubev, also is running on our coalition's slate. [Lebedeva] It looks like while all Petersburg is not yet part of your coalition, you have a good chance of bringing the entire Vasilyevskiy Island to your side. [Filippov] By selecting this name for our coalition--which an "Itogi" correspondent recently attributed to our ambition--we only wanted to emphasize that the list of candidates our coalition is going to put on the ballot is open to all city residents. I thought it especially important because right now, despite democratic window dressing, the population is virtually removed from the opportunity to influence what is happening in the city. Even those services that operated during stagnant times no longer function. It is rare for a resident's petition or complaint to get a reply. The letters department in a newspaper has become an anachronism. Any talk of social activism of the population, or development of self-rule is perceived almost as retrograde. Meanwhile, for instance, in Switzerland, which is comparable in population size to St. Petersburg, city residents only need to collect 5,000 signatures to put any problem to a vote in the form of legislative initiative--from regulating store hours on holidays to the need to adopt new legislation on the press. To bring the problem to the federal level requires 50,000 signatures. Our coalition has collected almost as many on All Petersburg signature lists. So perhaps residents of our city, too, should engage without delay in resolution of St. Petersburg's urgent problems.
