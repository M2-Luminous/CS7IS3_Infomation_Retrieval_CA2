FR940707-2-00191 FR940707-2-00099 IV. Discussion Under Section 19(b) of the Act, the Commission must approve a proposed NASD rule change if it finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that govern the NASD. 35 In evaluating a given proposal, the Commission must examine the record before it and all relevant factors and necessary information. 36 Section 15A of the Act addresses with some specificity requirements applicable to NASD rules, and those standards are particularly significant in the Commission's determination of whether the NASD's proposal is consistent with the Act. 37 35 15 U.S.C. 78s(b). 36 In the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Congress directed the Commission to use its authority under the Act, including its authority to approve SRO rule changes, to foster the establishment of a national market system and promote the goals of economically efficient securities transactions, fair competition, and best execution. Congress granted the Commission ``broad, discretionary powers'' and ``maximum flexibility'' to develop a national market system and to carry out these objectives. Furthermore, Congress gave the Commission ``the power to classify markets, firms, and securities in any manner it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and to facilitate the development of subsystems within the national market system.'' S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st. Sess., at 7 (1975). 37 See 15 U.S.C. ยง78 o &hyph;3. The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. 38 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. 39 Sections 15A(b)(9) and (11) require that the NASD's rule be designed not to impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act 40 and to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations. 41 In addition, the Commission believes that the rule change will further the goals of Section 11A in that it will promote efficient and effective market operations and economically efficient execution of investor orders in the best market and assure fair competition between the exchange markets and the OTC market and among brokers and dealers. 42 38 Id 78 o &hyph;3(b)(6), (9) and (11). 39 Id 78 o &hyph;3(b)(6). 40 Id 78 o &hyph;3(b)(9). 41 Id 78 o &hyph;3(b)(11). 42 Id 78k&hyph;1(a)(1)(C). A. Background of Short Sale Regulation The Commission believes that the disparate regulation of short selling in Nasdaq and exchange markets may no longer be warranted or justified by valid regulatory purposes. Short selling of exchange-listed securities has been the subject of Commission regulation since 1938. 43 On a number of occasions, the Commission has sought comment on and considered whether to extend short sale regulation similar to Rule 10a&hyph;1 to securities traded solely in the OTC market. In the process of designating certain OTC securities as National Market securities, the Commission discussed issues related to the eventual inclusion of qualified OTC securities in additional national market system facilities. 44 In response, the NASD stated that ``short selling regulations prior to and during a distribution of [National Market] Securities would be appropriate but that it is not necessary, at this time, to impose across-the-board short sales regulations on transactions in [National Market] Securities.'' 45 In 1985, the Commission again sought comment on whether short sales in Nasdaq National Market securities should be regulated, and if so, how such regulation should occur. 46 Commenters generally opposed the adoption of a tick-test for Nasdaq National Market securities. The Commission did not act on these requests for comments. 47 43 17 CFR 240.10a&hyph;1. Congress granted the Commission plenary power to regulate short sales in listed securities to ``purge the markets of the abuses connected with these practices.'' See Stock Exchange Practices, Report of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 55 (1934). See also H.R. Rep. No. 1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1934). Following a Commission inquiry into the effects of concentrated short selling in the 1937 market break, the Commission in 1938 adopted Rule 10a&hyph;1. This rule prohibited all short sales in securities listed on a national securities exchange below the last sale price, or at the last sale price if the last preceding trade at a different price was at a higher price, subject to certain exceptions. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 1548 (Jan. 24, 1938), 3 FR 213. In that release, the Commission also adopted Rule 3b&hyph;3. For a detailed discussion of the development of Rule 10a&hyph;1, see 7 Louis Loss & Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation 3198&hyph;3221 (1991). 44 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18590 (Mar. 24, 1982), 47 FR 13617 (Mar. 31, 1982). The primary effect of designating OTC securities as National Market securities is that transactions in these securities must be reported in a real-time system in accordance with the Commission's last sale reporting rule, and quotations for these securities must be firm as to the quoted price and size. 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1 and 17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;1. 45 Letter from William Broka, Secretary, NASD, to George A. Fitzsimmons, Secretary, SEC (July 31, 1981). 46 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22127 (June 21, 1985), 50 FR 26584 (June 27, 1985). 47 The Commission did, however, adopt Rule 10b&hyph;21 to address the concern expressed by the NASD and other commenters about the practice of short selling immediately prior to a public offering of securities with the covering purchases being made from the securities in the offering. 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;21. In particular, Rule 10b&hyph;21 prohibits a person who effects short sales of an equity security between the filing of a registration statement and the time at which sales of such equity security may be commenced, from covering those short sales with offered securities purchased from an underwriter or other broker or dealer participating in the offering. The Commission originally adopted Rule 10b&hyph;21 on a temporary basis (Rule 10b&hyph;21(T)). Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26028 (Aug. 25, 1988), 53 FR 33455 (Aug. 31, 1988). The Commission subsequently adopted the rule on a permanent basis. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33702 (Mar. 2, 1994) 59 FR 10984 (Mar. 9, 1994).
