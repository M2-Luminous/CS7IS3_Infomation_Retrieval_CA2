The council discussed the current political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia. The Council also heard a report by Mate Granic, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister, after his return from Turkey and Greece. Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it was viewed that relations between Serbs and Muslims and relations between Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the international community are deteriorating once again. The council examined President Tudjman's recent state visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina and came to the conclusion that the visit would further consolidate the positive orientation of the Washington agreement, and also encourage those forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina advocating a peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In connection with the cease-fire with local Serbs from UN protected areas the council reiterated the Croatian leadership's position that there can be no resumption of talks with the Serbs outside the Republic of Croatia.
