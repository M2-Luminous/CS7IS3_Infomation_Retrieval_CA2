It is Klim Voroshilov And brother Budennyy Who granted freedom-- The people love them! That is what they used to sing in the camps in the age of the great and terrible amnesty after Stalin's death. I do not know whether in Lefortovo, Sailors' Rest, or other not so distant places they will compose another song in honor of the amnesty of 23 February 1994, but if they do a whole song will not be enough to contain the names of those who are loved by the people. Eight factions and deputy groups of the State Duma found the strength within themselves to take an extraordinary step for the sake of social harmony--to declare, along with the criminal amnesty, political and economic amnesty as well, accompanying this act with the adoption of the Memorandum on Harmony. Let us list just their formal and informal leaders. They include Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin (Agrarian Party), Vladimir Medvedev (New Regional Policy), Alevtina Fedulova (Women of Russia), Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (Liberal Democratic Party), Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party), Gennadiy Zyuganov (Communist Party), Sergey Baburin and Yuriy Vlasov (Russian Way). Nor can one fail to mention along with them the chairmen of Duma committees on legislation and security--Vladimir Isakov and Viktor Ilyukhin, who did an immense amount of work to find a solution that was mutually acceptable to the majority of deputies, even if it was on the third go-around. By adopting it the Duma actually put forth its own political anticrisis platform and was days ahead of Yeltsin, who delivered a watered-down and content-deficient message "On Strengthening the Russian State." Therefore it is no wonder that from the president's circle one could immediately hear irritated comments and appeals not to implement the Duma's decision which, according to the text of the Constitution, which was written in that same circle, is its exclusive prerogative. The reason for the irritation is understandable. His circle never expected that with such a varied and contradictory composition parliament would manage to achieve such a complex and multistage compromise. Therefore it is worthwhile to consider in detail how this was done. The quantitative results of the voting in which the final decision was adopted ("for"--252, "against"--67, "abstentions"--28) far from fully reveals the picture of the struggle and even creates the illusion that the supporters of the decision had an overwhelming majority. But that is far from true. In the first place, to adopt any decision requires a minimum of 223 votes, and therefore not only a direct vote "against" but also an "abstention" and failure to participate in the voting and absence from the meeting actually mean to vote against it. In the second place, there were two votes, and the first was not successful. The fact is that it was decided to adopt four documents all at once as a single package: the Memorandum on Harmony, the decree on general criminal amnesty, the decree on political and economic amnesty, and the decree on abolition of the commission for investigating the events of 21 September-4 October. But first, at the suggestion of the factions of the Agrarian and Communist Parties, they voted on a "small package"--without the four decrees. The negative result ("for"--209, "against"--81, "abstentions"--16) immediately put the success of the "large package" in real jeopardy because for many it was exceedingly difficult to vote to abolish the commission, on whose creation immense effort had been expended. And not all were willing to accept this difficult compromise. The results of the two roll-call votes with a breakdown according to factions are presented in the table. It takes into account not only those who voted but also all deputies who were physically present at the session, and for greater clarity, abstentions and failure to vote are equated to a vote "against." From this it is very clear what kind of dramatic struggle took place in the hall and in the soul of each deputy and the elements from which the final decision was formed. The overall total of columns I and II gives the number of votes "for" and the total of columns III and IV is equal to the number of votes "against" in the first vote. And for the second vote the number of votes "for" is equal to the sum of columns II and III, and the number of votes "against" is equal to the sum of columns I and IV. Thus the block of 209 votes "for" in the first vote changed (in just a couple of minutes!) by the second vote not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. It lost 18 of its previous supporters but it acquired 61 new ones. If there had been half this number--everything would have been ruined. After studying independently how similar processes took place within the factions, the reader will be able to judge the essence of their positions and the degree of unity and discipline, and also the efforts it takes the Duma to make literally every one of its decisions. Spiteful critics call this horse trading, a business deal! We call it something else: compromise, without which, with the present alignment of forces, nothing can be done in the parliamentary arena. Did the opposition have to concede something important and valuable? It did. Was this easy to do? Absolutely not. But what was achieved was very important--political defendants and prisoners were freed from persecution: participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991, and 1 May and 21 September-4 October 1993. That is the first thing. The second thing is that, by adopting its Memorandum, suggesting the idea of forming a national accord government based on a parliamentary majority, the Duma firmly stated that it does not intend to remain in the back yard of political life, where it was assigned a place by the "creators" of the new Constitution. The country simply does not need a powerless parliament. To find a source of confrontation in these obvious steps toward civil peace would take a truly deranged imagination.
