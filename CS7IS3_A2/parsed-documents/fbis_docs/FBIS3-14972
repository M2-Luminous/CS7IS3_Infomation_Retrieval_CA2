The new structure -- a staff for coordination and cooperation -- will be more international. Whereas the majority of positions were taken earlier by officers of Russia, now 50 percent of the staff has been assigned to the republics. But the collective security will be financed in the same proportion. All in all, there will remain 240 people on the staff's payroll. Its work will be directed by the chairman of the Defense Ministers council. This position will be filled in turn by generals from all the republics. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov has been appointed the first chairman. The new staff will also have a permanent position, that of deputy chairman. He will be Colonel General Samsonov, chief of staff of the CIS Joint Armed Forces High Command. The deputy chairman was also granted the right to vote over Russia's objections.
