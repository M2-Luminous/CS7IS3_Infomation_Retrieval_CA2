Was this voting not very comfortable for the union? [Spychalska] It was very difficult because the budget is extremely stretched, does not secure the fundamental needs, and, on top of it all, is not the full implementation of the program of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. We understand that this is a four-year program, but the people, who are simply going through many hardships, do not really feel like waiting. [Bardzinska] Why, then, did the union's deputies support the budget? [Spychalska] No one can work miracles. We evaluated this budget and checked whether it was feasible and secure, whether it clarified the legal situation. We also analyzed how the budget distributed money for various purposes. The budget met all of these conditions. I must also say that the additional law that makes it possible to amend the budget is quite important. [Bardzinska] Does your support for the budget mean that you have become a progovernment union? [Spychalska] You are asking me whether we have placed a protective umbrella over the government? Well, we have not, among other reasons, because we publicly criticized all of the things we did not like about the budget. [Bardzinska] When this government was only beginning its work, you used to say that the OPZZ would not give it even an umbrella handle.... [Spychalska] The budget issue is not at all a matter of protecting the government, but a matter of stabilizing the state and setting things in order. As the situation gradually improves and the budget's revenues increase, we will make efforts to improve social protection mechanisms. [Bardzinska] The budget ballot was probably difficult for you personally as well, was it not? One of the deputy chairmen, who, according to some commentators, may be your rival, voted against... [Spychalska] It is of secondary importance. Deputy Chairman Wisniewski underscored very clearly the lack of money for expenditures in the area of social policy because he happens to be dealing with these issues. He stated in public that increasing the deficit is not as dangerous as causing a social outbreak by the lack of that money. He has good reason to say so. However, if we look at this issue realistically, increasing the deficit means greater inflation. The latter, in turn, hits the poorest the hardest. It was difficult to persuade him to change his mind; he remained faithful to his views until the end. As a result, by the decision of the club, he was expelled from the SLD. [passage omitted] [Bardzinska] How would you comment on the president's veto of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]? [Spychalska] The president's action is in line with our unionist action--when we voted against this law. [Bardzinska] What can you say about the talks between the OPZZ unionists and this government? Are they easier because the OPZZ deputies belong to the coalition? [Spychalska] They are difficult. Government representatives are telling us: Why, you do know the program, so you should understand the prospects for its implementation. We certainly know that. However, we want this stated clearly in negotiations. We want an implementation schedule to be prepared and certain social minimums to be guaranteed. Actually, I found it easier to discuss certain difficult issues, such as the problem of reclaiming, with the representatives of the Suchocka government--Minister Kuron and Minister Osiatynski. The issues of reclaiming have not been brought to an end yet because part of the statement by the Constitutional Tribunal was adopted by the Sejm, but it did not pass through the legislative path. Now, the committee that handles reclaiming issues is forwarding so many motions to us that they exceed the number of motions forwarded to us during the two years of governments not favorable to us. The unionists are indignant and asking: Why is it so difficult to reach agreement? Or, what do we gain by being in the coalition? Minister Miller told us that the committee is independent and is not in any way subordinated to him; he only ensures it administrative support. [Bardzinska] Does the OPZZ support the idea of returning union property? [Spychalska] Yes, it does. The controversial issue is only the problem of pricing. [Bardzinska] Your deputy said that he is not satisfied with this government. [Spychalska] I am not fully satisfied with it, either. [Bardzinska] What are the reasons for this dissatisfaction? [Spychalska] Talks with the government take too long. They are often too general, and there are not enough earlier agreements reached among the various ministries. Sometimes our government colleagues just cannot decide on a firm solution--in this or that way. However, it is high time they started doing it. [Bardzinska] What does the OPZZ gain by being in the coalition? [Spychalska] Not much, really. It is even a very troublesome situation for us, which we can feel rather strongly. [passage omitted] [Bardzinska] What is your evaluation of the recent protests of Solidarity ["S"]? [Spychalska] It is a pity that it all happened like this because the things that "S" demanded in its protest actions are the same issues we are discussing at the negotiation table with the government. Apart from that, any strike results in losses. People know perfectly well that there is keen competition on the market and that, when there is a stoppage in a company, the company's rival profits. Strike is a weapon that should be used as a last resort. If it is overused, it loses its strength; it simply ceases to be dangerous. [Bardzinska] Did OPZZ unions take part in those protests? [Spychalska] No, we did not approve of those activities. However, there was neither a recommendation to take part in the strikes nor a ban. Our organizations are legal entities and can decide their activities themselves. In referenda, work forces were asked the following questions: Do you want to earn more? Are you satisfied with your living standard? Are you, then, ready to protest? Well, who would answer "no" to such questions? Therefore, I could see that the results of the referenda were not related properly. [Bardzinska] Thank you for the interview.
