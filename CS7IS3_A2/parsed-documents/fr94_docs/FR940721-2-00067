FR940721-2-00067 FR940721-2-00036 Social Security Administration Privacy Act of 1974; Report of Revised System of Records AGENCY: Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACTION: Revision to a system of records. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (11)), we are issuing public notice of our intent to revise the name and description of a system of records entitled ``Master Files of Social Security Number Holders, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0058'' (last published at 58 FR 35025, June 30, 1993). DATES: The proposed changes will become effective as proposed, without further notice on August 30, 1994, unless we receive comments on or before that date which would warrant our preventing the changes from taking effect. ADDRESSES: Interested individuals may comment on this publication by writing to the SSA Privacy Officer, Social Security Administration, room 3&hyph;D&hyph;1 Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235. All comments received will be available for public inspection at that address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Stanley Hanna, Social Insurance Specialist, 3&hyph;D&hyph;1 Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, telephone (410) 966&hyph;7077. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Discussion of Proposed Revision We are changing the name of the system of records and the description of its purpose to clarify the fact that it includes applications for Social Security numbers (SSNs) submitted with suspicious or fraudulent evidence, as well as the records of individuals who have applied for and been assigned SSNs. The vast majority of SSN applications with complete evidence are soon approved and SSNs are assigned to the applicants in a few days. In some cases, however, an application may be held and a record maintained for up to 120 days while SSA determines whether the evidence of identity, age or citizenship/alien status is proper and authentic. SSA disallows applications which are supported by fraudulent documents, and maintains records of such applications. These records prevent individuals whose applications are supported by fraudulent or suspicious documents from obtaining SSNs by visiting other SSA offices which might unwittingly accept these documents. Besides changing the name of the system and showing that its purpose includes protecting against SSN applications supported by suspicious or fraudulent evidence, we have changed some of the other language: •To show that the system covers paper applications for SSNs as well as electronic records, and •To explain how a record is retrieved when it does not include an SSN. II. Effect of the Proposed Changes on Individual Rights The proposed changes will clarify the types of information which SSA maintains about persons who apply for SSNs. They will have no effect on individuals' rights. Dated: July 12, 1994. Shirley S. Chater, Commissioner of Social Security.
