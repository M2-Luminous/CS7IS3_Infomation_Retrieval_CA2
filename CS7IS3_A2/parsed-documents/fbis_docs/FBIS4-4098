The economic daily HANDELSBLATT reported Wednesday that the Grman firms HDW, Vulkan, Thyssen Nordseewerke, and Blohm Und Voss contacted US arms contractors last year about assembling submarine parts made in Germany and then shipping the finished submarines to Taiwan. The German Government said it never gave permission to the companies to enter into such a deal, and that it was adhering to a ban on sales of weaponry to countries it considers to be in "high tension" areas. Delivery of the submarines to Taiwan, the paper said, would secure for Germany another contract for high speed ice rains [as received] worth 30 million marks (US$17.6 billion). Taiwan's efforts to purchase submarines and other weaponry from Germany have been stalled as Bonn does not want to damage its ties with Beijing. Communist China has repeatedly insisted that no country should sell weapons to Taiwan because it is under Beijing sovereignty. In Taipei, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told the press on Tuesday that his government is reviewing the present list of high tension areas, but did not say whether the list would be amended to exclude Taiwan. Rexrodt, the second highest ranking official from Germany to visit Taiwan, is visiting Taiwan to lobby on behalf of German firms bidding for construction contracts related to the building of the proposed high speed railway.
