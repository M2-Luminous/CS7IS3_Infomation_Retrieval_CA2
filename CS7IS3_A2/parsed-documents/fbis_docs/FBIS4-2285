On the eve of Balladur's first official trip to China, and in an interview published here today by LE LIBERATION, Juppe said worsened Sino-French relations caused by France's sale of Mirage fighters to Taiwan should be past history. He stressed that France cannot continue discord with China, citing economic, political, strategic and population factors, and he suggested that there is no great difference between their two foreign policies. Replying to criticism that the four day visit will not bring a flood of new deals, Juppe said that there is no reason why France should not develop relations with a country as big as China but explained that, in his view, this was not a commercial trip. "It is to restore political relations." he said. "Reentering into China's markets requires much work and needs time."
