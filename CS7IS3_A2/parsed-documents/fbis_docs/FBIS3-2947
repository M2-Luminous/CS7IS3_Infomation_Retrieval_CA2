During a speech at the George Washington University, Perry said U.S. policy toward Moscow should be based on the principles of realism and pragmatism. Terming U.S.-Russian ties as a "pragmatic partnership," Perry said there is "a great variety of morbid symptoms" in Russia when the country is trying to dismantle the controls of the previous system. He listed the "morbid symptoms" as a deeply divided political system with profoundly disaffected elites; economic uncertainty and social dislocation. These facts, in the worst circumstances, would lead Russia to "emerge from her turbulence as an authoritarian, militaristic, imperialistic nation, hostile to the west." "In such a situation, we could indeed see a renewal of some new version of the old Cold War, Russia without the Warsaw pact but still with a formidable nuclear arsenal," Perry said. In light of the "stark realities," the defense chief said, Washington should try to influence events in Russia to a positive outcome while being prepared to deal with a negative outcome. He described some of the elements in U.S. defense planning that are not justified by current threats but needed as a "hedge against the possibility of a negative outcome" in Russia: -- While implementing the provisions of the First Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), the United States would hold off reductions stipulated under the second start treaty until "we see comparable reductions being made in Russia." -- The Pentagon would maintain a "minimum essential defense industrial infrastructure" so that it could have the capability to reconstruct "key elements." -- It would maintain a "minimal" production and research and development capability for nuclear weapons, while the Pentagon is reducing the nuclear stockpile. -- The Pentagon would continue building nuclear submarines even though current threat and replacement needs don't justify building new submarines until the year 2000. On Wednesday, Perry will start a week-long trip to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. While in Russia, he plans to meet with government as well as leaders of the parliament's military and foreign affairs committees.
