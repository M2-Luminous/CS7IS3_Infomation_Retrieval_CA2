Segni, who was accompanied by [Rocco] Buttiglione, held a meeting this morning with Northern League Deputy [Roberto] Maroni. The meeting was described as positive and one which helped to resolve many differences. Segni said the meeting, which lasted four hours, was successful. A short time ago, a joint document was released. The document says, among other things, the Italian Republic is united and indivisible. This declaration was demanded by Segni, and it puts an end to the many secessionist statements made by the Northern League. Now that the path has been smoothed over, the birth of a moderate alliance, which should also include [Silvio] Berlusconi and the Christian Democratic Center [Party], is set to go ahead. Observers are now waiting for a reaction from [Mino] Martinazzoli's Popular Party [new name of the Christian Democrat Party].
