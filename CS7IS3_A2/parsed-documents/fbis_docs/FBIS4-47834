Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said in a statement on Tuesday [3 May] night Lt-Gen Smit "has decided to retire from service on superannuation at the end of May 1994. It is indeed sad to lose such an experienced and dedicated general and I wish him and his family everything of the best." In the same statement, Gen van der Merwe pledged the SAP's [South African Police] "wholehearted" support for Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira who had apparently criticised police for a lack of cooperation in the investigation into alleged "third force" activities. "I wish to give the assurance that the South African Police will, as in the past, continue to give its wholehearted support to Dr D'Oliveira and his team and that everything possible will be done in order to prevent the investigation being hindered in any way," said Gen van der Merwe. He added: "I also wish to dispel any impression which may have been created that the South African Police is in conflict with the Goldstone Commission. The South African Police will, as in the past, continue to offer its complete cooperation to the Goldstone Commission." Gen van der Merwe also committed the SAP to the country's new dispensation. "...I wish to emphasize that the South African Police has committed itself to enter the new dispensation with confidence and enthusiasm, and will protect and serve the government and the community with dedication."
