Cavallo pointed out: "For example, this will help transform fruit and vegetable production in the Rio Negro valley, northern Santa Fe Province, entire sectors of northwest Argentina, and irrigated areas where it is necessary to produce goods more in keeping with what the world demands today." -- Cavallo noted: "We will encourage a mechanism linking the foreign trade chain selling the products with industrialization and production in Argentina. Therefore, when planting, harvesting, and industrialization is complete in Argentina, there will be an awareness that these products will actually be sold abroad, that a good price will be collected, and not that we have a product that we do not know to whom it will be sold and must then be raffled off." -- There will be measures in the automotive industry system "that do not represent any change, but will actually clarify what will happen if there is no compensation between exports and imports as established by the system for 31 December 1993." -- Certain "improvements in the system of capital goods and local production of capital goods" will be announced. The information on the current mechanisms for the manufacturing industry, agriculture, livestock, and fishing will be expanded so as "to facilitate the implementation of more appropriate technologies and better product design by small and medium-size companies in order to enhance quality controls." -- A number of deregulation measures that "will allow a 20- to 25-percent cost reduction in construction" will be announced along with a "drastic reduction in employers' contributions" that will probably reach the construction industry as of 1 April and "after the large provinces issue their laws indicating the dates for reducing gross incomes." Cavallo noted: "It especially represents a reduction in construction costs for low-cost housing that will benefit the entire industry." He hopes for "a strong expansion of construction activities that will contribute to reducing unemployment and maintaining a dynamic economic growth rate within the next few years."
