SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said, "the party should distance itself from both the ruling coalition and the LDP." Murayama told a party meeting, "we cannot allow this issue to undermine the unity of our party." Murayama referred to an objection from the largest SDPJ intraparty group, the democrats, to an LDP-sponsored motion to dismiss the chairman of the House of Representatives steering committee who is a senior member of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Following the SDPJ's decision, the lower house will shelve the motion aimed at relieving Keiwa Okuda from duties as chairman of the steering committee, a key body which sets schedules for Diet business. The LDP, which is poised to table a no-confidence motion against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, submitted the motion against Okuda last week. As the largest single party in parliament and also as the No. 1 opposition party, the LDP submitted the anti-Okuda motion in a bid to reestablish its leading role in setting the course of parliamentary business. The democrats, an SDPJ intraparty bloc of 23 members in the lower house, decided Sunday not to support the anti-Okuda motion. Meanwhile, the SDPJ's Diet Affairs Committee Chairman, Koken Nosaka, asked the LDP on Tuesday to allow the Diet to defer a ballot on the motion despite the earlier SDPJ-LDP accord to take concerted action on the motion, SDPJ officials said. Nosaka also contacted Shinseito, asking for its consent to replace Okuda shortly after the parliamentary passage of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget, which is expected to be passed in late June, they said. Shinseito rejected the request, saying it will not comply with the plea at least until the current regular Diet session adjourns. The session is to expire June 29, but its term could be extended.
