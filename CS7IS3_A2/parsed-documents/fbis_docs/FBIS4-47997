ANC Southern Natal spokesman Dumisani Makhaye claimed the elections in the province had been fraudulent and the results would rest on the consciences of Independent Electoral Commission leaders. "All the evidence is of massive rigging in terms of millions...Even the IFP knows it didn't win Natal," he said, adding that "the overwhelming majority of people in Natal will not accept the results". Mr Makhaye said it was now up to the ANC leadership to consult its followers for a mandate on a course of action and strategy to deal with the defeat. Mr Makhaye's sentiments were echoed by Northern Natal ANC Chairman Bheki Ntuli who said "it's distressing that they've won after such great intimidation of our members". Mr Ntuli said the ANC was "a mature political organisation" and its reaction to the IFP's success was not "sour grapes". The IFP won KwaZulu/Natal with 50.3 per cent of the votes compared to the ANC's 32.2 per cent. A total of 3.7 million people voted in the province.
