Supporters of various parties were surveyed in October 1993 by IMU on their attitudes toward the other parties; Lars Ryding reported the results in the 7 February SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 11. Respondents were asked whether they would consider voting for a party, the alternatives being: would definitely vote for the party, would consider it, probably would not, or absolutely would not. Of the 21 percent who said they would consider voting for New Democracy, 57 percent also had positive attitudes toward the Moderates and 53 percent toward the Social Democrats. The other parties made out less well, although the nonsocialist parties would get the majority of voters. A total of 40 percent would consider voting for the Center Party, 31 percent for the Green Party, 29 percent for the Liberals, 20 percent for the Christian Democrats, and 17 percent for the Left Party.
