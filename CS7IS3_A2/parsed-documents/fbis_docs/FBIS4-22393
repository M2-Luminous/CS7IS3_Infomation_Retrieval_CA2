This can be attested to by delegations from the International Red Cross organization "Physicians Without Borders," legal defenders, and jurists who had free access to all the places where the prisoners of war and hostages were kept. They can also confirm that all the Azeris who were released were in normal psychological and physical condition. Letters from their relatives were even delivered to them. Incidentally, as A. Agasaryan noted, previously the NKR commission had suggested to its Azeri colleagues that it send the aforementioned commission to Karabakh to find out the real state of affairs. The Azerbaijan side currently has about 1,000 Armenian prisoners of war and hostages who are mainly citizens of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other CIS countries who were captured in the conflict zone. Many of them are being kept in nonstate institutions or are in the hands of private individuals, which extremely complicates the process of exchange. At the same time, representatives of international organizations accredited by the NKR are certainly not always given an opportunity to visit Armenian prisoners of war and hostages. But, A. Agasaryan noted, in spite of all kinds of difficulties caused by the corresponding structures of the neighboring republic, the NKR government has repeatedly shown good will and adherence to the principles of coordination and compromise in solving problems of this area. This is also shown by the unilateral transfer of 69 prisoners of war and hostages to the Azerbaijan side.
