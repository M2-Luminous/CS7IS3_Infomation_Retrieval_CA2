His itinerary includes a meeting with Hans Blix, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in Tokyo where they will discuss the agency's assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability after the latest inspection and future measures to ensure safeguards. After his stopover in Japan, the foreign minister will visit Moscow April 13-15 to meet his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev and other government leaders. He will explain the results of President Kim's trips to Japan and China last month, consult on the Korean nuclear crisis and set down details for Kim's Moscow visit, expected to come in June. Han then heads to London where he will stay until April 16. He plans to meet his British counterpart Douglas Hurd and attend the South Korea-Britain Forum, delivering a speech on bilateral relations. He will stop off in Brussels April 16-17 for a conference of South Korean mission chiefs stationed in Europe before returning April 18. The trip will obviously highlight coordination on the nuclear problem that entered a new phase last month with the UN Security Council's presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow additional outside inspections. Moscow has recently tried to play a more visible role in the matter, proposing an eight-party conference to solve the problem among regional powers, the United Nations and the IAEA.
