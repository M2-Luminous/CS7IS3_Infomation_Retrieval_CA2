The agency cites a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement issued on Friday. Justifying this step, the Ukrainian ministry has accused the Russian media of disseminating confidential information on the transportation of the warheads from the Ukrainian territory into Russia. This is seen by the Ukrainian military as a threat to the safety of the nuclear materials due to be transported. It was earlier reported that the first nuclear trainload arrived in Russia last Sunday.
