The discovery of new monoclonal antibodies allowing the identification of various antigens of normal and tumorous tissue has expanded the capabilities of morphological research. Peroxidase immunoassay has enabled the evaluation of local immunity and the morphological study of the role of various populations of lymphocytes in the immune response, as well as the identification of micrometastases in regional lymph nodes. Despite that, the technique is little used in Russia, because of the inadequate amount and inadequate variety of high-quality reagents and the small number of studies of the procedures associated with the technique. The researchers here developed a variation of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method that enables immunomorphological studies on cryostate sections of tissue of benign and malignant tumors of the mammary gland, as well as of regional lymphatic nodes removed in radical mastectomy. The work involved the monoclonal antibodies IKO-1, IKO-12, IKO-31, IKO-86, and IKO-90. Among the round-cell infiltrates both of benign and malignant tumors, the most pronounced expression was noted for the CD3 antigen, which is typical of T lymphocytes and was identified with IKO-90. CD3-positive cells were found to predominate. CD22- positive cells among the infiltrates was approximately equal to or a little more numerous than those with benign tumors, with a ratio of 1:2 in relation to CD3-positive cells. In regional lymphatic nodes without metastatic damage, IKO-90[.sup]+[/] cells were noted most often in the paracortical area as focal clusters. IKO- 12[.sup]+[/] cells were identified, as a rule, in lymphoid follicles as focal clusters. Usually, the center of the follicle was represented as B-cells, with lymphocytes on the periphery expressing CD4 and CD8 antigens. IKO-31[.sup]+[/] and - 86[.sup]+[/] cells were noted most often as clusters in the interfollicular regions. Lymphocytes labelled with the monoclonal antibodies of IKO-1 were found in the follicles, pulpy cords, and interfollicular regions. Figures 3, references 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.
