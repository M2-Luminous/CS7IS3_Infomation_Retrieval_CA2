With this as momentum, the widespread rumor about North Korea's difficulties in food supply has turned out to be true, thereby arousing the general public's great interest. Because we also had much difficulty at one time in the seventies and in the early eighties, we all know well that North Korea's food shortage is not of the nature that we can just gloat over. This is because that issue is, rather than the one that should be seen from a political or military viewpoint, a prerequisite to the maintenance and development of human survival and is a task that should be solved together with a compatriotic love. This notwithstanding, the statistics about food are still a secret to the outside in North Korea. We are at a loss on how to help because the truth cannot be known, and the reality is that we cannot do anything because we might touch a sensitive matter of taboo. The Food Situation in North Korea Veiled in Mystery The only official statistics about North Korea's food situation is the record of production of food crops which North Korea is reporting on a regular basis to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] every year. It is internationally acknowledged that the reliability of this report is that it is only for reference. To sum up the data reported to FAO, as seen in table one, North Korea recorded grain production in 1992 at a level similar to that of 1991. In terms of roughly refined grain, the production break-down follows: 5.8 million tonnes of rice (4.18 million tonnes in terms of finely refined rice--about 29 million sok [one sok equals about 5.12 U.S. bushels]); 200,000 tonnes of wheat; 4.5 million tonnes of corn; 460,000 tonnes of beans; and 200,000 tonnes of barley and others grains. The volume of all these total as much as 11 million tonnes in terms of roughly refined grain production. This is an enormous volume amounting to about eight million tonnes in terms of finely refined grains. Even without the volume of 2.5 million tonnes of potatoes, including sweet potatoes, this means that North Korea has already been in a chronic glut of food crops. But, the grain production volume of North Korea is too high when compared with 1992's grain production of no more than 5.97 million tonnes in South Korea which has many more rice paddy fields than the North--though the size of the total arable land of South and North Korea is roughly the same. In other words, this means that North Korea's per capita grain consumption is as much as 365 kg -- 65 kg more than the maximum average volume an adult can consume annually. Even considering its stockpiles for an emergency, North Korea, with a population of 23 million people ought to have exported annually about 1.5 million tonnes of grains over the past two or three years. In terms of finely refined grains, aside from rice, this means that every person of North Korea's whole population consumed about 182 kg of rice in 1992 thanks to that year's production of as much as 4.176 million tonnes (29 million sok), a 13.7 percent increase over 1983 when the production was no more than 3.672 million tonnes (25.5 million sok). This amount is as much as 70 kg more than South Korea's per capita consumption of about 182 kg the same year. Considering that North Korea is producing annually as much as 4.5 million tonnes (as reported to FAO) of corn, its second most important food staple next to rice, this is construed as meaning that rice, its primary food staple, is in rampant excess everywhere in North Korea. Therefore, the details of North Korea's food statistics which are veiled in mystery are incoherent. The FAO is quite at a loss as to this data under the circumstances in which it has to compile and make public such statistics about grain production. Even if the organization dispatches an investigator to North Korea, then, it would also face the difficulty of making a confirmation. Thus, it is just printing out annual reports as received. Under these circumstances, we can never expect anyone, if he is not an expert, to make a comparative analysis as seen above. On the contrary, most of amateurish North Korea researchers are faced with a dilemma in this regard. They cannot but trust FAO statistics, and cannot, either, flatly negate news reports about North Korea's food shortage. By the way, an event, which can be said to be "revolutionary," took place inside FAO this year. FAO has made public statistics about 1993's food production--though tentative--, about which official reports have not been compiled yet, on the basis of an estimate which is calculated to be 22.4 percent lower than 1992. FAO made public data of rice production by lowering the volume by 33 percent. Statistics compiled by ROK research institutes are also different from one another, and have only added to the confusion because they differ from data compiled by U.S. CIA's satellites. In order to avoid such confusion, the National Unification Board [NUB] has recently had the Office of Rural Development experiment in doing farming as patterned after the reality in North Korea, thereby making public data for a general study, which are relatively close to the reality. Therefore, according to the "present status of North Korea's economic situation" compiled and released by the NUB on 21 August, 1993, with the help of a relevant agency, North Korea's gross grain production, in terms of finely refined grains, was 4.81 million tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27 million tonnes in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993, showing a large gradual decrease. Outwardly, these figures show a remarkable difference in annual production by about as much as 3.5 million tonnes from North Korea's report to FAO. According to the estimated statistical figures released by the NUB, in 1991-1992 alone North Korea was short of at least 1.3 million-2.3 million tonnes of provisions. Meanwhile, according to the recent data released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund (CHOSON ILBO dated 29 April 1994), North Korea imported 649,000 tonnes of grains from China and 177,000 tonnes from Turkey during 1992. In addition to this, North Korea also seems to have imported 250,000 tonnes of grains secretly from the United States during the same year. In other words, this means that North Korea imported a total of slightly over one million tonnes during 1992. However, the estimated amount of North Korea's harvest in 1993 showed a shortfall of 400,000 tonnes over 1992. As a result of this, it is apparent that North Korea's food situation in 1993-1994 has become more serious. In view of such a situation we cannot sternly say that some North Korean defectors' remarks revealing that even some stockpiled rice for military use was released and supplied to civilians as an emergency step and that it has become impossible even to take such a step now are totally groundless. Now North Korea also suffers from a shortage in foreign currency and so, it cannot afford to purchase for cash grain from foreign countries. It has relied only on its import of grant-type grains from China. With the recent increase in the number of North Koreans who are escaping from North Korea via China and Russia it has become no longer possible for North Korea to conceal its food shortage. Furthermore, in recent years North Korea has begun to almost openly purchase grains from foreign countries in an effort to maintain stability in its political system in the wake of the power transfer to the Kim Chong-il system. Until 1990 North Korea had carried out trade on a barter system with China by giving rice to China and taking corn of greater quantities of its rice from it. However, afterward North Korea began purchasing in earnest rice and corn from Thailand, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Turkey. However, as mentioned above, North Korea has relied on imports of grains mainly from China since 1992. North Korea's failure in agriculture is caused by its political system In 1991 and 1992 the North Korean authorities reported to the FAO that they had achieved a bumper crop in these years. However, the food situation in these years and in 1993 was so bad that food was not distributed to residents on time and that collective resistance took place in some regions as a result. In sum, it is evident that North Korea's food situation has become more serious particularly in recent years, and the people's complaints are mounting. Riced corn, which is made of corn flour, has appeared as a rice substitute, and corn noodle appeared as a wheat noodle substitute. Even noodle mixed with powdered herb roots and tree bark has appeared in North Korea today. Chinese and Korean residents in China should bring their own food and foodstuffs with them when visiting North Korea. People carrying flour bags on their heads or backs are a common sight at border check points. The main cause for the worsening agricultural and food situation of North Korae lies in the natural, physical, and technological restrictions in North Korea. As Karl Marx said, "the productivity of agricultural labor is closely linked to natural conditions." In view of this, North Korea is definitely unfavorable than South Korea in terms of natural and physical farm conditions. However, we cannot say that North Korea is unfavorable compared to the three provinces of Northeast China which are located north of North Korea. Therefore, the natural and physical factors cannot become the main cause of North Korea's agricultural failure. Denmark's agriculture which has developed by cultivating a desert, Israel's agriculture which has been built on swamps and barren land, Switzerland's agriculture on mountain-side terraced fields, and Netherlands' agriculture on the sea have created a miracle and evoked the world people's admiration despite their unfavorable conditions. The main cause of the low productivity of North Korea's agriculture should be found in the shortcoming of its agricultural management system. In other words, the problem of North Korea's agriculture lies in its centralized planned economy which cannot properly adapt itself to the rapidly changing natural, environmental conditions and in its uniform, collectivist economic system. It is difficult to expect a substantial technological revolution in agriculture through North Korea's present system of ownership by all of the people and its collectivist cooperative system of agriculture --which have ended in failure in former socialist countries--and through the repeated emphasis of the so-called chuche farming method. In particular, it is also difficult to whip up the production will of farmers by repeatedly stressing the ideological revolution and the cultural revolution among them without giving incentives to their production efforts as we see in the capitalist economy. Agricultural exchange between the North and the South is urgently needed North Korea has relatively favorable circumstances and conditions in solving the basic problem of its "continuous poverty." In the early seventies, North Korea's potential strength surpassed that of the South Korean economy. In other words, North Korea's foundation for material growth and human capability, that is, its labor force, cannot be underestimated even today. North Korean agriculture's scientific and technological level of is not inferior to that of any developing countries. North Korea's plant breeding and farm cultivation technology, too, have reached a considerable level. The foundation for mechanization of the production system of chemical fertilizer, as well, are fairly good. The problem is, however, that a key mechanism which can combine these factors into one and vitalize them, is necessary. In other words, this means that an incentive sysrem based on the market economics should be introduced. In light of the fact that the rate of self-sufficiency in food supply in South Korea remains at the 30 percent level and that agriculture is the most vulnerable field of the South Korean economy, it is necessary for the North and the South to seek mutual cooperation in agriculture, including the exchange of agricultural technology and capital. The most serious problem in South Korea's agriculture is that it is losing international competitiveness in the prices of agricultural products due to the high prices of agricultural labor forces and the increase in land prices. In other words, the only problem that South Korea is faced with today despite the fact that it has capital, technology, plants, and high-standard agricultural labor forces, is the lack of international competitiveness in the prices of agricultural products. Such being the situation, strengthening cooperation in agriculture with North Korea which has basic material and human foundations for agricultural development can, I believe, open a new horizen in South Korea's agriculture.
