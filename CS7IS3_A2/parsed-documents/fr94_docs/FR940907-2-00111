Miller, Senior Special Counsel, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant, an open-end diversified management investment company, is organized as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On January 7, 1987, applicant filed a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A under section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under section 8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on June 24, 1987, and the public offering of applicant's shares commenced on June 29, 1987. 2. On March 22, 1993, applicant's board of trustees adopted an agreement and plan of reorganization and liquidation (the ``Plan''). The Plan provided for the transfer of all of applicant's assets to IDEX II Flexible Income Portfolio (the ``Portfolio''), a separate series of IDEX II Series Fund, a Massachusetts business trust, in exchange for the assumption by the Portfolio of all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and duties of applicant, and shares of the Portfolio equal in number to the shares of applicant outstanding as of the close of business on September 30, 1993. 3. Applicant and the Portfolio are affiliated persons because they have common officers; they therefore relied on the exemption provided by rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act to effect the transaction. 1 Consequently, the trustees determined, in accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8, that the purchase of applicant's assets by the Portfolio was in applicant's best interests, and that such purchase would not result in any dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders. 1 Rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption from the affiliated transaction prohibition of section 17(a) of the Act for a merger of investment companies that may be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 4. Applicant filed preliminary proxy materials with the SEC on or about May 28, 1993, and filed definitive proxy materials with the SEC on or about June 24, 1993. On or about June 25, 1993, a notice of the special meeting, proxy statement, and form of proxy relating to the Plan were distributed to applicant's shareholders. The Plan was approved by vote of applicant's shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders held on July 28, 1993. 5. As indicated in the proxy materials, the purpose of the reorganization of applicant into the Portfolio was to reduce the number of separately organized investment companies in the IDEX group, to enable the combination of prospectuses, statements of additional information, and shareholder reports, and to provide other operational efficiencies for certain IDEX funds, including applicant and its successor. The reorganization also implemented various changes to applicant's investment policies and restrictions in order to standardize these matters for the funds in the IDEX group. 6. As of October 1, 1993, there were 3,048,111.95 shares of beneficial interest of applicant outstanding, with an aggregate net asset value of $29,232,430 and a per share net asset value of $9.59. On that date, applicant transferred to the Portfolio all right, title, and interest in and to its assets, including all securities, cash, cash equivalents, receivables, and other assets. In exchange, the Portfolio assumed all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of applicant, and issued and delivered to applicant full and fractional shares of Portfolio equal in number to the shares of applicant outstanding as of the close of business on September 30, 1993. Applicant then liquidated and distributed pro rata (resulting in a one-for-one distribution) to its shareholders of record the shares of the Portfolio received in exchange for shareholders' shares of applicant. 7. The expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization consisted primarily of legal expenses, expenses of printing and mailing communications to shareholders, registration fees, and miscellaneous accounting and administrative expenses totalling $35,492.71. In accordance with the Plan, the Portfolio was responsible for the expenses of both parties in connection with the reorganization. 8. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities, nor was it a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 9. Applicant intends to file a notification of dissolution with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
