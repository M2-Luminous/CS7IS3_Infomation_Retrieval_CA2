ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Department of Energy (DOE or Department) to support a voluntary national testing and information program for those types of luminaires that are widely used and show potential for significant energy savings. Not later than October 24, 1995, DOE must determine whether the voluntary program thus created by an appropriate organization of interested parties is consistent with the objectives set forth in the legislation. In order to clarify the objectives of the legislation, and thereby assist the development of the voluntary program by the appropriate organization, the Department has developed a set of evaluation criteria that will be used as the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the luminaire testing and information program. The Department will hold a public meeting on Thursday, January 5, 1995, to discuss the proposed criteria with parties interested in the development of the voluntary program. All persons are hereby given notice of the opportunity to submit written comments and to attend the public meeting. DATES: Written comments in quadruplicate must be received by January 27, 1995. The public meeting will be held on Thursday, January 5, 1995.
