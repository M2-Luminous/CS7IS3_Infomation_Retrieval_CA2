FBIS3-46844 "dreas004__a94023" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan MOF Expands Firms' Access to Customs Data OW0301141794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0301141794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Finance Ministry [MOF], which operates the national automatic customs clearance system [NACCS] which processes customs clearance with the help of computers, has decided to make available the NACCS' information to exporters and importers. With the NACCS being made open to exporters and importers, trading firms including exporters and importers will be able to obtain information on their import-export dealings and simplify procedures for paying tariffs. The Finance Ministry has decided to make the NACCS accessible to exporters and importers in response to requests from the business community, including the Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]. Once the question of meeting the cost of changing the system which the business community has requested is settled, the NACCS will be opened in early 1995. The NACCS, which is designed primarily to speedily process customs clearance on exported and imported cargo, was first used with air cargo in 1978 and then with sea cargo in 1991. The NACCS processes all information about the origin and destination of cargo, the permits for customs clearance, and the payment of tariffs. Currently only customs houses, customs clearance companies, and banks have access to the NACCS. Major trading firms are using the "comprehensive deferred payment procedure" which allows them to make a monthly payment of tariffs, but they can obtain information on the amount of tariffs only through customs clearance companies. This has complicated the procedure for calculating tariff payments. Information provided by the NACCS is said to be of great use to trading firms for managing their overall export and import dealings. For this reason, the business community has asked the Finance Ministry to expand access to the NACCS through the Keidanren. In response, the government decided to provide exporters and importers with part of the NACCS-held information on the payment of tariffs in a deregulation package it announced in September. The latest decision by the Finance Ministry will make it possible for exporters and importers to gain access to all of the NACCS information about them through their on-line terminals or other means. In the future, the government and the private sector will jointly promote responses to the requests of information users and ways to meet those requests. Attention will focus on to what degree private enterprises can bear the cost of altering the NACCS.
