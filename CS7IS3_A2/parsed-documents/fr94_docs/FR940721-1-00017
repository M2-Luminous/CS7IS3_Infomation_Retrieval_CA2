FR940721-1-00017 FR940721-1-00009 9. The MOBILE model was correctly used to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes. 10. Non-road mobile emissions were prepared according to current USEPA guidance for all of the source categories. The base year emission inventory will be approved if it passes Levels I, II, and III of the review process. The USEPA reviewed the State submittal using the Level I, II and III criteria noted above. These findings are discussed further in the Emission Inventory TSD. III. Proposed Action The USEPA is proposing to fully approve the ozone emission inventory SIP submitted to USEPA for the Detroit/Ann Arbor area as meeting the section 182(a)(1) requirements of the Act for emission inventories. The State has submitted a complete inventory containing point, area, biogenic, on-road, and non-road mobile source data, and accompanying documentation. Emissions from these groupings of sources are presented in the following tables: Daily VOC Emissions From All Sources_Tons/Summer Weekday 1Ozone nonattainment area 1Point source emissions 1Area source emissions 1On-road mobile source emissions 1Non-road mobile source emissions 1Biogenic emissions 1Total emissions Detroit/Ann Arbor 167.08 252.27 327.00 531.03 113.90 1391.28 Daily CO Emissions From All Sources_Tons/Summer Weekday 1Ozone nonattainment area 1Point source emissions 1Area source emissions 1On-road mobile source emissions 1Non-road mobile source emissions 1Total emissions Detroit/Ann Arbor 146.28 45.22 3058.00 862.54 4112.04 Daily NO X Emissions From All Sources_Tons/Summer Weekday 1Ozone nonattainment area 1Point source emissions 1Area source emissions 1On-road mobile source emissions 1Non-road mobile source emissions 1Total emissions Detroit/Ann Arbor 734.62 56.36 437.00 108.22 1336.20 Detailed information on how each of the above source category groupings was determined is included in the Emission Inventory TSD. B. Inspection and Maintenance A detailed analysis of the Michigan I/M SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 1, 1994 from Brad Beeson to the Docket, entitled ``Technical Review of the Michigan SIP Submittal to Revise the I/M Program in Southeast Michigan'' (I/M TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above. I. Background and Review Criteria The Act requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(i) requires States to submit SIP revisions for any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as marginal, pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act, with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP prior to enactment of the Act, or any area that was required by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act) to have an I/M program, to bring the program up to the level required in pre-1990 USEPA guidance, or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more stringent. Areas classified as moderate and worse ozone nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve programs to this level. On November 15, 1993 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted to the USEPA a revision to the Michigan SIP which was intended to address the requirements for an I/M program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The revision included legislation which was signed into law by Governor Engler on November 13, 1993. 2 2 In addition to legislation revising the I/M program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area, the State also submitted adopted legislation establishing an I/M program on the west side of the State. For reasons of clarity, however, that program will be the subject of a future Federal Register notice. Today's rulemaking only addresses the State's submittal related to the program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. At the same time as this legislation was being developed, the MDNR was also in the process of developing a redesignation request from nonattainment to attainment for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act states that an area can be redesignated to attainment if certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the USEPA has fully approved the applicable implementation plan under section 110(k) and that the State has met all applicable requirements of section 110 and part D. The USEPA's current approvability criteria for I/M in part require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the proposed SIP revision. In addition, all SIPs submitted must be subject to public hearing before they can be approved.
