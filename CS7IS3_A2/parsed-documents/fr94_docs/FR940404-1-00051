FR940404-1-00051 FR940404-1-00021 Section 5(c) of the Halibut Act provides for the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson Act to develop regulations, including limited access regulations, governing the U.S. portion of Convention waters and applicable to nationals or vessels of the United States, which are in addition to, and not in conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC. Since 1987 NMFS has interpreted this provision to mean that regulations having domestic allocation of the Pacific halibut resource as a primary purpose would be developed by the Council with respect to Alaska and by the Pacific Fishery Management Council with respect to Washington, Oregon, and California. Regulations having biological conservation as a primary purpose are developed by the IPHC. This policy does not necessarily prevent either Regional Council from developing biological conservation regulations that are in addition to and not in conflict with IPHC regulations. Neither does the policy necessarily prevent the IPHC from developing regulations that have secondary domestic allocation effects. Area 4B Allocation To determine the need for domestic allocation of Pacific halibut, the Council solicited regulatory proposals from the public in July 1993. The Council received two such proposals that were reviewed and evaluated by the Council's Halibut Regulatory Amendment Advisory Group (RAAG). At its meeting of September 21&hyph;26, 1993, the Council reviewed recommendations of the RAAG and decided to take action on one proposal concerning the Area 4B fishery. The other proposal, which is undergoing further study, concerned allocations to the halibut charter boat fishery. The Area 4B allocation proposal is designed to ameliorate the effects caused by the differing harvest abilities of vessel operators who catch and land all their halibut harvest in Area 4B, principally at the Aleutian Islands community of Atka (single-area vessels), and who catch and land halibut in other areas as well as Area 4B (multiple-area vessels). Most single-area vessels are small relative to most multiple-area vessels. This size differential means that multiple-area vessel operators have an advantage in fishing power (i.e., a larger vessel has more space for fish, fuel, and crew) and in fishing time (i.e., a larger vessel can fish in weather conditions that would prevent smaller vessels from fishing). The Atka Fishermen's Association (AFA), which submitted the Area 4B proposal and represents the interests of the single-area vessel operators, believes that the single-area vessel operators are competitively disadvantaged relative to multiple-area vessel operators. To eliminate this competitive disadvantage, AFA proposed reserving 20 percent of the Area 4B catch limit for a series of 12-hour fishing periods to be fished prior to the general open fishing period for Area 4B in August. AFA also proposed a 5,000 pound trip limit during the early season 12-hour openings. Any amount of the 20 percent reserve that is not harvested during the early season openings would be made available in the later season openings. In making its proposal, AFA assumed continuation of the existing clearance requirement for multiple-area vessel operators fishing in Area 4. Generally, this requirement at ยง301.14 provides for vessel clearance prior to fishing during any fishing period in any part of Area 4 and before unloading any halibut caught in this area. Single-area vessel operators fishing in Area 4B are not required to obtain clearance. The proposed combination of the 5,000-pound trip limit, the 12-hour fishing period, and the vessel clearance requirement was intended to provide a competitive advantage to single-area vessel operators by discouraging multiple-area vessel operators from participating during the early season fishing periods. The IPHC has some experience in using short fishing periods to control halibut harvests. Since 1989, the IPHC has managed the Area 4B fishery with early season 12-hour fishing periods and later season periods of 2 to 4 days duration. However, AFA did not believe that these measures provided the harvest allocation priority it needed to compete adequately with multiple-area vessels operated in Area 4B. For example, during the 3-year period 1991, 1992, and 1993, an average of 11 single-area vessels were operated during the early season fishing periods (i.e., prior to the August and later fishing periods) along with an average of 26 multiple-area vessels. Fishermen operating single-area vessels harvested about 44,300 pounds per year on average during the early seasons of 1991&hyph;1993, while the comparable average harvest of fishermen operating multiple-area vessels was about 394,300 pounds per year. This resulted in fishermen operating single-area vessels taking about 15.2 percent of the total early season harvest on average and fishermen operating multiple-area vessels taking about 84.8 percent on average. However, the early season harvest taken by fishermen operating single-area vessels amounted to only 2.3 percent per year on average of the total catch for the entire season in Area 4B.
