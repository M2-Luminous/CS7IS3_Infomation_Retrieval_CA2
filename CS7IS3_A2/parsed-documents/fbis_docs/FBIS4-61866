This is one of the key provisions of a draft law on the Constitutional Court which was adopted in the first reading by the State Duma on Wednesday. The decision on the 12-year term in office was adopted following long debates. The accord was finally reached today as lawmakers voted for the resolution. Another problem which caused unequivocal reaction from lawmakers was a provision suggesting that the president may offer candidatures to the post of judges of the Constitutional Court. Accord on this problem has been finally reached as well. The draft bill on the Constitutional Court adopted in the first reading today is based on provisions of the existing Russian Constitution which were developed and made more concrete. The Constitutional Court is the organ of state control, independently exercising judicial power by means of Constitutional Court proceedings. The main principles of the Constitutional Court are independence, collective approach, glasnost, competitiveness and equality of the parties concerned. The Constitutional Court consists of 19 judges appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation by the president. The State Duma has instructed the Committee for Legislation and Judicial Reform to finalize the draft until June 1, 1994 and submit it to the Duma for final approval.
