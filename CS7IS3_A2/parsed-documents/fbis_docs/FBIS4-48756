Speaking during debate on the president's address, Mr Leon, elected as Dr. Zach de Beer's replacement last Sunday, said he and his colleagues would "use all our resources to advance our ideals and to unpack our value system so that it touches the lives of all South Africans in all communities". The DP supported the government's Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP], he said to applause from ANC benches, provided it was sustainable, cost-effective and wide in its reach. The following "base-line" characteristics were needed for a truly effective RDP: -- a profound change in direction of previous government expenditure, with more stability in fiscal and monetary policy; -- recognition of the innovating stimulus of the free market economy, without its indifference to unemployment; -- sustainable job creation on a long-term basis; -- acceptance of the broad line of division between public and private sectors; and -- the use of market forces to help achieve policy objectives. Mr Leon said although the DP was a small party, it represented many of the critical interests of South Africa's civil society: the professions, elements of the university community, smaller and larger businesses, entrepreneurs, investors and consumers. He called on the government to lift the state of emergency in Natal, to ensure that the selection process for judges of the constitutional court was open and to promote federalism. Mr Leon paid tribute to Dr. de Beer as someone who had represented decency in public life "even when flagrant incivility and rhetorical excesses seemed the quickest route to political power".
