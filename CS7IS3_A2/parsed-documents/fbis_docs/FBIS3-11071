The documents were signed by the two foreign ministers during a ceremony attended by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at Government Palace. The other cooperation agreements refer to the economy, natural resources, the environment, health, the duty free warehouse in Villeta, and tourism issues. All these agreements were signed during the last visit President Wasmosy made to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, some months ago. Stolen Vehicles According to the agreement on the recovery of stolen vehicles, the two countries promise a smooth exchange of information between their respective police forces regarding the owners of the vehicles, the reports of theft to the police, and details of the stolen vehicles. The accord also establishes the need for a document certifying that the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and listing the highways and checkpoints which the vehicle is authorized to use. Other preventive measures mentioned in the agreement refer to constant patrolling, checking of vehicles, and the establishment of consultation offices in both countries in their respective police stations. Establishment of Grounds for the Construction of a Gas Pipeline The agreement for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to Paraguay is partial, although of an "indefinite duration" and for a volume yet to be determined. The two countries have agreed to authorize the construction and operation of a gas pipeline between the two countries, as well as for the transportation of gas within their own territories. The purchase of gas will be made through operators who will be in charge of the negotiations and of establishing the price, deadlines, volume, and other pertinent details. Payments will be made in dollars. Economic Cooperation The economic cooperation agreement is basically designed to step up economic and commercial relations through the elimination of non-tariff barriers on bilateral trade, and to promote the expansion and diversification of trade between the two countries. Natural Resources As for the agreement referring to natural resources and environment, it provides for the exchange of technicians, professors, and experts for the drafting of joint programs as well as the exchange of information regarding methods and techniques. Tourism Cooperation The tourism cooperation agreement, among other issues, provides for regional and subregional integration, the coordination of promotion events, the consolidation of integrated tourism circuits, the identification and consolidation of a land and river corridor between the two countries, as well as the promotion of integrated tourist circuits in the international markets. Villeta Duty Free Warehouse The two ministers also signed an agreement for the exchange of reversal notes authorizing the rendering of services for cargo in transit, for Bolivian cargo in transit and to the Paraguayan market, and for Paraguayan cargo bound for Bolivia. The Bolivian Government has offered the Paraguayan Government a duty free warehouse and storage area in a site yet to be chosen, under the same terms granted by Paraguay to Bolivia. Health The cooperation agreement in this field is designed to establish an exchange of knowledge and experience, to step up the training of human resources, establish an information service on the activities held on the border areas, and adopt regular notification mechanisms on illnesses that must be reported.
