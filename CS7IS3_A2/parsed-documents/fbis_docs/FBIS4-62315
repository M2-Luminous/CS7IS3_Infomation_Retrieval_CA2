Andrey Kozyrev, Warren Christopher and their counterparts from Greece, Belgium, Germany, France and Great Britain try to elaborate a common position towards Bosnian settlement and bring the conflicting parties back to the negotiating table. According to Kozyrev, the discussion is unlike to be easy. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Geneva, the Russian foreign minister said that "although everybody understands the necessity of instant termination of combat actions, every party (at the negotiations) tries to insert additional demands into this definition". Kozyrev estimated chances of compromise, at least over principal approaches towards the problem, as 50-50, but said that Boris Yeltsin's recent peace proposals "have a good chance to become a backbone of possible decisions".
