Presenting a key-note speech at the Asia Society this morning, Wu noted that trade between China and the United States increased by 20 percent annually. Despite the troubles and conflicts in the process of Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, the general trend has been developing and going forward, she added. According to the minister, the two way trade between China and the United States valued at 27.65 billion U.S. dollars, increasing 11-folds over 1979 and the U.S. by far was the largest investor in China with committed investment of 11 billion dollars in over 10,000 projects. "It is worth noting that about 50 of the fortune 500 companies have made investment in China and their investment tend to be large in size and have higher level of technology content," Wu said at the China-U.S. trade and investment seminar. On the most favored nations (MFN) status, a topic concerned by all, Wu stressed that there was no problem on the part of China, but the U.S. annual review on China's MFN status had added considerable uncertainty to the business communities in the two countries. While praising more and more Americans of vision who were in favor of de-coupling human rights with MFN, Wu expressed her hope that reason would prevail so that this issue could be solved once and for all. "If otherwise the basis for Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations were ruined, both sides would suffer, the biggest loser would not be China, but rather U.S. business community and the vast U.S. consumers," she emphasized. Economies of the two countries were very complementary to each other, Wu said, adding that to develop trade and economic relationships between the two countries was not only in the fundamental interest of the two nations, but also beneficial to the prosperity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world. Ye Qing, vice chairman of China's State Planning Commission and Jiao Sufen, director general of the Department of Foreign Investment of MOFTEC, also made speeches on business opportunities in China. About 300 people, most of whom are businessmen from U.S. big companies, attended the seminar.
