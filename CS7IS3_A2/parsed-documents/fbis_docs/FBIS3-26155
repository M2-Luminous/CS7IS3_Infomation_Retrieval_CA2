As a result, this prevented the economy from overheating, maintained rapid economic growth, and basically achieved the planned targets. In 1993, China came out on top of the rest of the world's economies with a 13 percent economic growth rate and gained some valuable initial experience in the pursuit of maroregulation and control under the conditions of a market economy. The world looked agape and praised China's success in economic macroregulation and control. In retrospect, economic operations over the last year went through overheating and the attempts to get overheating under control. In early 1993, macromonitoring and forewarning indicators showed the national economy had entered the "red zone" and "peaked" in June, which meant it had entered the mid-level of the red zone. The macromonitoring and forewarning system gave the "overheating" warning. The central and local authorities took prompt and resolute measures to boost macroregulation and control. Through structural adjustment, they managed to reduce the overheating, maintained rapid economic growth, prevented drastic fluctuations, and stored away some strength for next year. Through rectification, the financial and circulation sectors were markedly improved in order and the good reformist momentum was preserved. Through screening, the bubble economy was curbed and effective economic growth was maintained. Overal economic operations in September fell from the mid-level "red zone" in the first half of the year to its lower levels and to the "yellow zone" (basically normal) in October. Great changes have happened in China's macroeconomy. Overall, it is developing in a healthy direction and basically has the objective of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. This shows that it is necessary, as well as possible, for the state to pursue further macroregulation and controls under market economic conditions and rapid economic development. A good start has gained some fresh experience for the better pursuit of macroregulation and control. First, the macroregulation and control based on the review of the situation was able to exploit the timing. Last year, based on an objective and accurate analysis of the economic situation, the central authorities resolutely and promptly unveiled a series of macroregulatory and control measures. Decisions for this round of macroregulation and control were made during the peak of an economic cycle (in June). The measures themselves were unveiled in July, in contrast with the past practice of unveiling them when the economy hit the bottom. In this way, macroregulation and control was able to seize the initiative, cool down the economy in an orderly and steady manner, prevented impetuosity and, more importantly, avoided the heavy losses that come with a "hard landing" and drastic fluctuations. This shows the scientific predictability and resoluteness of central decisions. Second, correct identification of targets for macroregulation and control and the areas for making breakthroughs. After analysis, the central authorities determined the overheating was local or confined to certain sectors and caused by confusion of the economic order in some sectors, not a heating up on all fronts. Therefore, they advised that boosting macroregulation and control did not mean retrenchment across the board but a structural adjustment. They stressed concentrating funds on the procurement of agriculture and sideline products, normal production in key state enterprises, key state projects, foreign trade procurements and operations, and so on, trying as much as possible to avoid "uniform and sweeping administrative measures." They succeeded in minimizing the negative impact of the macroregulatory and control measures. As a result of correctly identifying the cause of overheating and confusion, that is, overheated investment in fixed assets and the chaotic financial order, and the analysis of factors prompting the two to feed on each other, the central authorities chose rectifying the financial order and controlling excessive investment growth as the two main efforts, got hold of the key links, and enabled the entire economy to develop healthily. Third, endowing macroregulation and controls with the right amount of force with an eye for flexibility. Unlike the "riding roughshod over" and hard-landing approach in previous regulation and control, this time a soft-landing and microscopic regulation line of thought was adopted, with the objectives of suitably cooling down the economy while not dampening motivation for proper and rapid development in various sectors and controlling economic growth, price rises, total investment in fixed assets, loan scale, and money supply volumes with quantified targets. In the construction sector, macroregulation and control was aimed at strictly curbing new projects and prioritizing existing projects according to industrial policies and construction conditions. With the enforcement of the maroregulatory and control measures, local project investment was brought under effective control and decreased monthly from July onward. The actual amount of work on construction projects for the whole year rose by 22 percent, still within the normal range of growth. The industrial production rate dropped steadily each month between July and October, signalling a strengthening in market regulation, as witnessed by normal production growth for products still in demand in the market. When there was a general shortage of funds among firms, regulation and control was promptly relaxed; funds were injected, and firms were in better shape by October. By November, the industrial production growth rate had stopped declining, especially that of state-owned industry where production grew 1.9 percentage points from October. Production and sales rates rose further. The November sales rate of all industrial products climbed further to 96.25 percent after ending the June to September low-level fluctuation. Fourth, the adoption of integrated macroregulatory and control measures and making sure that the measures adopted are scientific. This time, emphasis was placed on combining regulation and control with reform and opening up and identifying rectification with reforms. Economic means were to be the chief method, supplemented by legal means and pursued in parallel with a strengthening of ideological and political work to foster clean government, fight corruption, and crack down on economic crimes. The regulation and control this time was supplemented with necessary administrative measures, conducted with equal attention to domestic and foreign markets, with emphasis on the banking and financial sectors. In particular, efforts were made to put the banking sector in order, taking advantage of an adjustment in interest rates. As a result, loopholes were plugged, formal channels established, and residents' savings increased significantly. This way, various banking and investment actions were standardized and capital markets were assured of healthy development. Fifth, an emphasis on a correct orientation, ensuring that targets for regulation and control and media opinion were coordinated. Under the conditions of a market economy, there are many different interests, including the anticipations of local governments, firms, nonprofitmaking bodies, and individuals, which also play a direct role in changes in market demand and supply. Examples include bullishness and purchase decisions made in relation to inflation and value appreciation. Expectations decide whether one is piling or selling stock, or selling fast, or holding back. The vigor or laxity of macroregulation and control will determine the expectations of foreign businessmen and local governments. As a result of paying attention to changes in psychological expectations, timely efforts were made to come to grips with situations before they became threatening. Media propaganda was boosted, information provided for guidance, and policy transparency increased to dispel unwarranted psychological expectations. These were also effective macroregulatory and control measures. In sum, in 1993, along with the strengthening and improvement of macroregulation and control, reform, opening up, and modernization moved into a new dimension, gained initial experience, and showed that strengthening and improving macroregulation and control was an essential component of economic work. However, to move the entire economy into a sustained benign cycle we need the guarantees of an economic structure, operating mechanism, and legal framework that are able to meet the requirements of a market economy. In a sense, macroregulation and controls can treat only the symptoms, not the cause of the diseases. Under the existence of two parallel structures, we have to further deepen reforms on all fronts if we want to eliminate factors that cause drastic fluctuations in the economy. Meanwhile, poor management remains a general problem, which is even more easily neglected under market economic conditions, as evidenced by the one-time mistaken concept that we could do away with all kinds of overseeing once prices were deregulated and the powers delegated to enterprises. Therefore, we have not solved the problems deeply embedded in economic operations and should watch out for them. The main problems in current economic life are: The excessive investment scale of current projects, irrational structures, huge market price raises which have passed the warning line, a fragile agricultural foundation, and so on. Furthermore, problems such as irrational social distribution, generally low industrial efficiency, lethargic state-owned large and medium enterprises remain prominent. At present, macroregulation and control should focus on: Preventing serious inflation; maintaining suitable growth in fixed-asset investment and money supply; strengthening agriculture in a down-to-earth manner; enlivening state-owned large and medium enterprises with effective measures; vigorously adjusting the economic structure; and raising economic efficiency to ensure the achievement of the targets for 1994 reforms and development in a smooth manner.
