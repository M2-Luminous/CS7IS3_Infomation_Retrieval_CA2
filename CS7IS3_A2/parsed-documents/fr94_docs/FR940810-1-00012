FR940810-1-00012 FR940810-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Part 171 [CGD 94&hyph;010] RIN 2115&hyph;AE75 Standards for Damage Stability of New Domestic Passenger Vessels AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking with request for comments; notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to amend the rules, on standards for damage stability, that it adopted on December 10, 1992. Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory burden. The amended rules proposed here would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing and other casualties caused by inadequate damage stability. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1994. A public hearing will be held from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. on September 30, 1994. More information about this public hearing is available from the person identified in for further information contact. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA, 3406) [CGD 94&hyph;010], Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia L. Carrigan, Marine Technical and Hazardous Materials Division (G&hyph;MTH&hyph;3), room 1308, Coast Guard Headquarters, telephone: (202) 267&hyph;2988, telfax: (202) 267&hyph;4816. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request For Data, Views, and Arguments This notice encourages the submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e). It is the Coast Guard's goal to implement regulations that will best address both the safety, and the operational needs, of all vessels. All new domestic passenger vessels, as defined in 46 CFR 171.045, must now meet the standards for damage stability in 46 CFR 171.080(e). These standards were based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for any passenger vessel allowed to carry 12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificate''). The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels, naval architects, shipyards, its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others involved in affected vessels' compliance with ยง171.080(e), either as it stands or as this proposed rule would amend it. Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data, views, and arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94&hyph;010], identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments. Drafting Information The principal persons involved in the drafting of this final rule are Patricia L. Carrigan, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection and Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.
