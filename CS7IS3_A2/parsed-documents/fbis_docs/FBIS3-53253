The president of the republic affirmed in his address the importance of the redivision at this very time since it involves the curtailment of the administrative shadow [as heard], the provision of more federalism, and the handing over of power to the masses. He denied that the financial cost of the project or the distribution of the human cadre was an obstacle preventing the implementation of the redivision recommendations, pointing out in this respect the success of the experiment on the redivision of states. [passage omitted] Dr. Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, minister in the Federal Rule Office and rapporteur of the committee, presented a comprehensive explanation at the beginning of the meeting, supported by maps detailing the options arrived at by the committee. He explained that the number of states in Sudan will rise to 25, by dividing each state into three states, with the exception of the northern state which it was decided will be divided into two states only; whereas the committee recommended the division of the central state into four states. It also decided to keep Khartoum state as it is -- one state.
