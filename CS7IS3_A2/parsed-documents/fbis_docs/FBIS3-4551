The largest-ever 15.25 trillion yen pump-primer unveiled earlier this month and a market-opening package scheduled to be announced in March have drawn much attention from other members of the G-7 club, Fujii told a news conference. Financial officials from these countries placed high expectations that the measures will help reduce Japan's swollen current account surplus, Fujii added. He also said Tokyo has been able to secure G-7 cooperation in preventing excessive fluctuations in currency rates. Fujii flew back from Frankfurt, Germany, where he attended a meeting Saturday of top finance officials from the seven leading economic powers. Referring to talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen held prior to the G-7 gathering, Fujii said Bentsen listened "in real earnest" to his explanation on the latest Japanese tax cut plan designed to boost personal consumption. Fujii said the media coverage so far made on the six other G-7 nations' assessment of the Japanese stimulus package does not accurately reflect "the real atmosphere" of the meeting. The remark apparently shows his frustration over a barrage of newspaper reports that Japan was criticized by its G-7 partners in the Frankfurt suburb meeting for failing to make sufficient efforts to boost domestic demand and cut its huge current account surplus. Reports also said Japan, despite Fujii's claim first made in his news conference immediately after the G-7 meeting, was not able to obtain firm G-7 commitment for taking currency-stabilizing measures following the yen's renewed surge against major currencies. Finance ministers and central bank governors from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States appeared to have "a positive impression" of the latest pump-priming package, Fujii said. He also said the G-7 club's shared stance against "speculative currency moves that may lead to the yen's rapid appreciation against the dollar" was well echoed in press remarks made by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Summing up the latest G-7 meeting as its Chairman, Waigel stressed the continuation among the seven countries of a process in which they have taken "appropriate" steps to arrest rapid currency rate movements, Fujii said. But Fujii withheld comment on whether or not the G-7 has agreed to refrain from currency rate manipulation. The yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on speculation over U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen, which were widely viewed as manipulation designed to guide the Japanese currency higher following the February 11 collapse in Japan-U.S. trade talks. Fujii dismissed as groundless reports that Japan had been isolated from other G-7 partners in their latest meeting. News conferences held by each G-7 country clearly showed "what was the reality," he said. Fujii said during his meeting with Bentsen he tried to wipe out "U.S. misunderstanding" that the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut envisioned in the stimulus package is a single-year scheme. The finance minister said he told Bentsen the tax cut is "a first step toward a more full-fledged tax reform expected to be worked out by the end of this year." Fujii also said he briefed Bentsen on the recently inaugurated coalition council which he said is working toward a full-scale tax reform in line with the fiscal 1994 tax reform guideline. But Fujii refrained from saying whether or not Bentsen was convinced by his explanation. Fujii said Japan is not considering formulating another economic package for now. He voiced hope the February 8 package will become a final one by pulling the Japanese economy out of its long slump.
