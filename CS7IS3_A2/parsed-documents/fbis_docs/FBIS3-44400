The agreement, reached between Heihe city in the northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang and Blagoveshchensk city of the Amur region of Russia in the Far East, was made public here at a seminar named "special economic zones for regional development", jointly sponsored by the United Nations and Heilongjiang Province of China. Under the agreement, the free economic and trade zone will extend from either end of the pontoon bridge to be built soon to span the boundary Heilongjiang river. The zone, initially blueprinted to cover 20 sq km, will consist of 10 sq km of land from each of the two countries while respective state land ownership remains unchanged. As outlined in the agreement, the zone, to be mainly engaged in trade, finance, high-tech industries, transportation and catering, is expected to become a transit center for goods and passengers. It is also designed to be an export-oriented processing base. The agreement said the zone will be administered by a joint management commission, to be formed by state-appointed personnel from both China and Russia. The commission, meanwhile, will adopt internationally-recognized practices and regulations governing economic, social, cultural and legal affairs. The zone will not be subject to the administration of either single government, the agreement noted. Within the zone, both goods and currencies will be allowed to circulate and be exchanged freely, and citizens of both countries will be allowed to go in and out with a border pass issued by the management commission while citizens from other countries will be allowed in and issued visas upon arrival. Participants in the seminar from the United Nations and 11 countries, including Japan, Russia, China, Bulgaria, Thailand, the United States and the Republic of Korea, held that the framework for the free economic and trade zone is workable. Heihe and Blagoveshchensk are the two largest and closest cities on the border between China and Russia. Since 1987, border trade between the two countries has surged, with Heihe alone reporting a two-way trade volume of more than two billion Swiss francs up to the present. To date, the two border cities have helped build connections between 2,000 companies in ten members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and over 3,000 Chinese firms. An official from the UN said the free economic and trade zone represents a brand-new type and can serve as an example for cross- border economic zones among other countries. The zone, once established, is expected to be a development force for regional economies in Northeast Asia as well as a spark to lead development of the neighboring areas. Currently the local governments of the two border cities are conducting detailed negotiations on the agreed project, which still awaits state approval by both China and Russia. Last December China and Russia officially agreed to build a pontoon bridge across the Heilongjiang river separating the two countries.
