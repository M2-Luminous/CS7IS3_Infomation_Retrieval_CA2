The daily quoted informed sources as saying that Pyongyang sees the Japan Renewal Party (JRP), the main force in Hosokawa's coalition government, as a lackey of the United States. Further sullying Pyongyang's impression of the Japanese leadership was the failure of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which had been friendly with North Korea, to form a coalition with the JRP. YOMIURI quoted the sources as speculating that this is the reason Chochongnyon (Federation of pro-Pyongyang Korean Residents in Japan) did not attend the SDP national convention on Tuesday. Negotiations between North Korea and Japan, suspended in Nov. 1992, and exchanges between parties of the two nations were thus unlikely to resume in the near future, the article said. It quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying that it was an unexpected situation because the JRP and SDP had close relations with Pyongyang. The two parties paved the way for the Pyongyang-Tokyo talks on normalization of ties after Shin Kanemaru, vice chairman of the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990. YOMIURI said that its sources were two SDP and JRP officials who had met with senior North Korean officials in charge of diplomacy since the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North Korean leadership last month. They said that the North Korean leadership considers relations with Japan "below zero," compared to inter-Korean talks or to its negotiations with Washington. They quoted a Pyongyang official as saying that the Hosokawa government was worse than its LDP predecessor and the SDP cannot be considered friendly to the Workers' (Communist) Party. This official called JRP Chairman Ichiro Ozawa a puppet of the United States, which he said dresses in the clothes of the United Nations, the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.
