FR940907-1-00034 FR940907-1-00014 Small and restricted populations of E. maguirei make this species vulnerable to alterations of its habitat. The plant already has been adversely affected by off-road vehicles and trampling by humans and livestock. Other potential threats to the species are due to mineral and energy exploration and development. The demographic stability of the various populations of the species is not well known, but some of the smaller populations may be at levels too low to ensure their long term survival. Although the effects of natural factors such as disease, parasitism, grazing by native species, natural erosion, and vegetative competition are usually not threatening to this species, any further losses in its existing numbers even may make natural conditions threatening. Section 12 of the Act directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the report as a petition to list those taxa named therein under Section 4(c)(2) of the Act (petition acceptance is now governed by Section 4(b)(3) of the Act), and E. maguirei was included in the July 1, 1975, notice on list ``A'' as endangered. Erigeron maguirei was proposed by the Service for listing as endangered along with some 1,700 other vascular plant taxa on June 16, 1976 (41 FR 24523). General comments received on the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). The 1978 amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn, but proposals published before the date of enactment of the 1978 amendments could not be withdrawn before the end of a 1-year grace period beginning on the date of enactment. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice of withdrawal of that portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final (44 FR 70796) which included E. maguirei. The July 1975 notice was updated by a notice in the Federal Register on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), and that notice included E. maguirei is a category 1species. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service presently has significant biological information to support a proposal to list them as endangered or threatened. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 1982 amendments to the Act requires that the Secretary of the Interior make findings on certain petitions within 1 year of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments to the Act further required that all petitions pending as of October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. Since the 1975 Smithsonian report was accepted as a petition, all the taxa contained in those notices, including E. maguirei, were treated as being newly petitioned as of October 13, 1982. The deadline for a finding on such petitions, including that for E. maguirei, was October 13, 1983. On October 13, 1983, the Service made a 1-year finding that the petition to list the Maguire daisy was warranted, but precluded by other listing actions of higher priority. On July 27, 1984, the Service published a proposed rule proposing E. maguirei var. maguirei as an endangered species (49 FR 30211) and published a final rule designating the species as endangered on September 5, 1985 (50 FR 36090). On September 27, 1985, the Service published a notice of review (50 FR 39526) replacing the 1980 notice and its 1983 supplement. This notice of review included E. maguirei var. harrisonii as a category 2 species. Category 2 comprises taxa for which the Service has information indicating that it may be appropriate to propose to list the taxa as endangered or threatened but that more substantial data are needed on biological vulnerability and threats to the species. The 1985 notice of review was replaced by the January 27, 1990 notice of review (55 FR 6184), which was replaced by the September 30, 1993, notice of review (58 FR 51144). Both notices retained E. maguirei var. harrisonii as a category 2 candidate species. Recent status surveys and taxonomic evaluations (Heil 1989; Van Buren 1993; R. VanBuren, Brigham Young University, 1993, pers. comm.; Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) indicate that the varieties E. maguirei var. maguirei and E. maguirei var. harrisonii are synonymous with E. maguirei . Synonymizing the two varieties into a full species results in E. maguirei var. harrisonii being removed from the candidate species list. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to E. maguirei (Maguire daisy) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range Due to its inaccessible habitat, there are few threats to the populations of this daisy that occur on Bureau of Land Management (Bureau) lands. Livestock trampling has affected populations of this plant both in and outside of Capitol Reef National Park (the Park is not closed to livestock grazing). Off-road and foot traffic within the Park have affected one known population of E. maguirei . The range within which E. maguirei occurs is known to contain uranium ore deposits. The development of these deposits, and surface disturbance by annual assessment work on mineral claims for uranium and possibly other minerals, have the potential to adversely impact this species and its habitat. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes None known.
