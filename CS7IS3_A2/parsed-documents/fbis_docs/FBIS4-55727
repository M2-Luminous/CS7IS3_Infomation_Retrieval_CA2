You have also ended negotiations with the "lignite" branch. What other negotiations remain? [Pol] There is still the sector of liquid fuels, the shipbuilding industry, heavy chemistry, the fertilizer industry, perhaps the metallurgy... I hope, however, that the talks will not be held with strike committees. I suppose that we will discuss the necessity of restructuring these branches with the directors of enterprises and the unionists. [WPROST] The agreement reached with the striking lignite miners does not change the fact that the establishment of coal partnerships has not curbed the growing costs of coal extraction. The earning capacity of the mining sector has been decreasing since the beginning of the year and so has coal extraction, the demand for which is rather limited in the country. As a matter of fact, the 300,000 employees might lose their jobs. [Pol] I do not think the future is as black as that. Due to the scale of employment, production, and exports, mining is still one of the most vital sectors of our economy. In the future, it will be able to maintain itself and to make investments from its own resources. [WPROST] For the time being, the profitability of the coal partnerships is "negative." [Pol] Their financial results are still affected by an enormous indebtedness, which is now being reduced. The program of restructuring the mining sector has not ended at the stage of establishing new organisms. It already resulted in a decrease in employment by 20,000 people last year, and this process is being continued--without any pressure or group layoffs, which is important. Every year 20,000 people begin to receive retirement pensions. The miners working in the mines that are being liquidated are offered jobs at other mines, or the system of social protection is built up for the period in which the laid-off workers acquire new skills. We are trying to see to it that economic requirements do not come into too great a conflict with the social ones. [WPROST] Demand for coal today is only half as great as it was in the times of "prosperity," when the yearly extraction volume neared 200 million tons. [Pol] As far as domestic demand is concerned, it will not really increase in the next few years. However, exports and profitability will be very important. [WPROST] Our extraction costs are two or three times as high as those borne by American, Australian, or South African exporters. [Pol] The Australians have their coal a few meters under the ground; they often need nothing more than a good bulldozer to get free access to it. To get our coal, we have to dig deeply into the ground, hundreds of meters, which costs a lot of money. However, in the western German union lands, for instance, in mines that are geologically comparable to ours, the extraction process is "overmechanized," and, as a consequence, their extraction costs are higher than ours. Thus, figures are not always "fair." As exporters, we also have an edge over others thanks to the "geographic rent," which lowers the cost of transportation from Poland. All things considered, I would not demonize the situation. [WPROST] However, are we not creating a dangerous "museum" by setting up coal partnerships in which the low efficiency of some mines is "neutralized" by other mines of a given group? As a result of agreements with the European Union and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in a few years, after reducing or entirely lifting tariffs, we will become defenseless against our competitors, whose products will be much cheaper. [Pol] I do not think our mining sector is a museum. Please note that extraction is subsidized in many countries but not in Poland. Subsidies concern only the costs of mine liquidation and social protection for those who are forced to change jobs. It is certainly one of the duties of the coal partnerships to protect some of the unprofitable mines. In mining, one mine is never profitable forever. As a result of only one cave-in, a mine may lose its earning capacity for several years. Thus, the partnerships are made up of both good and poor mines. In the long run, however, the partnerships will want to lower costs, and, naturally, they will "push out" the latter, the poorest ones. They will want to close them down, especially the mines in which deposits have already been almost entirely exploited. [WPROST] For the time being, however, extraction costs are not observed to be decreasing considerably, and the earning capacity of mines is becoming increasingly lower. [Pol] My advice is: More patience. Coal partnerships are now at the stage of concluding agreements with their creditors and with the budget; they are all working on a system of paying off the mines' debts. Apart from that, mining is gradually getting rid of the nonproductive property. So far, it has been burdened with the duty of maintaining streets, stadia, hospitals, sanitariums, health centers. This year, all of this should yield a financial result that is slightly positive or near zero. [WPROST] Now that you have signed an agreement with miners, are you not expecting an escalation of pressure from other "vital" branches? [Pol] In many countries much more developed than Poland, the restructurization of strategic sectors was accompanied by great tensions, discussions, and conflicts. Success was or was not achieved through compromise. There are countries where restructurization of the power industry was suspended because the initial attempts brought about such tensions that the authorities decided to wait for a better atmosphere. [WPROST] Should the 40 percent of industrial enterprises, whose financial results are negative today, wait for a better atmosphere, as well? What do you intend to do with the "socialist dinosaurs" of our economy? [Pol] Unfortunately, you are now repeating stereotypes. When you are speaking about "socialist dinosaurs," you mean... [WPROST] The FSO Automobile Factory, for instance. [Pol] This "dinosaur" contributes well over 1 trillion zlotys to the state budget annually. [WPROST] The demand for these products is protected by outrageous customs duties, excise, and import tax. [Pol] The customs duty is not all that outrageous at all. In India, for example, it is as high as 150 percent of the value of a given car. I would like to caution against the vision of "let us plough this all up and create a beautiful, modern automobile industry meeting world standards." This is utopia. Unfortunately, we live off what we have. If some day we really opened our borders--and there were such attempts in 1991 and 1992, when the customs duty did not exceed 4 percent--the Polish economy would collapse immediately. It is worth recalling that thousands of enterprises whose debt burdens we are now trying to reduce somehow found themselves in trouble in that particular period. You can certainly say: Let us not reduce the debts; let them collapse. The problem is that, along with them, the whole of Poland would collapse because no one would be able to maintain such a large army of unemployed people. [WPROST] Is it not utopia, as well, that all of this can be rescued? [Pol] Certainly not all enterprises will make it. I believe, however, that, in the case of the sectors that are subjected to the restructurizaiton process, the situation will be similar to the second year of studies: Generally, everyone should survive it, but there is always some percentage that fails the exams. In the case of companies, this is an extremely slow and difficult process. First, they must come up with "a survival idea," and then they can count on the state to help them. Unfortunately, the state has also contributed to the difficulties they are going through. This is the result of certain mistakes that were made in the preliminary stages of free-market reforms. [WPROST] However, it is probably difficult to support enterprises without finding ways to communicate with their employees. In recent weeks, you have been at the forefront of the battle between the government and the unions. Did you not get the impression that Poland is becoming increasingly more deeply divided into two separate worlds, the interests of which it will be increasingly harder to reconcile? [Pol] It is certainly difficult to reconcile interests. I believe, however, that it is still one Poland with one way of thinking. It is obvious that, if you suddenly begin "tampering" with the labor-and-wage system of someone who considers his situation to be stable and his future to be safe, this will make him protest. Concrete information gets across to some people more easily than to others. If you add to this such factors as politics and the activities of competing trade unions, all of this will make for an explosive combination. [WPROST] However, I cannot see the government trying to effectively scatter these fears by presenting a coherent and clear activity schedule. You were practically alone in negotiations with the striking lignite miners. [Pol] I think this looked worse than it really was. Because the demands of the strikers concerned one of the strategic branches of the industry, I moved to the foreground of events. However, later there was cooperation. I cannot really complain about being alone. [WPROST] What will the talks on the restructurization of other branches look like? Will they be held under a threat of strikes? [Pol] We are striving to maintain the configuration that was agreed upon in the last negotiations: the government-trade unions-employers. [WPROST] However, Solidarity ["S"] is demanding separate talks with the government. [Pol] I believe that "S" will finally understand that we are not in a position to talk with each union separately. Each of them is quite strong, and favoring one of them triggers a chain reaction that consists of demands for separate negotiations. This is unacceptable to the government. [WPROST] The use of the "trilateral" model at the nationwide forum of the commission, which is supposed to be set up by a separate law, also creates a danger: It may lead to some kind of "corporationism" if not "unioncracy." As a matter of fact, the most vital social decisions may be made outside the government and the parliament. [Pol] No. I think that it is simply a slow and difficult procedure for reaching the final shape of the configuration of influence on state affairs. Neither the government nor the parliament will agree to be substituted for by the trilateral commission; they will not agree that the unions should decide issues that are of utmost importance to the state. It so happens that it is the government and the parliament that bear all responsibility. On the other hand, however, no government in a country that has such large union structures as ours can make decisions exclusively on its own. It should discuss with the unions any moves they are by nature interested in--from social issues to issues related to wages. [WPROST] Much seems to suggest that the consecutive governments, both the "S" governments and the present Cabinet, have not worked out any strategy for resolving the problems of "the vital" branches. It seems that the strategy has been replaced by the tactics of deferring conflicts and gradually neutralizing them in negotiations and strikes. [Pol] Definitely not. Programs concerning restructurization have been prepared in detail. They were worked out partially by my predecessors, who, however, did not manage to accomplish much because they were frequently recalled too soon. Today we are preparing a program of restructurization of the liquid fuels sector. If this program fails, the Polish fuel industry, which is today in pretty good condition, may be obliterated from the face of the earth within just a few years--when the contingents for fuel imports are lifted and the customs duty is lowered. [WPROST] However, the consciousness of this fact is not common. [Pol] Hence the scale of social opposition, whose enormousness I realized during negotiations with the lignite miners. Hearsay, false information, and mistrust were so concentrated there that the union activists, even though they realized that the threat caused by the restructurization is not really great, did not have the courage to be frank with the strikers. Thus, there is a great need to make everyone realize the necessity of transformations; people must realize that they bring not threats but possibilities for surviving.
