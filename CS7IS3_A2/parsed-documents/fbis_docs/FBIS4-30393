"We would like to clear the way (for further progress) through mutual dialogue without allowing the talks to move backward," the outgoing Japanese leader was quoted as telling Clinton. "I have directed working-level officials to make efforts in that direction," he was quoted as telling Clinton. Hata also said Japan will not allow the current political impasse to adversely affect its reform efforts, including those for the election system and other political matters, economic issues such as market opening, and administrative reform, the officials said. On the North Korean nuclear issue, he told Clinton there has been "a step forward" thanks to U.S. efforts and pledged to continue playing a role expected of Tokyo in close cooperation with Washington and Seoul. The officials quoted Clinton as thanking Hata for giving instructions toward enhancing cooperative relations between the two countries. The President told him Washington will continue to cooperate closely with Tokyo in resolving the question of Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms development program, adding he wants progress to be made in the trade talks, the officials said. Clinton said he was personally impressed by Hata's capability and personality, they added. Hata made the call to Clinton's presidential retreat at Camp David to brief him on the prime minister's announcement Saturday that he is stepping down to open the way for a stable new government.
