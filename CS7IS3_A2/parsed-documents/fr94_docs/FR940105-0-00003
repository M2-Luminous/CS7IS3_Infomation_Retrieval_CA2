FR940105-0-00003 FR940105-0-00001 The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment, is based on the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reasons and necessity for immediate implementation of this interim rule are as follows: Immediate promulgation of this interim rule is necessary to insure full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline mandated by MTINA. Specifically, petitioning employers who submitted labor certification applications with a state employment office before October 1, 1991 and who have not submitted a petition with the Service under section 203(b) of the Act, must be made clearly aware that the provisions of 8 CFR 204.5(d), regarding assignment of priority dates, have been superseded by the MTINA amendments. Moreover, immediate promulgation of these regulations will inform the petitioning employer that, in cases where the request for labor certification was filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, it should file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act with the Service as soon as possible after the Department of Labor has issued the labor certification in order to obtain an earlier priority date. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated that this rule affects only a very limited number of petitioners and aliens who filed requests for labor certifications prior to October 1, 1991, but have not yet filed petitions under section 203(b) of the Act. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 204 Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment, Immigration, Petitions. Accordingly, part 204 of chapter I of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 204_IMMIGRANT PETITIONS 1. The authority citation for part 204 continues to read as follows: Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1103, 1151, 1153, 1154, 1182, 1186a, 1255; 8 CFR part 2. 2. In §204.5, paragraph (d) is amended by adding a new sentence immediately following the first sentence of the paragraph to read as follows: §204.5 Petitions for employment-based immigrants. * * * * * (d) Priority date. *␣*␣*␣ In the case of labor certifications accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor before October 1, 1991, if a petition filed under section 203(b) of the Act is not filed before October 1, 1993, or within 60 days after the date of certification by the Department of Labor, whichever is later, the priority date shall be the date the petition is properly filed with the Service. *␣*␣* * * * * * Dated: December 30, 1993.
