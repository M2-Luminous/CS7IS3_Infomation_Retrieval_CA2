FR940204-0-00028 FR940204-0-00016 In an order issued July 2, 1979, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the effective date of EPA's approval of the 1978 coke pushing and charging regulations until the nonattainment designation challenge was resolved. In a second order issued October 23, 1979, further proceedings in the case were stayed pending EPA's final action on any new SIP revision that might be required after finalization of the nonattainment boundaries in Etowah and Jefferson Counties. As part of the basis of the second stay, EPA agreed not to enforce the 1978 coke pushing regulations pending finalization of the nonattainment boundaries and EPA's final action on any new SIP revision that may be required. Thus, neither EPA nor the State enforced the 1978 coke oven pushing and charging regulations. In November 1984, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals notified the Department of Justice and counsel for U.S. Steel and Gadsden Steel that the Court would not carry this case on its docket indefinitely and directed counsel to confer and dispose of the case. U.S. Steel and Gadsden Steel Company (formerly Republic Steel) requested that EPA's action in adopting 1978 coke oven regulations be vacated or, alternatively, that the July 1979 stay of enforcement of these regulations be continued. EPA and the Justice Department disagreed with the two steel companies, pointing out that the petition for review lacked ``good cause'' in light of EPA's second (and unchallenged) designation of parts of Jefferson and Etowah Counties as nonattainment areas for total suspended particulate matter (TSP). EPA and the Justice Department reasoned that the 1978 Alabama-submitted coke oven regulations (which represented Reasonably Available Control Technology) were needed due to the affected area's nonattainment status. The parties failed to reach an agreement and filed legal briefs and memoranda with the court. On May 14, 1985, the Eleventh Circuit Court dismissed the steel companies' petitions for review without prejudice. The dismissal of the case dissolved the July 1979 agreement by EPA to stay enforcement of the 1978 Alabama coke oven regulations. However, because of the imminent approval status of this SIP revision, EPA has continued to refrain from enforcement of the 1978 regulations. Regulations in this SIP revision will supersede the 1978 coke oven regulations in Etowah County. A reduction in particulate emission levels has occurred at the Gulf States Steel facility due to the enforcement of regulations applying to steel mills adopted in 1974, along with a fugitive emissions control program more recently implemented by Gulf States Steel Corporation. To insure that the reductions associated with the fugitive emissions control program will continue in the future, ADEM adopted regulations requiring Gulf States Steel Corporation to continue efforts to reduce fugitive emissions.
