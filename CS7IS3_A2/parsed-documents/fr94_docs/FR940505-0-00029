FR940505-0-00029 FR940505-0-00006 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;80.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;09&hyph;08 Allied-Signal Inc., Garrett Engine Division: Amendment 39&hyph;8897. Docket 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;80. Applicability: Allied-Signal Inc., Garrett Engine Division, Model TPE331&hyph;1, &hyph;2, &hyph;2UA, &hyph;3U, &hyph;3UW, &hyph;5, &hyph;5A, &hyph;6, and &hyph;6A turboprop and Model TSE331&hyph;3U turboshaft engines incorporating third stage stator turbine assemblies, Part Number (P/N) 868379&hyph;3, repaired at the Garrett General Aviation Service Division (GGASD) facility in Phoenix, Arizona, between November 1988 and May 1991, and identified by serial numbers listed in AlliedSignal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. TPE331&hyph;A72&hyph;0906, dated October 15, 1993. These engines are installed on but not limited to Mitsubishi MU&hyph;2B series (MU&hyph;2 series); Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A. (CASA) C&hyph;212 series; Fairchild SA226 series (Swearingen Merlin and Metro series); Prop-Jets, Inc. Model 400; Twin Commander 680 and 690 (Jetprop Commander), Rockwell Commander S&hyph;2R, Shorts Brothers and Harland, Ltd. SC7 (Skyvan), Dornier 228 series, Beech 18 and 45 series and Models JRB&hyph;6, 3N, 3NM, 3TM, and B100, Pilatus PC&hyph;6 series (Fairchild Porter, Peacemaker), De Havilland Model DH 104 series 7AXC (Dove), and Ayres S&hyph;2R series airplanes; and Sikorsky S&hyph;55 series helicopters. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect suspect third stage turbine stator assemblies, P/N 868379&hyph;3, and replace, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of AlliedSignal Aerospace ASB No. TPE331&hyph;A72&hyph;0906, dated October 15, 1993, and the following schedule: ␣ 1Third stage turbine stator cycles in service since repair by GGASD 1Inspection schedule 900 or more cycles Within 50 cycles in service after the effective date of this AD. 450 to 899 cycles Within 150 cycles in service after the effective date of this AD, but not to exceed 950 cycles in service since repair by GGASD. Less than 450 cycles Prior to accumulating 600 cycles in service since repair by GGASD. Note: The FAA has determined that cracking of third stage turbine stator assemblies is related to operating cycles, rather than operating hours. (b) If cycles cannot be determined, calculate cycles by multiplying third stage turbine stator assembly hours time in service by 1.5.
