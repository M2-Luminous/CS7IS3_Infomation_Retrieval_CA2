We have a new president and vice president. We are very pleased, particularly about the way in which the Salvadoran people once again expressed their feelings peacefully. We hope that from now on the country will be able to do everything that is required. The political campaign is over. I will continue working for the benefit of the Salvadoran people. [Unidentified reporter] What about the people not (?liking) the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] [words indistinct]? [Cristiani] We must not necessarily view it as the people either liking or disliking the FMLN. The people simply preferred another political force. We must realize that there are always some people who receive more votes than others and [words indistinct]. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Cristiani] We have had reports of some irregularities. Generally speaking, everything went very well. There was one incident in Pasaquina, but we do not have the details. We will have to check that out, but I do not think it will affect the elections.
