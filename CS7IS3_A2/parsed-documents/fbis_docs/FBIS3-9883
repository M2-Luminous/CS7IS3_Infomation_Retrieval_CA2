Famania opens the program by asking Lewis Galindo why he decided to run for office since he is a very successful entrepreneur. He replies: "I have devoted 45 years of my life to private enterprise and I have developed it. I have created many job opportunities and given employment to many. I have seen many enterprises grow, and I have reached a stage in my life where I think I must devote my efforts to serving the fatherland." Lewis Galindo goes on to speak about the economic plan he would launch and explains that "we must try to keep a 5-percent annual growth rate," and attain a national consensus that will keep the country calm so that foreign investments are made. This can only be done "if we modernize the government structures by improving administrative functions," he adds. When Famania asks him if this modernization entails "reducing bureaucracy," Lewis Galindo answers that a modern and efficient state requires fewer personnel, but we must watch out for the high unemployment rate; therefore, private enterprise must grow. The presidential candidate goes on to speak about ways to reduce poverty and pay the "social debt" rather than pay the foreign debt. After pointing out the foreign debt is higher today that in 1989, Lewis Galindo says that, should he be elected, he will seek an agreement with the people to see how the country can cope with "these inherited responsibilities." At 0230 GMT, Famania explains that Samuel Lewis Galindo is the presidential candidate of the National Consensus Alliance that is made up of Solidarity Party and the National Unity Mission. Expanding on the foreign debt issue, Lewis Galindo points out that another presidential candidate, Ruben Dario Carles, "is also responsible for the increase in the foreign debt" as Carles was the comptroller general for the current administration. To cope with this problem, Lewis Galindo says that the next government will have to do what Costa Rica did. For example, he adds, it must first seek Panamanian economists who will draft a national plan and not act according to "plans imposed by the international financing institutions, which is what has happened in Panama." Lewis Galindo says that the only way Panama can obtain "adequate growth" is through exports, but the problem is that while private enterprise has modernized, the government has not. Panama must reduce tariffs, and the state must become more efficient, he points out. To sum it up, Famania emphasizes that Lewis Galindo proposes "modernization of the economy." Turning to the subject of public security, Lewis Galindo says the National Police must become more professional, and the organization must be reorganized thoroughly, with a civilian hierarchy, without including the former officers of the defunct Panama Defense Forces and National Guard. Referring to the Panama Canal, Famania mentions that "about one week ago, the new chief of the Southern Command said that the United States was willing to change the timetable for returning the military bases at the request of Panama." He then asks the presidential candidate: "Do you think it would be advisable for Panama to change this timetable?" Samuel Lewis Galindo answers: "I think we Panamanians must conduct ourselves with a certain amount of dignity. If the United States gives clear signals that it needs certain areas for some bases that will benefit Latin America and Panama, I -- as head of the government -- would be willing to negotiate. However, first of all, certain things would have to take place. First, we must determine what is the value, what is the economic potential of those bases? What are the economic benefits those bases have for the country versus the exploitation of those areas? It will probably be more advantageous for Panama -- should there be mutual interest by the two nations -- that these bases be moved to other areas where they will promote the development of those areas, for example Darien, should that be the case. Nonetheless, we must first consult the sovereign power, that is, the people." As for the reverted areas, Lewis Galindo says he proposes conducting studies "to obtain the maximum benefit of the entire canal bank area, so that these resources will attract investors," but this must all be part of an overall program as "the former Canal Zone cannot become a privileged island while Panama remains poor." He adds that "the wealth generated from these areas must help solve the unemployment, health, and -- particularly -- the education problems." The presidential candidate then answers listeners' questions that cover subjects such as denying there is any political agreement with the Democratic Revolutionary Party, privatization, and the Social Security system.
