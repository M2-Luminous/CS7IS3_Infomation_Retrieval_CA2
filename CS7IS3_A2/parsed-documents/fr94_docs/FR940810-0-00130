FR940810-0-00130 FR940810-0-00021 Many who commented during the supplemental comment period agreed that OSHA should use AHERA as a general model for drafting training requirements for building/facility workers (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;15, 162&hyph;16, 162&hyph;18, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;30, 162&hyph;35, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45,162&hyph;46). Others, felt the existing OSHA training requirements were adequate (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;22). Some objected to OSHA specifying a time period in its training requirements (Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;17, 162&hyph;25, 162&hyph;50, 162&hyph;55, 162&hyph;57). BCTD argued that AHERA training was inadequate for OSHA's purposes, and that any employee in a building containing either ACM or PACM who does not intentionally handle the material should receive at least 4 hours of awareness training and that any worker who disturbs ACM during repair, renovation, demolition or maintenance work needs the full 5-day training course (Ex. 162&hyph;42). Under the training provisions of AHERA, all members of the maintenance and custodial staffs (of schools) who may work in a building containing ACBM are required to receive at least 2 hours of ``awareness'' training whether or not they are required to work with it (40 CFR 763.92). Those who conduct an activity which will result in disturbance of ACBM shall receive both the awareness training and 14 additional hours of training. EPA set as a minimum that the awareness training cover: _information of uses and forms of asbestos in buildings; _information on health effects of exposure to asbestos; _location of ACBM in building where employee works; _recognition of deteriorating or damaged ACBM; and, _the identity of person responsible for management of ACBM. While the more extensive training needed by those who might disturb ACM include in addition: _description of proper methods to handle ACBM; _information on respirator protection _the provisions of the AHERA rule; and, _hands-on training on the use of protective equipment and work practices Information in this rulemaking discussed above shows that workers who have performed work now designated Class III and IV have developed asbestos-related disease. Because as noted above, training is one of the most powerful instruments to protect workers, OSHA believes that its former training provisions must be improved by incorporating additional curricula such as covered in the AHERA courses for such workers. Imposing time criteria for courses will help insure that sufficient time for instruction is provided. More time can always be allotted, as needed. (12) Housekeeping
