Bekesi, who formulated the economic program for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also said that, after the new cabinet comes into office, immediate measures will be necessary to stop the further increase of the domestic and foreign state debt. Parallel with the quick measures, the 1995 budget will have to be prepared, and the so far delayed reform of state administration will have to be started, which will probably take up all of the next parliamentary cycle. [Hajnal] On the night of the elections, MSZP Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres said that the party was preparing a six-month action plan in which the most important tasks are laid down. Which measures will apply to the economy after the new government is formed? [Bekesi] We are indeed preparing a 15-point package, in which the most important tasks are laid down: What can be implemented or corrected this year, and how to prepare for the next year because the draft 1995 budget will also have to be prepared by the fall. At the same time, this six-month period is deceptive because, in my view, the next government will not even have one day's grace, it will have to begin to act straight away. First of all, we are making a full inventory of the macro-processes because, although we are familiar with the major indicators, we do not possess all the information. We must have exact information on the country's economic situation and its assets, our forint and foreign currency obligations, and the central burdens of the ongoing processes -- for example, debtor consolidation or privatization. When this inventory is completed, then we will have to show it -- our starting point -- to the country. In my view, the country's increasing domestic and foreign indebtedness is the most dangerous process, we must not delay curbing this, and results should be achieved in this area still in 1994. [Hajnal] One way of doing this can be the often mentioned and inevitable supplementary budget. However, as the supplementary budget cannot be accepted before September, its effectiveness may be questionable, especially if both the expenditure and revenue sides have so far been adhered to proportionately with time. [Bekesi] Essentially, we can only consider changing the expenditure side, which means the freezing of certain items. I am thinking of the 40 decentralized funds that are kind of small budgets within the big budget. In my view, out of the funds that represent some 100 billion forints' state support, the payment of almost all titles can be frozen apart from the money given to the agricultural sector, the municipalities, and employment. This can mean some 20 to 30 billion forints. In addition to this, other state payments can also be stopped, mainly the support given to governmental and political organs, which can reduce the expenditure side by another 20 billion forints. Naturally, these are only estimates, this is precisely the reason we have to prepare a correct inventory and situation assessment. It is more difficult to change the revenue side; increasing taxes is certainly out of the question. However, it is worth looking at the 150 billion forints of social security demands; according to the experts, some 50 billion of this could be moved, however, it is undoubtedly true that many tools, including the legal background in certain cases, are lacking for the mobilization of these assets. Naturally, it is only worth making a supplementary budget if real savings can be achieved through it. [Hajnal] In your previous statements, among the immediate tasks, you mentioned the suspension of certain passages of the law on cooperatives, a possible stopping of the preferential share purchase program [KRP], and the formulation of new asset policy principles. What concrete measures were you thinking of, especially when the KRP is being offered to ordinary people by the current government? [Bekesi] In the case of the cooperatives, we have to prevent the remaining assets from being further taken to pieces, this has to be stopped immediately. I am convinced that the same should be done with the KRP because this method does not mean the inclusion of new capital and it does not really create new owners. Of course, the KRP can also be amended but the details of this still have to be looked at. [Hajnal] In the meantime, the year 1995 also has to be prepared. What are the tasks facing legislation? [Bekesi] The majority of tax laws will certainly have to be amended, which would mean further tax reductions and tax allowances. These would be aimed at stimulating enterprises and savings. Further legislative tasks would be: Drawing up the foreign currency code and the customs law, amending the local authority law, creating export guarantees, and many others. [Hajnal] Implementing the reform of state administration would be an urgent task for the new government. How long would it take to implement this reform and what are its major points? [Bekesi] In my view, the implementation of the reform would take up the whole parliamentary cycle, but it certainly cannot be delayed any more. Within this, we have to solve the financing of the domestic state debts, on the revenue side it is necessary to reexamine the state functions, within this, the basic services and the proportions of distribution have to be corrected, naturally, linked to compensation, and the decentralized funds will also certainly have to be reduced. [Hajnal] In the past, a number of people formulated the MSZP's actual economic program. Is this program the one signed by you or the one that appeared in an advertisement, perhaps, with the influence of trade unions? [Bekesi] I believe that it is the former because the MSZP's congress accepted it, and this version appeared in the party's election program. Naturally, the way this will appear as a coalition government's program will have to be decided in negotiations with the partners. [Hajnal] As the person who drew up the MSZP's economic program, what role do you envisage for yourself in the new government? [Bekesi] It would be far too early to talk about this because much depends on the second round of the elections. The question is, what kind of government will be formed, what members it will have, what kind of program can be drawn up with these members, and whether I actually wish to participate in it because this is a two-way street.
