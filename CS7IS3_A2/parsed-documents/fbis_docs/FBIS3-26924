The date is 21 May 1958, and Comrade Mao Zedong is in Huairentang of Zhongnanhai, looking with great interest at "Dongfeng," our country's first domestically produced sedan. He later said happily: Finally I can ride in a sedan that we manufactured. (the photo above) But people in the know know that the sedan did not come from a modern assembly line, but was a sample car that was "hammered out" by highly skilled mechanics. The hand-crafted work was produced and presented to Comrade Mao Zedong as a token "gift" for the "Great Leap Forward." Back then, the assembly line only produced trucks. For a long time, any discussion of China's auto industry was actually about the country's truck industry. There was a saying which characterized the situation well: "A lack of light (vehicles), a shortage of heavy-duty (vehicles), and no sedans whatsoever." Thirty-five years have passed. Having started from scratch and expanded to a great scale, China's auto industry has made enormous achievements. In particular, in the 15 years of reform and opening up, China's auto industry grew at a high annual rate of 19 percent, with its output volume jumping from 185,000 in 1979 to 1.28 million vehicles in 1993. The output volume of last year alone was four times the total volume of the 30 years prior to reform. The total output value rose from 7.2 billion yuan in 1981 to 120 billion yuan in 1993, one third of the total output value of the entire machinery industry. The auto industry was launched in the 1980's; its output volume rose from 5,000 in 1985 to 225,000 in 1993, a 32-fold increase over eight years. For the last 15 years, through joint ventures and cooperation, the auto industry has imported 200 various advanced technologies and has initiated 126 joint-capital firms. Direct foreign investment has amounted to over $900 million, and all automobile products have introduced new models and have offered new ranges of models. There are now a dozen auto-production bases, such as those that produce the Jiefang, Dongfeng, Heavy-Duty, and Nanqi models in the country's capital, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. China now can produce 103 ranges of basic car models, from heavy-duty, medium, and light-duty to mini types, and 750 types of specialized and remodeled vehicles. Manufacturing standards, product quality, and management levels have all entered a new stage. The 14th Party Congress proposed speeding up the development of the auto industry as a pillar industry for the national economy. Between now and the end of this century will be a critical period for our auto industry, which will take on key development problems. During this time, the auto industry will increase investment, will work to create as quickly as possible a number of business conglomerates capable of responding to the two markets which are internationally competitive, and will establish an independent product development system with decisionmaking powers. By 2010, the industry will be producing 6 million vehicles annually. The economical sedan, most suitable for carrying the whole family, will be the leading product. Most encouragingly, the state is going to unveil an industrial policy designed to speed up the development of the auto industry. At the same time, car business groups are pursuing a "power-power" [qiang qiang 1730 1730] type of joint venture which links up different enterprises, regions, industries, and departments, with all partners investing jointly to import new and high technologies. For China's auto industry, today is a historical turning point. It signifies the end of isolated and disparate management and the repetitive imports and projects that have long plagued auto production. China's auto industry will finally be on its way to a high technological starting point, mass production, specialization, and production based on economies of scale and will enjoy healthy and rapid development.
