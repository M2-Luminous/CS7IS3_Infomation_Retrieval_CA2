While Japan, which is suffering from sluggish prices of ships, called on the ROK to curb the buildup of its facilities, the ROK refused by saying, "Japan's demand is against the move toward liberalization." Thus, they failed to reach an accord. Another meeting of shipbuilders of Japan, the ROK, and European countries is scheduled for 14 and 15 March. Several ROK builders, including the Samsung Heavy Industrial Company, have so far announced plans to build new docks for very large crude carriers (VLCC). With regard to their plans, Japanese representatives led by Shigeru Aida, chairman of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan, (chairman of Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.), urged self-restraint on the buildup of facilities, insisting: "There is already a surplus in shipbuilding facilities in the world. Building more facilities will cause excessive competition for contracts." However, ROK Shipbuilders Association Chairman Song Yong-su, (president of the Hanchin Heavy Industrial Company), and other participants insisted on difficulties in curbing the buildup of facilities, explaining: "We would like Japan to understand our circumstances. After the change of political regime, everything is moving toward liberalization." Thanks to the increase in the yen's value against the won, the number of orders received by the ROK has been increasing in recent years, becoming number one in the world in 1993, exceeding that of Japan.
