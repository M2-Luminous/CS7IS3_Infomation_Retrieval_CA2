Most of the enterprises that make up the APT today were sold to the workers or leased to them with promises that they would be sold. They were in deplorable financial condition, however, and their equipment and facilities were clearly run down. In many cases the workers have sought domestic and foreign partners, while in others they are facing serious financial difficulties since they cannot get loans because they do not yet have documents legitimizing their ownership. [passage omitted] Organization and Management in the APT Definition and nature of the APT: There is no totally accepted, widely discussed definition of the APT yet. There are only interpretations based on the economic and social "Consensus Accords" that have emerged from the privatization of state-run enterprises that has been going on since 1991 and on the organizational process in which these enterprises now find themselves. The following definition has been drafted with the aim of stimulating discussion that will lead to consensus on a clear, precise meaning of the term. APT is understood to mean "the group of enterprises in which, under their system of ownership, the workers participate as shareholders (majority or minority), thus forming a new grass-roots economic sector based on the struggles of the working class and their trade-union grievances relating to the social ownership of the state-run sector created by the Sandinist People's Revolution." The enterprises of the APT have been established as corporations under the national legal system. Owing to their origin, their goal is collective profits, which differentiates them from traditional private enterprise. The following are some of the differences and similarities that have been identified: Traditional Private Enterprise - One or several partners--Goal: profits - Partners investing capital - Heavily dependent on bank loans - Some degree of union activity - Wage-earning employees - Considerable managerial capability - Marketing experience - Individual profits - Labor/management relations - Economic and financial plans APT Enterprise - Many worker partners--Goal: profits - Partners investing capital - Heavily dependent on bank loans - Union self-management - Wage-earning employees and owners - Basic managerial capability - Little marketing experience - Collective profits - Partner/worker relations - Socioeconomic plans What type of partners are there in the APT? The law permits different categories of shares, establishing differences between partners in accordance with what kind of shares they hold. Some Labor Corporations (14) have specified in their constitutions and bylaws that all shares are registered. They have, however, established another category that takes into account the labor relationship between the enterprise and the partner. There are thus two kinds of shares: "A" and "B." --Type A shares are all those that are in the possession of partners who are working in the enterprise. Type B shares are those that are in the possession of partners who chose not to continue working in their enterprise. --The rights of partners vary according to the type of share (A or B) they hold. Partners with type A shares will be entitled to vote at meetings. Partners with type B shares have the right to attend and speak at meetings but cannot vote, and other restrictions on the exercise of the right arise from this. Partners with type B shares may not hold any managerial post in the enterprise. --The two types of shares confer equal rights in the distribution of profits. In other enterprises in the APT there is no difference between partners, regardless of whether they are working or not; thus, they have equal rights at meetings (to speak up and vote), the same right to seek administrative posts, and an equal share in profits. If a worker is an owner in an enterprise, can he be fired? What happens then? In the case of APT enterprises, shareholder rights do not guarantee a permanent job, inasmuch as this depends on the efficiency and responsibility of each worker. People must realize that jobs cannot be guaranteed to the detriment of the enterprise's finances. Ultimately, a worker's job will depend on the enterprise's economic potential and the effective use of manpower. An owner/worker can be justifiably dismissed in order to safeguard the profitability and production efficiency of the enterprise and to protect collective assets. Nevertheless, a worker who is fired or decides to leave the enterprise retains all his rights as a shareholder. Dismissal should be the last resort, inasmuch as an enterprise has several ways of helping its worker/partners and a wide range of options for their direct employment. The following are some options that both agricultural and industrial enterprises have tried: --Rotation of work shifts --Work on credit --Lowering wages The following can be regarded as options for indirect employment in the event of payroll cuts in the agricultural, industrial, or services sector: --Work on family parcels --Temporary harvest work --Work as a distributor, commission agent, or salesperson in one's hometown --Others The Initial Capital of APT Enterprises The agricultural and industrial APT enterprises were created by Presidential Resolution No. 109-91 (see Cuaderno No. 10, Annex 3 of Cipres [Center for Sociological Research]). The first to win contracts with Cornap [National Corporation of the Public Sector] were the agricultural enterprises, which negotiated resources from the state-run corporations Agroexco, Hatonic, Cafenic, Bananic [Nicaraguan Banana Enterprise], Nicarroz, and Trabanic. An initial group of industrial and services enterprises concluded negotiations in early 1993 and acquired enterprises from the COIP [People's Industrial Corporation], Conilac, Corcop [People's Commercial Corporation], Cotur, and other agencies. The initial capital of the APT enterprises is the capital that the state-run enterprises had at the time of the negotiations; it consists of land, plantations, machinery, and other resources and was acquired under lease and purchase contracts with the owner (the State).
