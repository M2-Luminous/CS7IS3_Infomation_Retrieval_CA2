There have been reports that on 5 April, Prince Ranariddh, first prime minister of the two-headed government, said there is a photo of Democratic Kampuchean leaders leaving the Pailin battlefield in a car and entering Thai territory with an escort of Thai troops. II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] spokesman vehemently and most categorically rejects Prince Ranariddh's accusation, which has dirty and dark political goals. This concocted and dirty story certainly will not deceive anyone. III. The Cambodian nation and people, like the international public in general, know and are well aware of the tricky way of the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets and lackeys. The communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets and lackeys have been using this dirty method incessantly since 1978-79 to cover up the war by the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their great criminal and brutal activities in killing the Cambodian nation, people, and race. These are intended to transform Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now part of Vietnam] according to the communist Vietnamese Indochinese Federation strategy. Prince Ranariddh concocted all the above stories on the orders of his masters; namely, the alliance between communist Vietnam and the communist Vietnamese puppets. Their goals are the following: 1. The two-headed government, the communist Vietnamese, and their allies have taken turns making accusations concerning the situation on the Pailin battlefield. This is to cover up the fact that communist Vietnam has brought nearly 4 million Vietnamese settlers into Cambodia and annexed tens of thousands of square kilometers of Cambodian territory in eastern Cambodia. 2. To cover up their defeat on the Pailin battlefield; the two- headed government, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and their allies are beginning to smell utter defeat on the Pailin battlefield. The invading forces of the two-headed government are being attacked by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. Their transport lines around Pailin -- which are their lifelines -- are being cut and their troops are being attacked and trapped within Pailin's perimeter. Their soldiers are constantly being killed and wounded. They are running around like rats caught in traps. IV. The Cambodian nation and people and the international public have clearly seen who is good and who is bad; who wants peace and national reconciliation and which warmongers are fueling the war. The communist Vietnamese oppose national reconciliation and the king's five-point national reconciliation plan. It is clear that Democratic Kampuchea wants genuine peace and national reconciliation in line with the king's five-point plan. As for the two-headed government and the communist Vietnamese puppets, they constantly shout about war and about fighting against Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. National and international opinion inside and outside of the country predicts that the two-headed government will certainly be defeated on the Pailin battlefield, just like at Anlung Veng. [Signed] The PDK spokesman [Dated] 6 April 1994
