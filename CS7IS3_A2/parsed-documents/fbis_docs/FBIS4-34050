Expressing "profound concern that illegal interests have embedded themselves in the institution, with obscure aims," General Rocha spoke of several modernization projects that are under way in La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and other districts of the country, and "that can be expected to come to fruition soon." The police chief referred to the "plans, programs, and strategies" that have been drawn up by his staff in the short time he has been in command, designed to modernize the Bolivian police. Following is the dialogue held with General Rocha Martinez: [LOS TIEMPOS] General Luis Rocha, the modernization plans announced by the police have been so severely criticized that it is now said that these good intentions have been postponed indefinitely. Is there any truth to what is being said? [Rocha] No. Very much on the contrary, my staff has taken definite steps in recent months toward improving the police institution's infrastructure, academic training, and modernizing the institution's equipment. The Bolivian police's current change of attitude exists and is permanent. The steps it has taken in its pursuit of renewal within the institution include the creating of an Honor Tribunal made up of former commanding generals of the police; the purchase of equipment to provide improved security services to the public; and the drawing up of plans to improve qualitatively the carrying out of their assigned tasks by the institution's future officers. [LOS TIEMPOS] Just what are the improvements to which you refer? [Rocha] For example, we have accelerated the work on remodeling the police units in the city of La Paz and Cochabamba. Evidence of this is the very recent remittance of approximately 40,000 bolivianos to the city of Cochabamba's Departmental Command, enabling it to proceed with the remodeling of what were once the criminology offices and are soon to be the sections of the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ]. The little that is available to the institution to improve its means of providing service to the Bolivian population is being put to use. As part of these plans, legally established businesses in Bolivia have been invited to bid on supplying typewriters and new office equipment for the offices of the PTJ. During the first phase, these PTJ offices will operate in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. With respect to its improvements program, the institution is currently awaiting the release of the Bolivian police budget funds that were approved this year by the government, so as to issue further calls for bids on the supplying of police reconnaissance cars, modern vehicles to augment our pool of radio patrol cars, and motorcycles for use by the Citizens Assistance and Cooperation Patrol [PAC] in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the PAC operate only in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz? [Rocha] No. The plan will be implemented throughout Bolivia. Specific phases of the program are being drawn up for this purpose. In this respect, we are planning an initial purchase of 120 motorcycles for the three departments of the country. Upon completion of these projects along the central axis, the program will be extended to Oruro, Sucre, and Potosi, and in a third phase to the departments of Tarija, Beni, and Pando. [LOS TIEMPOS] To what other areas has your staff assigned a modernization priority? [Rocha] My staff has also accorded attention to the police training system. Over the past few weeks we have entered a new period of extended police training. Under this program, substantial transformations are under way, beginning with the National Police Academy in La Paz, the Officers Post-Graduate Institute, the Noncommissioned Officers Training School, and the Basic Training Schools. After many years, competitive examinations have been opened to women. Women are a very real necessity especially in police units connected with the PTJ [Judicial Technical Police], and the narcotics and other services that are part of the institution. This year, we are going to begin by increasing the female police component by 50 persons. The component will operate in parallel with the Police Basic Training School. Thus, and as borne out by these general examples I have cited, the process of modernization and institutional change within the Bolivian police is well under way. The institution fully intends to improve its image qualitatively in the minds of the citizens. It is to this end that we are implementing a program of reequipping the police with new reconnaissance cars, radio patrol cars, and ambulances to provide emergency assistance to the citizens. Concurrently, we are redistributing our institution's best police personnel -- personnel who have been fully trained, including training in Europe as well -- to more effectively perform our task of serving the Bolivian people.
