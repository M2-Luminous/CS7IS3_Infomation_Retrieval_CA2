ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes escrow accounting procedures under Sections 6(g) and 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. 2605(g) and 2609 (RESPA). It establishes a nationwide standard accounting method known as aggregate accounting. The rule requires servicers to use the aggregate accounting method for escrow accounts involving federally related mortgage loans that are settled on or after the effective date of this rule. It provides a three-year phase-in period for existing escrow accounts to convert to the aggregate accounting method. In addition, the final rule establishes formats and procedures for initial and annual escrow account statements. By this rulemaking, the Department is implementing the Section 10 amendments made in section 942 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Conforming changes are also made to appropriate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provisions in parts 203 and 234. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 24, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2502&hyph;0501. I. Background Section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2609) sets out the statutory limits on the amounts that lenders may legally require borrowers to deposit in escrow accounts. The statutory language of Section 10 is complex. It has been subject to increasing controversy. At times the statute uses the term ``lender'' and at other times it uses the term ``servicer.'' A lender creates a loan obligation but may or may not service the loan. Within this rule, HUD uses the term servicer to include the lender when the lender performs the servicing function. Section 10(a) of RESPA limits the amounts that a lender may charge a borrower at the creation of an escrow account and during the lifetime of the account. Section 10(a)(1) sets limits on charges to a borrower when a lender creates an escrow account. At the time the lender creates an escrow account, the lender may only charge the borrower an amount sufficient to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, that are attributable to the period from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the first full installment payment under the mortgage. In addition, the lender may charge the borrower a cushion to cover unanticipated expenses. The statute limits the cushion to one-sixth of the estimated total annual payments from the account. Section 10(a)(2) sets limits on charges to a borrower over the rest of the lifetime of the escrow account. It provides that a lender may charge a borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth of the total annual escrow payments that the lender reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition, a lender may add an amount to maintain a cushion equal to one-sixth of the estimated total annual payments from the account. Section 10(c) of RESPA requires a servicer to provide a borrower with initial and annual escrow account statements. Section 10(d) sets forth the penalty provisions for a servicer's failure to provide the required statements. Section 6(g) of RESPA provides that if the servicer has required an escrow account, then the servicer shall make disbursement payments for the escrow account items in a timely manner as such payments become due. Historically, HUD had only interpreted the escrow accounting portions of Section 10 by informal opinion and one Interpretive Rule, dated January 21, 1993 (58 FR 5520). Litigation initiated by various State Attorneys General and private class-action plaintiffs raised serious questions about what RESPA permitted in this regard and fueled a debate about the extent of ``overescrowing'' in the industry. The Secretary decided that HUD needed to fulfill its responsibility to protect consumers by setting forth clear, specific guidance on escrow practices. Therefore, the Department initiated this rulemaking process. On December 3, 1993 (58 FR 64065), the Department published its proposed rule seeking public comments. After reviewing the comments, the Department developed this final rule, which is consistent with the consumer-oriented approach announced by the Secretary in the proposed rule. This final rule will:
