So as not to discourage companies from investing, fiscal policy must, above all, "dispel the fear" that the increase in the budget deficit will lead to a further taxation burden in either the short term or long term. Thus, at all state levels, there has to be a high degree of "savings and discipline regarding expenditure" to gradually reduce the state's share of GDP to the same level as in the period before unification by the year 2000. The government advises the partners to wage agreements to show "moderation" and has stressed its intentions of achieving a wage freeze in negotiations with public sector employees. In the old laender, a drop in real incomes will have to be accepted to improve employment opportunities. An increase in productivity should only lead to an increase in real incomes when a high level of employment has been achieved once again. In the new laender, it should be borne in mind that economic performance will only reach western German levels over a longer period of time. A strategy of catching up in economic terms so that incomes reach western levels will "increasingly be an obstacle to more investment and employment." Wage policy cannot bear the entire burden for the process of economic adjustment in eastern Germany. It is, however, "imperative and reasonable" for wage policy to contribute to closing the gap between wage levels and enterprise performance. The government regrets that in western Germany and above all in eastern Germany, wage policy currently does not take sufficient account of the differences in economic performance in terms of sectors and companies. There is much to be said for "new directions" in wage policy. So, for example, more freedom for companies and plants would provide a meaningful stimulus for "more wage policy creativity." Profit sharing could also reduce the burden on wages. The partners to collective agreements should consider the possibility of concluding agreements covering several years to a greater extent than has been the case until now. Agreements could, for example, be reached guaranteeing a share of profits if earnings develop favorably. Finally, the Federal Government is calling on the partners to wage agreements to make working hours more flexible to reduce company costs and to better satisfy the individual wishes and needs of employees and those seeking work. The new labor law will thus increase what room for maneuver there is. More flexibility in working hours should not, however, be a burden on the Federal Office of Employment.
