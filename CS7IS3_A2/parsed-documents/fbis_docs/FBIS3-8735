Hence, we can offer you the following interviews. [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] The parties that formed the opposition so far, presented [the president] with the name of a new prime minister to be authorized to form the new Slovak government. This proposed prime minister, approved by the president as well, is Jozef Moravcik. [Unidentified correspondent] Did the opposition parties propose candidates for ministerial posts as well? [Official] This was not the topic of the talks. According to the information given by the hitherto opposition parties, the names for individual posts are more or less known [to the opposition parties]. However, this [list of names] will be fine-tuned. There is a chance that the names for individual ministerial posts will be announced by Wednesday [16 March].

The Center Bloc, as I called it this afternoon--i.e., the Alliance of Democrats, the National Democratic Club, and another independent club, headed by Mr. Bajan--will also present seven names. The Christian Democratic Movement will present five names. [Correspondent] How many deputy prime ministers will there be? [Unidentified official] It is expected that there will be three deputy prime ministers. One deputy prime minister will be in charge of the economy. There will be another deputy prime minister for the so-called superstructure or ministries of the nonproductive sphere, and a deputy prime minister for legislative matters.
