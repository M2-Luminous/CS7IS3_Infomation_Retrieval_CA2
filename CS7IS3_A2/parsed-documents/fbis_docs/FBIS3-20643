And Arco's Yacheng 13-1 operation, the largest offshore gasfield in China, is scheduled to go onstream in January 1996, the company announced. Arco experts have spent the last few months surveying Chinese onshore oil and gas fields in Daqing, Liaohe, Dagang, Sichuan and Shengli. "We are looking at many opportunities for onshore oil operations," said John Knepler, vice-president of the Shekon-based Arco China Incorporate. "But we have to decide which ones we believe are economic to pursue," he said. The Yacheng field will supply natural gas through pipelines to Hong Kong and Hainan Island. The gas will feed electric power plants and a fertilizer factory. "By the year 2002 the Yacheng Gasfield will be producing 9.3 million cubic metres each day, and we will have recovered our investment," the 48-year-old vice-president said. The gasfield, with reserves of 100 billion cubic metres, was discovered by Arco, with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and the Santa Fe Energy Corporation in 1983. At present, Arco is focusing its efforts on getting partners for oil and gas exploration and development in China. The average worldwide exploration success rate for 1987 to 1992 was only 6 percent. "We know that exploration work is very risky and that is why the successes must pay for the failures or we would go out of business," said Knepler. Arco is bullish on the prospects of finding large quantities of oil and gas both onshore and offshore, he said. Arco, which came to China in 1979, is regarded as one of the lucky foreign oil firms which have so far operated successfully in China. Arco is the eighth largest non-governmental oil operator in the world.
