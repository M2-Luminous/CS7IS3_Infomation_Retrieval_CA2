FBIS4-37525 "drnes120_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 SYRIA Radio Stresses Just, Not `Hurried' Peace Radio Stresses Just, Not `Hurried' Peace JN2006142694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1130 GMT 20 Jun 94 JN2006142694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: These days, Israeli officials are stepping up their statements on the peace process and are urging Syria to speed up the peace talks before the U.S. administration halts its efforts to push the talks forward due to its numerous other international preoccupations. What is strange in these statements is that Israel is speaking for the United States and its officials in order to put pressure on Syria on behalf of the United States. Has President Clinton's administration authorized Israeli officials to speak for it about the peace process, or are the Tel Aviv rulers trying to hint that time is moving quickly and that Syria should catch the train of unilateral deals to bring about peace before it misses both the train and the fruits of these deals? Speaking about Warren Christopher's time limits, Itamar Rabinovich, Israeli ambassador in Washington and head of the Israeli negotiating team with Syria, has warned that everyone should know that the opportunity is limited. Ambassador Rabinovich's statement is not the first nor the last of its kind. Israeli officials make proposals every day that have nothing to do with the bases of the peace process. Sometimes they demand that the level of the talks be promoted and at other times they declare that they want to know the nature of the peace Syria will give to them or they allege Syria is not serious in its talk about peace. In all cases, however, they stress they will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, although they have voiced their readiness to carry out some kind of withdrawal from the Golan Heights--a withdrawal that will not end the Israeli occupation or return the rights and the land to their rightful owners. Its threats that the opportunity is limited and that time is short shows the true Israeli positions and the nature of Israel's intentions. The Israeli officials, who have wasted a great deal of time in futile talks over more than two and half years, are trying to use the same weapon of time against Syria to embarrass it in the international arena and portray it as the side that is hampering the peace process. These officials are mistaken if they believe that such attempts may succeed in making Syria enter into the trap of unilateral deals, as they succeeded with some sides, in order not to appear as an obstacle on the way to peace. These attempts will not affect Syria's known position and cannot mislead the world public opinion, which knows the true situation in the region, as well those who are placing obstacles on the way to peace. Syria has always asserted that it is a peace-loving state. The whole world, led by the U.S. and the American sponsors of the peace process, also knows this fact. Syria's desire to establish peace does not mean it will accept unilateral deals or secret talks because of the time limit. Such deals have weakened the momentum of the peace process and lessened prospects of bringing about a just and comprehensive peace that can stand fast in the face of changes and meet the aspirations of the region's peoples and the world. It is true that Syria wants peace, but it is also true that it is not in a hurry. The peace that Syria seeks is based on two principles: Justice and comprehensiveness in accordance with relevant UN resolutions--a peace that can restore the land and the rights regardless of time. What is important is the achievement of that peace. Syria is not responsible for hampering the peace march and wasting time. The whole world is well aware of who is responsible for that. A desire for peace can never mean embarking on the first train carrying that word. First, we have to make sure that the train is on the right railway. Otherwise, the peace train will not move, and even if it moves, it will not reach its target.
