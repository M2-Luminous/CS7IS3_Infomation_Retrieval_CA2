Lesny is an under secretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and the head of the Polish negotiating mission. He made this declaration following his return from the Prague meeting of the Joint Committee of CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement signed on 21 December 1992 in Krakow by the Czech Republic, the Polish Republic, the Slovak Republic, and the Hungarian Republic). Under that agreement, a free trade zone is to be established among these countries by 1998. "An understanding to hasten the liberalization of trade among Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary will be reached by the end of April or the beginning of May of this year," Minister Lesny emphasized. The gradual abolition of tariffs among the member countries of CEFTA, which represents a market of 65 million consumers, is intended to increase mutual trade, whose volume at present does not exceed $1 billion. Accordingly, the Prague meeting resolved to reduce by one-third the duties on industrial goods as early as on 1 July 1994. This is in the spirit of the provisions of the CEFTA agreement. Unlike the agreements with the EC and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], the Central European agreement is based on the principle of equivalence and reciprocal advantages, meaning that all of the parties are to benefit equally from liberalized trade terms. The agreement between Poland and its southern neighbor states reflects a compromise reached in the course of long and often dramatic negotiations. The main points of contention concerned the tariff abolition timetables and the division of manufactured goods into three groups among our countries, with separate duty-slashing schedules for each of these groups. Relatively speaking, the boldest attitude in this matter was represented, as the deputy minister explained, by Czechoslovakia, which has been levying customs duties of as little as several percent since 1991. In its turn, the position of Hungary, which has also been applying relatively low (though higher than the Czechoslovak) duty rates, was dictated by the desire to match these rates to those specified in its agreements with the EC and EFTA, which provide for completing the Hungarian reductions of duty rates by 1 January 2001. To Poland, which has during these negotiations been levying the highest duty rates among CEFTA members, an earlier date was acceptable because, as is known, duties on manufactured goods deriving from the EC and EFTA will be, with a few exceptions, abolished by 1 January 1999. In effect, duties on the first group of merchandise, the so-called List A, were to be immediately abolished on the effective date of the agreement--that is, as of 1 May 1993. In general, that group comprises relatively unprocessed goods (among other things, raw materials and semifinished products). As a result, and owing to the even earlier applicable zero duty rates, approximately 50-60 percent of Polish exports to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary are duty-exempt. As for the second group of merchandise, the so-called List B, which comprises goods of medium susceptibility [to foreign competition], the related duties will be reduced in three equal installments of one-third each during the period between 1 January 1995 and 1 January 1997. The so-called List C includes goods most susceptible to foreign competition, such as textile, metal, automotive, electronic, and similar products. The related duties will be reduced to zero in seven installments during the period from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 2001. The CEFTA member countries also pledged themselves to gradually abolish the existing nontariff restraints on trade (such as concessions, import quotas, import and export prohibitions) and to refrain from introducing any new such restraints in mutual trade. The problem of farm products received special treatment under CEFTA. No member country was prepared to fully open its agricultural and food market, and, hence, liberalization in that domain extended to only a few commodities, mostly in quantitative terms. In the case of agricultural products, the existing regulations remain binding, and new ones, protecting against foreign competition, may be introduced. The text of CEFTA also provides for a gradual attainment of world standards (developed under GATT) by the parties thereto upon employing economic instruments distorting [as published] free competition in world trade. This concerns, among other things, nondiscriminating domestic taxation, policy on state monopolies, rules of competition and governmental economic aid to enterprises, manufacturing orders, and antidumping measures. Strictly speaking, CEFTA is not an integrative agreement to create an organization similar to that of the European Community, the European Union [EU], or EFTA. It does not provide for permanent bodies such as the EU Commission or the EFTA Secretariat. This approach is dictated by the idea that an excessive institutionalization of economic cooperation may engender a mistaken belief in the political and economic self-sufficiency of the countries of Central Europe. The more than a year that has passed since the provisions of CEFTA began to be implemented is, in the opinion of experts, too short a period to assess in detail its effect on the structure and volume of trade. But it can be stated that, even now, our country is deriving measurable advantages: In 1993, its balance of trade with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary was positive. Although these countries, taken together, account for merely 7-8 percent of our foreign trade, they rank among the 10 biggest Polish trade partners. Even as CEFTA was being signed, the signatories provided for the possibility of modifying its provisions. Their concurrently signed joint political declaration of 21 December 1992 mentions the desire to hasten and broaden the liberalization of trade beyond the terms of the original agreement. Since last March, the partners have been discussing revisions of reciprocal concessions that will probably result, after 1 January 1998, in abolishing a definite majority of duties on manufactured goods as well as in marked reductions of duties on and increases in quotas for farm products. Moreover, during the negotiations in Prague, it was decided to advance to 1 July 1994 from 1 January 1995 the commencement of the abolition of duties. Merchandise on List A will become nondutiable as early as at the beginning of next year. The duty rates on merchandise on List B will be reduced in three stages: on 1 July 1994, on 1 January 1996, and on 1 January 1997. Trade in susceptible [to foreign competition] merchandise (metal products, textiles, some chemicals) will be liberalized in four stages. The text of CEFTA allows its signatories to conclude agreements on free trade with other countries, as well. According to Minister Lesny, such agreements are to be concluded [between Poland and] Turkey, Romania, and Israel. Negotiations with the Baltic republics are also under way. For the time being, a highly liberalized flow of goods and capital is to be possible within the next year or so among the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. This should contribute to a more rapid integration with the West European economic system and accelerate our membership in the EC and the EU.
