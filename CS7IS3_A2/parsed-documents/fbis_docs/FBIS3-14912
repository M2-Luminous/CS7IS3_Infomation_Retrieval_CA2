The conversation with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was held behind closed doors. However, it is known that they concerned the new peace-making initiative of Russia, which once again is trying to stop the bloodshed in Nagorno-Karabakh. The representatives of the Russian leadership also met Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik Sarkisyan and the Armenian president's special envoy David Shakhnazaryan. As the Armenian president's press service has reported, during the course of the meetings the Armenian side reaffirmed that Yerevan is ready to assume all its commitments arising from the Moscow protocol. The conflict has reached a phase where a settlement is impossible without the introduction of separating forces, the participants in the conversation at the Armenian president's office stated. As reported earlier, at the recent meeting in Moscow of the Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers with the participation of a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, and with the mediation of the Russian defense minister, it was proposed to the conflicting sides that there should be a cease-fire and an end to hostilities from 0000 on 1 March, and also that troops should be withdrawn from the confrontation line. These points were sealed in the protocol that was signed. Russia has done everything in its power, Georgiy Kondratyev told journalists. "We intended to visit Stepanakert," said the general, "but bad weather prevented us from going. The Armenian side was quite constructive and had no questions." According to the deputy minister, "if the Azerbaijan side does not respond to this initiative, Russia will suspend its mediatory mission." A cease-fire is awaited in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan and if all sides agree, a mechanism to implement a cease-fire, worked out by heads of the military directorates at a Moscow meeting, could be set in motion, Georgiy Kondratyev said. The general expressed certainty that the agreements will be respected by both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. "It is essential," he said, "that Azerbaijan adopts a similar decision." This evening, after the meetings in Yerevan, the representatives of the Russian president went to Baku.
