At the inauguration of the El Vocho Industrial Park in San Lorenzo Almecatla, the chief executive added that this agreement will considerably decrease the outflow of workers from Mexico to the United States and Canada. Workers will no longer have to migrate to places that offer employment, because new opportunities are opening up in the country, Salinas said. On the second day of a tour focusing on the electricity issue, the president added that foreign investment in this industrial zone during the first four months of 1994 was higher than in 1992 and 1993: "This means more jobs and greater possibilities of competing in the industrial area in other markets." He inaugurated the San Lazaro Almecatla Power Substation and symbolically inaugurated five other substations and five transmission lines. The president of the Republic said that in the past six years the electric sector increased its production capacity by more than 35 percent. In the company of Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of energy, mines, and parastatal industry; Carlos Rojas, secretary of social development; and Guillermo Guerrero Villalobos, director of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), Salinas added that during his administration 21 million new Mexicans have received electric services and that 10 rural communities are being incorporated into the system each day. He said that without sufficient electric energy the country would not have been able to establish such bases for additional economic growth "as the ones that we can now expect to have in Mexico." Eduardo Arreola Valdes, CFE deputy director for programming, said that 5,763 km of high-tension transmission lines have been put into service and that 53 power substation have been built during the 1989-1994 period. This, he added, represents increases of 20.7 and 25.9 percent, respectively, compared to the facilities that existed at the start of this six-year term. President Salinas also inaugurated the President Plutarco Elias Calles thermoelectric plant in La Union, Guerrero State. There he said that 95 percent of Mexicans have electric energy. He pointed out that this thermoelectric plant is the largest of its kind in Latin America. He said that 7.5 billion new pesos were invested in this plant, which will use fuel or coal, depending on the best operational conditions. Salinas added that once the construction of this plant, which was started during this six-year term, is concluded, it will contribute to the national electric system more than 10 percent of the country's total capacity. Secretary Emilio Lozoya Thalmann said during this ceremony that production capacity increased by 8,306 megawatts during the 1989-1994 period, from 23,554 to 31,860 megawatts, that is, a 35 percent increase. In addition, works that were started during this period will add 3,766 megawatts and will be operational between 1995 and 1997. Lozoya added that recent estimates indicate that about 8,000 megawatts need to be added to the current electric production generation capacity within the next 11 years. This, he said, requires significant financing that calls for private involvement in the production of electric energy without implying that the state will abandon its constitutional responsibility for providing this public service.
