This could result in the dissolution of parliament and imposition of presidential rule. According to the TURAN agency, recently Geydar Aliyev held a closed conference where it was decided to clamp down on the opposition. The reprisals were prompted by criticism of plans for a Karabakh settlement based on Russian proposals (providing for the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict zone). It is not ruled out that Aliyev will also dissolve the National Assembly. The day before yesterday Panakh Shakhsevenli, leader of the National Liberation Party, was arrested. The Baku police have dispersed several rallies in the past few days while "letters from workers" have inundated Azerbaijan newspapers, demanding that "things be put in order." For instance, 940 refugees from Lachin wrote in AZERBAIJAN: "The riff-raff from the National Front are preventing you (Aliyev -- KOMMERSANT-DAILY) from restoring peace. Comrade Aliyev, the sooner you stifle them, the better. We are ready to come to Baku and hang them in a central square." Parliamentary opposition members have already felt that something was wrong: On pain of forced rotation, 17 deputies who walked out of the National Assembly in protest against the "treacherous agreement on Karabakh," returned to the chamber. Yet all of this does not mean that Aliyev himself accepts the Russian plan: He stands by his phrase pronounced on 19 May, "Russian troops will never return to Azerbaijan." In this, incidentally, Aliyev is also supported by the United States. The day before yesterday the State Department said that the efforts by the Minsk CSCE group (its plan proposes peace-keeping operations only under UN and CSCE auspices) is the path that will lead to a durable settlement of the conflict. Friction over Russian troops could be augmented by oil disagreements. On 23 May Aliyev received representatives of the oil consortium (British Petroleum, Statoil, Amoco, Pennsoil, Remco, Macdermott, Turkish Petrol, and Lukoil) and told them that some minor details have to be coordinated before signing the contract. He also let drop this phrase (cited according to the TURAN report): "As for the status of the Caspian, the sector which is being developed by the republic refers to Azerbaijan." Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry long ago sent a letter to the British Foreign Office (the British BP company plays a leading role in the consortium), recalling that under the Soviet-Iranian agreements on the state border, all the Caspian resources in the USSR territorial waters were Soviet property. In the Russian Foreign Ministry's interpretation, after the disintegration of the Union the resources beyond the 12-mile zone should be regarded as the "common property of the Caspian states." This is reason enough for Moscow's close attention to the oil talks.
