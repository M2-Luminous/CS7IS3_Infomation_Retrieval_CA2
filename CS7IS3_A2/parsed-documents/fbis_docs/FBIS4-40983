Japanese naval sources quoted by KYODO news agency today believe that this is connected with the increased tension over the DPRK's nuclear program and the belief that Pyongyang is striving to create its own nuclear weapons. The reason for the increased activity of U.S. nuclear submarines is the intensification of the U.S. Navy's intelligence operations around North Korea. The nuclear submarines are cruising along the DPRK coastline, picking up information about the communications networks of the North Korean armed forces and intercepting all kinds of radio messages. The largest number of visits were to the U.S. naval base of White Beach on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Submarines called there 17 times. Moreover, U.S. nuclear submarines were also frequent "guests" at the docks of Sasebo (Nagasaki Prefecture) and Yokosuka (Kanagawa Prefecture) naval bases.
