In any case, in the EU the principle of unanimity governed complex matters, and the qualified majority vote was decisive for issues concerning the internal market, Kinkel told the DDP/ADN news agency in Nuremberg. Moreover, the EU foreign ministers had undertaken to reexamine the whole procedure, which has now been decided, in 1996. It had at any rate been right not to let the accession of the Scandinavian countries and Austria collapse over this matter, Kinkel said. Kinkel rejected criticism from the CSU [Christian Social Union]-led Bavarian Government to the effect that German interests were not being represented at national and international level as matter of factly as other countries. In view of its past, Germany was being "viewed critically" as a reunited country, Kinkel said. However, there was "no reason to slink around on velvet paws." Germany had so far done well out of its "policy of restraint."
