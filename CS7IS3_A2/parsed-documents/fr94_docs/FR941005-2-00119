This is a notice to inform the public that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering issuance of an amendment to Source Material License No. SUB&hyph;1010, issued to Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, at the Sequoyah Facility, Gore, Oklahoma. The licensee requested the amendment in a letter dated September 2, 1994, to remove the requirement for a contingency plan because an evaluation performed by the licensee has shown that the conditions set forth in 10 CFR 40.31(j)(l)(i) can be met. The license amendment request is based on the analysis conducted by SAIC to demonstrate compliance with Section 40.31(j)(l)i). The NRC hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a license amendment falling within the scope of Subpart L, ``Informal Hearing Procedures for Adjudications in Materials Licensing Proceedings,'' of the NRC's rules of practice for domestic licensing proceedings in 10 CFR Part 2 (54 FR 8269). Pursuant to ยง2.1205(a), any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding may file a request for a hearing in accordance with ยง2.1205(c). A request for a hearing must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of this Federal Register notice. The request for a hearing must be filed with the Office of the Secretary either: (1) By delivering to the Docketing and Service Branch of the Office of the Secretary at One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852; or (2) By mail or telegram addressed to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. In addition to meeting other applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 2 of the NRC's regulations, a request for a hearing filed by a person other than an applicant must describe in detail: (1) The interest of the requestor in the proceeding: (2) How that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding, including the reasons why the requestor should be permitted a hearing, with particular reference to the factors set out in ยง2.1205(g); (3) The requestor's areas of concern about the licensing activity that is the subject matter of the proceeding; and (4) The circumstances establishing that the request for a hearing is timely in accordance with ยง2.1205(c). Each request for a hearing must also be served, by delivering it personally or by mail, to: (1) The applicant, Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, to the attention of Mr. John H. Ellis, President, P.O. Box 610, Gore, OK 74435; and (2) The NRC staff, by delivery to the Executive Director for Operations, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852, or by mail addressed to the Executive Director for Operations, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Any hearing that is requested and granted will be held in accordance with the NRC's ``Informal Hearing Procedures for Adjudications in Material Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2, subpart L.
