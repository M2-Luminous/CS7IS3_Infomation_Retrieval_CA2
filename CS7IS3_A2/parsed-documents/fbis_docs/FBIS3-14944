In an opening speech, Yakovlev said he thought that the main idea of the president's message to parliament was a commitment to build a democratic society in Russia in democratic ways in keeping with the country's constitution and laws. For his part, Satarov said the new constitution marked an end to the stage of building democracy from "above". He described Russia's democracy as rather fragile adding it needed internal stability to survive. The aide described as fundamental those aspects of Yeltsin's address. Both officials agreed that Russia was still in need of coordinated legislation to ensure internal stability under its multi-party democracy. "The system tends to become a destabilizing factor when the number of parties exceeds five", Satarov said. And he called for the creation of such parties which could reflect real public mood and opinion. Satarov pointed to the message's section saying part of government functions must be devolved to the public. The Duma's Saturday resolution on amnesty for October uprising leaders dominated the agenda. Yakovlev said the society was tired of political squabbles. In his view, many of the deputies voted for amnesty driven by a sincere desire for civic peace. He said it would not be long before it became clear whether the resolution was aimed at national reconciliation or confrontational attitudes. On the possibility of the amnesty being withdrawn, Satarov said the rebellion leaders could be jailed again only Interfax they were in breach of law. [sentence as received] "Such is the president's belief", he added. The aide described as crazy the suggestion from one of the journalists saying the president could try to overturn the amnesty resolution by force. One other aide, Yuriy Baturin, who was 45 minutes late for the briefing because of a routine meeting with Yeltsin said: "Our society is in need of an amnesty law. Without such an act, it will be hard to envisage steps for minimizing the negative implications of the Duma's amnesty resolution". Baturin reaffirmed having discussed this with Yeltsin. But declined to comment on the meeting though not ruling out the possibility of Yeltsin appearing on appear on national television on Monday. Baturin described the continuing split in the democratic camp as by far the greatest danger for Russia's fledgling democracy. "We must overcome it. I hope we will, otherwise there can be no democratic society," he said. A presidential message listing priority bills, scheduled to be submitted to the Duma this Monday, will not be sent to the lower house of the Russian parliament for at least two or three days. Georgy Satarov, president's assistant, told Interfax Monday that "the State Duma forced us to attend to other business," meaning the presidential team's attempt to have the release of those amnestied by the Duma put off. According to Satarov, those attempts were not dictated by the desire to safeguard the president from a comeback by his political opponents. Rather, the goals of Yeltsin's messages to the prosecutor general and the State Duma were to align the amnesty with the law and minimize the harm it might do. Satarov did not agree with the view that the presidential team had been passive while the Duma had debated and later adopted the amnesty resolution. He said that he had proposed to the State Duma Council on February 22 that the issue should not have been discussed before the annual presidential message was heard. Satarov emphasized that the lower house of parliament was best placed to prevent a new increase of political tension in the country. He said that he had been assured by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin that the parliament's leaders were aware of this responsibility.
