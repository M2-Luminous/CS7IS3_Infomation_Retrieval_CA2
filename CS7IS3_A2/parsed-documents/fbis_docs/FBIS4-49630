FBIS4-49630 "drchi089_v_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 TAIWAN NAA Official on Membership in International Groups NAA Official on Membership in International Groups OW0705111794 Taipei CNA in English 0704 GMT 7 May 94 OW0705111794 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Debbie Kuo] [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Loic Bouvard, chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), said here Friday [6 May] that the Republic of China has made exceptional achievements in economic development ad political reform during the past years, paving the way for Taiwan's re-entry into international organizations. Bouvard, who led a five-member NAA delegation to visit Taipei recently, said at a news conference before his departure that the NAA, an affiliated forum of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), supports the Republic of China's [ROC] bid to join the United Nations, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other world organizations. The NAA chairman, who is also vice president of the National Assembly of France, singled out Taiwan's efforts in removing trade barriers as "commendable," and its economic performance "enviable." Bouvard said he would be pleased to let Taiwan into the Brussels- based forum as an observer. Japan and Australia are also observers in the organization. Jose Lello, a parliamentarian from Portugal, gave a positive account of Taiwan's protection of human rights and speech freedoms, saying that Mainland China lags far behind Taiwan in these two areas. Taiwan's achievement in upholding human rights and speech freedoms will be salutary factors supporting the island's bid to join the international community, including the UN, GATT, and the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarian Forum, Lello maintained. The NAA parliamentarians concluded their six-day visit in Taiwan and left Saturday. During their stay, the delegation met with ROC Government officials, lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties, civic leaders and scholars. Other members of the delegation included Peter Corterier, NAA secretary-general and vice foreign minister of the former West Germany; Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a polish parliamentarian; and Anders Sjaastad, a Norwegian lawmaker.
