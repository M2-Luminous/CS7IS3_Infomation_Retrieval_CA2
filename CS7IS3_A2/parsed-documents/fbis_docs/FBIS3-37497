It says: In recent days Russia has made additional efforts to give effect to its initiative on getting the blockade of Sarajevo removed and having the city handed over to the control of the UN. That initiative was put forward back at the 47th session of the General Assembly. We have been striving to implement this initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security Council resolutions. This line is being continued by us also at the present time despite the grave exacerbation of the situation around Sarajevo for well-known reasons. As a result of the steps undertaken by the Russian leadership and intense diplomatic work, this sustained and consistent line which rules out unilateral ultimatums has borne fruit. In response to our appeal, the Bosnian Serbs at their assembly in Pale have taken a decision to withdraw their heavy armaments from the vicinity of Sarajevo. We consider that this display of goodwill by one of the warring sides at a critical moment for a settlement will produce equally specific steps in return. We call on the Bosnia Government without delay to place all its heavy armaments in the vicinity of Sarajevo under the control of the UN forces in accordance with the secretary general's plan, which he proposed in his letter of 10 February to the Security Council. We also call on our partners in a Bosnian settlement, primarily the United States and the countries of the European Union, in the spirit of their statements on a preference for a political solution to the problem, to bring the necessary influence to bear on the Bosnian Government in order that it should cooperate with the UN as regards the total lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and its demilitarization. At this crucial moment, it is extremely important to exclude the likelihood of any provocations and sabotage of this peace process. On this depends the fate not only of Sarajevo, but of the whole Bosnian settlement as well. Once the siege of Sarajevo is lifted, the UN Security Council could, as we have suggested, proceed, as a matter of urgency, to examine ways of establishing a UN administrative directorate in the city, and also to examine measures to reinforce other dangerous areas on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Increasing its concrete contribution towards ensuring a turn towards peace, Russia is ready to send a part of its military contingent, which is within the UN forces, to ensure verification of the implementation of the understandings on the lifting of the Sarajevo siege.
