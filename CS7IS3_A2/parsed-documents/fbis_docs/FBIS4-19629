In his eulogy for the victims of the terrible act of arson in Solingen on 3 June 1993, President von Weizsaecker correctly described German-Turkish relations as friendship between peoples. This friendship has a long and exemplary tradition. It is an important commodity for us, in foreign policy terms and in human terms. The Federal Government has a firm desire to care for this commodity also in difficult times. Close cooperation with Turkey is no special interest of Germany's. Rather, it is a common objective of NATO and the European Union [EU]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the transformations in Central and East Europe, Turkey has gained even greater significance as a bridgehead between Europe and Asia and as a stabilizing factor within the Muslim world, and it requires solidarity particularly now. Prime Minister Ciller has just announced an economic stabilization program that calls for harsh measures and sacrifices. At the same time, the country is being put to the test by the strengthening of Islam. The Iraqi Kurd leader Talabani, with whom I am due to hold talks this evening, has just said that he considers the "growing fundamentalism" in Turkey "a common threat both to the Kurds and to the Turkish Government." But, Ladies and Gentlemen, friendly relations, such as the ones we maintain vis-a-vis Turkey, also involve the need for each side to inform the other side as friend and partner about any problems that exist. In this context, it must be said that the situation with human rights and that of the Kurdish population in Turkey is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the situation has deteriorated. The EU admitted the same thing in a 31 March 1994 declaration on the subject of human rights in Turkey. This declaration was brought on by lifting parliamentary immunity and arresting Kurdish deputies in the Turkish Parliament at the beginning of March. Immediately after receiving confirmation of the first reports on this subject, the Federal Government pointed out that measures against freely elected members of the Turkish Parliament create the impression that the voice of the Kurdish population in Turkey is being suppressed. Both bilaterally and on an EU level, we have expressed our expectations that the Kurdish deputies will be permitted to avail themselves of their constitutional rights. In this connection, the Federal Government trusts in the impartiality of Turkish justice. Together with Douglas Hurd, my British colleague, on 20 January I held a frank discussion with my colleague Cetin, who is himself a Kurd, and with whom I happen to have been in touch over the past few days, and still am. A recurrent subject of our talks is the situation with the Christians and Yezidis, torture during police custody, and restrictions on the freedom of speech and opinion. So that there are no misunderstandings, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Federal Government naturally considers combating the terrorist Kurdish Workers Party to be legitimate. But even combating terrorism must adhere to the framework of the rule of law and the norms of human rights that Turkey has also recognized. The Federal Government believes, and we have said so again and again in our talks, that the Kurdish issue, which is a problem not only in Turkey, can only be resolved by peaceful means and in mutual agreement between the Turkish Government and the Kurds. Such a solution must respect and guarantee the cultural identity of the Kurdish population.
