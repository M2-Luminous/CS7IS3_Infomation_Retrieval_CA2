Is it true that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will visit Lebanon? [Buwayz] The latest round of [Arab-Israeli] negotiations, undoubtedly, was somewhat deadlocked. Mr. Christopher's upcoming visit to the region is supposed to get things going by securing some points to encourage the resumption of the negotiations. Anyway, I believe that progress on the Palestinian track would push forward the other topics on the agenda of the negotiations. [Correspondent] Will Lebanon demand that Christopher visit it within his tour? [Buwayz] We do not demand; we welcome anyone who visits Lebanon or deals with it as it should be dealt with. [Correspondent] How do you explain what was achieved between the Palestinians and the Israelis in Cairo today? Does this mean the beginning of progress on the Gaza-Jericho track? [Buwayz] The Gaza-Jericho agreement, naturally, had some weak points. Any action that will in one way or another fill this vacuum and satisfy the Palestinians will be welcome. So far, I believe that only the incorporation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement into a comprehensive peace process can cover this agreement in the best way. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, how is Lebanese diplomacy handling the current Israeli acts of aggression against the south? [Buwayz] Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of crisis for a long time. This crisis has not at any point stopped progress in the Middle East talks. Just as Israel did not stop its repeated aggressions, Lebanon conceded neither its right to confront and resist the aggression nor its right to use all political and diplomatic means to confront it. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, as regards media, the public is under the impression that it should (?wait), and the Chamber of Deputies was inclined to ask the government to suspend its decision [on banning news programs on private radios] until the media law is issued. What do you think? [Buwayz] I clearly and realistically believe that it is necessary to think of democracy and freedom on one hand, and security and stability on the other, and take the requirements of both into consideration. Talking about returning the media to the old situation; that is, the return of more than 50 television stations and more than 100 radio stations is impossible for any country, no matter how much democracy and freedom it has, to tolerate and accept. But I also believe that talking about one official station and closing the door to the development of media -- and they actually have developed over the past 20 years -- when a number of Stalinist countries have renounced Stalinism, may be wrong. We need to lay down a framework to reshuffle all these broadcasting stations so that we can find a number acceptable to Lebanon's security and order and satisfying the Lebanese people's ambitions for democracy and freedom. I believe that four or five television stations and four or five radio stations -- controlled by the valid laws on sectarian sedition, insults to Lebanese or foreign officials, and provocation of the sentiments of the public -- may be a realistic solution that reconciles Lebanon's democracy, which has always been an integral part of the Lebanese situation and entity, and security requirements. We cannot ignore the fact that Lebanon is living on a sensitive Middle East volcano and cannot tolerate disorder, which no democratic country allows.
