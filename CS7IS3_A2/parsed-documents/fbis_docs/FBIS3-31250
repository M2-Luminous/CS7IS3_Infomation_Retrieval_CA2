A commission for missing persons and humanitarian issues was formally and legally constituted and it would work under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] and the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. The commission has eight members--three each from Yugoslavia and from Croatia and one each from the ICRC and the UNHCR. Simic also said that all details in connection with the opening of offices in Belgrade and Zagreb were agreed and that they would be opened, most likely at the end of this or at the beginning of next month. [passage omitted] Simic said that his talks with Croatian President Tudjman were successful, pointing out that the Croatian president showed that he was very interested in the normalization of relations with Yugoslavia. Simic also said that after these talks he was even more convinced that meetings at the highest level were, he said, "more than realistic." Asked whether the status of the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] was discussed, Simic said that the Yugoslav standpoints were clear but not so inflexible that they could prevent a normalization of relations. The issue of Krajina is very sensitive but the RSK is a political reality and must be respected, Simic stressed, and went on to say that the current situation did not suit Zagreb but an aggressive resolution of the situation would suit Zagreb even less.
