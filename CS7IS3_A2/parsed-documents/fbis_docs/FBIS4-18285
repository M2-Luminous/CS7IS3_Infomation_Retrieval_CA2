Given the election schedule, this decision does not really commit the current authorities in that no financing is needed in 1995. A few hundred million French francs [Fr] will, however, be assigned to defining the aircraft's specifications in 1996, with development planned in the second half of the period covered by the law. The aim of this move is to profit from the time lapse to reduce the specifications as far as possible and thus reduce the cost of the aircraft, and then to launch the program as part of a Franco-German cooperation project within the scope of the Airbus consortium. In this way, they hope to attract the participation of Britain, which needs 60 such aircraft. This project was agreed on in principle last weekend in Berlin by General Arms Delegate Henri Conze and the head of the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff, Jacques Lanxade, at a meeting with their German counterparts, Joerg Schoenbohm and Klaus Naumann. They are also said to have come to an agreement on lowering the cost of the NH-90 European helicopter and, above all, on initiating a process of closer Franco-German cooperation with regard to a European antimissile defense program. The launch of the FLA is considered by many French and German figures to be essential, starting with French Democratic Union-Republican Party [UDF-PR] deputy for the Var region, Arthur Paecht who, in a report published last February on the subject, argued that a large part of Europe's aeronautics sector depended on this aircraft being built. Moreover, it is no coincidence that the Airbus consortium is being considered to host the project. The aim is to feed the production chains that are running out of steam and draw maximum benefit from the experience built up in the civil domain in order to save on costly development work. The FLA is, in addition, one of the rare programs that make it possible to lay the foundations for a real project for Franco-German cooperation and, over and above that, to supply the joint agency set up by Henri Conze. While the cost of the aircraft will be minimal between 1995 and 2000, it may be likely to present a major financing problem at the turn of the century, when FLA production will clash with the delivery of and, above all, the payment for the Rafale fighter aircraft. The recent decision by Euroflag, the European consortium in charge of the project, to opt for a turboprop aircraft will scarcely contribute to reducing its cost. There is currently no suitable engine available "off the shelf," and Europe will have to begin development of a new program.
