Leite said that, if approved, the article would have caused "great damage to the military," whose salaries would have been frozen, without any increases up until 1995. In light of the pressure, the government and the parties yesterday excluded the measure from the amendment. Article 74 set forth that expenses for payment of public servants' salaries in 1994 and 1995, on a monthly basis, may not surpass the expenses incurred last year, plus monetary correction. The article added that if monthly personnel expenses surpass the level of spending of the same month in 1993, salary revisions, adjustments, or improvements -- that increase total expenses within each branch of government -- will be vetoed until the spending level is recovered. Leite said he sent a fax to 40 or 50 lawmakers asking that the article be rejected. The article was drawn up by PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Luiz Roberto Ponte. Leite explained that before sending the fax messages he consulted with President Itamar Franco. The chief of staff claimed that the article dealt with a matter that may not be included in temporary constitutional provisions. He said that the military pressure was "legitimate and democratic." Article 74 was approved by the Chamber subcommittee that studied the fiscal adjustment, and was included in the amendment that creates the Fund by PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Nelson Jobim, the coordinator of the constitutional revision. Ponte estimated that this year the government has to cut approximately $1 billion in salary expenses. The budget provided for $24 billion in salary expenses. After the cut, salary expenses would have stood at $23 billion. The government also agreed to exclude Article 75 of the amendment, which authorized the executive branch to unilaterally reduce the budget if revenues did not prove to be enough to cover expenses. This measure was considered as a safeguard of the stabilization program, because in practice it compelled the government to spend only what it could collect. "This article reduced the power of Congress," PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] Deputy for Sao Paulo Delfim Netto said. "The budget can be changed only through a law, and this is the essence of democracy," he added.
