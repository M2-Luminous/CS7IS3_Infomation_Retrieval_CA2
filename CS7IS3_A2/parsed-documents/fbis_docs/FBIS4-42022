According to former Prime Minister Kuchma, "for the past month, Ukraine's national television has been virtually transformed into daily air time of one presidential nominee -- Leonid Kravchuk." The ex-premier is particularly concerned over the fact that "the Central Election Committee pretends not to notice these irregularities and ignores gross violations of the election procedure reported by some foreign observers." With this in view, Kuchma urged the parliament presidium "to consider the issue of disregarding the election law by the State TV and Radio Company and other central mass media, as well as the political stand taken by the Central Election Committee." The former prime minister also lodged a protest with the Central Election Committee, demanding that resolute measures be immediately taken to implement the law on presidential elections, which provides for equal opportunities for candidates to carry out election campaign.
