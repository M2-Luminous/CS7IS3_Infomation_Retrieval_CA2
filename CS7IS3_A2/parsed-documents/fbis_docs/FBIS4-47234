Kirchev, member of the Uzbekistan Journalists Union, under rubric "Nature and the Economy": "More Precious Than Gold: or, How To Build Interrelationships Between the Branch That Extracts Precious Metals and the Environment"] [Text] World Money Is Being Extracted From the Depths of the Earth Gold. The first of the metals that were discovered by man. There is a film of mystery over this word. Possibly because, in the category of raw materials created by nature, it has occupied a special place. Nowhere else in the world has anyone found another product (with the same chemical and physical properties) that could be as suitable for the role of universal equivalent, as a single gauge of values. Incidentally, all this is well known. Our Republic during the Soviet era was in the second or third place in the Union with respect to the amount of the currency metal that was being extracted. That, to a rather large degree, determined our Republic's weight and role. Then independence came. And it brought with it new problems. It is well known that foreign investments can help to build an economically strong country.. We have political stability and civil peace. For a foreign investor these are very important factors. But he would prefer to invest his capital and provide credit if he is also given the guarantee that his capital is backed up by currency gold. Nature has bestowed on us abundant gold-bearing ore. "Uzbekistan occupies eighth place in the world with regard to the overall volume of gold production and fifth place with regard to production per capita of population," Republic President I. A. Karimov said in his statement at the 4th Session of the Forum-Fund International Economic Organization in Switzerland in June 1993. "Thirty deposits have been discovered in the country, and their total reserves exceed 4000 tons... The quality of Uzbek gold corresponds to the highest world standards and, over a 20-year period, no claims were made against it. During the past two years it has been awarded three international quality prizes." The extraction of gold and other precious and nonferrous metals is primarily a mining process. The ore specialists have been aided by science and by the technology with which Uzbekistan's mining industry has been abundantly equipped. The basis of the gold-mining branch is made up of the mines with shafts, quarries, and concentration plants. Their output is industrial concentrate with a large content of precious metals, from which high-grade gold and silver are produced at mining and metallurgical combines (Navoi and Almalyk). Happy Birthday, Association! After the well-known 21 January 1994 edict of the Republic president, the State Committee for Precious Metals became the Association for Mining Gold and Processing Diamonds. Its short name is Uzalmazzoloto. At a meeting of the founders in April, the chairman of the association's board was elected. That chairman is 46-year-old Shavkat Nazhimov, who previously headed the state committee. He began his career in the gold-mining industry as a foreman at a concentration plant. Our leading, strategic branches are managed by a firm state hand. Acting as the chief state instrument for management in the gold-mining industry are the fixed prices that are established for precious metals. The world price of one gram of gold today is U.S. $12. Sh. Nazhimov says, "The state pays us only part of this. We take an attentive attitude toward this temporarily enforced measure: times are difficult for the Republic and it is necessary to provide for the social program..." The higher administrative levels are considering the question of increasing the payment for the gold miners' output, but, as they themselves feel, the size of that payment must outstrip the inflation level. Otherwise it will be impossible to pay back the production expenses, or to replenish the mining capacities that are being depleted. Because the mining of precious metals must increase. Mining is the "eating up" of the mineral resources. It is active contact with the environment. It is no secret that in previous years we took the attitude toward the protection of the environment as being of secondary importance. Today the situation is changing. We have come to the realization that technology that is ecological tested or that is free of waste products (in almost every branch) means that that technology is also the most economical one in the final analysis. In the mining industry, destruction and waste products are unavoidable. If a ton of ore contains 3-5 grams of gold (and this is considered to be rather good content), then it is easy to imagine what mountains of ore have to be processed in order to extract from that ore hundreds of tons of the precious metal. Today science, technology, and the environmental protection services are struggling to resolve the problem of these tailings -- artificial mountains. A large amount of money is being expended. We shall discuss a little while later how this should be done from the start in the best way -- both for the environment and for the economy. Have you noticed that the association's name includes the word "diamond"? Didn't it surprise you to learn that we have this valuable stone here, although its homeland is the Urals and Yakutia? This "raw material" for the manufacture of diamonds is delivered to the Almaz Plant in Burchmulla by the Russian Committee for Precious Metals. The hands of the local expert craftspeople who at one time studied at related enterprises manufacture two types of precious stones -- 17-faceted and 57-faceted diamonds. The finished articles -- and the largest weigh as much as one carat, 0.2 grams -- are sent back to where the raw material came from. Plant director Rustoy Ziyavidinov discusses his people very warmly: "These expert craftspeople with astonishing hands love their work very much." First the diamonds go to the markers and cutters. It is necessary to discern in the small shining stone a future diamond, and to "design" it correctly. Subsequently they go to the grinders and polishers. It is delicate work. The work ends with the facet-cutter. There is also a shop for processing fianity --semiprecious stones from the Urals. In addition, the plant manufactures gold-plated teaspoons, engagement rings, sewn garments, sets of kitchen knives... The shops at the Almaz Plant have been set up in the repaired facilities of the former mining and concentration combine which, during the war years and subsequently, used to mine arsenic. Tailings that have accumulated are also situated on the territory of the form bismuth Ustasaray Mine. There are a lot of tailings. For a long time ecologists have been demanding that they be carefully buried and rendered harmless, inasmuch as the poisonous substances are located on slopes above the Charvak Reservoir. Both the plant and association administrators understand the seriousness of this problem and intend to resolve it by the end of the current year. The past frequently looks at us with loathsome ecological sores. They were created by us. And we are also the ones who should heal them. The Ecology and the Economy Should Go Hand in Hand People's present needs must be satisfied without any detriment to future generations. That idea arose under the influence primarily of ecology. Ecologists attempt to correct the errors of the past and to look into the future. Economists, as a rule, are interested in increasing the immediate profits. Bringing them closer together contains the key to resolving many problems. Does there exist in the gold mining branch any experience when ecological priorities guarantee the achievement of high economic results? I was told at the association that for a long time we have known about the existence of this kind of experience, but we were not able to acquaint ourselves with it first-hand until we flew last year to... the United States. Sh. Nazhimov headed the delegation, which also included N. Namazayev, the leader of the association's science group; T. Igrashev, chairman of the oblast environmental protection committee; and A. Yemelyanov, chief geologist at the Angren Mine. They visited a private gold mining company. It is a small one that mines 13 kilograms of gold a year. Our specialists saw progressive technology for extracting the precious metal from the ore. They saw a strong and very authoritative ecological service, the precise organization of labor, and high working efficiency. In a couple of days all this was perceived as something completely obvious. But there were things that made a staggering impression. Just imagine being shown pleasant-looking slopes, hills overgrown with grass and little trees, and being told that just a few months ago there had been a quarry here, where operations with explosives used to be carried out, and where a road used to wind over the slopes... But where are even the slightest traces of this? There is nothing. All one can see is the primordial natural beauty, recreated by man with surprising diligence and with love. Even the little trees had returned to the places where they were born. It was fantastic! What is this, then? The greatest patriotism? The strict and respectful observance of environmental protection laws? Or is it simply something that is economically beneficial for them? Apparently it is all of these things, taken together. They have fused together and given rise to standards of everyday existence. Of course we shall not idealize everything that our people saw in America. That country also has a large number of ecological problems. But, objectively speaking, the people there were earlier in recognizing the seriousness of those problems and began to engage seriously in resolving them. The second thing that could not fail to surprise our delegation was the poverty of the gold-bearing ores from which their colleagues extract the precious metal. Half a gram in a ton of ore? In our country that is the same amount of the precious metal that exists in the tailings. One gram of gold costs the company $8. It sells the gold to the state at $12 (the world price). The remaining $4 are completely sufficient for reproduction, for new technology, and, of course, for providing the people with a good life. And necessarily one dollar out of the $4 will go into the protection of the environment. That's a lavish amount! We spend only a tiny fraction of that amount for those purposes. The association -- this new structure -- will have to assimilate qualitatively new steps in environmental protection work. It must do so. Proceeding along this road is difficult, because the past has left us a "rich inheritance." Almost 15 million tons of tailings. In addition, more than 50 million cubic meters of rock overburden have accumulated. Almost 1700 hectares of land has been destroyed in the mountainous and foothill rayons. It will be necessary to recultivate several quarries. But, no, everything is not really that gloomy. Interesting experience also exists at the Angren Gold Mine, where the best ecological results have been achieved and where the output produced is cheaper than anywhere else. Last year the concentration plant that is situated here held a housewarming party on the occasion of the introduction of ecologically effective and highly productive equipment. The people at the enterprise have attempted to do the maximum to assure that no more ecological problems will develop in the future. And the intention is that that principle, which is based on the improvement of the technology and of the environmental protection service, will be introduced everywhere at the association's enterprises. It is for these purposes that a program for the ecological rejuvenation and technical improvement of the enterprises by the year 1997 has been prepared. It is planned to improve the process of secondary extraction of gold and silver from substandard ores and overburden, and that means additional kilograms and tons of precious metals. It is also planned to obtain building materials (crushed rock, sand, silicate and clay bricks) from waste products, and also to carry out secondary extraction of side-produced nonferrous metals -- lead, copper, zinc. Certain quarries and depleted deposits will be sealed up. Prospectors Continue To Be Esteemed Whatever forces and capabilities of scientific-technical progress we put our hopes on or count on, a good result in any job invariably depends upon people's skill, knowledge, industriousness, and devotion. In gold mining there continue to be a rather large number of people who have remained true to the traditions of cooperative handicraft labor. They are the prospectors. One should not think that these are only manual laborers with a pick and shovel. Their strong point is their maneuverability, and sometimes also their ability to extract a considerable quantity of metal at deposits with small volumes of gold reserves. Life is difficult for them. But the gold that they mine is cheaper for the state. For many years a certain S. Bondarenko headed the famous Kyzylkum Cooperative. He died two years ago. The cooperative elected as its leader S. Aksenov, a smart miner. The labor performed by the cooperative members is today in demand with new force under conditions when the problems of the material-technical support of major subdivisions have been complicated. And those cooperative members are successfully engaging in the mining not only of gold, but also of salt, marble, and coal. Prospectors... It's a good word. It is applicable to people of any occupation who put their heart and soul into their work. Currently we are talking about gold miners. This branch has grown many expert workers and highly qualified specialists who deserve to have their names known. They include N. Karabayev and B. Dekin -- crew leaders at the Kochbulak Mine; S. Khudaybergenov, chief of the Kyzylolma Mine; A. Mirzayev, chief of the Angren Gold-Extracting Factory; N. Sannibayev, crew leader at the Zarmitan Mine; and many others. When we have more people like this, society will be richer, and it will have more of all kinds of valuables, including, of course, gold.
