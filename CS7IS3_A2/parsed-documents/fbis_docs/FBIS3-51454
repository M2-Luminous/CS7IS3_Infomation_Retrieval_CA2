The union movement advocates doing away with formalism, and it supports a more realistic look at problems and their possible solutions from the perspective of the workplace, as well as from a nationwide point of view. A recent editorial in the weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor unions, called for the elimination of ritual and repetitive language. It asked for an end to the constant use of triumphant arrogance during everyday work at the unions' grass-roots level -- a level that includes factories, workshops, and service centers. TRABAJADORES attacked the use of what Cubans call "teques." This means using propaganda slogans instead of objectively analyzing the problems affecting any given daily situation. "Teques," according to the weekly, is the corruption of revolutionary language. It called on the unions to move into an offensive mode and leave behind the habit of forever waiting for guidance from higher up while deficiencies continue to grow at the workplace. The call for a more specific analysis of the problems affecting a certain work center and the country in general is consistent with the nationwide effort to face the economic crisis provoked by external forces in a way as realistic as possible. The same weekly had previously called on workers to fight for social equality and to banish egalitarianism practices of years gone by. These methods had such a negative effect that they managed to neutralize the workers' enthusiasm to produce more and better products. The current trend is to consider equality as a beautiful humanistic ideal and also as a condition for economic development. Now, more than ever before, Cubans believe it is time to do away with idealistic practices and to cautiously apply the socialist principle of distribution of wealth according to the quality and quantity of work performed by each individual. In this context, it should be understood that if work does not become the true gauge with which to measure merit and, in turn, measure each worker's standard of living, current deterrents to production and efficiency will prevail. The Cuban unions will support the socialist formulas designed to increase work results and will have greater participation in the decisionmaking process in this area. Whenever this does not occur, it will be the workers themselves who will demand the unions assume their rightful role.
