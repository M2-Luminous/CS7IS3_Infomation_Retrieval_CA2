FR940819-1-00045 FR940819-1-00011 6. FRA Form F 6180.57_``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' (Revised Title): Limited Changes Form FRA F 6180.57 collects information on accidents and incidents occurring at highway-rail grade crossings. Any impact, regardless of severity, between a railroad on-track equipment consist and any user of a public or private crossing site, including sidewalks and pathways, must be reported on this Form. 49 CFR 225.19(a) and 225.21(e). The information collected on this report is vital to identifying and resolving problems at highway-rail grade crossings. Comments FRA received several comments concerning Form FRA F 6180.57. Several commenters expressed concern over the question asked in block ``32,'' which states, ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning identified in item 31 operating?'' Item ``31'' on the Form currently lists several types of signal devices, including active and passive devices. Confusion arises when the person completing the report identifies a passive device and then reports that it was not operating. To avoid this confusion, several commenters suggested that the question in item ``32'' be amended to request information on whether the device was operating only if the device identified in item ``31'' was an active device. The Form also makes a distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item one. Most commenters recommended elimination of this obsolete distinction. A few commenters stated that the grade-crossing report required no change at all since the information requested was adequate and not burdensome and that the Form itself was understandable. Section Analysis and FRA Conclusions The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.57 is set forth in Appendix 11 to this NPRM. Note that Appendix 12, the currently used Form FRA F 6180.57, is provided for comparison purposes. In order to collect more information on motorists involved in highway-rail grade crossing accidents, FRA proposes to amend Form FRA F 6180.57 to require information under the heading ``Motorist,'' if known, on the motorist's age and gender, and whether the motorist was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident/incident ( see items ``39,'' ``40,'' and ``41'' on the proposed Form). Additionally, under the heading ``Highway Vehicle Property Damage/Casualties'' on the currently used Form, FRA is proposing to delete blocks ``43'' through ``45,'' which request information on the total number of occupants, and the total number of occupants killed and injured, and replace those blocks with several new ones ( see items ``48'' through ``54'' on the proposed Form) to gather information on: (a) the number of highway-rail crossing users ( i.e. , pedestrians and vehicle occupants) killed, (b) the number of highway-rail grade crossing users injured, (c) the total number of highway-rail grade crossing users involved in the incident (including the driver), (d) the number of railroad workers killed, (e) the number of railroad workers injured, (f) the total number of people on the train at the time of the incident (including passengers and train crew), (g) the number of train passengers killed, and (h) the number of train passengers injured. FRA also proposes to eliminate the distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item ``1'' as such a distinction is obsolete. Additionally, FRA proposes to clarify the question in item ``32,'' ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning working?'' FRA agrees that the ambiguity of this question has resulted in errors and problems because railroads report obvious contradictions. The proposed instructions for completing this question (item ``33'' on the proposed Form) are set forth in Appendix 13 to this NPRM. FRA also proposes to add two new questions to the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' to gather information on whistle bans and signal system failure. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in effect and observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was signal system failure within the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items would be included in the FRA Guide. In addition, a new narrative block (item ``55'' on the proposed Form) allowing for up to 250 characters would be added to the form in order to gather information on unusual causes/circumstances surrounding the highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident. 7. Form FRA F 6180.78_``Notice to Railroad Worker Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Worker Human Factor; Worker Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report'' (Revised Title): Limited Changes If a railroad should cite an employee human factor as the primary or contributing cause of a rail equipment accident/incident, then current regulations require the reporting railroad to complete the ``Railroad Employee Human Factor Attachment'' (Form FRA F 6180.81), and attach it to the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54). 49 CFR 225.12(a) and 225.21(g). Additionally, for each employee listed on Form FRA F 6180.81, the reporting railroad must complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved In Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor,'' on Form FRA F 6180.78, and must provide a copy of this form to the worker within 45 days after the end of the month in which the accident/incident occurred. 49 CFR 225.12(b) and 225.21(h). Upon receipt of Form FRA F 6180.78, the worker has the option of providing a statement in part II (entitled ``Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report''). 49 CFR 225.12(g). Recipients of the notice (Form FRA F 6180.78) are to include only those railroad workers who were the primary cause or a contributing cause of the rail equipment accident/incident. In order to minimize any confusion or misunderstanding for recipients of the notice, FRA proposes refinement of the language in the block entitled ``Notice to Railroad Employee'' to read as follows: Notice to Recipient. An accident occurred on the above date which the railroad alleges was at least partially caused by an action, lack of action, or the physical condition of a railroad worker. The railroad is sending you this notice because it believes that you had a role, but may not necessarily be the primary or only person responsible for the accident's occurrence. The railroad has reported to FRA that the primary and/or major contributing cause(s) of this accident are those listed above. Other causal factors related to this event may be described in the narrative portion of the railroad's report; a copy of which is attached.
