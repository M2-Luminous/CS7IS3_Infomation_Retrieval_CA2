Both the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] leadership as well as the Christian Social Union accused Kinkel on Friday [18 March] of having overreacted by "summoning" French Ambassador Francois Scheer, thus damaging relations between Bonn and Paris. Kinkel, on the other hand, said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that German-French relations are "of utmost and primary importance." After difficult years Bonn and Paris have found a special relationship of a friendly nature. This must be preserved at any cost. The German-French relationship is of utmost importance for Europe. "I will not permit any shadow to fall on that," Kinkel said. Deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine -- commissioner for the cultivation of German-French cultural relations -- said that the tensions that have now erupted between Paris and Bonn have been building for some time. Since the fall of the Wall in 1989 the Federal Government has made "several serious mistakes" in its European policy, he said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. "We must make efforts to again improve the relationship with Paris." As an example Lafontaine cited the fact that in 1989 Chancellor Helmut Kohl had not coordinated his 10-point catalogue on German unification with French President Francois Mitterrand. "This was not in the spirit of the German-French treaty." Later on, in the policy toward Yugoslavia or regarding questions of German financial policy, chancellor and foreign minister "did not exercise the necessary restraint and care in dealing with France," Lafontaine added. In the future important foreign policy decisions must "again be coordinated in the spirit of classical diplomacy and partnership." [passage omitted]
