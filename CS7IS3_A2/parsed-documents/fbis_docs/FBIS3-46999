They are looking for excuses to interfere, supposedly to protect human rights in Vietnam. They want to initiate a permanent and long-term anti-Vietnam campaign to foment instability and obstruct our people's national renovation now being initiated and led by the Communist Party of Vietnam. Of late, taking advantage of the complex situation created by the extremists in the former An Quang Buddhist Church, the external forces have added fuel to the fire. Promptly seizing this opportunity, they have unjustifiably linked the human rights issue with religious causes. They have resorted to every trick to internationalize this issue by taking advantage of foreign forums to give slanderous testimonies against Vietnam. Earlier, a number of foreign strategists who are unfriendly to Vietnam held that to carry out a long-term anticommunist campaign, it is necessary to rely on the force of religion. These strategists also predicted that the puppet army, the puppet regime, and other parties would fall apart and that in Vietnam, the religious problem is one of the factors that could be exploited to stir up the situation, and thus create permanent instability. Taking advantage of religion at home and abroad, a number of people in priests' robes have been and are following the advice of the above strategists. They are allying themselves with one another in setting up various single-religion or inter-faith organizations and committees. Their purpose is to rally and to get external forces to cooperate with internal forces in a bid to pressure other countries and international organizations into intervening or offering help. They have vociferously claimed that at many places -- such as in front of the parliamentary buildings of many countries, by the side of the new cathedral of the Rome Missisonary College, at the Vienna Human Rights Conference, and at the 1993 youth gathering in Denver -- that human rights, with freedom of religion being the most important, are the yardsticks to measure the degree of democracy of a country. Turning to Vietnam, they slander Vietnam for persecuting religion and for violating human rights. Everyone knows that assisted and agitated by exiles such as Vo Van Ai from France, Thich Quang Ba from Australia, and Thich Ho Giac and Thich Vien My from the United States, a number of evil elements in the An Quang Buddhist Church have done many things at variance with Buddhist scripture. For instance, they have driven a wedge into Buddhist unity. They have written documents distorting the truth and have taken advantage of our open-door policy and our expansion in international exchanges and telecommunications to slip these documents out to the external forces, rigging up a myth about Vietnamese Buddhism crying for help for having suffered from persecution for the second time. Taking advantage of exiled Buddhists, a number of elements converged on the headquarters of the European Paliament to stage a hunger strike to press the parliament -- in session at the time -- to pass an anti-Vietnam motion. Regrettably, due to this pressure, representatives of various groups in the parliament drafted a motion and kept it handy. Citing the petition of the exiled Buddhists as an excuse, the European Parliament issued a motion calling on member countries of the European Coordination Committee to pressure the Vietnamese Government into respecting the freedom of religion. In early October 1992, sponsored by a number of on-site forces, the Rome-based Central Office of Overseas Vietnamese Catholic Apostle Affairs Committee headed by Monsignor Tran Van Hoai organized an inter-religious ceremony on behalf of various overseas Vietnamese religions such as Buddhism, Protestanism, Cao Dai, and Hoa Hao to pray for peace in Vietnam. In their speeches, the head delegates all resorted to false arguments to distort the truth, claiming that peace does not mean an end to or the absence of war. Instead, peace necessitates the respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and freedom of religion for all individuals and organizations. In their opinion, the objective of this function was to provide each religious group with a chance to think about its responsibility toward the cause of democracy-building in Vietnam. The Cao Dai group ambitiously maintained that since mundane affairs are handled by the United Nations, so should religious affairs. The United Religions may request the United Nations to intervene with Vietnam in the human rights issue. At last, the function gave birth to an extranenous body, the `92 Roma Group, formed by representatives of different Vietnamese religious organizations overseas to continue to give advice to the action program for peace and human rights in Vietnam. A survey of the history of the Vietnamese revolution indicates that for more than a half a century, the Communist Party of Vietnam has guided the entire people in making the great August Revolution a success, and henceforth, bringing about national independence, civil rights, freedom, people's material and moral welfare, and happiness. With the victory of the two wars of resistance which lasted for 30 years, the nation was reunified and people in both parts of the country now live under the same roof. What was lost due to the division and separation caused by the war of aggression can be recovered in full now through a unified country which opens her arms to welcome everyone, including different religious organizations. The rumors about a bloodbath following the end of the war turned out to be unfounded. We closed a final chapter, conducting educational activities to help those criminals who had participated in the old regime to mend their ways and become useful citizens in society. Afterward, those elements also had the chance to make their aspirations come true by obtaining permission to leave for resettlement in foreign countries of their choices under the ODP [Orderly Departure Program] and HO [expansion unknown] Programs. It could be said that only a few countries in the world have adopted the same humanitarian policy like Vietnam where great importance is attached to human rights and peace whereas repression, retaliation, and bloodshed are nowhere to be seen. These traits mark the traditions and moral values of the Vietnamese people. Over the past years, in the framework of the renovation policy, Vietnam has opened its doors to welcome all friends and made every effort to integrate itself into the world community. It is Vietnam's policy to befriend all countries of the world. Vietnam has attracted investment to develop the national economy and enhance everyone's material and moral welfare. The people's lives have constantly been improved both materially and spiritually. Society has become more and more civilized with each passing day. The Vietnamese people in general and faithfuls of different religions in particular are making joint efforts to achieve and preserve noble goals, namely genuine peace and respect for human rights that Vietnam has gained and is now making sustained efforts to consolidate. There is no such things as harsh treatment or discrimination based on religion the outsiders are trying to accuse us of. In our opinion, those who have left the fatherland and use religion as a pretext to call on Vietnam to show respect for human rights and to look squarely at the truth should follow the examples set by overseas Vietnamese residents who are seeking ways to contribute to national reconstruction, no matter how insignificant their contributions may be. Let them stop clinging to the human rights float as soon as possible and avoid using religion as a smokescreen to cover up their crimes against their fatherland and compatriots.
