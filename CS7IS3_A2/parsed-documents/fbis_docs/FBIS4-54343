Sin Ki-ha as their floor leader for the next two years. Sin, 53, a third-term representative from Kwangju, defeated the incumbent floor leader, Rep. Kim Tae-sik, by receiving 49 votes to Kim's 46 with 96 DP lawmakers taking part in the vote. One vote was taken as an abstention. Sin's election came as a surprise to many as he represents the non-mainstream faction while the incumbent had been endorsed by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, Rep. Kim Won-ki, a leading member of the Supreme Council, and followers of former Chairman Kim Tae-chung. The party will now have to live under an awkward arrangement in which the mainstream leadership must carry out parliamentary business through a whip from a non-mainstream faction. As a result of Friday's election, discord between the two large factions in the opposition party is expected to deepen. Analysts said Sin apparently managed to demonstrate unexpected strength because the competition was waged more on personality than on factional considerations. Many DP lawmakers were obviously wary of re-electing the already- powerful Kim Tae-sik to another two-year term, they said. Sin is currently a member of the policy-making Supreme Council and chairman of the DP's Kwangju city chapter.
