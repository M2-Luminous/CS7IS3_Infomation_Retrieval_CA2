[Kocherov] Viktor Nikolayevich, if everything really is moving toward the creation of the CIS JAF [Joint Armed Forces], how are to we understand the transformation of the CIS JAF High Command into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation? Can this be considered a step forward in the development of military cooperation? [Samsonov] Paradoxical though this may seem, at the present moment this really is so, although just two years ago the path toward military cooperation seemed quite different to all of us. The creation of the CIS JAF High Command in March 1992 was a consequence of reckoning on preserving a unified defense area and joint leadership of the General-Purpose Forces and of the systems of air defense, missile attack early warning, ABM defense, verification of strategic forces and weapons of mass destruction, etc. But life, as is known, has ordered things in its own way. Military organizational development in the Commonwealth states took the path of creating national armies. By July 1992 it was already clear that it would not be possible to create the General Purpose Forces. The post of commander of these forces was abolished. The process of disuniting the air defense, missile attack early warning, and ABM defense systems began in the first half of 1993. Elements of these systems were scattered about the territories of different, now sovereign CIS states and had, in point of fact, been "privatized" by them -- which led virtually to their destruction. Then Russia's military-political leadership assumed the functions of managing the Strategic Forces. The High Command's sphere of managerial activity was shrinking like shagreen leather. Therefore in August 1993 the CIS Defense Ministers Council adopted the decision to reorganize the High Command into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation, which was implemented at the meeting of heads of state in Ashgabat 24 December last year. Of course, we would all like very much to preserve the common defense area and its administration, unified defense systems and infrastructure, joint armed forces, and the common "nuclear umbrella" over the CIS, but.... None of this exists yet (or already). Not that anybody objects to coordination in the military sphere. Therefore, if we evaluate from these positions the transformation of the CIS JAF High Command into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation, this is a natural phenomenon. But it can hardly be considered a positive fact that we failed to preserve the common defense area and to create joint armed forces. Nevertheless, I am firmly confident that the creation of such armed forces is a matter for the not so distant future. [Kocherov] You have not spoken of another aspect of this problem -- the legislative basis on which the policy of military cooperation was founded. Or are the documents so universal that they easily fit in with the newly created structure of the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation? [Samsonov] If only this were so. The High Command has spent two years working out approximately 100 documents on questions of defense. The role of the CIS JAF High Command found its place in such basic documents as the Commonwealth Charter and the Collective Security Treaty. Now this entire legislative base has to be revised -- which will take, according to the most modest estimates, at least two years, because no more than two military questions are being submitted to the Heads of State Council. Meanwhile new agreements are waiting in line, whose signing also brooks no delay. [Kocherov] In the press today there are many contradictory reports about the Collective Peacemaking Force [CPF], which most frequently appears in the guise only of Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division. What is the composition of the CPF? [Samsonov] The agreement on the CPF and the decision on forming the CPF, signed by the heads of five CIS states -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan -- prescribed that the CPF be formed by 1 October 1993 and that its arrival at its points of stationing on Tajik territory be ensured. Russia allocated the 201st Motorized Rifle Division and certain other units to make up the CPF. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan pledged to send subunits there, up to the strength of one motorized rifle battalion each. Since the 201st Motorized Rifle Division has long been in Tajikistan, the question of manning it and of its timely arrival on station did not arise. Things were more complex with the allocation of subunits of the remaining countries for the CPF. This was all time lost. This is what it cost: four attacks on border posts and instances of hostage taking. This constituted moral, material, and political damage to both Russia and the CIS states, not to mention the threat to stability in the republics neighboring on Tajikistan. In addition to the Russian troops, the CPF is now made up of a reinforced motorized rifle battalion of the Uzbek Armed Forces, an incomplete battalion of the Kyrgyz Armed Forces, and units of the Tajik Armed Forces. [Kocherov] Nevertheless, how do you rate the position of our troops in Tajikistan? Are you sure that they will not find themselves drawn into another war on foreign territory? [Samsonov] I would rate as stable the position of the CIS troops in Tajikistan as a whole and of the Russian troops in particular. They are successfully fulfilling the tasks entrusted to them, creating favorable conditions for the political settlement of crisis processes, and ensuring the covering of the Tajik-Afghan border. With regard to forecasts, I would say that the CPF in itself cannot resolve all Tajik problems. It is merely creating conditions for reconciling the sides, reaching political accord between the Tajik Government and the opposition, and resolving the border question with Afghanistan. Some people believe that Tajikistan can manage without the Commonwealth's military forces. I do not think so. The troops' withdrawal from there will not only not ease tension but will also lead to a new flareup of violence and the exacerbation of border problems. Therefore, however hard and costly it might be to maintain the CIS CPF, it is essential to the Commonwealth and, in particular, to Tajikistan. Incidentally, a session of the republic Supreme Council was held in Tajikistan recently, during which a number of awkward problems were resolved and representatives of irreconcilable groupings were made to agree to compromises. Hope emerged of creating a coalition government. The very presence of the CPF played a stabilizing role here. [Kocherov] What is the nature of the relationship between the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation and the Ministries of Defense of those states which are not in the collective security system? [Samsonov] We cannot yet speak of any system of relations, since the staff was only created one month ago. But it is possible to speak of trends. The chief one is the interest which Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine are showing in military cooperation in very diverse spheres: from the military-technical sphere to the training of military cadres. I would particularly like to point to the substantial change in the views of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry leadership on participation in the collective resolution of defense questions. Addressing the Ashgabat session of the Commonwealth Defense Ministers Council, Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy, Ukrainian minister of defense, particularly emphasized that, in addition to developing bilateral interstate relations in the military sphere, the republic's leadership is examining the question of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's joining the CIS Defense Ministers Council. This, in my estimation, is a substantial step forward in strengthening the Commonwealth's collective security, which confirms the general integrational sentiments in the former republics of the USSR. A year ago people in Azerbaijan, for example, did not wish even to speak of any cooperation in the defense sphere. But today we are awaiting a representative of that republic's armed forces in the staff. Incidentally, this republic was the ninth to sign the Collective Security Treaty. I believe it will not be the last. [Kocherov] Based on this, what is your forecast for the future of military cooperation in the CIS? [Samsonov] To be brief, things will, in my opinion, evolve as follows -- from the coordination of military cooperation to a military-political alliance and the creation of joint armed forces. I will refrain at present from speaking about the schedule for carrying out this trend. I am convinced of one thing -- along with economic integration and the strengthening of political cooperation, questions of restoring the common defense area and creating joint armed forces will also be resolved. The CPF is the first step on this path.
