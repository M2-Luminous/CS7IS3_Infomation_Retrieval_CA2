In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday the Kuwaiti minister said that what mattered to Kuwait was "to get the best arms from any source because our criterion is the quality, not the source, of the arms." In his first statement since assuming his new post he said that the government would not hesitate to provide everything of service to the members of the Kuwaiti Army. In reply to a question about coordination with the Gulf states regarding the Peninsula Shield forces, the minister said that the defense of Kuwait was primarily the responsibility of the Kuwaiti Army, followed when necessary by the role of the brothers and friends. He said in that respect that "Kuwait does not trust the Iraqi side. Once bitten, twice shy." He affirmed that attention at present was focused on preventing infiltration of any Iraqi elements into Kuwaiti territory to destabilize its security. He added: "When I was interior minister we foiled Iraqi attempts to undermine Kuwaiti security and we exposed many such designs at the time." The Kuwaiti defense minister also said that his past experience as interior minister would consolidate his role as defense minister in the present government in providing complete security for the public and in ensuring their safety. He added that he was confident about the strength of the internal situation, thanks to the public's conscious support for the work of the security forces.
