It is mostly sufficient to coat the surfaces with hard films. That saves costly basic material. Using new physical and chemical deposition processes it is now even possible to enhance the physical limits of hardness: diamond, the hardest substance in the world, can be deposited as a thin film on tools. Such new film processes for hard metals have been developed successfully in recent years in Germany as well. It is the intention of a new research project to extend them to steel tools. Until now there are still no superhard films for the processing of ferruginous metals, and diamond is not suited for such a purpose. The hardest alternative is boron nitride. It is the aim of another combined project of the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology [BMFT] to vacuum metallize it as a thin film. By combining diamond films and cubic boron nitride as a supplement, superhard films will become available for all materials and categories of application. Such research projects are supposed to result in a position of international leadership in the application of superhard films. The initial results had been displayed at the Hannover Fair. Swift technological development is continually elevating the quality and reliability criteria for components. Since the surface is of critical importance for the effectiveness of many tools, it is mostly enough to alter their properties. Further advantages of surface engineering are that energy and material can be economized through an appropriate combination of basic material and film and substitutes can be had for relatively costly basic materials. This is the reason why in recent years the processes developed in micro-electronics for the physical (physical vapor deposition [PVD]) and chemical (chemical vapor deposition [CVD]) deposition of films from the gaseous phase have been extended to the coating of all sorts of components and tools. Currently coatings are utilized in many engineering sectors: in micro-electronics, in the optical industry and even for the wearing protection of components and tools. It is the aim of these new film technologies to enhance the performance of tools, components, machinery and equipment so that companies can strengthen their competitiveness in the world's markets. Diamond is an especially attractive material for film engineering. Of all known substances diamond is the hardest, it is particularly resistant to abrasion and it is chemically resistant. Because of its high heat conductivity and its excellent optical and electrical properties it is a very promising material in the future of micro-electronics. Even the most extreme substance, however, has its weak point: at temperatures over 500� C, approximately, diamond reacts with oxygen, meaning that the precious crystal burns up. In the early eighties, on the basis of research activities in the former Soviet Union, Japanese researchers developed deposition of polycrystalline diamond films from an active gaseous phase at low pressure. Such CVD diamond films turned out to be excellent wearing protection for tools and components. As a result there was a fresh outbreak of diamond fever, this time in scientists' laboratories. According to market research, as early as the late nineties, the volume of CVD diamond films for tribological applications is likely to swell up to 3 billion German marks [DM]. Two unresolved problem areas are being feverishly worked on: diamond coating of steel and processing of steels in which the diamond films undergo chemical wear because of high carbon solubility. Steel is such a critical basic material for tools and components that the BMFT has decided to support the "vapor deposition [VD] diamond coating of steel." Participating in the DM9 million combined project, half of which is financed by the BMFT, are the Juelich Nuclear Research Facility [KFA] research center as project sponsor, CemeCon limited company [GmbH], Aachen, as contract coater, Daimler-Benz corporation [AG], Ulm research center, and Siemens AG, Berlin, both of which use steel tools in their firms, and tool manufacturer United Hardmetal GmbH, Horb am Neckar. Coordination of the research and development [R&D] tasking will reside with the Fraunhofer Institute for Film and Surface Engineering. The basic R&D tasks to be resolved are: the temperatures for the diamond deposition have to be lowered to below 500� C, the diffusion processes between the underlying steel body and the diamond film have to be attenuated and, lastly, adequate bonding of the films has to be realized. The participating industrial users are hoping for a definite increase in the effectiveness of tools and components with diamond coating and a technical lead over the international competition in equipment and machine building and, ultimately, as a result, economic advantages. Since there is still an absence of superhard coatings with which ferruginous materials can be treated, the BMFT is therefore supporting a combined project worth nearly DM10 million for concurrent research on "cubic boron nitride films." Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) ranks alongside diamond among the "superhard" materials. Even the electrical and optical properties are similar to those of diamond. Unlike diamond, which is subject to chemical wear because of its reaction with iron in the processing of steel, cubic boron nitride is eminently suited, even at high temperatures, for the processing of ferruginous materials. This explains the great interest by industry and above all by tool manufacturers in cubic boron nitride films. Cubic boron nitride's excellent properties also hold forth promising future applications in transportation and energy engineering as well as communications engineering and in the medical sector. Internationally, however, development in the field of cubic boron nitride films is only at the outset. Activities have progressed the furthest in Japan and in the U.S. One Japanese research group has already succeeded in coating drills with cubic boron nitride. But there are still a number of unresolved questions that have to be resolved before practical implementation. For instance, there is still extensive uncertainty about which processes and coating parameters can produce cubic boron nitride films that are as free from phase shift as possible. Essential to practical use of cubic boron nitride films for wearing protection in electronics or optics is their excellent bonding. Films of several micrometers' thickness are required especially on tools. This problem has still not been resolved globally. Currently various interim film bonding agents are being tested, but so far this has not resulted in any breakthrough. The structure of the combined projects indicates the strict industrial orientation of the planned research activities. The partners want to realize a position of international leadership in industrial applications of superhard films. The decisive prerequisite for market success will be the economicalness of the coating technologies. The objective is to be well armed with supertough films in tough competition.
