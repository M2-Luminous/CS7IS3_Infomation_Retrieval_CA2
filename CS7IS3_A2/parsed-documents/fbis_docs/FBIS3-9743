They focussed on international issues, Balkan ones in particular, with special stress on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the Turkish guest at the close of the talks. The Turkish foreign minister enlarged on the appeal launched by President Suleyman Demirel today before Romania's Parliament, an appeal addressed to Bosnian Serbs to find a way to adhere to a confederation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Also, the stage of the relations between the two countries and their neighbours was surveyed, in Romania's case with Hungary and Ukraine, and in Turkey's case with Greece and the states in the Caucasian ex-Soviet region, as well as the two countries' relations with the European Union from the angle of the Union's extension with new members. Turkey's unconditional support was reiterated to Romania in the process of integration in the NATO, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said at the end of the round of talks.
