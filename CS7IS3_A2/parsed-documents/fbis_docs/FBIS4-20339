According to what was revealed by a relevant quarter, 52.3 percent of the underground civil air defense works in cities throughout Liaoning have played a role in economic construction, in 1193 posting an output value of 750 million yuan and a profits tax of 110 million yuan. After liberation, particularly since the beginning of the sixties, because of the necessity for making preparations against war, Liaoning in succession invested huge sums of money in the construction under cities of an enormous concealed system for air defense, forming a huge underground space complete with water, electricity, and air conditioning facilities. However, because of the complex international situation over the past several years and other reasons, for these underground works it was a case of building at one place, closing at one place, and letting one place remain vacant. After reform and opening up to the outside world began, particularly against the background of the trend toward relaxation in the international situation and the putting into practice domestically of the market economy, civil air defense departments at all levels throughout the province, in line with the principle of "integrating peace and war, and serving the economy," gave full play to the superiorities of underground works in being warm in winter and cool in summer, in having wide spaces, and in being near cities; they opened up, one after another, to society the greater part of the civil air defense works, thereby making the fast-asleep underground treasure caves battlefields of economic construction. Now, the civil air defense works throughout the province have already become more than 20 sites of commodity production and business activity. The underground business conducted by Shenyang and Fushun cities, the underground processing and cold storage of marine products done by Dalian and Dandong cities, and the facilities of some other cities for underground aquatic breeding, planting, stockpiling, and recreation are gradually developing into a special industry. The underground market located in front of Shenyang's North Railroad Station has a business area of 23,000 square meters and an annual customer flow rate of more than 7 million persons; last year its volume of business was more than 70 million yuan, becoming a big part of Shenyang's business landscape. In the process of turning civil air defense works toward the market and service economies, civil air defense departments at all levels insist on making the requirements for preparation against war number one. They strictly manage and safeguard the works for society's by letting them out and other forms, in order to ensure that the works can at any time be put to use for air defense; thus they have achieved a benign cycle in lwhich the "caves" are used both to create wealth and to support themselves.
