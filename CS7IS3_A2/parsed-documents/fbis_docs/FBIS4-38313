'Abd-al-Ghafur also told the Jordanian parties that his excellency the president takes pride in the noble pan-Arab stand they took during the great showdown of the legendary Mother of Battles. This came during a meeting between 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur and the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation on the one hand, and the secretaries general of 11 Jordanian parties in Amman today. During this meeting, 'Abd-al-Ghafur reviewed the latest developments in the relationship between Iraq and the UN Security Council, as well as the efforts under way to lift the unfair sanctions clamped on Iraq. He indicated that the positive changes in the stands of most members of the UN Security Council are to be attributed to the steadfastness of the Iraqi people, and the wisdom of their leader Saddam Husayn. 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur urged nationalist, pan-Arab, and Islamic forces in Jordan and the Arab homeland to step up their efforts and activities prior to the next periodic review session of the UN Security Council in July. During the meeting, the Ba'th Party delegation made some practical proposals regarding multifaceted moves that could be made on the pan-Arab and international scenes to expedite the lifting of the unfair sanctions and mitigate the sufferings of the steadfast Iraqi people. For their part, the secretaries general of the Jordanian parties reiterated their total support for Iraq. They also commended its steadfastness in the face of the unfair embargo, as well as its legendary confrontation of all forms of aggression, conspiracies, and foreign intervention in its domestic affairs. The Jordanian parties also renewed their full support for Iraq's unity, independence, and sovereignty, particularly since the battle it is waging is meant to vindicate Arabism and Islam. The enemy in this battle is one; namely, U.S. imperialism, and its ally, racist and expansionist Zionism, the Jordanian parties contended. The conferees agreed to form a committee to draft practical proposals for future action on the Jordanian, Arab, and international scenes. The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, director of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th Party; Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the Arab Popular Forces Conference; and the Iraqi ambassador in Amman.
