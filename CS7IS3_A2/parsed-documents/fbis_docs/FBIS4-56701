He nonetheless conceded that "as in any integration process, the road is paved with difficulties." He moreover pointed out that with regard to the controversial issue of duty free zones, his country "will neither change its position nor make any concessions, because the private sector -- the one that invests there -- needs clear and predictable rules of the game." Besides, he contended that it has been "proven" that for Uruguay "it is a very useful tool for achieving development." Abreu denied that Uruguay will withdraw from negotiations over the common external tariff. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that one or two officials might have voiced their personal opinions, which do not reflect the government's official position. The government never "as an institution entertained the idea of leaving Mercosur, or voiced a desire to do so." Abreu's remarks were made during a news conference, following the release of press reports on 5 May which, citing government officials, indicated that Uruguay had decided to withdraw from negotiations until Brazil had explained its proposal to establish a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA). The foreign minister stated that "to date, Uruguay's strategy and position are clearly known to be in favor of the consolidation of Mercosur in all its manifestations." He explained that these consist of "the enhancement of free trade zones, which will have been concluded by the end of the year with the exception of the Treaty of Asuncion for Uruguay and Paraguay, and the definition of the common external tariff." Abreu added that this will not necessarily entail establishing a customs union, "which needs other instruments for its creation, such as the system of origin, clear rules and regulations on exceptions in foreign trade, and also aspects that have to do with the settlement of controversies." He underlined that the countries are undertaking "a gradual process in a negotiation that is by no means easy." The foreign minister reported that there is consensus between the four Mercosur partners -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- on 85 percent of the subjects pertaining to the common external tariff. Despite this, he noted that three major sectors "that are very sensitive to the two more developed economies, Brazil and Argentina, namely capital goods, the petrochemical industry, and computer science," are still pending. Abreu said that Uruguay, like the other member countries, is studying the Brazilian proposal for creating SAFTA, which has to be improved to make it compatible with Mercosur's political projects and with the other integration endeavors. Abreu believes that SAFTA "is Brazil's absolutely understandable reaction to NAFTA" in defense of South American trade. Insisting on defending tax-free zones, the minister said that once the common external tariff is set "we will know what type of integration we want and what type of protection from third countries we will have." Abreu considered the common external tariff to be "of prime importance, and it will affect the free zones, which Uruguay will not change." The minister pointed out that the economies of some regions of the country need to be bolstered, and duty free zones are an appropriate means for doing so. Brazil and Argentina have not accepted Uruguay's system of free zones, even though Abreu said that "there are different opinions" on it, though no "major opposition."
