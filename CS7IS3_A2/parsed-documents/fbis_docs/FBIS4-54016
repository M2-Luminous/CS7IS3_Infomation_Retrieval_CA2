FBIS4-54016 "dreas101__a94024" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Fujitsu To Triple Procurement of Foreign Parts Fujitsu To Triple Procurement of Foreign Parts OW2505125494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2505125494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Fujitsu Ltd. has decided to triple procurement of foreign-made parts and materials by fiscal 1996 to increase the share of foreign-made parts to 30 percent of the total parts it uses. Foreign-made parts are becoming less expensive due to the recent appreciation of the yen, and Fujitsu intends to focus on cost reduction through expanding use of foreign-made parts, aiming at rehabilitation of worsened business records. In addition to an office in Singapore, Fujitsu will open another parts procurement office in Taiwan, and subsidiaries in China will also expand parts supply to Japan. Earlier, NEC Corporation announced its decision to increase purchases of computer parts made in Southeast Asia; however, Fujitsu is the first major computer manufacturer to indicate a target figure of import increase. Fujitsu's computer and telecommunications section uses many electronic parts, plastic materials, metal parts, and cables, and the total amount of parts procurement reaches approximately 1.2 trillion yen (including 600-700 billion yen purchase from subsidiary companies). Foreign-made parts presently share about 10 percent of Fujitsu's annual parts purchase, but the company intends to increase the rate to 30 percent of parts used by Fujitsu and its subsidiaries in Japan. Fujitsu's procurement section currently has an outpost office in Singapore, and is dealing with about 40 parts and material manufacturers in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. To expand procurement from Asian companies, the Singapore office will open business with companies in Indonesia and other countries. Moreover, Fujitsu intends to open another office in Taiwan before the end of this year for reinforcing procurement of Taiwanese-made computer parts. Even in China, Fujitsu is planning to boost production of telecommunication devices in its subsidiary, and to open a new joint venture company to produce printers. Chinese-made parts used in these plants will also be exported to Japan to push up the rate of foreign-made parts. Fujitsu is suffering a sales slump in the computer section, which earns 70 percent of the company's total profits, since the first quarter of 1993. Market demands for larger multipurpose computers are in decline mainly because of the prolonged recession and downsizing (shift of consumer demands to smaller models). In the January-March quarter of 1994, the sales of Fujitsu computers is expected to drop to 1.49 trillion yen, down 15.4 percent from the previous quarter, and that of the entire company will remain at 2.16 trillion yen, down 9.9 percent. Fujitsu marked an 8.7 billion yen business loss in the October-December quarter in 1993, but, in the January-March quarter, the company is expected to announce 27 billion yen profits owing to cost reductions and business rationalization efforts. Yet, the business sector is reducing computer-related investments under the recession, and consumers are leaning toward less expensive models. Under such circumstances, a top official said "a drastic increase in sales is unlikely." Fujitsu is being pressed by an urgent need for cost reduction.
