A feasibility study on the site was approved a few days ago. The township in Huian County is the only site among the three initially picked by state nuclear power departments in Fujian that is not near an earthquake zone. Following numerous surveys and scientific demonstrations, concerned experts finally determined that Shanqian Township was the best site for a nuclear power plant in the province. The new plant will be located in the middle region of coastal Fujian at the mouth of Quanzhou Wan, near a hillside and facing the sea, and is 140 km north of Fuzhou and 20 km south of Quanzhou. The Huian Nuclear Power Plant project plans to build six 900,000 kw generating units with a total installed capacity 5.4 million kw, commanding over 50 billion yuan in total investment. Phase one has been listed in the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" and will include two 900,000 kw generating units requiring 30 billion yuan in total investment. The units will be integrated with the eastern and central China power grids. Huian County has begun the early phase of preparations for the nuclear power plant project in Shanqian township, which includes resettling villagers and educating people about nuclear power. According to the electricity departments, because the project requires a huge amount of capital and the province itself is short on construction funds, the departments concerned are hoping to solve the funding problem by inviting bids and attracting foreign capital.
