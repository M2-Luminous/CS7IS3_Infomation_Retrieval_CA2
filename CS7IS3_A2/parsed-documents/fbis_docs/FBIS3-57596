The main difference between the new and old tariff rules is the complete abandoning of the zero-tariff, that is -- every imported item will be subject to a customs duty, even if only symbolic, said Minister of Finance Uldis Osis at a press conference following a cabinet meeting. Besides, government ministries will no longer have the right to exempt certain categories of goods from customs tariffs, which has become a rather common occurrence. The new customs tariffs introduced by the Cabinet of Ministers have their legal basis in Article 81 of the Constitution, therefore they do not need to be approved by the parliament and they are effective as soon as they are published. Nonetheless, the government is to present the draft law regarding import duties to parliament on 15 February. The rules issued today will be in force until this law is approved by the parliament. The average customs duty will be 15 to 20 percent, and it will depend not solely on the type good, but also on the kind of agreement that binds Latvia with the country from which the item is being imported. The lowest duties (0.5-1 percent) are provided for imported raw materials, which were imported duty-free until now. The duty on semi-finished products will amount to 3-6 percent, and the highest tariffs are expected to be imposed on finished products. The main criterion for fixing the customs duty will be the demand for a particular product in Latvia and the possibility of manufacturing that item locally. If demand is low and the same goods are being manufactured in Latvia, the duty will be accordingly higher. For this reason, one of the highest duties (upwards of 50 percent) is expected on food, which -- as is commonly known -- Latvia can produce on her local market. U. Osis expressed the view that the new tariffs -- in their ideal form -- would protect the domestic market from an invasion of outside goods. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to provide proper customs control and a duty collection mechanism.
