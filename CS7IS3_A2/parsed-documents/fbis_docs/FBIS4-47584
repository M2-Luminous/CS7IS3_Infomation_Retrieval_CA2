P. Stolina; UDC 575.16] [Abstract] CC57W male and female mice from the Chernobyl and Kiev experimental populations were exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation to determine its effect on reproductive functioning. The radiation exposure for the test (Chernobyl) group was an order of magnitude or more higher than for the control (Kiev) group. The external _g_-background radiation exposure in the special 30-km vivarium at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant fluctuated between 70 to 100 mkR/h. Internal radiation exposure was effected by means of radionuclides inhaled or otherwise ingested by the mice. Crossbreeding of mice three to five months old was done at the Kiev vivarium (Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences) within three days after exposure. The effect of the radiation exposure was studied by testing for the incidence of embryonic mortality in the offspring of the experimental and control groups. Pregnant females were dissected on the 16th, 17th, or 18th day of gestation, and the incidence of pre- and post-implantation mortality was determined from the number of yellow masses in the ovaries and from the intrauterine implantation and live embryo locations. A consistently high incidence of pre-implantation mortality was found in the offspring of three generations of female mice and of two generations of male mice from the Chernobyl population, an obvious consequence of the mutagenic effect of low doses of combined radiation on the gametes. This finding was further corroborated by the normal incidence of pre-implantation mortality among the offspring of the F3-males from the Chernobyl population, which were allowed to reach sexual maturity without exposure to radiation.
