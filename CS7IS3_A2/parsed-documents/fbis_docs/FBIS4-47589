Korolevich, O.P. Sobeshchuk, A.A. Adarchenko, Clinical Pharmacology Course and Intrahospital Infection Laboratory at the Minsk Medical Institute; UDC 576.8.088.3:615.28] [Abstract] The urgency of combatting purulent infection using various antibacterial preparations and antiseptics which have a number of advantages over antibiotics and the arbitrary and empirical manner in which antiseptics are often prescribed necessitated a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidin, decamethoxin, and septonex relative to hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogenic forms of the enterobacteria species. Sensitivity to antiseptics was measured by diluting the preparations in a dense nutrient medium and establishing the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIK) for each strain. An analysis shows that in therapeutic concentrations, chlorhexidin, decamethoxin, and septonex inhibit the growth of all hospital strains of S. aureus and 48-78% of hospital strains of enterobacteria. Yet all hospital strains of P. aeruginosa are tolerant to decamethoxin and septonex while 28.0% is tolerant to chlorhexidin. The conclusion is drawn that the use of the above antiseptics against hospital infections should be based on studies of the microorganisms' sensitivity to these preparations. Tables 1; references 7.
