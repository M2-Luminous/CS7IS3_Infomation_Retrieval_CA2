In order to strengthen management in this field, the following points are defined: First, when foreign trade companies purchase goods from production enterprises for export (or for sale on commission), they should strictly examine whether the trademark is registered and belongs to that enterprise. Goods produced by enterprises that misuse the trademarks of others must not be purchased for export (or sold on commission). Second, foreign trade companies may not purchase (or sell on commission) export goods from production enterprises that use trademarks licensed to a registered enterprise that has not stipulated clearly in its contract that the production enterprise has the right to sell or has only the right to sell on the domestic market. Third, without the approval of the foreign trade company that holds the trademark, export enterprises may not purchase (or sell on commission) export goods from enterprises with a domestically registered trademark that, for historical reasons, is possessed by a foreign trade company -- in addition to the production enterprise -- and is registered abroad by the foreign trade company. Fourth, foreign trade enterprises may not misuse the trademarks of others to export their goods. Fifth, when a trademark-holding foreign trade company endorses the use of its registered trademark by production enterprises, it should strictly stipulate in the contract the terms governing the sale of products abroad, and should strengthen management and supervision. When purchasing goods for export (or sale on commission), if a foreign trade company infringes upon the rights of another party owing to its negligence of trademark ownership or to improper management by the trademark holder, the party concerned is to undertake administrative and legal responsibility in light of the seriousness of the case.
