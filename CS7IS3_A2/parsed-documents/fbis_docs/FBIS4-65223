According to an opinion poll, which the Committee of Finnish Industry and Commerce, EVA, published yesterday, 40 percent of Finns support joining the EU, while 37 percent say no. However, these figures do not represent any major change. In a similar poll last fall, 39 percent supported membership, while 41 percent said no. Over 50 percent of Finns say that they have a poor or very poor knowledge of the content of the package that emerged from the negotiations and that over 50 percent describe as "satisfactory" or "defensible." Some 63 percent say that agriculture has too prominent a place in Finland's final EU agreement. Even if the overall figures have not changed very much, it is possible to note changes within various population groups. Young people are not as enthusiastic, while support for membership has grown among the adult population. Support among the less well educated population has increased at the same time as it has decreased among those with higher education. And some former supporters of membership have become uncertain. EVA's poll was carried out between 30 March and 6 May. A total of 1,900 Finns between 18 and 70 participated in written interviews.
