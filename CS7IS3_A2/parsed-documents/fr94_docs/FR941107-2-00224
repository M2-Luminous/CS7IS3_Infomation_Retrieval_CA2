FR941107-2-00224 FR941107-2-00112 Gowns and Protective Apparel Various types of gowns and protective apparel are worn to provide barrier protection and reduce opportunities for transmission of microorganisms in hospitals. Gowns are worn to prevent contamination of clothing and protect the skin of personnel from blood and body fluid exposures. Gowns especially treated to make them impermeable to liquids, leg coverings, boots, or shoe covers provide greater protection to the skin when splashes or large quantities of infective material are present or anticipated. The wearing of gowns and protective apparel under specified circumstances to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens is mandated by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule.51 Gowns are also worn by personnel during the care of patients infected with epidemiologically important microorganisms to reduce the opportunity for transmission of pathogens from patients or items in their environment to other patients or environments; when gowns are worn for this purpose, they are removed before leaving the patient's environment and hands are washed. Adequate data regarding the efficacy of gowns for this purpose, however, is not available. Patient-Care Equipment and Articles Many factors determine whether special handling and disposal of used patient-care equipment and articles are prudent or required, including the likelihood of contamination with infective material; the ability to cut, stick, or otherwise cause injury (needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments [sharps]); the severity of the associated disease; and the environmental stability of the pathogens involved. 27,51,81&hyph;83 Some used articles are enclosed in containers or bags to prevent inadvertent exposures to patients, personnel, and visitors and to prevent contamination of the environment. Used sharps are placed in puncture-resistant containers; other articles are placed in a bag. One bag is adequate if the bag is sturdy and the article can be placed in the bag without contaminating the outside of the bag;84 otherwise two bags (double bagging) are used. The scientific rationale, indications, methods, products, and equipment for reprocessing patient-care equipment have been delineated in other publications. 68,83,85&hyph;90 Contaminated, reusable critical medical devices or patient-care equipment (i.e., equipment that enters normally sterile tissue or through which blood flows) or semicritical medical devices or patient-care equipment (i.e., equipment that touches mucous membranes) are sterilized or disinfected (reprocessed) after use to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms to other patients; the type of reprocessing is determined by the article and its intended use, the manufacturer's recommendations, hospital policy, and any applicable guidelines and regulations. Noncritical equipment (i.e., equipment that touches intact skin) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions is cleaned and disinfected after use according to hospital policy. Contaminated disposable (single-use) patient-care equipment is handled and transported in a manner that reduces the risk of transmission of microorganisms and decreases environmental contamination in the hospital; the equipment is disposed of according to hospital policy and applicable regulations. Linen and Laundry Although soiled linen may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms, the risk of disease transmission is negligible if it is handled, transported, and laundered in a manner that avoids transfer of microorganisms to patients, personnel, and environments. Rather than rigid rules and regulations, hygienic and commonsense storage and processing of clean and soiled linen are recommended. 27,82,91 The methods for handling, transporting, and laundering of soiled linen are determined by hospital policy and any applicable regulations. Dishes, Glasses and Cups, and Eating Utensils No special precautions are needed for dishes, glasses and cups, or eating utensils. Either disposable or reusable dishes and utensils can be used for patients on isolation precautions. The combination of hot water and detergents used in hospital dishwashers is sufficient to decontaminate dishes, glasses and cups, and eating utensils. Routine and Terminal Cleaning The room or cubicle and bedside equipment of patients on isolation precautions are cleaned using the same procedures used for other patients unless the infecting microorganism(s) and the amount of environmental contamination indicates special cleaning. The methods, thoroughness, and frequency of cleaning and the products used are determined by hospital policy. HICPAC Isolation Precautions There are two tiers of HICPAC isolation precautions. In first, and most important, tier are those precautions designed for the care of all patients in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. Implementation of these ``Standard Precautions'' is the primary strategy for successful nosocomial infection control. In the second tier are precautions designed only for the care of specified patients. These additional ``Transmission-based Precautions'' are for patients known or suspected to be infected by epidemiologically important pathogens spread by airborne or droplet transmission or by contact with dry skin or contaminated surfaces.
