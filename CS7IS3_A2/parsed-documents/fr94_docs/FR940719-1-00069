FR940719-1-00069 FR940719-1-00015 Measurement of any required water flow rate could be accomplished through the installation of a flowmeter. A flowmeter provides a direct and reliable measurement and is the preferred method of determining water flow rate. Another acceptable method of determining flow rate would be to establish the relationship between the water pressure and the spray orifice diameter, either through engineering data or through actual tests. Once established, the water pressure gauge reading could be used to reliably indicate a flow rate for a specific number of sprays at a given orifice size. The proposed requirement would specify that the number of water sprays and their orientation be included in the examination. While spray orientation is important in air-directing spray systems such as sprayfans and shearer-clearers, the Agency does not intend that precise angles be determined during each examination by the use of engineering instruments. Rather, the correct direction and orientation of the sprays would be determined by comparison with the requirements of the ventilation plan. The proposed requirement would also specify that the section ventilation setup and control device placement be examined for compliance with the ventilation plan. Information concerning section ventilation systems is currently required to be contained in the ventilation plan through ยง75.371(f). Any other respirable dust control parameters specified in the approved ventilation plan would be included in the examination under the proposal. An example could be the cleaning and maintenance procedures for a wet bed scrubber installed on a continuous mining machine. Given the importance of and the need for continually maintaining compliance with the dust control parameters to assure dust control, dilution and removal, an effective system of continuous monitoring of the performance and condition of the dust control parameters is desirable. The Agency is aware that through advances in technology it may be feasible to monitor air quantity and velocity, and spray water flow rate and pressure. Continuous monitoring offers the potential to further improve miner protection by providing real-time data on the performance and condition of the dust control parameters. This information can be used to give early warnings of deteriorating dust control conditions which can be corrected before the dust control system operates below the accepted standard. Although the application of continuous monitoring will eliminate the need for periodic physical measurements of key dust control parameters, visual observation will be necessary to verify compliance with other ventilation plan parameters. Among these are the number and location of operating water sprays, their general condition and orientation, the section ventilation setup and control device placement, and other control measures where performance and operating condition can only be assessed visually. Although the proposal includes continuous monitoring as an option, the Agency is considering requiring the use of this technology at some later date when it becomes available. Comments are solicited on this approach. Specifically, comments are solicited on the parameters that lend themselves to continuous monitoring, the need for performance standards for monitoring devices, levels of detection, accuracy and precision requirements for monitoring devices, the need for alarms and/or warning signals when parameters monitored are outside of specified tolerances, and the polling frequency necessary to provide monitoring that is substantially continuous. Paragraph (c)(1) would be modified to remove the word ``working'' modifying the word ``section'' in the current rule. The reason for this proposed change is to achieve consistency between paragraphs (a) and (c). Many of the activities to which persons are assigned would be on sections not normally thought of as working sections, since the term ``working section'' is often associated with coal production. For purposes of ยง75.362, a section in the mine is considered to be the area inby the loading point, or the proposed loading point in the case of the installation of equipment, or the location of the last established loading point in the case of the removal of mechanized mining equipment. The certified person conducting the examination would examine the section in much the same way as it would be examined during a coal producing shift, including checking for hazardous conditions, testing for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determining if the air is moving in its proper direction. Paragraph (c) would require certified persons conducting on-shift examinations to take the air measurements at the same locations where air measurements are required during the preshift examination. This would include areas where mechanized mining equipment, including longwall or shortwall mining equipment, is being installed or removed. This provides an additional check of the mine's ventilation system and verifies that ventilation changes in the mine during the production process have not occurred. Reduced volume or velocity of air during the shift can contribute to increased levels of respirable dust and the occurrence of methane accumulations or oxygen-deficient atmospheres. The proposal includes an additional requirement under paragraph (d)(1). The new item appears as (i) while former (i) and (ii) are redesignated as (ii) and (iii). Paragraph (i) would require that at the start of each shift an examination for methane be conducted at each working place before electrically operated equipment is energized on the section. Under the proposal, at the beginning of each shift, a methane examination would be conducted at each working place prior to energizing equipment. The provision would assure that the working places on the section are examined and determined to be safe before electrically operated equipment on the section is energized and normal work activities commence. The operation of electrically powered equipment is a recognized potential methane ignition source. The proposed rule would reduce the likelihood of ignition by requiring an examination for methane before this equipment is energized. The Agency is also proposing to revise paragraph (d)(1)(iii) to require methane tests more often than at the current 20-minute intervals at specific locations during the operation of equipment in the working place when required in the approved ventilation plan. Commenters have expressed a concern that some mines, because of the methane liberation at the face during mining operations, need additional methane tests for safety. MSHA agrees and is proposing to reinsert language similar to that in the previous standard that would require that when necessary for safety, more frequent tests are to be made. It should be noted that the methane monitor installed as required by ยง75.342, Methane monitors, has never been accepted as a means for satisfying the test requirements of this section, and likewise would not be accepted under the proposed rule.
