On concluding in Havana the national meeting on teaching methodology in preparation for the next school year, she said that we must generalize the experience on joint methodological work and systematize that method to perfect relations among the province, the municipality, and the school. Maria de los Angeles Garcia added that this meeting must verify the results of this method and see whether its implementation is advisable or not. She said that children and adolescents are also protagonists of the economic adjustments being adopted in the country and for this reason the teachers must explain to them the causes of these measures so that they may find the just answers to their concerns. At the preparatory meeting for the next school period, Maria de los Angeles Garcia stressed the importance of increasingly linking the school with the family and the community. She added that informal education must be consolidated so that teaching will reach all young people, namely those who are under five years of age and are not going to the childcare centers. She added that the optimization process is beginning a special stage because there are many points that will require the effort, intelligence, and political touch of all in order to conclude successfully this stage. She added that the evaluation of teachers must be an element of incentive, control, and differentiation of teachers, in addition to being just. Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez Gutierrez also participated in the meeting in preparation for the next school period, and he also stressed the changes being made in the registration of students for adult education. He added that these changes are made in accordance with the current economic situation that must be changed. He said that appropriate measures are being adopted and will be released soon. The education minister added that adult education cannot become a refuge of teachers who are not suitably trained to give classes in those centers, and for this reason they must be given further training in education. He added that English teachers must be trained further to give classes in high schools, where they are most needed, perhaps more than in the language schools.
