This was the third event of its kind. This year it was held within the framework of the "Aircraft Engines-94" international exhibition. A wide range of Air Force equipment was on show, from the old Tu-95 long-range aircraft, which has been in the arsenal for more than 40 years now, to the super-modern Su-35. During a demonstration flight of the latter, test pilot Viktor Pugachev performed a new aerobatic maneuver for the numerous spectators. For the time being it has been dubbed a "sideways cobra." [video shows maneuver] Spectators were enraptured by the amazingly harmonious demonstration flights performed by pilots of the Kubinka Flight Center.
