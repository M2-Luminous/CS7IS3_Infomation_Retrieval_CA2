FR940214-2-00035 FR940214-2-00020 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;172&hyph;000] Mojave Pipeline Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization January 21, 1994. Take notice that on January 6, 1994, Mojave Pipeline Company (Mojave), 5001 E. Commercenter Drive, Bakersfield, California 93309, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;172&hyph;000 a request pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to construct a sales tap under Mojave's blanket certificate issued in Docket Nos. CP89&hyph;1&hyph;000 and CP89&hyph;2&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Mojave proposes to construct a connection between its existing 30-inch line and the All American Gas Pipeline Company's (All American) gas supply pipeline to its Cadiz pump-station in San Bernardino California. Mojave states that it would transport the gas on behalf of All American pursuant to its existing blanket transportation certificate under existing rate schedules. Mojave states further because All American's firm entitlement is less than the previously uncommitted capacity on Mojave, service to Mojave's other customers should not be affected by transportation on behalf of All American. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3341 Filed 2&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
