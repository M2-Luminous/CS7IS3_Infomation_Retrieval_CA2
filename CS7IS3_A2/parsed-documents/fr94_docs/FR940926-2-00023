Purpose In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631, et seq. ), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract or a modification to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and are implemented in FAR 19.7. In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit reports of their progress on SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report. In addition, OFPP Policy Letter 91&hyph;1, Government-Wide Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Goals for Procurement Contracts, requires Executive branch departments and agencies to report the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business. The report is being expanded to collect information on the number of subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business which is not currently collected by the report. Information submitted on SF 295 is used to assess contractor's compliance with their subcontracting plans and to report achievement of goals for subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business.
