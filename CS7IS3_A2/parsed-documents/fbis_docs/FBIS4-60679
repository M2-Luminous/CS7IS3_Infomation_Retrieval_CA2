FBIS4-60679 "drnes103_l_94018" FBIS-NES-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 ISRAEL NRP Political, Financial Situation Viewed NRP Political, Financial Situation Viewed TA2605130194 TA2605130194 BFN [Editorial report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 26 May carries a 1,500-word article by Amnon Barzilay on page B3, in the "I Saw, I Heard" daily column, discussing the current situation of the National Religious Party [NRP]. The article says that NRP leader Zvulun Hammer recently held separate meetings with Likud's David Levi and Ari'el Sharon "in an attempt to reconciliate between the two," "in a move coordinated with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu," hoping to follow this with "the second stage of setting up the right-wing shadow government." After holding the meetings, however, Hammer realized "the chances of rehabilitating the Likud leadership are slim." Hammer found that Levi wants to act as foreign minister, and that Sharon will never be candidate for construction and housing minister if Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan is promised the defense portfolio. This further added to the feeling of frustration the NRP leadership is currently experiencing. It is frustrated because "its dream of Jewish settlements in the territories is collapsing, and they can do nothing to stop the process." The frustration grew even bigger in view of the "irreversible processes" of the "tightening political cooperation between Labor and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], as the latter returns to the coalition, and the socioeconomic cooperation between SHAS and Meretz" in the Histadrut labor federation. NRP leaders blame Netanyahu and their cooperation with the Likud. Party officials last week claimed that only NRP activists show up for demonstrations against government policies claiming: "We are their black laborers. Netanyahu comes to our demonstrations, delivers a speech, and goes home." The NRP heads expect a shift in the right-wing religious public sentiment toward them, believing that the Likud, Moledet, and Tehiya parties will support them in the next elections, gaining them additional "two or three Knesset seats," but some NRP leaders believe this will not be enough to get them out of the opposition. Also, the NRP is in serious financial distress. "The unexpected Labor defeat in the Histadrut elections will be followed by the collapse of the secret financial deals between Histadrut and the NRP," Barzilay says, noting that "the party still has debts of some 5 million shekels from the local elections."
