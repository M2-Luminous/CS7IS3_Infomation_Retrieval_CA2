They discussed all the issues that are currently complicating the situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard], particularly certain demands by the international community issued to the leadership of the Srpska republic. [Begin recording] [Akashi, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] There should be no difficulties concerning the rotation of the UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica, and I hope that this rotation, based on this agreement, will be completed by the end of February. As for the opening of Tuzla airport, I believe that Dr. Karadzic is keeping an open mind. He wants to explore our suggestions. He has to consult his assembly, but we are ready to take into account his concerns regarding the security and other aspects of this. We have a clear mandate from the UN secretary general to open the airport by peaceful means, by negotiations, but if that is not successful, then there is the possibility of the use of a minimum of force for self-defense. However, I am sure that we agree that we will do everything possible to avoid that kind of an escalation. [Unidentified correspondent] How do you understand the latest mandate that you have been given by Mr. Butrus-Ghali? The foreign press carries different interpretations of that mandate. [Akashi] I have explained many times to the distinguished members of the press that the secretary general has given me a mandate to call for NATO air support for self-defense for our troops. This is different from air strikes for offensive purposes. Neither the secretary general nor I have the right to initiate such attacks. Even NATO would have to go back to consult the NATO Council to solve that issue, the issue of air strikes. We are talking about something specific here, about the air support for the self-defense of our troops. [Karadzic] We have completely clarified the issue of Srebrenica with Mr. Akashi, General Rose, and their associates, and we do not believe that this will be a problem. The Dutch troops are already in Srebrenica, and we believe that the Canadian UNPROFOR will be completely replaced by the Dutch forces by the end of February. As for the opening of the airport in Tuzla, we understand the efforts of the international community to increase the inflow of humanitarian aid into the Tuzla region. Last time we offered Mrs. Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to double, even treble, the number of humanitarian land convoys, and we are ready to increase the inflow of convoys for Tuzla, and that has already happened. Larger amounts of food are already reaching Tuzla. I am afraid that the issue of opening Tuzla airport could become more of a psychological than a realistic one, psychological in the sense that the international community could, that is, some belligerent members of the international community could use this as a form of exerting further pressure. We do not reject in principle the notion of it, but it is too major a decision for any one Serbian official to make by himself. That has to be decided by our assembly. [end recording]
