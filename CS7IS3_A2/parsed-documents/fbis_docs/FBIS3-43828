In a statement issued yesterday, Viljoen said the next two weeks would provide clarity, but there were "strong indications that the Afrikaner will shortly stand before his toughest choice of the century". He rejected recent suggestions that his position in the AVF had been weakened and that he might quit the organisation. A right-wing source said recent comments by Viljoen were simply an indication that he believed his political role might be ending: "I imagine he was hinting at a military role he might have to play," said the source. He said there was "concern, discontent and frustration" among grassroots supporters at the lack of progress in negotiations with the Government and the ANC [African National Congress]. They were saying to the AVF leadership: "I told you so...there is no alternative to war." However, Viljoen said in his statement that his role was not changing because of dissatisfaction over his performance but because the ANC and Government were limiting the options open to Afrikaners. The fact that the nature of the struggle could change soon was not his fault, but that of the Government and ANC who thought they were dealing with people who "bark but don't bite". He also claimed that the Government had shocked him by negotiating in a "spineless" manner with the ANC and had been dishonest in its dealings with the AVF.
