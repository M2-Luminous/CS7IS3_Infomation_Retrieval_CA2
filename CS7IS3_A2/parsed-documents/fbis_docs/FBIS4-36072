The agency's correspondent, who is currently stationed in the axis of Abyan-al-'Alam-Aden, added that he noticed that our Armed Forces operating in the battlefields in this axis are eager not to harm our people in these areas, which are being purged of separatist forces. The correspondent went on to say: Our forces are making a deliberate effort to avoid damage to vital and service facilities that serve people in these areas. He pointed to the damage caused to economic installations, as well as the destruction of all vital facilities carried out by the secessionist gang so that citizens may not benefit from them. For example, in the first days of the secessionist gang's unleashing of the crisis, it cut off the power supply feeding Abyan from Aden in retaliation against its heroic sons for the nationalist unity-orientated positions they have taken, for their confrontation of this gang's secessionist plan, and also for the support they have lent to the forces of unity and legitimacy, which are valiantly confronting the destructive secessionist plan announced by the war criminal, agent, and traitor 'Ali al-Bid. Furthermore, several other economic facilities and service installations became targets of aggressive bombardment by the secessionist and separatist forces when they were compelled to retreat and withdraw from their positions. This reflects the malicious spirit and destructive instincts of this criminal secessionist gang.
