The Great Significance of Practicing the Strategy of Opening Border Areas to the Outside World Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of building special economic zones [SEZs] constitutes an important part of his own theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the guidance of his idea, China's SEZs, acting as the country's "windows" to the outside world, have played a "vanguard" role in reform and opening up, thus giving a tremendous impetus to the process of reform and opening up throughout the entire country. Through the practice of reform between the 1980's and the early 90's, a multilevel, multiform, and omnidirectional new setup of opening up has taken shape, featuring the pattern of SEZs--coastal open cities--coastal open economic zones--inland and border areas. This new setup is the outcome, and also a concrete embodiment, of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs in practice. Moreover, it is of great significance to our efforts to bring a sustained, rapid, and healthy development to China's national economy and to fulfill China's second-step strategy on building socialist modernization. Along China's 22,000 km border, most regions are inhabited by ethnic minority nationalities. Practicing the strategy of opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance and an inevitable outcome of applying in practice Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs; it is also an objective requirement for us to help ethnic minority regions extricate themselves from poverty, narrow the gap between the economically advanced and less advanced regions, and bring joint development and common prosperity to all nationalities in our country. Practicing the strategy of opening up border areas and further expanding border trade with neighboring countries is a major change in the economic development pattern of China's border areas. It also serves as an important way by which China's ethnic minority regions can expand their economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the country and the world, allocate major means of production in a more rational way, improve their economic performance, enhance their ability to compete in international and regional commodity exchanges, and bring an overall development to their economy. China's accomplishments in both the opening of coastal areas and the opening of border areas, which are complementary to each other, have added a new chapter to the annals of reform and opening up and further enriched Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs. Deng Xiaoping pointed out as early as 1984: "Special zones serve as windows for the introduction of technology, management, and knowledge; and also as windows for applying our foreign-related policies. From special zones, we can introduce technology and knowledge from abroad and learn and master management skills. Management is also knowledge." (Footnote 1) (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, pp 51-52) This celebrated thesis has already been proved correct in the pioneering development of SEZs and coastal open areas and can thus serve as important guidance for the opening up of border areas. The move to turn open border areas into windows for the introduction of foreign technology will surely give a tremendous impetus to the development of inland and border areas in their efforts to establish lateral ties with other domestic areas and expand their contacts with foreign countries. The introduction of advanced technologies from foreign countries is beneficial to transforming existing traditional industries and products, developing new technologies and products, improving the technical level and the quality of products in enterprises, and to building up advantageous and export-oriented industries which enjoy a better ability to cooperate with other industries, cope with contingencies, and to survive in competition. Moreover, through the introduction of foreign advanced technologies, we can upgrade the exploration for natural resources and comprehensively turn the potential advantages of border ethnic regions in natural resources into practical economic advantages; push forward the technical progress of border areas; and subsequently accelerate the rate of border areas in establishing lateral economic and technological ties with other parts of the country, thus giving form to a new-type regional economic relationship under which border areas, inland areas, and coastal areas supplement and help each other on a mutually beneficial basis with a view to bringing about joint development and common prosperity. Meanwhile, the move to turn open border areas into windows for the introduction of management skills can surely accelerate and deepen the economic structural reform of inland and border areas. In the light of their realistic conditions and in accordance with the requirement to establish a socialist market economic structure, border areas can learn from and use for reference the successful experience of advanced countries in managing the socialized general production and in developing the market economy with a view to transforming their economic structure. The move to turn open border areas into windows for introducing knowledge will undoubtedly promote the building of the two civilizations in inland and border areas on a comprehensive scale. Through these windows, border areas can obtain timely information on the latest developments in technology, market, capital, and human resources in both neighboring countries and the whole world; acquaint themselves with the usual economic practices in foreign countries; learn and master knowledge about international trade and banking; nurture a large number of talents in all fields who are familiar with international economic activities; and bring the markets in border areas well in line with both the markets in neighboring countries and the international market. The move to turn open border areas into windows for applying foreign-related policies will certainly enable inland and border areas to exert a greater influence on their neighboring countries and regions. Practicing the policy of opening border areas to the outside world is beneficial to: Bringing into better play the advantages of border areas in regional development and natural resources, thus enabling border areas to have a greater appeal to neighboring countries and regions; carrying forward the historical tradition of China's border areas to keep contact and do business with different nationalities in neighboring countries and regions, thus augmenting their friendship with the peoples of neighboring countries and promoting the economic and technological exchanges and cooperation among them; and beneficial to making China's border areas more complementary to neighboring countries in terms of industrial structure, product mix, and natural resources, thus rejuvenating the border economy. As a result, border areas will eventually serve as windows to the outside world showing that China has become economically stronger and richer and is enjoying a sound social order and a general unity among all nationalities. In this way, China's influence and status in the international community can be enhanced immensely. In short, the strategy of opening border areas to the outside world is a continuance of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs in the practice of reform and opening up. So long as they further use for reference and assimilate the successful experiences gained by SEZs and coastal open areas, emancipate their minds, make bolder explorations, and open up new paths, China's inland and border areas can surely extricate themselves from the current economic, technological, and cultural backwardness; "gain dominance as newcomers"; and advance both the economic development and the living standards of their people to a new level. II. Current Basic Development Trends in China's Open Border Areas The current domestic and international political and economic situations are truly favorable to our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the strategy on opening border areas to the outside world. Faced with such a rare opportunity to bring a comprehensive development to China's inland and border areas, we must enhance the sense of urgency in opening up border areas, seize this favorable opportunity, and speed up the pace of opening border areas to the outside world. To successfully implement the strategy of opening up border areas and keep abreast of the basic development trends in border areas, we must acquire a correct understanding of the regional features, development phases, and trading characteristics of China's inland and border areas. There are altogether 143 border counties (cities) in China's inland and border areas, which border on 15 neighboring countries. Alongside the in-depth development of China's reform and opening up over recent years, the State Council approved in 1984 the "Provisional Management Regulations on Small-Volume Border Trade Transactions," which was issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Relations and Trade, and decided, in 1992, to list four more border cities as open cities, namely, Heihe and Suifenghe in Heilongjiang Province, Yunchun in Jilin Province, and Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia. After that, a number of border cities and counties were opened to the outside world in turn, including Pingxiang City and Dongxing Town in Guangxi Province; Hekou County, Wanding City, and Ruili County in Yunnan Province; Yining City, Tacheng City, and Bole City in Xinjiang; and Erenhot City in Inner Mongolia. In addition, preferential policies originally designed for coastal open cities were applied to a number of provincial (regional) capital cities, such as Nanning, Kunming, Urumqi, Huhhot, Changchun, and Harbin. This is a major step which China has taken to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up and marks the beginning of a new development phase for China's drive to open up border areas. At present, China has expanded its border trade with neighboring countries in terms of business patterns, levels, and scope and the economic cooperation between China and foreign countries is being carried out on a more extensive scale. China's current border trade with neighboring countries has the following special features: The volume of border trade has increased by a large margin, of which China enjoys a favorable balance of trade while foreign trading parties have adverse balances. While the border trade still relies mainly on local trade, small-volume transactions, and commodity exchanges among border residents, border areas have set out to develop a comprehensive exchange and cooperation in the economic, technological, and trading fields. While the barter system still remains a dominant trading form in border trade, a financial market relying mainly on renminbi transactions has taken shape, both the labor and tourist markets have expereienced fairly large growth, and the border trade is being carried out in diversified forms. In the past, the border trade mainly took the organizational structure of a nongovernmental trade; today, a simultaneous development has been registered in both the nongovernmental and official trade, the number of our trading partners is increasing on a constant basis, and the border trade is developing into a diversified transregional and transownership trading system. To promote their economic and trade relations with neighboring countries, all border provinces and regions have formulated a series of policies, rules, and regulations; as a result, the once chaotic border trade is moving toward a state of orderliness under the new environment of competition. Our neighboring countries, for their part, have also adopted a positive attitude in developing their border trade with us. They have worked out a series of policies, rules and regulations, and measures; and adopted more preferential policies, striving for a faster growth in their economies. A number of advanced countries in the West, including Japan, France, and the United States, as well as countries like Thailand and the regions of Hong Kong and Macao have also stepped up their efforts to play a bigger role in China's border trade with neighboring countries. Meanwhile, advanced areas inside the country, such as the coastal areas of Guangdong as well as the municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing, have made thermselves more involved in border trade. All border areas have taken positive measures to preserve their specific regional advantages in competition. III. A Tentative Plan on Implementing the Strategy of Opening Border Areas to the Outside World The whole country, central and local authorities alike, has reached a consensus on the implementation of the strategy of opening up border areas. All provinces and autonomous regions along the border have also worked out their own policies and regulations guiding the development of the border trade. However, judging by the overall situation, an overall plan on how the strategy can be implemented remains to be formulated. Therefore, it has become a pressing matter of the moment to adapt ourselves to the objective needs of the new situation resulting from the opening of border areas and establish China's strategy of opening border areas to the outside world. The strategy of opening up border areas should embrace a guiding ideology, a strategic principle, major tasks, a strategic set-up, and key policies and measures. The guiding ideology for the opening of border areas is as follows: In the light of the realistic conditions of China's inland and border areas, and in accordance with the requirements set out in the country's macroeconomic policies, we must make use of the current relaxed international political situation; vigorously bring into better play the geographical, resources, and economic complementary advantages of border areas; carry out the strategy of opening up border areas which aims at rejuvenating them and making their people rich; actively help border areas step up their economic, trade, and technological cooperation with neighboring countries; use opening up to promote reform and economic development; enhance the overall economic strength of border areas with a final aim of developing the productive forces; bring about a comprehensive development to the scientific and technological, cultural, and educational undertakings in border areas; strengthen border security and promote unity among all nationalities; and we must fulfill the second-step strategic goal of our modernization drive and bring about common progress and prosperity for all nationalities. It is the strategic principle of the opening of border areas to regard the border trade as a breakthrough point, use trade as a guide, rely mainly on inland areas, focus our attention on economic and technological cooperation as well as on the markets of neighboring countries, and open up more international markets. To fulfill the goal of rejuvenating border areas and making their people rich, we will open border areas to the outside world in a comprehensive way; introduce foreign equipment, technology, and capital while establishing lateral ties with domestic enterprises; and bring about a regional association and integration between the eastern and western parts of the country, with a view to bringing about a comprehensive development. The major tasks of the opening of border areas should include the following: We should readjust and optimize the industrial structure and the product mix in border areas; set up more production bases for exported commodities, and help border areas develop their own highly competitive products for exports; expand the commodity, technology, and equipment exports from border areas; promote their exports of labor services; actively introduce from abroad scarce resources, supplies, and raw and semi-finished materials; improve the environment for investment; accelerate the market building and perfect the market system; and change the functions and roles of governments in border areas. The strategic set-up for the opening of border areas requires us to further consolidate and perfect the opening belts along the southwest, northwest, and northeast borders, thus turning them into regional economic opening belts with their own specific features. While further strengthening and improving inland ports already approved by the central authorities, we must build up a number of new inland ports in selected locations in a planned way and enhance their fanning influence, giving shape to a new opening set-up under which the experience of selected units will be used to promote the work of the whole. The key policies and measures guiding the opening of border areas should embrace the following: First, more preferential policies should be adopted. For example, we can set up processing zones for the export trade from inland and border areas, allow these zones to enjoy the preferential treatment originally designed for SEZs, and grant them greater decisionmaking powers as well as preferential policies in operation. Second, we need to further readjust the industrial structure and the product mix in border areas. Third, efforts should be taken, through various channels, to promote comprehensive exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries in the fields of economy, technology, trade, and labor services. Fourth, advances need to be made to further change the operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises in border areas and turn them into market-oriented enterprises. Moreover, we need to make rational readjustments to the organizational structure of medium and small enterprises, vigorously promote the nonstate-owned economies, and accelerate the development of township and town enterprises in border areas. Fifth, further efforts should be made to perfect the market system in border areas. Sixth, we must continue to reinforce and promote the lateral economic cooperative relations between the eastern and western parts of the country and further develop the economic and technological cooperation in border areas with both inland and coastal areas. Seventh, in line with the requirements to establish a socialist market economic structure and to open border areas to the outside world, we should actively explore ways to reform the investment, financial, banking, planning, circulation, and foreign trade structures in border areas. Opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance and development of Deng Xiaoping's ideas on building SEZs in the practice of reform and opening up. Our current efforts to expedite the opening up of border area will undoubtedly turn the economy of China's inland and border areas into a new force in China's economic development in the 1990's.
