Some of the leaflets demanded the Palestinian leadership not return to the negotiating table unless settlements are eradicated and an international force is deployed in the territories. There was nothing dramatically new in the content of the leaflets. They stated the position of the Palestinian opposition, which has been operating openly since the Oslo agreement was disclosed. However, there was a big change in the identity of the signatories. The name of 'Arafat's organization, Fatah, appeared in all of them, alongside that of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Democratic and the Popular Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine, and other opponents of the process. One such leaflet, signed by seven organizations, was distributed in Jericho; others appeared in places such as Hebron and Janin. What is interesting is that the leaflets did not appear out of the blue. They are the external manifestation of a profound process which has been gathering momentum since the Hebron massacre. A broad coalition has been emerging in the street and in internal circles, which has been pushing for a total halt of the talks. 'Arafat's closest advisers have been bending over backwards in a bid to find a way back to the negotiations, but as the situation appears now, no acrobatic formula will satisfy the local leadership in the territories. In fact, most Fatah activists in the cities have fallen into step with their erstwhile opponents. Many Fatah members in Hebron went as far as announcing their desertion to the ranks of Hamas. According to various reports, this "closing of ranks" around the opposition has had another effect: the resumption of terrorist activities against Israel. Israeli security elements are aware of the fact that instructions in that spirit have been sent from Tunis and Amman to Fatah gangs in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. However, even if such instructions had not been received from the outside, the disengagement from Oslo would have been inevitable. Many of these militant leaflets were written without the approval of the chairman in Tunis or his envoy in Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni. The latter tried to thwart attempts to bring about cooperation between the opposition and Fatah on the national level, but these efforts spurred al-Husayni's subordinates to take independent action.
