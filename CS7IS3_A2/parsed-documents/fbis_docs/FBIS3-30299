Significantly, the share of private sector production and sales increased in 1993. Private sector output, excluding farming, rose 22 percent. Production dropped about 8 percent (excluding agriculture), the drop in the state sector alone being 10 percent, Mr. Fratev told a news conference today. Industrial output dropped 10 percent from 1992 and sales went down 9 percent. The shrinkage in production was greatest in the food, machine engineering and textile industries. A total 8 percent growth in production was reported in power engineering, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, and the chemical and oil-processing industries, which account for 45 percent of the aggregate output. The private sector accounted for about 4 percent of industrial output in 1993. Sales in the private sector exceeded 9 billion leva (3.5 percent of industrial sales), a 29 percent rise over 1992 at comparable prices. At 57 percent the share of the private sector was biggest in retail trade, up from 46 percent in 1992, an increase by nearly one quarter, Mr. Fratev added. Inflation dropped 15.6 percent, from 79.5 percent in 1992 to 63.9 percent in 1993. Last year inflation began to be computed on a different basis from the 1990-92 period, when commodity turnover was the key indicator. The consumer price index, adopted as a key indicator of inflation in 1993, is calculated on the basis of monthly observations of the actual retail prices of a basket of 1,400 commodities and services. Food prices went up by an average 60.38 percent, non-foods 55.94 percent, and services 93.66 percent. Heating and energy outlays accounted for about 4 percentage points of the total consumer price increase. The upward trend of redundancies in the state and cooperative sector persisted in 1993, Mr. Fratev said. The employment figure for the state and cooperative sector (excluding agriculture) was 1,322,000, a drop of over 10 percent (about 152,000 persons) on 1992. Private sector employees numbered 750,000. The latest figures (by September 30, 1993) show unemployment in Bulgaria at 814,000, including 50,000 pensioners and 14,000 students seeking jobs. State and cooperative enterprises' obligations amounted to 167 billion leva by September 30, 1993, as against 125 billion in 1992. NSI forecasts do not envisage GDP growth in 1994.
