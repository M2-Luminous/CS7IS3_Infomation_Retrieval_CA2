A number of serious complaints were expressed in them, as well as in Ostankino broadcasts, addressed to Ukraine and its Ministry of Defense. Accusations were made that joint Ukrainian-Russian agreements on the fleet's financing were being violated. A number of figures are cited in this regard. For example, of the total credit of 96,977,700 karbovantsy allocated to the fleet as of 29 October 1993, Ukraine's share is only 22.6 percent, while in recent times it has grown even smaller. These and other data are cited with the blessing of the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet. Strange as it may seem, for some reason not one of the authors of the articles tried to discover the opinion of the other side--Ukraine--regarding these truly painful issues, and acquaint readers with it. To correct this omission I turned to the chief of the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy, Colonel Viktor Kobernik, who had participated as an expert in drafting and adopting the joint Ukrainian-Russian agreement on financing the Black Sea Fleet. "All numerical computations and financial data need to be meticulously checked in order to confirm or refute them," he emphasized. "Yet there are complaints against Ukraine that its Ministry of Defense should be allowed the possibility to carry out a documentary financial audit of the Black Sea Fleet jointly with representatives of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, in order to determine where money for the fleet is coming from, in what amounts, and where and for what needs it is being spent, who is overpaying, who is underpaying, and so on." However, initiatives undertaken on this account by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense in February, and then in July of last year, were rejected for some reason by the Russian side. This is despite the fact that according to statute the military districts (fleets) must undergo documentary financial audits not less than once every two years. And the last audit in the Black Sea Fleet was in July 1991. Had it occurred as required, in 1993, there probably would not have been any need for law enforcement agencies to investigate criminal cases associated with major material and financial abuses in the mine and torpedo arsenal base, and in the Black Sea Fleet fuel service. The joint agreement on financing the Black Sea Fleet in the transitional period (to 1995), drawn up and initialed in February of last year, foresees participation of Ukraine and Russia in equal shares of 50 percent. This agreement was subsequently confirmed in April 1993. When the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet announces that Ukraine's share in fleet financing was only 22.6 percent as of the end of October, and even lower after that, the personnel and the blue and white collar workers of the fleet develop a negative attitude toward the Ukrainian side. It is obviously this goal that the articles recently published on these issues pursue. However, the sad thing is that lies are being offered as truth, and many things are deliberately not being said, with the blessing of Colonel A. Zhukov. In particular, the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet has to know that Ukraine provided for 100 percent of the Black Sea Fleet's financing throughout practically all of 1992 and from 1 January 1993 to May 1993. Mutual settlements regarding these expenses have still not been carried out. Now about how the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet is manipulating the figures. Yes, according to agreements Ukraine's share should be 50 percent. By Colonel A. Zhukov's calculations this share is presently something else. But once again he is holding back a great deal of information. For example, about the amounts upon which his computations are based. The agreement does not allow unilateral financial actions. Even so, Russia unilaterally decided to introduce payment for the difference between the karbovanets and the ruble into the Black Sea Fleet. The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense also unilaterally assumed the responsibility of paying the expenses for this item. Thus, these expenses should not be included in Ukraine's percent share. Nor can the Ukrainian side assume responsibility for half of the expenses of maintaining those vessels and ships that raised the flag of St. Andrew. It would be wrong, after all, for any self-respecting power to pay those who insult its national worth! Some other nuances of this complex problem could be brought up as well. As they say, money likes to be counted. And it is precisely such an accounting that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense proposes. It is completely incomprehensible why the RF Ministry of Defense and the Black Sea Fleet are opposed to this. You would think that they should be the ones who are most interested in clarifying and resolving the arising misunderstandings. I would like to pass along another extremely interesting fact. In early December 1993 the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense appropriated 21 billion karbovantsy in payment of the Black Sea Fleet's debt to ship repair plants. It wanted to be sure that the enterprise collectives would receive their wages in time. The financing was carried out according to established procedure by the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy. However, on 8 December the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet returned the money to us with the following explanation: "The indicated amount will be credited to the budget account of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet by decision of the Black Sea Fleet commander only if the transfer is made directly by the financial directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, and not through the Ukrainian Navy." It is incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet took the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's attempt to finance the ship repair plants through the financial and economic directorate of the Russian Navy as such an insult. And the latter grossly violated the February agreement, which prescribes transfer of money to the Black Sea Fleet through the Ukrainian National Bank, by using the services of commercial structures; for example, to the Omtek-Biznes firm through the Mosbiznesbank. This choice was made by the Russian side. As for why, who knows? On the other hand, throughout all of 1993 Ukraine insistently offered to continue 100 percent financing of the Black Sea Fleet through centralized mutual settlements with the RF Ministry of Defense through the National Bank (50 by 50 percent), as is foreseen by the joint February agreement. In this case any interruptions in issuing pay and other payments to the personnel would have been excluded. There is one other tactical maneuver of the Black Sea Fleet command I would like to discuss. It's no secret to us that many Black Sea Fleet admirals and officers capitalize on various loopholes to get their pay in rubles much more often than once a year (when departing on leave). Subsequently converting them into karbovantsy in various ways, they acquire a good "nest egg." This is hardly to the liking of the officers, shore-based and seagoing warrant officers, and employees of the Black Sea Fleet whose position does not allow them to do this. In short, there are many financial nuances in the Black Sea Fleet, ones which the command has no intention of discussing fully. And as a distracting maneuver, various insinuations are being made and a purposeful effort is being conducted to influence public opinion and arouse negative emotions. It is obviously precisely for these reasons that the Black Sea Fleet will never agree to such inspections, and all the more so to a documentary financial audit. Even though this would be the best way to shed some light on the real state of affairs.
