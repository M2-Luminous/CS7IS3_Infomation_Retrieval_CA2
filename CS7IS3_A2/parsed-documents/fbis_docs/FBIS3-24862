The airport has also been occupied by heavily armed soldiers. We have just received this news from an AFP photographer who was on the scene. Tension has remained high in the Burundi capital since clashes broke out on Monday [31 January]. There is said to be relative calm at the moment. The violence of the last two days has claimed 46 lives, according to the latest toll from the Burundi police. This morning opposition parties met with the army high command to ask the army to mediate in their talks with the government on the appointment of a successor to assassinated president Melchior Ndadaye. Still on the subject of Burundi, the Organization of African Unity is still unsure about sending troops to Burundi. An advance group of 200 soldiers drawn from several African countries was due to arrive in Burundi to protect the ministers of the Kinigi government, but the operation has now been delayed by the latest outbreak of violence.
