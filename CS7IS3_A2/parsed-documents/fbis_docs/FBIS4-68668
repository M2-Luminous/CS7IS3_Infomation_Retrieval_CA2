Asin; date and place not given] [Text] The Kabardino-Balkaria Republic Organization of the Agrarian Party of Russia (APR) was created at the founding meeting in Nalchik recently. The party's Program and Rules were approved and appropriate corrections to account for the specifics of the region and the republic were made in these documents. The party was registered on 25 March. The new party's governing board was elected and its members included Z. Kh. Balkizov, chairman of the Germenchik Kolkhoz, M. M. Klevtsov, chairman of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] State Land Committee, C. Z. Shavayev, his deputy, A. T. Kushkhov, the minister of agriculture and food, Z. M. Taov, the head of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food kolkhoz organizing department, K. S. Kuchmenov, chairman of Agrosnab [Agricultural Supply System], V. I. Punarzhi, chairman of the KBR Agrarian Union, and Z. Kh. Shogenov, chairman of the Kolkhoz imeni Lenin in Chegemskiy Rayon. Ch. M. Beslaneyev, who headed the Shalushkinskiy Sovkhoz for the last several years, was elected chairman of the governing board. Our interview is about the motives for creating the new party and its goals and tasks. [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, the Agrarian Party headed by Lapshin is one of the most influential in Russia. As I understand it, you are a part of the all-Russian party of agrarians. What are the motives for creating this republic party? [Beslaneyev] Yes, we are the republic, Kabardino-Balkaria Organization of the APR. As for the second part of the question, I will say right away that we do not intend to "plug" the gaps in the political vacuum which once formed. It is now so overflowing with so many parties and movements of the most varied persuasions and all colors of the rainbow that not even a small niche left for another can be found in that space. The people are confused not only about their program documents but even their names. Fortunately, this boom has not hit our republic so hard. The essence of the motives. The economic, political, and social standing of agriculture has been reduced to a critical point. The state has not implemented the so-called shock therapy as such in even one sector of the economy. If it were conducted in a decisive, well-considered, and sober manner, the state and the entire economy would have wakened and gotten going long ago. In 1991 state social programs in rural areas were supported with budget financing at a level of 22 percent for housing construction, 31 percent for social-domestic objects, and 67 percent for roads. In 1992 less than half as much money was directed to the social sphere as in 1991. This past year the volume of capital investments in rural areas declined again by half as compared to 1992. Because of the price "crunch" and the enormous state debts to kolkhozes and sovkhozes, rural residents, and they account for 26 percent of the entire population, live in extremely tough economic and domestic conditions. Proceeds for the output of fields and farms received by the treasuries of kolkhozes and sovkhozes fell short by more than 1.5 trillion rubles [R] and R800 billion worth of budget allocations. The state is buying agricultural output abroad while 35 percent of the rye from the harvest grown in Russia remains unsold, 67 percent of the vegetables, 76 percent of the long-stemmed flax, 24 percent of the animal fat, and 59 percent of the wool. It has become difficult to sell all types of grain, meat, and meat products in many regions. [Asin] In our republic too, in my opinion. I have information on unsold meat at the meat combine and unclaimed first generation hybrid seeds in the republic's grain elevators. [Beslaneyev] You are absolutely right. Here is one more example of how the peasant is really being robbed. Only 28 percent of the earnings from the sale of grain are left for the grain producers, while one-fifth goes to trade and 40 percent to grain receivers. The list of examples of excess being created in the agricultural complex would take up a great deal of time. Suffice it to mention that as a result of all this, a foundation has been laid for further degradation of agriculture. As of today, Agroprom [Agroindustry] is unable to ensure simple reproduction using its own resources. So in these conditions, it has become urgently necessary to create a strong political party able to keep agriculture from breaking down for good. [Asin] The appearance of such a political party which sets such goals is a gratifying thing. What ways do you see to achieve them? [Beslaneyev] This would be the most reliable path: the diversity and equality of various forms of ownership and economic activity on land must be achieved and commercial reforms based on long-term scientific programs must be conducted on the state level. We support the priorities of development of the agroindustrial complex. The primary task is overcoming the opinion which has become fixed in social consciousness that the peasantry is conservative and politically backward. They must take a proper place in society. [Asin] What methods do you intend to use to achieve your goals? [Beslaneyev] Only constitutional means and political methods. We intend to participate actively in elections to the state organs of power. We realize very clearly that only those who truly express the will of the majority can count on success and have this moral right. People have had enough populist slogans and unfulfilled and deliberately unfeasible promises. The rural laborer is tired of them. In our work we will cooperate with other political parties, trade unions, and public movements and organizations. [Asin] What will be the foundations of this cooperation? [Beslaneyev] Cooperating with organizations and movements whose goals and tasks are close to ours as well as with power structures does not mean abandoning our program goals and tasks. We will follow them strictly. But we will begin from the need to unite the efforts of political parties, structures of parliament and executive power, and the healthy forces of society in the cause of uplifting and strengthening the agrarian sector and restoring the traditional way of life in the countryside. We also take into account that our republic is largely an agrarian one and most of the population has rural roots. The countryside has been and continues to be the keeper of the national culture and traditions of the Kabardins, Balkars, and Cossacks. [Asin] What do you consider the most important position, the most important question? [Beslaneyev] There is perhaps no tougher or more fundamental question in our work than the question of land. The approach to resolving it cannot be the same even in conditions of different rayons within the republic itself. Even less acceptable is a mechanical transfer to Kabardino-Balkaria of models developed somewhere else. Our party supports the outright transfer of land parcels to ownership with the right of lifetime possession and bequest. But only to those who live and work on it or want to obtain it exclusively for production of agricultural output, horticulture, or gardening. But at the same time, we are against haste in resolving the question of the free buying and selling of land. In the republic's conditions, this may lead to redistribution of land in favor of persons who have nothing to do with agricultural production and to unpredictable consequences. We must not allow land to become an object of speculation and enrichment of rich people. Yes, we are for the equality of multistructural forms of economic activity on the land. We believe that private farming must not be "under the thumb." But we must not go to extremes. For development of peasant (private) farms does not presuppose the mandatory suffocation of collective forms of economic activity on the land. But it is clear that in the present stage of the reforms in Agroprom, private farmers still cannot, as they say, feed the country. There are many reasons for this: we do not have the small equipment needed for small farms, the tax system is imperfect, and private farmers' relations with the processing enterprises are becoming extremely difficult. We must understand that the development of private farming, especially given the shortage of arable land, is the longest, most capital intensive, and most inefficient way. There are, of course, barriers of a psychological and professional nature. Already the first experiments have shown how the peasant farmer must be trained in many things. By no means is everyone ready for this now. If excesses triumph here, we risk sliding down the path of the inefficient, subsistence form of economic activity typical of underdeveloped countries. [Asin] But is there other experience? [Beslaneyev] We usually like to refer to the United States. In fact, the American agrarian sector is oriented to large market agricultural enterprises. This type of economic activity can be created on the base of kolkhozes and sovkhozes without large additional expenditures. I want to be understood correctly: There will be no obstacles to those private farmers who want to and in fact do everything necessary to use the land efficiently or to those for whom this difficult job is not a sideline but their life's work. They can and will successfully coexist with other forms of labor organization. Large commodity producers will be no obstacle to them. [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, what organizational plans does the party's governing board have? [Beslaneyev] Anyone who is even a little tempted by this work understands that in the future we cannot do without a precise organizational structure. We are going to create our own cells in the villages from people who understand and sympathize with our ideas and program. Then will follow their joining into rayon organizations. It would probably be appropriate to stipulate that we do not plan to revive a communist-oriented party. We have precise practical goals where the economic and social orientation predominates. But for now we face the work of explaining our Rules and Program. I believe that we have already taken the first step in this direction with this conversation. We see clearly that without detailed knowledge and a sense of the problems bothering rural residents we will not rally people around us. The Agrarian Party will work hard to preserve the republic's integrity and indoctrinate the rising generation in the best traditions of our peoples. We are not striving for self-isolation; our program includes close cooperation with all branches of power, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and with elected and management organs. In defending the interests of rural commodity producers, we will rely on solid knowledge of the state of affairs in local areas. [Asin] To judge from the makeup of the APR governing board, there is good potential for this. In my opinion, a solid "team" has been chosen, one able to create a party which in terms of size is a mass party and in terms of quality a competent one. I sincerely wish you well, may you have success in your work, and thank you for the interview.
