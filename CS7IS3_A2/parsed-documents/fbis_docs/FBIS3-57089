The discussion proceeded in a businesslike atmosphere. The deputies, who took the floor during the discussion, arrived at the conclusion that the vast legislative programme, submitted by People's Deputy Mikhail Mityukov, had to be examined in detail and finalised in Duma committees. This refers primarily to the package of economic legislations. Deputy Sergey Kalashnikov, moved to hear a government report on the concept of the economic reform. He claimed that the economic policy, conducted by the cabinet in recent years, "completely overlooked the human factor". The speaker stressed that "Russia needs workable economic laws that will not merely discharge populist functions". In his opinion, it is necessary, first and foremost, to map out the main directions of the social policy, to elaborate laws on employment and on the minimum consumers budget. Deputy Sergey Glazyev moved to discuss primarily the presidential decrees submitted to the two chambers of the parliament. He stressed the need for clearly determined priorities in drawing up legislations. This idea was backed by other MPs. Deputy Lyudmila Zavadskaya described as deplorable the lot of women and children in Russia. She stressed that these problems needed legal regulation. Deputy Nikolay Kotov believes that the Duma should adopted first of all laws governing the work of the agro-industrial complex, land relations, and also the taxation police and social insurance. Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov insisted that questions linked with the military service and participation of Russian troops in peace- keeping actions abroad brooked no delay. Several deputies moved to revise the conversion programme, to bring legislative acts in line with the new Russian constitution. Deputy Viktor Ustinov tabled a motion to elaborate primarily a bill on the restoration of the constitutional court.
