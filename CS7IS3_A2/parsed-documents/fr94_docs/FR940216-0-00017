FR940216-0-00017 FR940216-0-00007 The requirement concerning the color of the contrasting background for the warning has been changed from the proposal in response to a comment from Ford. Ford suggested that red and orange be permitted in addition to yellow. NHTSA is permitting those similarly bright and attention-attracting colors. Ford also suggested that the color be required only for the word ``WARNING'' at the beginning of the required statement, instead of the entire statement. NHTSA is requiring the entire statement to be printed against the color contrasting background to maximize the conspicuity of the warning. Volkswagen objected to the requirement that the letters be capitalized, stating that manufacturers should be allowed to decide on the print format. NHTSA disagrees. Standard 213 requires important safety messages on the proper use of child restraints to be capitalized. These include a warning that the consequences of failing to follow the manufacturer's use instructions can result in the child striking the vehicle's interior in a crash (S5.5.2(g)), and directions on snugly adjusting the child restraint belts around the child (S5.5.2(h)) and on placing an infant restraint so that it is rear-facing (S5.5.2(k)). The air bag warning is as important as these messages. Requiring the information to be capitalized is consistent with the present labeling requirement of S5.5.2 to capitalize such information, and increases the likelihood that the consumer will notice and read the information. However, NHTSA will revisit this issue when it reviews all labeling requirements. Printed Instructions This rule amends S5.6.1 to add a requirement that the printed instructions for rear-facing infant restraints must provide a warning against using rear-facing restraints at seating positions equipped with air bags and must explain the reasons for the warning and consequences of not following it. NHTSA is also requiring that the instructions include a statement that owners of vehicles with front passenger side air bags should refer to their vehicle owner's manual for child seat installation instructions. The agency adopted the latter requirement in response to a suggestion from Volkswagen. Effective March 1994, the owner's manual of each vehicle having a front passenger side air bag must include information on the proper positioning of occupants, including children, at seating positions equipped with an air bag. The information must include any necessary precautions that should be heeded for the safety of those occupants. The requirement adopted today for infant restraint instructions complements the requirement for the vehicle owner's manual. Effect on Future Designs
