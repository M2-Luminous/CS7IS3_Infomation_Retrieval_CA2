A resident of the northeastern border town of Narva, Pyotr Rozhok, has identified himself as the representative of Zhirinovsky's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia. "Concrete proof is needed to sanction legal action against Rozhok," Kama said. He added that a decision on Rozhok's possible arrest had to come from the country's Defense Police. The minister said defense police officials first have to make sure if Rozhok really was a member of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party. The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, told BNS Rozhok was having a membership card of the party. "But we cannot claim with full confidence that he is the party's official representative in Estonia," Pihl said. He added that Zhirinovsky's party had a few dozens of members in Estonia. The security police chief said Rozhok in his statements had voiced disrespectfulness toward the Estonian president, the government and members of the parliament. "I cannot say if this is sufficient for initiating criminal proceedings," he said. The chief spokesman for the Russian Liberal Democrats, Eduard Yermolayev, confirmed to BNS that Rozhok was the party's official representative in Estonia.
