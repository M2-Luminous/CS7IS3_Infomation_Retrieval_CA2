Liu Zhixiong, deputy-president of the CGWIC, said that Optus B3 will be sent into space aboard a Long March 2e launch vehicle at the Xichang satellite launch center in Sichuan Province in the second half of this year. Liu said that the launch services contract was finalized by both parties after more than one year of discussions and joint efforts. In addition, both parties also signed a long-term co-operation agreement today for the launching of an additional ten Hughes-built communications satellites in the coming 12 years. Hughes is a well-known manufacturer of communications satellites, occupying some 60 percent of the worldwide commercial communications satellite market. It was one of the earliest Western satellite manufacturers to do business with the CGWIC. Its products, Asiasat-1 and an Australian-owned communications satellite, have already been successfully launched by the CGWIC. The two sides have contracted to launch the Hughes-built Apstar-1 and Apstar-2, as well as the Optus B3 this year, and hope to extend their co-operation in the space field in the near future.
