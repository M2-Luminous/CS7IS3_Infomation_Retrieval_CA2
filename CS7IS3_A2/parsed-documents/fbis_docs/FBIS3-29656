Follow-up steps"] [Text] It is certainly a welcome turn of affairs that Pyongyang has at long last found itself obliged to abide by the rules of the international community. After nerve-wrecking months of dickering and bickering with the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], North Korea decided to open some of its nuclear facilities to international inspectors -- just a few days before the IAEA was to convene its general meeting to decide whether it should refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the Security Council of the United Nations. Although the North Korean stance in this regard is still clouded in ambiguity, it is our sincere wish that the to-be-resumed inspection will help Pyongyang shed the infamy earned in the international community for its obstinate obsession with nuclear armament and other unsavory behavior. The North Korean decision to remain within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), if accompanied by necessary deeds including reopening of the now-deadlocked dialogue with Seoul, can surely clear stumbling blocks for Pyongyang to progress in talks with the United States and Japan toward rapprochement. All is not settled with the decision alone, however. What is important, and perhaps more crucial, is how sincerely Pyongyang abides by the terms of the NPT. North Korea must act without intentional procrastination while abiding faithfully by all provisions of the NPT, and readily and honestly submit its nuclear installations to international inspections including those, for example, in the suspected Yongbyon and other areas. The Pyongyang regime is advised to accept IAEA inspections as soon as possible so as not to arouse unnecessary suspicion unless it has an ulterior motive for lingering. Surely, the sooner the better for the North if it is really interested in obtaining the confidence required to salvage its faltering economy. It should waste no time in issuing visas to IAEA inspectors who are all packed and ready to travel. Regrettably, North Korea has so far rejected Seoul's repeated calls for mutual inspections of suspected sites in both Koreas. An early conduct of such trial inspections would certainly relieve Pyongyang of any suspicions that might arise in the course of implementing procedural steps. The inter-Korea inspections, based on the denuclearization declaration of the Korean Peninsula, will be an important step that can, if followed up by action, lead Pyongyang to gain international trust badly needed for its viability. Now that it has decided to allow IAEA inspectors into its nuclear facilities, North Korea has no option but to sincerely, and more importantly, quickly, implement required measures. It would be folly for North Korea to remain under suspicion simply by fumbling with excuses. There will be no way to conceal Pyongyang's ulterior nuclear intentions, if any.
