The 12 present Member States of the European Union have agreed that, in the hypothesis where four new Member States will join the Union, the threshold necessary for a qualified majority required by the treaties shall be fixed at 64 votes. They have also agreed that the question of the reform of the institutions, including the weighting of votes and the threshold of the qualified majority in the Council, shall be examined during the Conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States which shall be convened in 1996, in accordance with article N, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on European Union. b. Besides, they have agreed to invite the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to establish a report on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union. These reports will provide input for the work of a Reflection Group of Representatives of the Foreign Ministers which should be created by the European Council in Corfu and start its work in mid-1995. This Group will work in association with the European Parliament. It will, inter alia, prepare options based on the positions and arguments of all Member States on the weighting of votes and on the threshold of the qualified majority decisions, taking into account future enlargement. c. They have taken note that the Council has decided that, if Members of the Council representing a total of 23 to 26 votes indicate their intention to oppose the adoption by the Council of a decision by qualified majority, the Council will do all in its power to reach, within a reasonable time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by the Treaties and by secondary law, such as in Articles 189b and 189c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a satisfactory solution that could be adopted by at least 68 votes. During this period, and always respecting the Rules of Procedure of the Council, the President undertakes with the assistance of the Commission any initiative necessary to facilitate a wider basis of agreement in the Council. The members of the Council lend him their assistance. d. They have finally agreed that the different elements of the present Declaration shall continue to be in operation until entry into force of an amendment to the Treaties, following the 1996 Conference. 2.
