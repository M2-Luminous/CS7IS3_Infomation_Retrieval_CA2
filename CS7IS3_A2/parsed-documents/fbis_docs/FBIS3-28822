Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK at the Japan-U.S. summit talks that "Japan will take every possible action within the framework of the Constitution," Hashimoto criticized the prime minister, and said: "We are greatly concerned whether Japan will be allowed to take actions within the framework of the Constitution in case this issue is turned over to the UN Security Council for debate. Since it is not the United States but Japan that will be asked to make sensible responses, how can the prime minister remain so calm?" Thus, Hashimoto indicated his strong concern as to whether the government would be sufficiently able to respond quickly to the increasingly tense situation in the Far East.
