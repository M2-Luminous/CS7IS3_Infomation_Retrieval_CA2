Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out disagreements and work out a compromise. The most probable solution would be to leave half of 3,400 draftees in the Crimea and send 20 per cent (about 680 people) to the Ukrainian Army and 1,000 (about 30 per cent) to the Black Sea Fleet, he said. Kuznetsov said the other half will be sent to adjacent Ukrainian regions for military training since the Crimea does not have enough training facilities and expressed the hope that 30 to 40 per cent of them will return to the Republic upon the completion of studying. Speaking about the autumn drafting campaign, Kuznetsov said that "we hope all prerequisites and conditions will be created for military service in the Crimea."
