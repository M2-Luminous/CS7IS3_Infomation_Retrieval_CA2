Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos G. Cordero announced the measure, stating that the suspension of flights to Haiti complies with the commercial blockade imposed by the United Nations and the OAS against the Raoul Cedras military regime. Cordero told the media that yesterday, "acting President Guillermo Ford Boyd signed the decree establishing the prohibition of flights to Port-au-Prince effective 26 June." COPA was the only Latin American airline covering the route to the Caribbean nation. Regarding this measure, a COPA source said the company does not yet have the official notification from the central government. The airline official said that General Manager Pedro Heilbron will be returning from a trip to Miami tomorrow and that Deputy Manager Moises Veliz is on vacation. When LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA previously interviewed Heilbron, he said the company "will comply with the government's order as long as the U.S. airlines suspend their commercial flights to Haiti." According to Heilbron, the U.S. companies "did not comply" with the previous two sanctions established by the international organizations against the Caribbean island. The COPA flights to Haiti mainly carry Haitian businessmen and merchants coming to Panama to make purchases in the Colon Free Zone.
