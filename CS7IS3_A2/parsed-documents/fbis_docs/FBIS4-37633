The Druk National Congress (DNC), made up of people from the north and eats of the country known as Druks, plans to fight for free speech, freedom from oppression, among other things, DNC Chairman Rongthang Kunley Dorji told a press conference here. "You are all aware that these freedoms do not exist in Bhutan and it is this fact that has left us with no other recourse except to launch a body whose aim is to bring recognition of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Bhutan and also protect these rights under ... an independent judiciary," Dorji said. "Due to lack of human rights and an independent judiciary, the situation in present day Bhutan has deteriorated to such an extent that the citizens are treated as 'oxen without horns' and forced to live under very oppressive conditions by the regime," he said. Dorji said they had formed the party in Nepal instead of India as New Delhi has an extradition treaty with Bhutan. "If we were found raising voice against the Bhutanese king or the government, we may be immediately deported to Bhutan to be handed over to the Bhutanese Government," he said. More than 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepalese descent are currently living in refugee camps run by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees after fleeing their country following the imposition of laws forcing them to adopt Bhutanese customs or face punishment.
