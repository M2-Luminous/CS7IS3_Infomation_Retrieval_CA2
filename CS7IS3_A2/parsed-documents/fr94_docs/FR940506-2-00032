The change in regulations eliminates the SSI (Supplemental Security Income) adjustment to income eligibility used in prior years. No volunteer currently participating in these programs shall become ineligible as a result of this change in guidelines. In accordance with the revised program regulations, the income eligibility level for each State is 125 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guidelines, except in those areas determined by the Corporation to be of higher cost of living in which case the guideline shall be 135 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guidelines. The level of eligibility is rounded to the next highest multiple of $5.00. For purposes of determining eligibility, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the applicable FGP/SCP income guideline is deductible from gross income for out-of-pocket medical expenses of the applicant, enrollee, or spouse. Any person whose income is not more than 100 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guideline for her/his specific family unit shall be given special consideration for participation in the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs.
