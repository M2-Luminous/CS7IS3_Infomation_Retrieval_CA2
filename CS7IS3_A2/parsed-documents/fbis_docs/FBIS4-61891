Kazimirov said that "Rasul Guliyev signed the Bishkek document with two reservations". Instead of "captured territories", Guliyev wrote "occupied territories" and to the word "monitors", he added the word "international". "These reservations practically change nothing but the Azeri party thinks that it is very important", mentioned Kazimirov. In his answer to the whether these amendments to the Bishkek document forwarded by the Azeri party will be adopted, Kazimirov said that "this document was signed in Bishkek by the representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS, secretary general of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS the chairman of the Kyrgyzstan Parliament and myself as representative of the Russian president. For all those who signed it in Bishkek, the text will remain the same. Probably, the Azeri party expressed it particular opinion of this text". According to Kazimirov, "the document was signed by the representatives of the legislative bodies which have created important political ground for the beginning of the settlement to the conflict". "All concrete issues coming out of the protocol must be settled by executive powers, or presidents, premiers and defense ministers", said Kazimirov. Kazimirov said that during his meeting with President Aliyev on Sunday "they agreed to order a cease in hostilities". "On the other hand, I know that Stepanakert has been already ordered to cease hostilities since I spoke with Stepankert by phone just now", said Kazimirov. But according to Kazimirov "there is no official agreement on a cease-fire between the parties, each party orders a cease in hostilities itself", mentioned special envoy of the Russian president. "The matter concerning concluding the agreement on a cease-fire has yet to be discussed", said Kazimirov. "The fact is that Baku and Stepanakert must conclude an agreement over the cease-fire themselves", mentioned Kazimirov. "Baku sees the conflict as one between Armenia and Azerbaijan while Yerevan believes that this is a conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia is not involved in it. Such propagandistic sentiments by Yerevan do not allow the parties to move towards political settlement of the conflict. Kazimirov said that the Russian party believes that "one of the obstacles in the way of settlement of the conflict is Azerbaijan's non-recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, the party to the conflict". He added that "it is up to Azerbaijan to recognize it or not". "But recognition of the party to the conflict is necessary in order to know with whom to sign the agreement for a cease-fire". Prior to the Bishkek summit, the Azeri Parliament made the decision to not sign the Bishkek Protocol because its provisions contradict the interests of Azerbaijan.
