The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries found in a probe that dealers have discounted commissions for futures transactions of gold, Azuki beans and other commodities for the sake of specific investors in breach of the commodity exchange law, government sources said. Officially, however, the ministries deny any such misconduct by the dealers, the sources said. The ministries will take no particular punitive actions against the dealers. Under the law, the practice of commission discounting is banned and violators could face fines or other penalties, although no cases of violation have ever been reported. Japan's relatively high commissions -- seven to eight times more for gold futures than on the New York market -- puts local dealers at a disadvantage in international competition. Therefore, it is widely seen as "common sense" among dealers to change commissions from customer to customer in order to survive. "We cannot compete unless we discount (commissions)," an official with one firm said. Responding to calls from Japanese traders, the government plans to partially liberalize the commissions in June. The planned liberalization, however, will be limited to commissions for foreign investors and commodity funds apparently because sweeping deregulation would hurt smaller dealers, the sources said.
