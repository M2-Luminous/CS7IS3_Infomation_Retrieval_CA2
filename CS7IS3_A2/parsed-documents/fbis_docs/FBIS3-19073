The measures have deepened our country's dependence on the United States and European Union, something that today, one month after the measures were imposed, cannot be denied. What has followed the measures leaves no room for misinterpretation or different views. The Western allies who caused the problem with the barrage of recognitions of the neighboring republic have aggravated things anew by ignoring the positions of the Greek Government. They now come as mediators, brokers, and cool evaluators of the situation, with advice and threats, judgments, and criticism. [passage omitted] The course of developments should change, even now. The measures against FYROM should be lifted and the stirring of nationalism and chauvinism should stop. If nothing else, when these feelings reach extremes, as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, they only bring war, hatred, and the bestiality of man. Direct dialogue with the neighboring state should begin now, away from the tentacles of the "protectors." Doesn't their involvement in the Cyprus issue over 40 years prove that they bring tragedy to a country?
