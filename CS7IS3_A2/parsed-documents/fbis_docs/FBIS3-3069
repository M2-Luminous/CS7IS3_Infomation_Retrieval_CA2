Commercial enterprises used to engage only in commodity sales. But this kind of resource distribution was often inefficient and failed to meet the demand in an increasingly competitive market. Since 1992 such enterprises have been experimenting with annexing loss-making manufacturers and found that combining commerce with industry works to restore profitability. Many commercial establishments with solid financial standing have opened their own factories, mostly through annexing inefficient industrial operations. The assets flow in the commercial sector helps expansion of their businesses, creates a larger market share and brings in more business.
