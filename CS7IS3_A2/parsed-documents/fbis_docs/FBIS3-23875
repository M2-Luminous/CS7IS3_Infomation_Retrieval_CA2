Yeltsin and Republic of Tatarstan President M. Shaymiyev. An event took place that was long awaited and that has no precedents. Expressing the will of the multiethnic people of Tatarstan and of the whole Russian Federation, the treaty makes a significant contribution to the revival of Russia and to the construction of a democratic federation. On the other hand, it performs a kind of summing up of the legal-state development of the Republic of Tatarstan under contemporary conditions from the moment of the adoption of the Declaration of the State Sovereignty of Tatarstan to the adoption of its new constitution of 1992. The concluded treaty, undoubtedly, is of a reformative nature. With respect to it, the term "for the first time" can be used repeatedly. For the first time, it is bilateral; for the first time, it is in two languages (Tatar and Russian), and for the first time, it is signed at the highest level. The treaty was created in controversy, in a search for compromises, and in the resolution of difficult questions, ready answers to which simply did not exist in nature. The accumulated negotiating experience has political significance, and it is a new word in diplomacy. But it also affirmed the value of such generally accepted categories in the civilized world as mutual respect, equality of rights, and cooperation. This is why, contrary to the aspiration of some political forces to belittle the fact of the signing of this historic document, it is possible to say with full confidence: There are no losers here. But there are winners. They are people of various nationalities, common sense, and courage. This, finally, is the common future of Russia and Tatarstan. A detailed analysis of the treaty lies ahead, but it is very important today to emphasize its legitimacy. The treaty rests upon the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, and, of course, upon the international legal obligations of the Russian Federation, in particular those that result from the generally accepted rights of people to self-determination and equality of rights. The treaty opens with a preamble that sets forth the principles of unification of the Republic of Tatarstan as a state with the Russian Federation. Among these are voluntariness, territorial integrity, unity of the economic space, and preservation and development of historical and national traditions, cultures, and languages, and the priority of human rights and freedoms... The subsequent articles disclose the exclusive powers of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Russian Federation, their organs, and also the joint powers. They encompass the political, socioeconomic, and spiritual spheres. The sides also coordinated the mechanisms for implementing these powers. The main ones among them will be intergovernmental agreements, other understandings, and joint commissions and structures. Already today, 11 agreements that regulate various questions (from environmental protection to coordination of the fight against crime) have begun to function. The treaty is going into effect. In greeting all of the newspaper's readers with the holiday, we want to call on them to actively participate in the process of its implementation, and there is enough work for everyone. And as the ancient philosophers said, when you see great work ahead, you experience enormous joy. Especially since this work is for the people and for our children.
