Glazkov, G.A. Tirskiy, V.G. Shcherbak, Moscow; UDC 533.6.011.8] [Abstract] Steady-state supersonic flow of a viscous chemically and thermodynamically nonequilibrium gas mixture about a smooth blunt body is considered on the basis of a model of parabolized Navier-Stokes equations which are an asymptotic form of Navier-Stokes equations under specific constraints in a body axes system of coordinates. The slip, temperature shock, and catalytic atom recombination effects on the wall are taken into account in defining the boundary conditions. The effect of nonequilibrium excitation of translational and vibrational degrees of freedom on the dissociation reactions is examined. A numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations is sought by the method of global pressure gradient iterations. For illustration, the results of numerical calculations of hypersonic flow about an axisymmetric hyperboloid which simulates a space shuttle vehicle streamline within an 85-110 km attitude range are presented. A model with different vibrational temperatures of molecular components is also considered whereby the inverse impact of chemical reactions on vibrational relaxation is taken into account. The findings are compared to the results direct statistical simulation by the Monte Carlo method for the same conditions. Figures 5; references 14: 6 Russian, 8 Western.
