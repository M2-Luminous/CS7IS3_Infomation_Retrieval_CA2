The total number of acres that would be affected by the Pipeline Project is approximately 1,880 acres. The DEIS focuses on the environmental impacts projected to result from implementation of the proposed action and viable alternatives to the proposal. Specific subjects receiving emphasis in the DEIS are: (1) The proposed dewatering rate of up to 30,000 gallons per minute (GPM) and the associated affects related to the dewatering; (2) socioeconomic impacts to the regional infrastructure from the construction work force and increased permanent work force; (3) air quality issues; (4) and cumulative impacts resulting from the extensive mining in the area. A copy of the DEIS will be sent to all individuals, agencies and groups who have expressed interest in the Pipeline Project EIS process, and a limited number of copies are available upon request from the District Manager at the above address.
