FR940927-2-00011 FR940927-2-00009 Disposal options considered and eliminated were capped aquatic disposal (CAD), an upland disposal facility (CDF), near-shore confined disposal (NCDF), and a combination of PSDDA and NCDF. Although an alternative requiring less dredging or ``no action'' would have fewer environmental impacts (but would not fulfill the purpose and need for the project), the dredging and dredged material disposal methods chosen will have the least practicable impacts and are environmentally preferred. Transfer of the dredged material designated for upland disposal from marine to upland transportation will occur at a shoreside transfer area located near the west side of PSNS. The shoreside transfer area will be paved with an impervious pavement and curbing to prevent penetration of liquids into subsurface soils, or uncontrolled release into Sinclair Inlet. Within this area, dredged materials will be segregated according to moisture content, and loaded onto trucks for transport to the landfill. Runoff will be directed to sumps that will be used to convey water to settling tanks before discharging into Sinclair Inlet. If the moisture content of the dredged materials is too high for disposal at the landfill site, soil stabilization/solidification treatment measures will be employed to mitigate the problems. Materials that are acceptable to the landfill will not be treated prior to disposal. Treatment will be through the addition of a portland cement/pozzolan mixture and/or additional drying. In a portland cement/pozzolan reaction, portland cement is combined with flyash or other pozzolan to produce a sediment-concrete mixture. Water is entrained in the hydration of the portland cement. The moist material will be screened and mechanically fed to a pugmill-type mixing plant. Portland cement/pozzolan soil additives are added through pneumatic system to the pugmill mixer. The treated material will be delivered to the landfill storage site thoroughly mixed and relatively uniform in appearance with all ingredients evenly distributed. The preferred site for upland disposal is the OVSL in Kitsap County. The RRL and CRLRC are designated as alternative sites to provide flexibility and ensure project completion. Although OVSL has enough capacity for the volume determined to be unsuitable for open-water disposal, unforeseen circumstances related to dredging, transportation, or landfill operations could adversely affect the overall project schedule. Rather than delay the project, the alternative disposal sites would be used until use of the OVSL is reestablished. Use of these sites would involve the same process as described above for dewatering and treatment, but transportation would occur by rail car rather than by truck. Dredging causes localized short-term effects on water quality in the immediate vicinity of the dredge operation. This will be mitigated through the use of regulatory dilution zones and water quality monitoring during the dredging operation. If water quality effects exceed these of regulatory requirements, such as alterations in pH value, dissolved oxygen, and/or turbidity to an unacceptable quantity, the dredging operation will be halted until the cause of the water quality degradation is identified and mitigated. Dredging is allowed to proceed only after all practicable measures are taken to correct the problem. The FSEIS and water quality permits provide water quality mitigation requirements. These requirements are a part of the construction specification detailing approaches and equipment requirements to maintain environmental quality. Temporary losses will occur in benthic infauna, epifauna, and other bottom dwelling organisms through destruction of existing benthic habitat in the area affected by dredging. However, these losses are anticipated to be recovered within about a year after completion of the work. Dredging operation, tug-barge transportation, and truck/train hauling operation will produce short term localized increases in air emissions and noise. No safety related effects are anticipated from these impacts. The affected area is in attainment with clean air standards and an air conformity analysis is not required. The SEIS was prepared by the Navy in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region X; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District; Washington State Department of Ecology; City of Bremerton; and the Suquamish Tribe. The FSEIS was distributed to agencies and officials of federal, state and local governments, citizen groups and associates, public libraries, and other interested parties for review. The comment period ended on September 6, 1994. All significant issues identified were resolved through discussions with concerned agencies and parties.
