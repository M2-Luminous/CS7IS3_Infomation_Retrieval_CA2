The communique was released following the government's decision to forcefully reduce all coca crops in the Chapare region and to mobilize Coca Reduction Directorate (DIRECO) agents who "intimidate and threaten our rank-and-file comrades, forcing them to reduce their coca crops." In response to the government's "Option Zero"--which involves the eradication of our coca crops as a way of drug enforcement--the Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers proposes "Option One"--the expulsion of DEA officials from our country--"to reassert our national sovereignty." The eight-point communique released yesterday, after the government again suspended a meeting scheduled to discuss coca problems, instructs federation members to nationally and regionally reorganize coca defense committees, which comprise all existing institutions and organizations. In a serious warning, which seems like an imposition, the federation members call on citizens' committees of the tropical region and mayors' offices to support the coca growers' struggle. The communique notes: "If they refuse, the coca producers will intervene these institutions." The coca growers communique states: "Reject any governmental attempt to carry out a forceful reduction of coca crops." The communique also declares "a state of emergency and constant mobilization of our federation's ranks, and a suspension of the voluntary reduction of our coca crops until the government implements development projects." The coordinating committee of the five coca growers federations also proposes "calling a protest rally in the town of Ivirgarzama as soon as possible." The communique concludes by stating: "Faced with the government's Option Zero--which involves the complete removal of coca in the tropical region--we propose Option One, involving the DEA's expulsion from our national territory."
