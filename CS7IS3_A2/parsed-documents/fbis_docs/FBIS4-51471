In accordance with relevant articles of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Prohibition of Import and Export of Prison-Made Products, signed by the Chinese Government and the U.S. Government, Chinese judicial departments arranged a visit by two officials from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to the No. 4 prison in east China's Zhejiang Province and other units from May 19 to 21. Prison officials answered questions from the U.S. officials and provided them with relevant materials. There was no evidence during their visit that shows China had violated the memorandum of understanding, the ministry official said. However, in his article AP reporter John Leicester claimed that "U.S. officials had information that the camps were exporting prison-made goods to the United States..." In reponse to a Chinese Ministry of Justice official's inquiries, Lorraine Toly, first secretary for press of the U.S. Information Service of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said in a letter yesterday that AP reporter John Leicester had made "errors" in his article. She said that "what I said was that if U.S. customs officials receive information that a Chinese prison might be exporting prison- made goods to the United States, they then contact the Chinese authorities to ask to inspect the prison. "This explanation became in his article: `Toly said U.S. officials had information that the camps were exporting prison-made goods to the United States...'" The U.S. official said: "I was annoyed by this article when I read it last week." She said: "I will call ASSOCIATED PRESS and complain." In the letter, she also said that she was "sorry for any confusion this article might have caused." The Justice Ministry official stressed that the Chinese Government has been implementing the Sino-U.S. memorandum on the prohibition of import and export of prison-made goods in a serious, responsible and effective way. He pointed out that the letter from the U.S. Embassy official showed that the May 21 AP report by John Leicester was a sheer distortion of facts.
