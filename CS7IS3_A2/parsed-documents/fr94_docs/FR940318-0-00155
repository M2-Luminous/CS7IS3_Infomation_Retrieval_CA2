FR940318-0-00155 FR940318-0-00023 (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B. R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household refrigerators. See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. This blend's components contribute significantly less to ozone depletion than CFC&hyph;12. However, the two components have the highest ODPs of all refrigerant alternatives, and will be phased out under the accelerated phaseout schedule. In addition, the GWPs of the components are high compared to most of the other alternatives in this end-use. Although this blend does contain a flammable constituent, testing has shown that the blend itself is not flammable and that it must experience significant fractionation before flammability becomes a risk. Given the small refrigerant charge size and the hermetic nature of refrigerators, it is unlikely for a leak resulting in such fractionation to occur. (29) CFC&hyph;12 Household Refrigerators, New. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new household refrigerators. HFC&hyph;152a does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, HFC&hyph;152a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than those of most alternatives. Although HFC&hyph;152a is flammable, a risk assessment demonstrated it could be used safely in this end-use. (d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 household refrigerators. (e) R200b blend. R200b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new household refrigerators. R200b does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, the GWPs and atmospheric lifetimes of the blend's constituents are less than those of CFC&hyph;12. However, the GWP of one component is high compared to those of other alternatives for this end-use. One component of R200b is flammable, but a risk assessment has shown that use of R200b in household refrigerators poses negligible additional risk of fire, given the hermetic nature of the equipment, the small charge, and the low probability of ignition. (f) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to household refrigerators using CFC&hyph;12. Research and development efforts are underway to produce household refrigerators using this cycle. Further information is discussed under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.
