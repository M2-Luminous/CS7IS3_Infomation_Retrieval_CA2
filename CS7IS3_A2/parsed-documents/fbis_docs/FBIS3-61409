B. Mikheyev, S. A. Kulyukhin, and L. N. Auerman; UDC 621.039.337] [Abstract] All lanthanides and actinides starting with protactinium may exist in a homogeneous melt in the 2+ oxidation state. When the stabilization energy of the d-level exceeds the energy of f-d-excitation, the f-elements are characterized with participation of d-electrons in the chemical bond. These elements include the lanthanides and Y. The presence of a d-electron in the valency orbital is a required condition for formation of a condensed cluster, such as M[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/]. The classical method for this synthesis is based on the reaction of the metal with the tri-chloride in a melt. However, a basic factor inhibiting this reaction in the case of GdCl[.sub]3[/] is the fact that the Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is not thermally stable at temperatures above 923 K, while most di- and tri-chlorides have melting points considerable higher than this value. It then becomes necessary to add an inert component to the melt which has a melting point lower than 923 K, such as LiCl (m.p. = 879 K). In the present work GdCl[.sub]3[/] was reduced with divalent lanthanide in a homogeneous melt containing NdCl[.sub]2[/] or DyCl[.sub]2[/] at 888 K. After 25 hours the Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is formed. This type of reduction does not take place in the presence of TmCl[.sub]2[/]. References 10: 5 Russian, 5 Western.
