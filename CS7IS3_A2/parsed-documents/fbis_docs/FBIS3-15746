In the first place, Armenia seeks a ceasefire in the conflict area. However, this has become impossible without the presence of separating forces there. Speaking at a news conference in Yerevan today, Liparitian pointed to the need for the entire world community to combine its efforts for the successful resolution of the issue. "Russia and the CSCE must submit a united plan to the warring sides," Liparitian pointed out. He said Eliasson had agreed with this when he stayed in the Armenian capital. The Armenian diplomat said armed formations must be withdrawn from certain territories after the establishment of a ceasefire in accordance with documents developed by Russia and the CSCE. Liparitian pointed out that both the Russian plan and the CSCE program envisioned a pull-out of Armenian forces from all territories they occupy, except for Lachin, while Azerbaijanis will have to leave Mardakert. The status of the Shaumian (Geranboi) district will remain as subject to further negotiations. After this, vital communications should be unblockaded and the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be submitted for consideration by the CSCE Minsk Group, according to Armenia.
