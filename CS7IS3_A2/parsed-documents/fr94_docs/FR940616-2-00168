SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Act of October 19, 1973 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, 87 Stat. 466), as amended, requires that a plan be prepared and submitted to Congress for the use and distribution of funds appropriated to pay a judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or Court of Claims to any Indian tribe. Funds were appropriated on January 25, 1993 in satisfaction of the award granted to the Gila River Indian Community before the United States Court of Federal Claims in Docket 236&hyph;N. The plan for the use of the funds was submitted to Congress with a letter dated January 24, 1994 and was received (as recorded in the Congressional Record) by the Senate on February 7, 1994 and by the House of Representatives on January 25, 1994. The plan became effective May 9, 1994 as provided by the 1973 Act, as amended by Pub. L. 97&hyph;458, since a joint resolution disapproving it was not enacted.

Any remaining amount, after the per capita payment to the members, shall revert to the tribe for use in the programming aspect of this plan. Programming Aspect Twenty percent (20%) of the principal, interest and investment income accrued shall continue to be invested with the interest to be available to the community's general fund on an annual budgetary basis to be used for operation of community programs. If at some future date, the Gila River Indian Community decides to amend this Plan, the Plan may be amended with the approval of the Secretary. General Provisions The per capita shares of living, competent adults shall be paid directly to them. The per capita shares of deceased individual beneficiaries shall be determined and distributed in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart D. Per capita shares of legal incompetents and minors shall be handled as provided in the Act of October 19, 1973, 87 Stat. 466, as amended January 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2512. None of the funds made available under this plan for programming or per capita distribution shall be subject to Federal or State income taxes, nor shall such funds nor their availability be considered as income or resources, nor otherwise utilized as the basis for denying or reducing the financial assistance or other benefits to which such household or member would otherwise be entitled under the Social Security Act or, except for any per capita shares in excess of $2,000, any Federal or federally assisted programs.
