Changes in International and Domestic Postal Fees and Rates; Final Rules Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 241␣/␣Friday, December 16, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 20 Changes in International Special Service Fees AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Changes in international special service fees. SUMMARY: Pursuant to its authority under 39 U.S.C. 407, the Postal Service is changing fees for international special mail services to become effective simultaneously with changes to domestic rates and fees. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John F. Alepa, (202) 268&hyph;2650. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). By virtue of that membership, the USPS adheres to the agreements of the UPU to which it is signatory. Specifically, the Universal Postal Convention (Convention), the Postal Parcels Agreement (Parcels Agreement), and the Money Orders Agreement contain provisions concerning the fees member countries can charge for special mail services. The Convention provides charges for (1) nonstandard letters, (2) inquiries, (3) return receipts, (4) registered mail service, (5) special delivery (EXPRÈS), (6) restricted delivery, and (7) recorded delivery; the Parcels Agreement provides charges for insured mail service; and the Money Orders Agreement provides charges for international money orders. The charges provided in these agreements are less than the USPS charges for the equivalent domestic service. The agreements authorize member countries whose internal service charges are higher than those that are fixed in the agreements to apply their domestic charges in the international service. The USPS charges international special service fees that are the same as the equivalent domestic special service fees to avoid having international fees that are less than those charged domestically. Accordingly, the USPS is adjusting international special service fees concurrently with the changes adopted by the Governors of the Postal Service as a result of the current proceedings before the Postal Rate Commission. This notice does not address charges for services that do not have corresponding domestic service. These charges will be addressed in a separate notice in conjunction with anticipated adjustments in international postage rates. The Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553). The Postal Service adopts the following rates and fees: List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 20 Foreign relations, Incorporation by reference, International postal services. PART 20_[AMENDED] 1.
