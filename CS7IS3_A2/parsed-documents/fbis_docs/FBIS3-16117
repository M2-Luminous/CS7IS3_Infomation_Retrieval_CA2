The ITAR-TASS correspondents were told this and about the results of the talks by Valeriy Grishin, first deputy head of the Russian Federation Government press service. Valeriy Grishin said that during the in-depth discussion of questions of Russian-Finnish relations it was remarked that there were no fundamental political problems between them. At the same time, it was noted that the considerable drop in the level of trade between Russia and Finland since the mid-1980s remained an object of concern to both sides, as the current level was far below the two countries' potential. V. Chernomyrdin noted in this connection that Russia regards Finland not only as a good neighbor but also a prospective partner, and he stressed that the Russian Federation Government will provide assistance to the Finns' aspirations not to give up the positions they have won in our market. The two sides' delegations assessed the conclusion of an accord to make additional deliveries of Russian weaponry and special equipment in part payment as an important step toward resolving the acute problem of Russia's indebtedness. There was also a detailed exchange of opinions around the problems of Russian and Finnish participation in the processes of European integration. The government heads are united in the view that the process of Russia's drawing closer to the European Union and Finland's entry into the European Union will take account of the interests of ensuring Russian-Finnish trade and economic links. V. Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia is in favor of strengthening regional cooperation in the Baltic region, moreover, he favors cooperation aimed not at exchanging statements about intentions but at achieving practical results. Touching on the problems of relations between Russia and the Baltic countries, the head of the Russian cabinet noted that our country continues to be seriously concerned over the position of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia. He also pointed out that Tallinn and Riga were not prepared to heed the recommendations from human rights organizations and experts from the CSCE and European Union in the human rights sphere. Viktor Chernomyrdin invited Esko Aho to pay an official visit to Russia.
