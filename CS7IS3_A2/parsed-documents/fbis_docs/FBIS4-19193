In a memo dated 11 April and addressed to the UN mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), the Rwandan Ministry questioned the "inexplicable failures on the part of the UN troops charged with the security of Gregoire Kayibanda airport and its environs, failures that made it possible for the criminals to shoot down the presidential aircraft." Another part of the memo criticized the "active participation of certain UNAMIR elements in Rwandan Patriotic Front operations against the Rwandan Army." In reply, Mr. Dehaene said: "These accusations are completely unfounded. The Belgian UN troops did their job and did it correctly." In his reply, Mr. Dehaene also wondered about the representativeness of the current, self-proclaimed "government" of Rwanda. The prime minister pointed out that the circumstances surrounding the death of President Habyarimana would only become clear if an investigation were launched by the international community. However, without wanting to prejudice the results of the inquiry, Mr. Dehaene said: "It does, however, now seem likely that the attack came from inside Rwanda."
