According to Fernando Madrinha's article in the 31 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 1993 failed to offer President Soares the conditions he needed for a "settlement of accounts" with the prime minister. The economic crisis did not cause the political and social upheaval Soares was hoping for, and the Socialist Party's (PS) gains in the municipal elections were not sufficient to jeopardize the government's majority, Madrinha notes. Similarly, internal Social Democratic Party (PSD) differences were not of a scale to threaten party disunity. "`Cavaco-ism' gave a little, but it did not collapse," he comments. In his opinion, while Soares begins 1994 with a diminished ability to influence events, he is "perhaps more determined than ever" to harass the government. Additionally, in the course of 1993 the prime minister and the PSD learned to "answer in kind" and no longer hesitate to criticize a presidential decision when it affects their interests, Madrinha contends. The first quarter of 1994 will be the most critical for the government, he continues. Most labor agreements are negotiated at that time. Moreover, the commemoration of the 25 April revolution will be an opportunity for Soares to draw a balance sheet of the situation, with negative factors to be ascribed to "Cavaco-ism." Another area of disagreement is foreign policy. Soares feels that Cavaco Silva governments have lacked "daring" and failed to take a broad view of events. As examples, Madrinha cites the differences between the president and the prime minister on Angola, Macao, and China. In concluding, Madrinha asserts that even if Soares does not "dislodge" Cavaco Silva until 1995, he will certainly use his considerable influence to make the prime minster's life difficult before the end of his presidential term. In Mario Mesquita's opinion, expressed in the 7 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, Soares still hopes to bring down the "imposing edifice of Cavaco-ism" before the end of his presidential term. Betting on time as his principal ally, the president devoted his first term to widening his base of support. He succeeded so well that, lacking a credible alternative, the PSD chose to support him rather than field its own candidate. However, at the beginning of his second term, Cavaco Silva increased his absolute majority thanks to the stability he brought to the country and the flow of EC funds, Mesquita continues. With Soares "isolated in the midst of Cavaco-ism," the "institutional guerrilla" between the two men began in earnest in 1993, against a background of national and international economic crises, increased unemployment, bankruptcies and student unrest. All signs indicate the struggle will continue in 1994, Mesquita contends. Even if the countdown for Soares' term has started, the president has not given up on his goal, however difficult it might be, he concludes. The institutional conflict in Portuguese political life is underlined by the results of a poll conducted by EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao between 21 and 27 December among a nationally representative sample of 481 individuals. Poll results appeared in the 31 December EXPRESSO. Respondents were queried on the status of the Soares-Cavaco Silva conflict in 1994. Some 55 percent said it will increase, 31 percent thought it will remain at its present level and 7 percent that it will diminish.
