Zedillo Ponce de Leon was born in Mexico City on 27 December 1951. He is the son of Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo and Martha Alicia Ponce de Leon. He is the second of six brothers, after Luis. Following him came Guadalupe, Lorena, Veronica, and Rodolfo. He is married to Nilda Patricia Velasco Nunez and is the father of five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Nilda Patricia, and Rodrigo. Zedillo holds a B.S. degree from the National Politechnical Institute's Higher School of Economy, where he studied from 1969-72. He also studied economics at the University of Colorado in 1974. He received a master's degree and a doctoral degree in economics from Yale University, which he attended from 1974-78. His doctoral thesis was entitled: "External Public Indebtedness in Mexico: Recent History and Future Oil Bounded Optical Growth." [thesis title as received in English] He worked as an economic researcher in the Secretariat of the Presidency's National Directorate for Economic and Social Programming from 1971-74, as an economist with the Bank of Mexico from 1978-82, and as deputy manager for economic and financial research in the same bank in 1982. He was secretary for programming and budget from 1988-92. In 1992, he was named secretary for public education, a post from which he resigned on 29 November 1993 in order to join the campaign of the now deceased PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. He was a professor at the Colegio de Mexico from 1981-83. He distinguished himself with his economic studies, which in turn led to his appointment as secretary for programming and budget. He outlined the National Development Plan, which has led to important political, economic, and social changes during the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. With the motto "Planning Is Prevention," Zedillo outlined the government strategies established since 1988 to date and within whose framework the government drafted programs to lower inflation by reducing spending, resuming growth, and attaining steady progress in the economic recovery. As the person responsible for the proposals dealing with 1989, 1990, and 1991 disbursements, he appeared before the Chamber of Deputies and corresponding commissions on several occasions, where he mounted an imprtant defense of the budgets and the National Solidarity Program. Zedillo also participated in laying the groundwork for the national agreements on the country's modernization, which led to an increase in several special allocations for agriculture and education. While he was secretary for programming and budget, Zedillo pursued dialogue, negotiation, and harmony with all governors, including those in opposition. Later, when he was secretary for public education, he subscribed to the thesis that "the higher the education, the greater the wealth," which held that the country's modernization was not just "fashionable" but an essential requirement in raising the country to the level of advanced countries with an eye on the 21st Century. In this context, he negotiated and secured approval for changes to Article 3 of the Constitution. He had the Congress approve a new General Education Law as an essential measure in meeting the challenge of the country's education with the new millenium in mind. Progress made in education during Zedillo's tenure crystallized in a national plan for the modernization of basic education, reform providing for free textbooks, and the reform of teachers' career tracks.
