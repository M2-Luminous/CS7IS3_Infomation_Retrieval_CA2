FR940124-0-00009 FR940124-0-00001 The new rules grant individuals the right to request that the Director of the DEQ hold an informal conference to review decisions of the Administrator; they also establish procedural, notice and decision requirements to govern such conferences. There are no Federal counterparts to these provisions, but they are consistent with the purpose of SMCRA set forth in section 1029(i) of the Act; i.e., the development of procedures for public participation in the program and its enforcement. Furthermore, Sections 4 and 5 of this chapter of the State regulations provide that (1) failure to seek informal review shall not be construed as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, (2) no evidence as to statements made or evidence produced by one participant at an informal conference may be introduced by another participant at a subsequent formal proceeding, and (3) the Director of the DEQ cannot usurp the authority of the EQC. Therefore, the State rules will not compromise or encumber the formal administrative review process or the right to administrative review. Accordingly, the Secretary finds that Chapter VI of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August 18, 1982, is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations, and is approving these rules. 10. Definition of ``Toxic Materials'' On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a permanent rule revising the definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter I, Section 2(99) of the LQD Rules and Regulations in a fashion identical to a temporary emergency rule submitted on May 26, 1982. OSM approved the emergency rule on September 27, 1982 (47 FR 42351), and, in the same rulemaking document, removed the corresponding condition of State program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(b). Wyoming has since recodified this definition as Chapter I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules and Regulations, but no other changes have occurred. Similarly, the corresponding Federal definition of ``toxic-forming materials'' at 30 CFR 701.5 has not changed since it was first promulgated on March 13, 1979. Because the permanent State definition at Chapter I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules is identical to the temporary emergency definition approved by OSM on September 27, 1982, the Secretary finds it to be no less effective than the Federal definition, and is approving it. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Public Comments OSM announced receipt of the March 9, 1993, submittal in the March 30, 1993, Federal Register (57 FR 16637), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals. The public comment period closed on April 29, 1993. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. Written comments were received from the Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC), The Powder River Basin Resource Council (PRBRC), and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;22&hyph;12, WY&hyph;22&hyph;14, and WY&hyph;22&hyph;11, respectively). A summary of these comments and their disposition is set forth below: 1. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that restricting awards of costs and expenses to ``contested case'' proceedings would be more limiting than and inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294. In particular, several commenters argued that participants in informal conferences should be eligible for awards of costs and expenses. For the reasons discussed in finding 2, the Secretary does not agree with the commenters. Case law associated with implementation of section 525(e) of SMCRA indicates that petitions for awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative proceedings must be entertained only if the proceedings are adjudicatory in nature (although nothing in these decisions would prohibit the regulatory authority from voluntarily considering petitions submitted in connection with other types of administrative proceedings). Informal conferences are both predecisional and nonadjudicatory.
