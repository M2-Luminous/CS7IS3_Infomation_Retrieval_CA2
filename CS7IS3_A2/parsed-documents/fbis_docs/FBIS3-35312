The recent clashes between government forces and Islamists resulted in 30 deaths on both sides. Opposition forces in Sidi Bel Abbes have attacked and set fire to government offices and institutions and gas station workers have gone on strike. The resumption of such incidents in Algeria shows that the period of optimism toward the government of Algerian President General Zeroual has ended and, having given up all hopes for any type of political reform by the government, the opposition has once again resorted to struggle. Since coming to power one month ago, General Zeroual, who was designated as president by the former coup council, has been constantly announcing that he will soon pave the way for a national reconciliation and will start talks with the opposition. However, he has not taken any steps toward this; and possibly, this is the main reason for the resumption of violence in Algeria. Algerian prisons continue to be filled with political prisoners. Some of Algeria's political parties remain illegal and are unable to carry out overt activities. By taking advantage of the state of emergency regulations, which have not yet been lifted, Algerian forces carry out attacks on residential areas on a daily basis and every so often they kill several opposition members. The newly established statesmen in Algeria have not taken any steps to reinstate the rights of those who were elected by the people--rights that were usurped by the former coup council. Moreover, by ordering the Islamists to refrain from opposing the current rulers, the statesmen continue the former suppressive conditions. These suppressive conditions show that the current situation in Algeria is not very different from the situation that prevailed a month ago. The only difference is that the ruling pawns have changed. The continuation of the suppressive climate in Algeria has destroyed all grounds for goodwill by the opposition and is gradually returning Algeria to the past violent situation. In this climate, the current Algerian Government is responsible for the blood that is shed and the destruction that is done.
