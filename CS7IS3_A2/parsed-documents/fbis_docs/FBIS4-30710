The United States moved fast, and a brake was put on the fall of the dollar by cooperating with Japan and Europe in making market intervention. The rise in the long-term interest rates stopped as well somehow, but it is said that all the senior officials of the U.S. Government, known as the "MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) school," were pale during that period. The MIT school means a group of people like Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under the Office of President, and Blinder [name as published], former CEA member, who received their doctor of philosophy degrees from MIT, and Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summer, who earned his bachelor of arts degree at the same school. They are the people who think importantly of balancing market principles and government policies. For them, this was an opportunity to be reminded that the public uneasiness about the current-account deficits at the root of the market turbulence remains." In the real economy of the United States, business performance is recovering, and the economy is back on the track of growing at a rate of more than 3 percent a year. To have this good trend continue for a long time, stability of interest rates is essential. But if the country wants to stabilize its interest rates, it has no other choice but to return to the basic question of "reducing the current-account deficits." Passing Over Economic Burdens For instance, if we take a look at the contents of the current- account deficits, we can see that the reduction of government deficits, which is a major element, is not making progress as expected. Even in the area of family finances, the savings rate went down to a post-war low of 4.0 percent in 1993, and the condition of excessive consumption has not been remedied. There has been no improvement in the structural problem of upward economy meaning increased imports and thus increased current-account deficits. As a result, the policy line of "maintaining low-interest rates and achieving a high economic growth rate" is not functioning properly. The market has come to recognize these ills of the U.S. economy, and this was precisely the reason for the gloom of the MIT school people. How seriously does the Clinton administration regard these ills? There is good material that is said to be "useful in making judgment on that question." It is testimony U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor gave before the Senate Finance Committee shortly after his nomination as USTR was approved by Congress in January 1993. He said in that testimony: -- In the post-war world, the top priority task for Western countries, including the United States, was to win the Cold War over the Eastern camp, which had the Soviet Union as its pillar. To do that, it was necessary to win not only in armaments, but also in the economic race. -- To win an economic victory, the United States formed new international frameworks like the IMF and the GATT, and has opened up its market to other countries, thus helping Japan and Europe to reconstruct their countries. -- But the U.S. economy started to stagnate clearly as the Vietnam war bogged down and the oil crisis hit it in the early 1970s. The trade deficit started to grow steadily. In spite of the situation, the East-West Cold War at the time did not allow the United States to retreat toward giving priority to the economy. -- What should have happened was for the United States to switch its policy toward giving priority to the economy in the Reagan era of the 1980s. But President Reagan chose the line of expanding arms instead, thus expanding the government deficits very rapidly. -- Victory has been won in the Cold War by paying an enormous cost, but the U.S. economy has become a shambles. It has become no longer possible for the United States to serve as the world leader without any conditions. Unless the United States regains its economy and re-establishes its "economic security," it will not be able to guaratee the political and diplomatic safety of the world. Pressure To `Pay Up' This testimony shows that the United States has analyzed the causes for the current-account deficit problem, not from the perspective of the current market turbulence, but by looking back on the long span of time since World War II ended. Besides, as far as Japan and Europe are concerned, aside from the question of whether such a U.S. stand is correct or not, the testimony seems to be saying to them: "You should pay for the losses the United States had to suffer to secure security for the world." Of course, the fragile U.S. economy is no small matter for Japan even when viewed from a short-term perspective. That is because its impact on the money market can be more sensitive than its real economy. The flip side of the coin of having a cheap dollar is the high yen, and the rise in the U.S. long-term interest rates puts upward pressure on the interest rates of Japan. An investment consulting executive officer of a major securities firm said, "If U.S. long-term interests rates go up to the 8 percent level, Japan's stock prices will collapse." But such a short-term view is not enough to understand or explain all the intentions or agonies of the United States. If the United States has come up with its present policies on the basis of the roles it has played in the post-war period and on the fact that the Cold War has now ended, then it may be necessary for Japan to look at the thinking of "pay up," which lies behind it all.
