Jarcevic said that Croats and Muslims were for months fighting in central Bosnia and that the Croatian forces continuously bombarded Muslim positions. "Therefore, the aircraft were most probably Croatian, because the Serbs do not fight there," Jarcevic added stressing that the aircraft were downed above the area of the Croat-Muslim conflicts.
