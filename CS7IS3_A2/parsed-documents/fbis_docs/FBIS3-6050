Despite disappointing results at inter-Korean contact earlier in the day, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci told a press conference he doesn't "understand the talks as having broken down." But he was clear that exchange of envoys was the bases to the next high-level talks with North Korea, repeatedly referring to the Feb. 25 "agreed conclusions" with Pyongyang with both Washington and Pyongyang taking simultaneous steps. Gallucci, chief U.S. negotiator to the high-level negotiations with North Korea, had come to Seoul for consultations on how to counter Pyongyang's nuclear situation. He refused to speculate on what would happen if North Korea did not meet the demand on inter-Korean envoy swap, saying only Seoul and Washington will "deal with that when that happens." He repeated U.S. hopes of keeping the promise of the meeting with North Korea, leaning more toward optimism than pessimism. "I would like to go to Geneva on March 21. I have not given up hope that the exchange (of envoys) will take place," he told reporters. He foresaw even more difficult negotiations ahead in the next round of high-level dialogue with North Korea where he said the United States "is willing to go beyond the nuclear issue." "But we do that only if we reach an understanding in other areas and move together in that direction," said Gallucci. These other issues are what the United States "would like the opportunity to talk with (North Korea) about." On Feb. 25, North Korea and the United States agreed on simultaneous steps that brought Pyongyang's nuclear problem out of immediate crisis. North Korea agreed to reallow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection on its declared facilities and to resume inter-Korean dialogue. The United States, in return, would cancel this year's annual military exercise "Team Spirit" held jointly with South Korea and hold high-level dialogue with North Korea on March 21 in Geneva. "We made clear in the days before that understanding that the meeting on 21st of March was agreed on the premise...that there would be exchange of envoys." While not saying per se that the March 21 meeting will be delayed if the envoy exchange is not implemented by then, Gallucci said the envoys' cross visits were "the bases" to the steps to be taken. The IAEA inspection team is currently in North Korea and in middle of its activities. Gallucci admitted that the inspections were not going "perfectly smoothly, that there have been differences." But like inter-Korean dialogue, "activities are still ongoing," said Gallucci, and the U.S. position is to wait until the activities are concluded in full. On possibility resuming the Team Spirit this year and mobilizing the troops, the official said "if it became necessary, the forces in the United States and Republic of Korea would be able to accomplish that."
