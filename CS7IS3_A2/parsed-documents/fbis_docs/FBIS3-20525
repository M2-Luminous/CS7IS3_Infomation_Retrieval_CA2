In recent years, especially since the beginning of 1993, all areas and departments throughout the nation have done a great deal of work to turn deficits into profits and have achieved definite results. In the first half of 1993, budgetary industrial enterprises throughout the nation continued to maintain a declining trend of deficits after reducing the range of loss by 4.2 percentage points and the amount of loss by 3.6 percent in 1992. By the end of June, 1993, the range of loss was reduced by 0.9 percentage points and the amount of loss, 2.605 billion yuan or 16.5 percent. But, in the second half of 1993, the range and amount of loss increased as a whole due to the occurrence of some new situations in the movement of the national economy, especially the price increase of energy, transportation, and raw materials, the rise of interest rates, the sliding of market, and poor management of some enterprises. As of the end of October, the range of loss increased 7.3 percent and the amount of loss, 14.9 percent. The State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance pointed out that judged from the current situation, the deficit situation of China's state-owned enterprises is fairly serious. But because measures adopted by different regions and departments are different, progress has been uneven. As of the end of October, the range of deficit of 12 areas, including Beijing, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou, was higher than the national average whereas Fujian, Xiamen, Guangdong, Guangxi, and some central departments successfully reduced deficits. Industries such as coal, petroleum, and tobacco, reduced deficits by 5.2 percent, 26.8 percent, and 66.4 percent respectively as compared to that in the corresponding period of 1992. To ensure that new progress is made in the work of turning deficits into profits in 1994, the State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance set forth five measures, urging all areas and departments to do a down-to-earth job. Strengthen the responsibility of turning deficits into profits and do a good job in classified guidance. All areas and departments should strengthen leadership in the work of turning deficits into profits, establish the target-oriented responsibility system, delegate the targets of turning deficits into profits to each and every level of departments and enterprises, and ensure that objectives are clear, targets are assigned to every position, and responsibilities are delegated to individuals. Enterprise supervising departments should make a list of major money-losing units, investigate and study each and every such unit, and adopt measures to solve their problems. They should ensure that each plant has its own measure for reducing and turning deficits into profits within a limited time period. All money-losing enterprises must establish a loss-bearing mechanism, adopt a measure to link employees' interest to the amount of deficits reduced or transformed in their enterprise, and give out awards or penalties in strict accordance with the measure. Economic and trade commissions, financial, auditing, and enterprise supervising departments at all levels should carry out supervision and inspection on a regular basis. Strengthen enterprise management and tap internal potential. Currently, we should stress the basic management, cost management, and team building of enterprises. In accordance with advanced domestic and foreign standard of enterprise management, we should establish and perfect various quota control, rules and regulations, and standards, and carry out strict evaluation. Pursuant to "General Rules for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Enterprise Accounting Standards," we should improve the internal economic accounting of enterprises, strengthen financial budget control and financial discipline, and reduce cost and expenses. Extend proper support to money-losing enterprises which are expected to turn deficits into profits. Where conditions permit, areas and industry supervising departments should continue to raise and utilize existing deficit-transformation funds, use such funds mostly for inexpensive technological transformation projects and other "short, even, and fast" projects which can be completed and put into operation within a year, and support money-losing enterprises in developing new products and their needs for working funds. When allocating funds for various technological transformations, economic and trade commissions (economic commissions and planning and economic relation commissions) and financial and banking departments at all levels should set aside some funds to be used to support money-losing enterprises to turn deficits into profits. After assisting money-losing enterprises in property inventory and investment verification, we should help them get rid of their bad credit history in a planned manner. After exercising the asset-to-debt ratio control over loans, banks should adopt a transitional method to help promising enterprises carry out production operations and stress support for money-losing enterprises to speed up the readjustment of product mix. Speed up the tempo of changing enterprise management mechanism. Those enterprises, which have complied with state industrial policies, are expected to turn deficits into profits, and have bright market prospects, should be leased, transferred, or merged. Those enterprises which have been losing money for a long period of time, are not expected to turn deficits into profits, have more debts than assets, should be firmly bankrupt. This is a fundamental solution for the mechanism issue of money-losing enterprises. Vigorously promote the technological progress of enterprises, do a better job in quality work and the activity of "double increases, and double festivals."
