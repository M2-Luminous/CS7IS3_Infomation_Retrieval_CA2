The bloodshed was not attributable to the peace process but rather the result of false messianic beliefs and the hostility of the other side. The prime minister was speaking at a mass rally in Tel Aviv a short while after his return from Cairo. Rabin called on his supporters to show more spirit and tell the enemies of peace in Israel that they did not represent the public. The Israeli people want peace and we will achieve it, Yitzhaq Rabin asserted.
