An official of the company said that his company signed earlier this year an agreement with the Shanghai Traditional Chinese and Western Medicines Co. Ltd. to jointly establish a pharmaceutical company in Singapore. It also signed agreements with the Shanghai Aquatic Products Group, the Shanghai Marine Shipping Group and the Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Company to launch eight new firms in Britain, Germany, Singapore and the United States, the official said. He said that these overseas firms will handle futures trading, provide marine shipping services or open supermarkets. The company has decided to launch a group company later this year so as to make better use of its marketing network overseas, managerial expertise and market information, he said. To date, local businesses have opened 420 firms in 60 countries and regions with the company's help, he said, adding that most of these businesses are doing well. For example, a firm opened by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in the United States has set up 20 outlets to market Chinese-built machine tools to 100 American customers. The official said that his company will also help overseas firms expand into multi-national companies combining production with trade. The company has decided to set up such a group company in Western Europe, and new subsidiaries in Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Africa and Southeast Asia later this year, he said. The Shanghai municipal authorities have decided to adopt internationally accepted practices in managing overseas firms launched by local enterprises, he said.
