The December issue of "Army News" carries a report elaborating on the latest changes in the military field. Beside mentioning [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo in most articles, the publication reports that Wasmosy received instructions over some appointments in the Cavalry divisions. The publication notes that the president and commander in chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces appointed the new 3d Cavalry Division chief of staff, "on the orders" of the Army, which is headed by Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, the Army commander. The text is as follows: "Engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, in his capacity as commander in chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces, appointed DEM [General Staff School graduate] Colonel Enrique Montiel G. as chief of staff of the 3d Cavalry Division on the orders of General Rodrigo Diaz Delmas, the 1st Army Corps Commander, through orders issued by Gen. Lino Oviedo, the Paraguayan Army commander ..." A facsimile of this report, which appears on page 7 of the December issue of "Army News," is published on this page. In the aforementioned publication's center page, Gen. Oviedo is quoted as saying he will build "one school per year to save Paraguay from poverty." The publication did not specify, however, with what funds he will build schools. There is a picture of the general awarding medals to high school graduates in the interior of the country.
