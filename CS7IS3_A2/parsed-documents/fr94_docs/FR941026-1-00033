(3) If the order is valid to award a payment from the TSP account of a participant under this part, upon payment. (4) If the Board determines that the order is not a qualifying order under this part, 45 days after issuance of the Board's decision.

(k) Multiple court orders pending before the Board will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part in the following order: (1) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to the same spouse or former spouse, the Board will process only the court order bearing the latest date entered by the clerk of the court. If any order does not have a date entered, then the date the order was filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the order was signed by the judge shall be used. (2) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to two or more former spouses, the Board will process the orders in the order of the dates entered by the clerk of the court, starting with the order bearing the earliest date, and continuing until the account is exhausted. If any order does not have a date entered, then the date the order was filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the order was signed by the judge shall be used. ยง1653.4 Calculating entitlement under a retirement benefits court order. (a) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of the account as of a specific date or event, the amount of the entitlement will be calculated based upon the balance of the account as of the end of the month on or immediately preceding the date or event, plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or before the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of an entitlement, any loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise. (b) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of an account but does not contain a specific date as of which to apply the percentage or fraction to the account, the amount of the entitlement will be calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section, using the account balance as of the end of the month on or immediately prior to the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by the judge. (c) If the court order awards a specific dollar amount, the amount of the entitlement will be the lesser of: (1) The amount of order awards; or (2) The amount in the account as of the end of the month on or before the date specified in the order (or, if no date is specified, the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by the judge) plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or before the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of entitlement, any loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise. (d) Unless the court order specifically provides otherwise, the entitlement calculated under this section will not be credited with interest or earnings. If interest or earnings are awarded, the Board will use the monthly rates of return credited to the account unless the court order specifies a different rate. The TSP monthly rates of return may be either positive or negative. Interest or earnings will be calculated beginning with the month following the month-end valuation date used for calculating the entitlement and ending with the month prior to the month of payment. (e) All entitlements will be calculated initially under this section including both vested and nonvested amounts in the participant's account. If at the time of payment the non-vested portion of the account has not become vested or has been forfeited, the entitlement will be recalculated using only the participant's vested account balance. ยง1653.5 Procedures for payment pursuant to retirement benefits court orders.
