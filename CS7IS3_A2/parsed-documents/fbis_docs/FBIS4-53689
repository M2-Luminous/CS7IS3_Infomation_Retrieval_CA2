Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], said there is no difference of opinion between him and the party's No. 2 man, Wataru Kubo, the SDPJ secretary general. On Saturday in China, Kubo said that the Hata cabinet should resign en masse soon after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 budget bills and before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion. Murayama, delivering a speech in the city of Fukushima, some 270 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, said talks can be launched among various political parties to restructure the coalition government. The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDPJ, which was the No. 1 component of the previous cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group excluding the SDPJ. Meanwhile, the SDPJ chairman also said a dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap general election might be inevitable in the event of political turmoil. "There may be no other way but to seek the judgment of voters," he said.
