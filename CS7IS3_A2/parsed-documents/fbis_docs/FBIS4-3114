At a recent meeting of the municipal people's congress, participants raised some 300 queries, mostly on these three "hot issues". Sources here said that the prices of daily necessities have recently risen at an unexpected rate in the capital. Talking about prices, Mayor Li Qiyan said that freeing prices by no means implies giving up control. On the contrary, active and forceful steps must be taken to keep prices down, including economic, legal and necessary administrative measures. He said that while efforts should be made to ensure the supply of farm and sideline products, such as grain, vegetables, meat, eggs and milk, emphasis has to be placed on distribution and circulation to ensure market supplies. A reserve system for major sideline products and a market risk fund must be set up in order to steady the price of daily necessities whenever they go too high, he added. Any change in the market price should be closely monitored by using a price analysis system, the mayor said, adding that regulations concerning profiteering must be established. Meanwhile, with the deepening of the country's reform and opening to the outside world, more and more job hunters and business people from every part of the country, especially from the vast rural areas, are pouring in the capital city hoping to make their fortunes. This causes a lot of problems in the aspects of public security, birth control and traffic that upset the local residents, who used to enjoy a peaceful life. According to a senior justice official, there are nearly two million outsiders in Beijing now, forming some non-Beijinger ghettos in the districts, such as "Zhejiang village" and "Henan village". The official said that a handful of these outsiders have turned to crime. A survey conducted in 1993 shows that outsiders accounted for as high as 80 percent of the total criminal offenders in the city. But, the official said, the outsiders on the whole play an important role in the capital's construction. They are mainly engaged in the catering trade, repairs, garment making, baby-sitting and nursing, and cleaning, he said, adding that they have made great contributions to enlivening the capital's markets and making life more comfortable for the city dwellers. Speaking of the control and management of outsiders, Deputy Mayor Meng Xuenong said that there is an urgent need to establish an effective registration system for outsiders. The number must be put under strict control in terms of the city's capacity of administration and the demand of the labor market, he said. A more unusual problem for residents of the capital is dogs. Nowadays, more and more families tend to keep pets, dogs in particular. However, the dogs also disturb the normal life of Beijingers, a local resident said, biting people and causing disputes. Statistics show that dogs injured more than 30,000 people in the city last year. A suggestion for solving this problem put forward by the deputies to the municipal peoples' congress is to register and immunize pet dogs. Fierce dogs should be banned completely, they said. To ensure that Beijingers live and work better in a better environment, Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa said the municipal government will put these problems on its agenda for this year's comprehensive urban management.
