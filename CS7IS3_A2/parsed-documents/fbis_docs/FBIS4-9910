A few moments ago a ruling was handed down in the case of [former Panama City Mayor] Mayin Correa, condemning Mrs. Correa. The sentence handed down is 187 days in prison and the suspension of citizen's rights, disqualifying her from holding public office for one year. It is noted that, according to Article 82 of the penal code, the prison sentence handed down can be converted into a 60-day fine, considering the salary she received at the time the crime was committed. That is, she must pay a fine equivalent to 60 days, in accordance with the salary she received while she was mayor. She is disqualified from holding public office. The other people involved in this case, Mr. Juan Domingo Diaz, Alexis Morales, and Enrique Delgado Bolanos also received rulings. Juan Domingo Diaz and Alexis Morales were acquitted. Mr. Enrique Delgado Bolanos was sentenced to two months in prison, which can also be converted to the payment of a fine. We learned here at the Electoral Tribunal that Mrs. Correa can run as candidate for the post of mayor. She cannot, however, assume the post -- should she be elected with the necessary votes. In this case, the post would have to be filled by her alternate, her first alternate. I do not know if Mr. Miller has anything else. [Miller] Yes, Mara. Let us repeat the sentence handed down. Also, can she fill the post, after she serves the sentence handed down? Go ahead. [Rivera] The ruling condemns her. The sentence condemns her. She is sentenced to 187 days, which can be converted to a 60-day fine. Then there is the sentence suspending her citizen's rights and disqualifying her from holding a public post for one year. After serving the sentence for one year, she can fill the post. In other words, if she is elected, she can fill the post of mayor after one year. In the meantime, her alternate would have to be in charge. [Miller] What other alternative does she have, following the sentence handed down by the tribunal, Mara? [Rivera] We were told she can submit an appeal. Nothing has been established yet because the sentence was just handed down. We understand her attorneys will immediately file an appeal with the tribunal. [Miller] Thank you, Mara, for this last-minute report.
