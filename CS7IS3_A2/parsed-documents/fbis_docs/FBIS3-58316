Vranitzky was reacting to a proposal by Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, who had called for cutting maternity pay for women whose partners earn more than 70,000 Austrian schillings per month. The Minister for Women's Affairs, Johanna Dohnal, although in favor of weeding out the social benefit system, opposed cuts in maternity pay. Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek also rejects such cuts. He said that misuse had to be stopped before introducing selective cuts.
