But government officials in Taipei accused Beijing of improperly intermingling politics into legal issues. The joint statement was issued by Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], and his mainland counterpart, Tang Shubei of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), itemizing major agreements reached during the five-day talks in Beijing. Chiao and other SEF delegates returned to Taiwan last night. The joint statement said the two sides have reached consensus on such thorny issues as repatriation of hijackers and illegal immigrants as well as bicoastal fishing disputes, adding that differences remain to be tackled in the next round of functional talks. "Both sides made some concessions," Chiao said. "Reaching consensus during this round of talks is what we call a `win-win' situation." In the meantime, however, Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of the supervisory Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), told reporters that the consensus reached in the Beijing meetings "are at best consensus in principle." He added that the two sides still failed to find common ground for as many as 10 items. Even for the issues that both sides have agreed on, "it will still test our wisdom to put the consensus into words," Kao said, referring to the wording of a formal agreement. The MAC ran an overnight meeting until 4 a.m. yesterday, giving its final approval on the Chiao-Tang statement. A few changes were made: the SEF and ARATS would only exchange, not discuss, views on economic issues during the next round of talks; the statement also left out the discussion for the arrangement of the second SEF-ARATS summit. ARATS chairman Wang Daohan has invited his SEF counterpart, Ku Chen-fu, to visit Beijing in late spring or early summer, yet the MAC seems less enthusiastic to embrace the idea for fear that Beijing will use the high-level exchanges to achieve its political goal. Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth round of functional talks in Beijing at the end of next month. Once formal agreements are reached on the three issues, Tang will come to Taipei to attend the signing ceremony, the Chiao-Tang statement said. In a written statement, the MAC sharply criticized Tang's remarks, saying the SEF-ARATS talks should "avoid discussions of political and legal issues" as ambiguous. In mid January, Tang said the ARATS would carry out the principles of "Peaceful reunification-one country, two systems," but during this round of talks, he asked the SEF delegates not to raise political and legal issues, according to the MAC statement. "Under the communist doctrine, law, which only serves as a tool of politics, has nothing to do with social justice and public welfare," the MAC statement said. It went on to say that mainland negotiators could hardly understand that "Political issues belong to politics, legal issues belong to law." During the next round of talks, the two sides will also exchange views on issues such as joint efforts to crack down on the criminal activities of marine smuggling and robbery, protection of intellectual property, mutual assistance between the judicial organs, and certain economic and technological subjects agreed to in last April's summit in Singapore, the statement said.
