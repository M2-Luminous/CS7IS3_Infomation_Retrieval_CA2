The explosion killed at least 10 people, and 20 were seriously wounded. The causes of the explosion at the Ninive Plant of the oil company and a fire between the towns of Gregorio Mendez and Rancho Nuevo, Cunduacan Municipality, approximately 660 km southeast of this capital, are still unknown, the radio station reported, adding that one of the plant's internal pipelines is what exploded. So far 10 people are known dead, four of who were passing in front of the Pemex installations in a particular vehicle, inside which "they were carbonized." The other six dead were workers of the enterprise who formed part of a team of 26 workers who were working at the site at the time of the explosion. The remaining 20 are seriously wounded, the radio station reported. The area Red Cross has confirmed to AFP some of the wounded were taken to Pemex's hospital located near the oil plant, others to medical centers located in the city of Villahermoza, capital of Tabasco State. The gas pipeline explosion occurred in a 200-meter stretch and left a crater seven meters deep, the radio station reported, adding that "more than 100 trees were blown down" by the concussion of the blast. Firemen controlled the resulting fire, although it prompted the immediate evacuation, by the Red Cross, of at least 800 people who inhabit the town of Gregorio Mendez. Pemex personnel were trying in the afternoon to prevent contact between gas and crude oil circulating in the different petroleum pipelines in the area by injecting water into the plants near the Ninive Plant, where there are several ejidos (communal lands). Radio Red stated Pemex concentrates most of its drilling and production activities in the Cunduacan area, where there is a vast oil-drilling infrastructure.
