[passage omitted] The official spokesman Abdelkader Bensalah affirmed further that the disbanded Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] is not present in the conference. However, contacts, which are still continuing, have taken place but they have been very difficult. The first signs are nonetheless encouraging. The following are excerpts from the statement of the official spokesman of the conference: [Begin Bensalah recording] As far as the Islamic tendency is concerned, I would like to say to you here that such a tendency is not present at the national dialogue conference, contrary to whatever has been said or published. On this occasion, however, it is necessary to inform you that contacts have taken place with this tendency. Such contacts are still continuing but they have been difficult given the particularities of this tendency. However, the first signs of these contacts have been enouraging. [end recording] [passage omitted] Meanwhile, there is intense activity in the corridors of the Palais des Nations. There are consultations, contacts, rumors, and reports on the personalities who could be appointed for the transition period. Nobody can at this stage confirm or deny these reports. Some parties have even held meetings on the sidelines of the conference. Tension became so acute at times that some participants stayed outside the conference hall. In a nutshell, this conference is shrouded in suspense as several assumptions are being made. Some say the conference has failed or will fail, while others say this conference is a prelude to a serious dialogue. The rest say that the conference will remain open and that the remaining partners to the dialogue may join. This evening, the text of the draft proposal on the platform for a consensus on the transition period was handed out to the participants and journalists. The article which was amended a second time and which has attracted everybody's attention is article six of section one on the presidency of the state. This article says: A head of state will be in charge of the presidency of the state. The head of state can appoint one or two deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in the tasks assigned to them by him. The head of state will be appointed by the Higher Security Council. This last point is reported to have caused huge disagreements between the participants and the bureau of the conference represented by the National Dialogue Commission. It is also reported that some parties may withdraw from this conference to protest this amended article six of the draft proposal on the platform. All these reports give an idea of the general atmosphere here at the Palais des Nations and constitute food for discussion for all journalists and political analysts. Thank you. We will be back at 2000 [1900 GMT].
