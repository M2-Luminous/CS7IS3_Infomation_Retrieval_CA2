Good morning, President Reina. What do you have to say to the Honduran people a few hours before this mini-summit gets under way? It has been said that Vice President Albert Gore's presence is the beginning of a new relationship between Central America and the United States. [Reina] Thank you, dear friends, for visiting us at the Presidential Palace this morning at a time when we are on the threshold of such an important event, namely, the visit of U.S. Vice President Albert Gore and the Central American presidents. All of us will get an opportunity to speak to this important U.S. statesman who enjoys great prestige in his country and abroad. I have heard very fitting comments on this visit, comments that have significant meaning. This summit means that our nation has the democratic conditions and the international image required to serve as host of such an important event. Under these circumstances, we are preparing for two more summits: the Cartagena de Indias summit and the Miami summit. One is the Ibero-American Summit, and the other summit has been organized by the United States. There have been a number of events leading up to this meeting. This meeting is being held in Tegucigalpa to enable the Central American presidents to engage in an open dialogue with the U.S. official, thereby allowing us to extensively review issues prior to the Cartagena de Indias and Miami summits. We believe there are basic issues that need to be discussed with the U.S. statesman. For example, we must repair the damages of a badly administered economy, while at the same time we must improve the state's finances. We must also strengthen the business sector's capacity, and we must meet the most pressing needs of the those people living in poverty who comprise the majority in Honduras. To do this, it is imperative that the international institutions adopt more flexible policies. This is one of the main issues we are going to discuss at this Tegucigalpa meeting. As far as the domestic situation is concerned, our position is that basically we need a broad consensus of all social and economic sectors to implement a [word indistinct] plan in Honduras. Therefore, we need the understanding and flexibility of the international institutions and friendly nations for this transition, at least until the unification plan is fully implemented. In preparation for the Tegucigalpa meeting, there was the Inter-American Conference for Peace and Development for Central America, which was held during the 14th Presidential Summit in Guatemala on 29 October 1993. We should reinstate the thesis of the Alliance for Sustained Development in which Guatemala and Costa Rica have been actively participating. For our part, we should strengthen trade, investment, and environmental protection. All of these issues will be taken up as part of a very full agenda. This is what I can tell you in broad terms about this event, of which I am very pleased, because it represents trust in the Honduran democratic system. [Balladares] In Switzerland this weekend, the American Association of Jurists questioned the IMF about its autocratic rule over the world's economies and finances, claiming it only wants to help powerful multinational corporations. President Reina, are you going to raise this issue with Vice President Gore during his visit? Some of your government officials have said that these statements by the American Association of Jurists might prompt international financial institutions to be more flexible, which is something you stressed this morning. [Reina] The news you have just given me agrees with what the world currently thinks. The nations that are moving down the path toward strengthening democratic systems, as well as facing up to macroeconomic variables to achieve healthy economies, must not be pressured. With a healthy and prosperous economy, all other problems can be resolved. The opinion of the jurists agrees with this position. The people of Latin America and the world need international financial institutions to display flexibility, not impose pressure. With this flexibility, we can very well solve difficult situations and strengthen what concerns everyone -- namely, human development. During our campaign, we gave this policy the name of development with a human face. [Balladares] Does this mean you are going to present the U.S. vice president with these concerns, in other words, that there should not be any pressure? Nevertheless, such pressure does indeed exist. For example, one form is already being felt, the elimination of subsidies and the ensuing higher prices of public services in our country. This is part of what these international financial institutions are demanding from our nation. Will this be raised with the U.S. vice president because it is common knowledge that Honduras, at least the Honduran people, cannot endure a situation of this nature. [Reina] We are dealing here with two situations. One is to be discussed with Vice President Gore and the other involves multilateral issues, such as the treaties in which the international financial institutions offer assistance to our nations. At times, however, when demands must be made, these are made with some emphasis. I think the president [as heard], all international officials, and all Latin American and world leaders know about this situation. What we have to determine now is how to resolve this situation. For example, in the case of Honduras, we want to avoid the situation we encountered when we received the nation amid a general crisis, a crisis that has a tendency to worsen. We have halted this tendency. Now we must consolidate a very solid and democratic way of life in Honduras. We must make deep cultural and educational changes. One of the first steps we took in this direction was to strengthen all values of civilian society. This has been excellent in clearing the way. Also, I believe that economically we must update our macroeconomic foundations. This cannot be done quickly. We must do this thoroughly and with the efforts of all of the Honduran people. I insist that we not allow those who have been hard hit, which is the majority of the Honduran people, to be hard hit any longer. We are on the path of overcoming this situation. [Balladares] Mr. President, according to many skeptics, Honduras is no longer a strategic point for the United States. For this reason, these skeptics claim that U.S. assistance is being diverted from Honduras. Do you really think that with the visit of this important U.S. official, the country can receive assistance equal to aid it received in the past or perhaps even larger amounts of aid? [Reina] The problem you have raised is much more complicated than that. We have left the Cold War behind us. In the Cold War, the world's attention was focused on Central America because a Cold War was forming in Central America in which the two large blocs were testing their strength. In El Salvador alone, the United States gave more than $6 billion in military assistance. We know now, however, that this situation and this world view have disappeared. The two blocs have reconciled, and now what is being sought is to improve the people's way of life. U.S. assistance that was geared toward a situation of conflict has disappeared. Now, we must develop assistance geared toward issues such as social problems, improving international solidarity, technical assistance, transfer of technology, environmental problems, and various forms of international cooperation. We cannot continue to permit tactless remarks that say Honduras is not fit for investment. I have seen with great satisfaction that even the U.S. representative in Honduras, the U.S. ambassador, has said that this is wrong and that Honduras is indeed a country for investment, a country in which all guarantees and securities are provided for anyone wishing to invest in Honduras. The world that you refer to has disappeared. The new world is based on other premises that are more encouraging. [Balladares] Will you ask the U.S. vice president for fair access of Central American products in the U.S. market? [Reina] In terms of economics, there are many things that will have to be brought up. There is the topic of Central America's possible integration into NAFTA. This is a technical and extensive topic. Let us recall that Honduras is also a member of GATT. Honduras has had a series of setbacks in terms of the banana trade. All of these economic topics will have to be broached with the U.S. vice president. I think, however, that he is coming to gain awareness of what is truly happening in Central America. This is the main point to which I referred earlier. He is coming to gain awareness and to make contact with the presidents of the area in order that the resolutions will favor international cooperation, with that new human face I mentioned, as well as with that way of approaching the people and offering support to democratic governments that are making immense efforts to leave their historical problems behind. I think this is part of the basic objective. The fact that he is coming to Honduras honors us very much. When President Kennedy planned to meet with Central American presidents, he met them in San Jose, Costa Rica. That was a meeting of utmost importance in which Dr. Villeda Morales played an important role. Subsequently, President Johnson went to San Salvador. That was another era. Today, the Clinton administration has selected Tegucigalpa, this dearly beloved capital of Honduras, in which we should all be united now to request not assistance but, rather, request that we be shown understanding and flexibility in finding solutions to our problems. [Balladares] Mr. President, because we have a government that is conducting a moral revolution and, as you say, a government that has a human face, there have been some questions about this. As the U.S. vice president arrives in Honduras and as we enhance our rapprochement with the U.S. Government in the field of economics, specifically in terms of assistance to the country, what will the talks you will be undertaking within the next few hours consist of? [Reina] U.S. influence in all world organizations is very great because the United States is the richest and most powerful nation in the world. We demand an understanding that takes our efforts into account. As I mentioned earlier -- for example, things such as the unification plan, broadening democracy, and improving macroeconomic indicators -- the United States must be aware of all of these efforts. In addition, our fight against corruption, drug trafficking, and poverty as our essential goals is something democracies worldwide deem very praiseworthy. [Balladares] Mr. President, Honduras used to be very important within the region because of the Nicaraguan war and the presence of contras on our soil. This is why Honduras was a U.S. strategic location in Central America. In light of what you said on 20 May -- that the U.S. vice president's arrival necessarily underscores the great importance of our country -- why is Honduras regaining importance? By virtue of the fact that Honduras was chosen as the site of the meeting, is this an unusual visit? What is the message of the visit? [Reina] I want to speak openly. Within the framework of the Cold War, Honduras played a sad and very bitter role because of the presence of counterrevolutionary forces involved in the Central American war. Honduras' image was very negative then. Today, however, just the opposite is true. Honduras was chosen to host this Central American presidents meeting to discuss the two upcoming summits -- again, the Cartagena de Indias and Miami summits. This reflects the strategic importance of Honduras. Also, Honduras has become a democratically strategic location in strengthening the values that serve as democratic foundations, and, in turn, this improves the image of Honduras within the United States and the world community. I believe I heard this stated in the Tegucigalpa media. We must understand this concept and welcome the international community's recognition of the democratic system currently reigning in Honduras. [Balladares] Mr. President, in a weekend meeting of some Armed Forces chiefs, the (Trifinio) Plan was made public by Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello, who views the opening of the border with suspicion because it may ultimately hurt the nation. What is your opinion on this? [Reina] Opening the borders is a delicate, yet inevitable, process within the framework of integration. We must learn to live peacefully and democratically in Central America. This poses new risks. As for the (Trifinio) Plan, I flatly oppose its so-called shared sovereignty. It was unacceptable before the demarcation of the borders because it could misrepresent the jurisdiction of each state. After the borders were demarcated by the highest world court, their redemarcation became imperative. Then, the states will be able to reach special agreements for the development of the area. This situation is not only relevant to the (Trifinio) Plan, but also to the Fonseca Gulf. The disputation of sovereignty issues by others, however, is something that must unite all Hondurans in order to defend our interests, interests that must not hinder regional development. [Balladares] As for domestic issues, over the weekend it was reported that you had decided to dismiss a top tourism official. It sounded like speculation, and we are lacking an official report. I would like to know if you have any official report? [Reina] Special commissions are currently investigating the latest cases in Tourism, Honduran Corporation for Forest Development, and Customs. These commissions will issue their reports in due time. I want to view this situation very positively, however. Should there be any irregularities, the Honduran people will be informed. The Honduran media have played a key role in this. This is part of the fight against corruption; it is a barometer for the new system. In the past, we refused to talk about corruption until it was impossible to control it. Today, we all act on it as soon as we encounter it, as soon as the first symptom arises. I believe it is important for each case to be properly studied. This constitutes the basis for many cases whose resolutions will be made public in accordance with the duties of a responsible government.
