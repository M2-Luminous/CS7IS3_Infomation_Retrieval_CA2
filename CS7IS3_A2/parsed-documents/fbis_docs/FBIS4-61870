The Duma on April 15 approved the main points in the draft, prepared by the government, though suggesting a few amendments to it. The government, around the end of the month, responded with a document over 40 pages long, which has already been considered by some of the lower house committees. On Tuesday it became known that the Duma Committees on Economic Policy and on Relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States had proposed that the draft budget be turned down. The Defense Committee, for its part, suggested raising the military expenditure from 37 to 55 trillion rubles. The Committee on Budgets, Taxation, Banks and Finance is also critical of the draft. Committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov said at Tuesday's meeting that the government had "effectively ignored" many of the recommendations made by Duma members. Thus, the house had said the document ignores social and economic forecasts for 1994 and fails to meet some of the country's social and economic priorities as formulated in President Boris Yeltsin's message to parliament. The Duma also said the draft, if passed, would impose heavier taxes on manufacturers and provide for unreasonable expenditure for the officialdom. The committee, of whose 43 members only 19 came to Tuesday's meeting, decided to go back to the matter on May 12.
