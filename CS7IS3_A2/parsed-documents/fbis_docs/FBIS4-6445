This, reported Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo to President Ramos, was one of the conclusions reached at the recent Asia-Pacific Finance Ministers' meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii. In a two-page report, Mr. de Ocampo said he told his APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] colleagues, the Philippines is ready to contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific region, even as it is currently "positioned for a takeoff." The finance chief likewise reported he had "most enlightening" discussions with representatives of Chile, Mexico, and Thailand. Among the items discussed was the implementation of the value added tax. These countries, Mr. de Ocampo noted, benefited from an expanded coverage of the said taxation scheme. "All these countries have reaped the benefits of tax reform and the broadening of their respective value-added tax systems," he said. Other points discussed in the meeting and agreed upon were the need to maintain sound economic policies and stability as a foundation for sustained, low inflation growth in the region; the importance of having the private sector continue to be the primary engine of growth; the need to further develop capital markets for effective mobilization and allocation of capital; and, the necessity of improving the capacity to finance infrastructure development in order to address current shortages and inefficiencies. Moreover, during the meeting, the Philippine panel -- composed of Mr. de Ocampo, Finance Undersecretary Juanita Amatong, Philippine Consul General in Honolulu Solita Aguirre, and special assistant Gabriel Lim stressed the urgency of arriving at an early conclusion to the ongoing discussions on a 100 percent capital increase for the Asian Development Bank, and the need to look more closely at and to accommodate other models of development particularly those reflected in the recent World Bank study on East Asia. He also stressed on the need to continue supporting small and medium-scale enterprises.
