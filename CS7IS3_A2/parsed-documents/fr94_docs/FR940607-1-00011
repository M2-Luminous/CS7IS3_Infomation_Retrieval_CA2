FR940607-1-00011 FR940607-1-00002 There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of DC&hyph;10 series airplanes is estimated to be $1,605,542 or $6,662 per airplane. There are approximately 114 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes is estimated to be $306,452, or $6,662 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: McDonnell Douglas: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, as listed in McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;222, dated November 1, 1993; and Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, as listed in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;34, dated November 1, 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD, install retainers and supports at the lateral control right- and left-hand mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;222, dated November 1, 1993 [for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes]; or McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;34, dated November 1, 1993 (for Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes); as applicable. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on June 1, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
