The severity of the fighting and the volume and types of arms used show that the fighting is unprecedented since the conquest of Kabul and the fall of Najibollah's regime. Also, the inhuman dimensions of the fighting -- shelling of residential areas, hospitals, and even safe areas such as embassies -- are proof that hostilities have gone beyond their usual, controllable state and have put Afghanistan on the brink of a new catastrophe. The recent clashes come when diplomatic efforts are under way to end the internal crisis in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the clashes plunge the horizon for peace into uncertainty. Each of the jehadi groups considers the unfair distribution of power in Afghanistan to be the cause of the fighting. The Afghan Mojahedin, who successfully put a 14-year-long holy war behind them and have managed to put on show one of the most brilliant victories, are now finding difficulty in consolidating sovereignty. The main Afghan difficulty in this respect is the lack of unified leadership, which is acceptable by all parties and groups. That problem resulted in bloody clashes right from the beginning of the mojahedin coming to power, without the battles putting an end to the crisis. It would seem that two years of bloody fighting -- which have left nothing but destruction in Afghanistan -- would be a good experience for those political and military Afghan groups that seek to resolve the crisis through military means. The balance of power among the groups and the rapid change in alliances and coalitions prevent progress through military means. Political analysts believe that peace and tranquillity will not return to Kabul unless the Afghan jehadi groups put the interests of their state and people before factional interests and choose a peaceful path, put down their arms and arm themselves instead with the weapon of logic, and then embark on instituting a constitution. The history of world movements and revolutions shows the constitution in any state to be one of its main pillars and guarantees its survival. The constitution must be formulated by the votes of all the people of Afghanistan. Only in such a situation can one hope for future peace and tranquillity there. Therefore, if the Afghan political and military groups do not quickly pave the way for talks in order to control the current crisis, opportunists will impose conditions from outside on the pretext of supporting human rights and establishing peace and stability in Afghanistan. In that case the real loser will be the Afghan nation and the 14-year-old aspirations of their holy jihad will be threatened.
