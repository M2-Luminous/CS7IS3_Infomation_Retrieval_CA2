"Unlike Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which used old Soviet cash money and attempted to accelerate the merger of the monetary systems, Belarus did nothing of the kind. Now, all mechanisms of the merger, including both monetary and economic systems, should be worked out. This concerns interbank relations, budgets, customs systems, etc.," Shokhin said. He went on to say that Belarus is, perhaps, the only country of the former Soviet Union which encourages the development of mixed forms of property. This process of encouraging mutual interests should be strengthened. Shokhin pointed out that ill- considered political statements should not impede real possibilities for integration which might be advantageous for Russia.
