At a news conference, Rugova recalled Hogg's statement that Great Britain will make efforts to resolve the problem of Kosovo and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. Commenting on Hogg's statement that Kosovo is part of Serbia and that the Albanians can only count on autonomy, he said: "We discussed all issues with the British Foreign Office minister. From the international point of view he has no authority or power to make any suggestions about what Kosovo is part of." "Mr. Hogg came here primarily in good faith and with the intention of exploring the possibility of a Serbian-Albanian dialogue," the DSK leader said. Asked about the possibility of establishing a dialogue with representatives of the Serbian authorities, Rugova said: "We have had no information about this." He described all talk about the possible beginning of talks as speculation. To a reporter's comment that "Serbia is ready for certain concessions to normalize the situation in Kosovo," Rugova said ambiguously: "We will see what concessions we are talking about." In the context of what he usually calls the daily repression of Albanians by the Serbian authorities, Rugova mentioned the crime in the Mladenovac barracks, describing it as "an incident which reflects the games and insinuations surrounding ethnic Albanian soldiers in the Yugoslav Army." Instead of condemning the crime, Rugova condemned the military authorities and said they are allegedly asking for financial compensation to release soldiers of Albanian nationality from the Yugoslav Army.
