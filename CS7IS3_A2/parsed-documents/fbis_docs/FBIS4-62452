In an exclusive interview with Interfax, Kebich made it clear that his cabinet did not like the situation in which "major western powers are granting Belarus paltry quotas" for the sale of Belarusian goods in the West, especially textiles, which were used widely there, and potassium produced in the republic. The premier said that those commodities were of good quality and highly competitive on the world market, a fact proven by the fact that the quotas for Belarusian cloth and fertilizers for sale in the West would be used up as early as May. IF Note: In April this year, a Belarusian governmental delegation headed by Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Mechislav Hryb visited Strasbourg in France to try to resolve the problem in hand at consultations with a deputies from the European Parliament. During the talks the Belarusian delegation received pledges of tangible assistance in raising quotas for textiles and potassium salts. Kebich stressed: "If the West does not allow Belarus on to its markets, why, then, should Belarus ignore the fact that leading European firms are selling their cars, confectionery, radios, beer and spirits, cigarettes and other commodities without restriction in Belarus and without quotas being issued by ourselves?" The premier was certain that "some products, for example those manufactured by the Minsk Kommunarka confectioners, are far superior in quality to their western counterparts which are currently flooding the Belarussian markets." Kebich commented that "the problem with finding sales outlets exists for practically all CIS states besides Belarus. Therefore, it would be a good feasible to resolve these matters together." He said he intended to submit the relevant proposal to all other CIS prime ministers at their very next summit.
