On Monday evening he was questioned by a procurator of the Main Military Procuracy, which is conducting the Zhirinovskiy case. The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader denied that his book, "The Last Dash South," and other printed or verbal speeches called for war, combat actions, and the annexation of other states to Russia. Earlier, on 25 February, Irina Kulikova, vice president of the Aesthetics Association of the Russian Academy of Sciences, was summoned to the Main Military Procuracy for questioning. She is the author of a book on the LDPR leader, "The Zhirinovskiy Phenomenon," assisted in putting together "The Last Dash South," and, in the opinion of observers, is a spiritual mentor of Vladimir Volfovich. Irina Kulikova also denied that in "The Last Dash South" or other printed or verbal speeches Zhirinovskiy had called for war or violence. It was earlier reported that a criminal case had been instituted under Article 71 of the Russian Criminal Code, "Propagandizing war in any form," against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by the Procurator General's office after numerous requests from citizens were made to law enforcement bodies and the Central Electoral Commission in connection with their having seen calls for war in publications and speeches by the LDPR leader. The Main Military Procuracy has been charged with conducting the Zhirinovskiy case.
