As our Interfax correspondent reports, thousands of citizens from nearby villages, elders, leaders of the clergy and local councils attended. Amateur artists performed at the meeting. Khasbulatov expressed his recognition for the support both to the village residents and citizens of Chechnya and Russia. Khasbulatov received a gun and Astrakhan sheep-skin hat, a papakha, from the village residents. The day before one of the streets in the village of Alkhan-Kala was called Imran, the name of Khasbulatov's father. Leaders of the local council explained to our Interfax correspondent that from 1934-37 Imran Khasbulatov headed the local collective farm. Due to the growth of Khasbulatov's popularity in Chechnya, observers do not rule out the possibility that he could head the forces in opposition to President Johar Dudayev. In particular, the present leaders of the opposition welcomed the return of the ex-speaker of the Russian parliament to his homeland as they connect their hopes for political changes in the republic with his name.
