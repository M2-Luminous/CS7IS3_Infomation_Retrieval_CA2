The main target is former quaestor Sen. Julio Larosiliere who is today accused of embezzlement. According to Edner Jean, it is in fact the new weapon being used in the battle between the senatorial blocs. Let us listen to his report: [Begin recording] [Jean] It is a cynical and macabre game that is currently being played in the Senate of the Republic in which any type of blow is allowed, featuring the bid for power that took Bernard Sansaricq to the head of the Senate and Firmin Jean-Louis' attempt to get his seat back. Since then, the attacks and counterattacks have been launched from both camps. On 8 March, when armed civilians showed up to support the office of Sen. Sansaricq, the battle for power took a definitive new turn: the dialectic of weapons. Today this Indian-wrestling match appears to be a settling of scores between the two quaestors, Julio Larosiliere, who cut off the means of subsistence to senators of the GARD [Action Group For the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and Osny Eugene, whose signing right is no longer recognized by the Ministry of Finance. Meanwhile, to occupy his time, the quaestor of the Sansaricq office has involved himself in an investigation into the management of Sen. Larosiliere. On 10 March, during a news conference, Osny Eugene presented the first elements in this process. His control of the accounting and management of the Senate of the Republic will allegedly prove that Julio Larosiliere practiced embezzlement of the quaestorship funds. It should be noted that this is not Osny Eugene's first revelation on this matter. Just to show that he will give no gifts to his main opponent in this clan warfare, Osny is attacking Julio through his previous positions. [Eugene] Sen. Larosiliere says that we do not respect the New York pact. I would like him to tell us whether he respected the CEP [Permanent Electoral Council] Act that he signed, the same CEP to which he appointed his cousin as treasurer. I would like to ask him if he respected the act of validation of power of the 18 January senators. Today, for personal reasons, he no longer recognizes them. I would like him to confirm that he respected his own signature before he asks us today to respect ours. Now, if he recognizes that he did not respect his signature, he must find the courage to come to the session room, resolve the conflict that he has with us, and agree that from now on we establish the rules of the game and respect the same principles for all. It is not a matter of questioning this office. This office has been legally elected. This office has not been acclaimed. They [not further identified] will come as simple senators and defend their viewpoints and simply continue with their mandate. They have no other choice. I must tell you that I strongly wish that Sen. Larosiliere would take the necessary steps for once because ever since Sen. Larosilere has been quaestor, he has never submitted a report on financial operations, nor on the institution's file, since August 1991. [Jean] Meanwhile, the most senior member, Sen. Franck Leonard, who has acknowledged the antagonistic offices, attempts to call the wise, quote, to reason, unquote. [Leonard] I met with Jean-Louis' office, and I met with Sansaricq's office. My words are words of wisdom. I am working so brothers who are separated over some triviality, some quarrel, can again speak to each other. [Jean] What are your hopes, Senator? [Leonard] My hope is that the country can move forward. I am trying to reconcile everyone. [end recording] [Jean] Here is a Haitian mediator in a Haitian crisis. However, to carry out his mission, Sen. Leonard will need not only determination, but nerves of steel. [end recording]
