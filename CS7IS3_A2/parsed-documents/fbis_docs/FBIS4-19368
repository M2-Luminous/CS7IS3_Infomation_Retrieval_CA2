A new Turkish provocation took place in Nicosia today at 1430 GMT this afternoon. According to information obtained by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation], near Famagusta Gate a Turkish soldier left his guardpost, entered a prohibited area of the buffer zone, and headed toward a National Guard guardpost. A national guardsman called on the Turkish soldier to leave the area immediately. The Turkish soldier did not obey and the national guardsman was forced to fire warning shots into the air. The Turkish soldier then withdrew. Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis told CyBC just a short while ago that the republic's authorities strongly protested to UNFICYP [UN Force in Cyprus] on the new Turkish provocation. An UNFICYP spokesman told CyBC that the incident is under investigation. It is not serious, he said. The illegal Turkish Cypriot radio station [Bayrak] concealed the Turkish side's attempt to cause tension and reported that a Greek Cypriot national guardsman provoked a Turkish soldier by firing shots against his guardpost. It is now calm in the area but the National Guard is following the situation closely.
