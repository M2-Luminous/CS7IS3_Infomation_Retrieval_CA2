FR940705-2-00222 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C&hyph;2. How many eligible patients do you anticipate being able to identify each year? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C&hyph;3. What recruitment procedures do you plan to use? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C&hyph;4. What selection criteria do you plan to employ? What are the exclusion and inclusion criteria for the study? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C&hyph;5. How will patients be selected if it is not possible to include all who desire to participate? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D. Informed Consent Indicate how patients will be informed about the proposed study and how their consent will be solicited. The consent procedure should adhere to the requirements of DHHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46). If the study involves pediatric or mentally handicapped patients, describe procedures for seeking the permission of parents or guardians and, where applicable, the assent of each patient. Areas of special concern include potential adverse effects, financial costs, privacy, long-term follow- up and post-mortem examination. When gene transfer is a procedure separate from a clinical protocol, Informed Consent documents shall be submitted for both the gene transfer and clinical protocols. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;1. How will the major points covered in Appendices M&hyph;I&hyph;A through M&hyph;I&hyph;C be disclosed to potential participants in this study and/or parents or guardians in language that is understandable to them? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2. How will the innovative character and the theoretically possible adverse effects of the experiment be discussed with patients and/or parents or guardians? How will the potential adverse effects be compared with the consequences of the disease? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;3. What explanation of the financial costs of the experiment, follow-up care, and any available alternatives will be provided to patients and/or parents or guardians? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;4. How will patients and/or their parents or guardians be informed that the innovative character of the experiment may lead to great interest by the media in the research and in the treated patients? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;5. How will the patients and/or their parents or guardians be informed about: (i) the irreversible consequences of some of the procedures performed? (ii) any adverse medical consequences that may occur if the subject(s) withdraws from the study once it has begun? (iii) expectations of willingness to cooperate in long-term follow-up? and (iv) expectations that permission to perform an autopsy will be granted in the event of a patient's death as a precondition for a patient's participation in the study? This stipulation is included because an accurate determination of the precise cause of a patient's death would be of vital importance to all future patients. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;E. Privacy and Confidentiality Indicate what measure will be taken to protect the privacy of patients and their families as well as to maintain the confidentiality of research data. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;E&hyph;1. What provisions will be made to honor the wishes of individual patients (and the parents or guardians of pediatric or mentally handicapped patients) as to whether, when, or how the identity of patients is publicly disclosed. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;E&hyph;2. What provision will be made to maintain the confidentiality of research data, at least in cases where data could be linked to individual patients? Appendix M&hyph;II. Special Issues Although the following issues are beyond the normal purview of local Institutional Review Boards, the RAC requests that Principal Investigators respond to Appendices M&hyph;II&hyph;A and M&hyph;II&hyph;B below: Appendix M&hyph;II&hyph;A. What steps will be taken, consistent with Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;E, to ensure that accurate and appropriate information is made available to the public with respect to such public concerns as may arise from the proposed study? Appendix M&hyph;II&hyph;B. Do you or your funding sources intend to protect under patent or trade secret laws either the products or the procedures developed in the proposed study? If so, what steps will be taken to permit as full communication as possible among Principal Investigators and clinicians concerning research methods and results? Appendix M&hyph;III. Guidelines for the Submission of Human Gene Transfer Protocols Appendices M&hyph;III&hyph;A through M&hyph;III&hyph;D and M&hyph;IV apply to human gene transfer protocols considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2. Appendices M&hyph;III&hyph;A, M&hyph; IV, and M&hyph;V apply to human gene transfer protocols considered under Section III&hyph; B&hyph;2. Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;A.
