It has been learned that the United States and North Korea have reached an agreement that if the IAEA begins inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities, the discontinuation of the Team Spirit exercise should be announced and the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks should begin. Because the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks is expected to discuss the issue of improving U.S.-North Korean relations and economic cooperation and is expected to greatly change and develop North Korean-U.S. and North Korea-Japanese relations, attention is focused on the sincerity of North Korea, which is to receive inspections. However, as we watch the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue, we have mixed feelings and are rather displeased because there are not just one or two dubious things about the U.S.-North Korean negotiations. First, even though it is said that North Korea's nuclear issue is "nearly settled," the United States and North Korea have not revealed the contents of the agreements they have reached. That is, they have not revealed what procedure and which method will be used to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue. We cannot know whether there is a tacit understanding with the ROK or the issue of persuading the ROK has not been completed. Second, the opinions of the United States and North Korea over the method of inspecting the seven facilities are incongruous. We are bewildered because North Korea says that it will receive the IAEA's nuclear inspection just once; the United States stresses that the continuity of nuclear safeguards accord should be maintained. Third, when on earth can the North-South dialogue be resumed in the wake of the "settlement" and what will become of mutual nuclear inspections? This question is as obscure as ever. We cannot but doubt about why our government keeps silent even though it has stressed close cooperation with the United States. We should never overlook the "just one inspection" if it is true, as claimed by North Korea. The fact that just in order to reinspect the seven facilities, a year after the IAEA already inspected them as many as six times in 1992, and in order to replace the monitoring films and batteries, the United States has been strained for nearly 10 months over the North Korea's nuclear commotions and that it will offer diplomatic relations and economic cooperation to North Korea cannot be anything but nonsense. When the main U.S. press pointed out that the one time inspection is a great concession, the U.S. Government, saying "inspecting seven facilities is a great advance," stressed the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. The United States may think that North Korea will be forced to constantly receive inspections in exchange for economic cooperation. However, it is doubtful whether North Korea will truly and easily respond to receiving inspections. Regarding the issue of resuming North-South dialogue and mutual inspections, after the summit talks with President Clinton last November, President Kim Yong-sam stressed that the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue involves "a thorough and broad-scale approach method." Speaking at the New Year's press conference, President Kim Yong-sam said "dialogue and mutual inspections cannot be absolutely excluded" in resolving North Korea's nuclear issue and "it is the firm position of the United States and the ROK that the IAEA inspections and mutual inspections should be conducted at the same time." However, the U.S. side still has not announced a clear schedule, nor has it declared its promise to put into practice mutual inspections. In fact, if North Korea's nuclear transparency could be completely ensured through any organization or method, we would not need to insist on mutual inspections. The IAEA can inspect the facilities that North Korea reported to the IAEA. On the other hand, mutual inspections means that each party can mutually inspect all facilities, including the facilities that are not reported. Thus, mutual inspections should be realized without fail. Of course, U.S.-North Korean negotiations have not been completed yet and we will have to watch the first step taken by the U.S. and North Korea, that is, the IAEA-North Korean inspection negotiations. However, all suspicions should be cleared up without fail. The government should explain the process of nuclear negotiations and the direction the solution of the nuclear issue is taking.
