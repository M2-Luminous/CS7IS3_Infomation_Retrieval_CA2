It specializes in publishing and disseminating leaflets. The first appeared immediately after the well-known conflict between Ukrainian and Russian Navy men near Odessa. In this leaflet, Ukrainian servicemen are termed invaders. Another one came soon after the televised speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy regarding the situation in the Crimea. Apparently, the general wants to "throw us into the meat grinder of civil war." Therefore, the Ukrainian Supreme Council and the president should immediately remove him from the post of defense minister. The key expression in the leaflet is even more radical: "Dostoyinstvo" calls on Odessa residents to defy the next draft of young people into the Ukrainian Army, which is, obviously, an open violation of Ukrainian legislation. The association is headed by Oleksandr Shteyman, recent candidate for Ukrainian people's deputy, whose real name became known to Odessa residents during the electoral campaign. Before that, he had been Kamenskiy for some reason. The leaflet does not suggest under which army banners the Odessa youth should fight. Nor does it explain why the Ukrainian Army is considered invasive on Ukrainian territory.
