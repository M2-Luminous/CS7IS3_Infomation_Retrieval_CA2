Forming the Consultative Committee (part 2 of 2): Chen Chih-hui [7115 1807 6540], Tseng En-bo [2582 1869 3134], and Pu Shao-fu [0592 1421 1133] Did Not Respond; An Zijie [1344 1311 0094] Objected To Putting Chen Yao-cai [7115 5069 2088] on the Committee We should consider soliciting the opinions of Taiwanese forces in Hong Kong. Back then, the Taiwanese Government's attitude toward the mainland was still very inflexible, and they were against the Sino-British negotiations over the Hong Kong question. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was made public, the Taiwanese Government also issued its own declaration saying that they reserved the right to enter into negotiations in the future to take back Hong Kong. But it was unclear whether they would stay in Hong Kong or leave after 1997; it was all very confusing. To ease Taiwan's concern and win their support in drafting and promulgating the Basic Law and influence their view on the principle of "one country, two systems," we had to find ways to enlist the participation of the influential among them. Even if they were not willing to participate out of personal concern, or perhaps the Taiwanese Government was unwilling to let them participate, we should still be able to make public our united stand for the sake of the country. I therefore openly named three people, indicating that they were welcome to participate: The first was the de facto representative of the Taiwanese Government in Hong Kong and secretary of the KMT's Hong Kong-Macao headquarters, Chen Chih-hui; another was Tseng En-bo, chairman of the board of Hong Kong's SHI PAO; the third was Taiwan Legislative Yuan member Po Shao-fu. Of the three, Po was more open-minded and had a more populist stand and was considered the most likely to attend, and therefore his name headed the list. But at the end, none responded. Later, Po Shao-fu published an article in the newspaper entitled, "Thank You, Xu Jiatun," in which he gave a friendly response. We subsequently selected three replacements who also had close ties with Taiwan to join the Consultative Committee. With regard to the "Fei-Shi incident" ["flying rock incident"] -- the incident involving Liu Chien-shi [0491 0578 4258], I was probably being too extreme. Liu was head of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Council and leader of Hong Kong's intermediary unions. Back then, it was thought that he had political background and that certain forces were trying to use him to start a Polish-style solidarist union in Hong Kong and turn him into a Walesa-like personality. Many Hong Kong industrialists and entrepreneurs regarded Liu as an adversary. In labor wage disputes, his union often asked for unrealistic raises, making the terms unacceptable for the owners. Based on my unwillingness to give him even more publicity, I disagreed with the "leftist" union's -- the Federation of Trade Union [FTU]--idea of putting Liu Chien-shi on the Consultative Committee. Since the FTU had already made some public announcement, my decision caused them to openly break their promises, causing them trouble, which made the middle-of-the-road and leftist unions unhappy and brought unfavorable public response. Facts proved that the FTU was right and my rejecting Liu Chien-shi only made him even more popular, contrary to what I had wanted. Moreover, even people with background have friends; they too must work. After the Consultative Committee list was approved by the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, An Zijie suggested adding several foreign personages in financial and business circles to serve as consultants. The several vice chairmen had no objection, but to balance things, I suggested adding Chen Yao-cai, retired veteran labor leader from the "leftist" "FTU." An Zijie objected immediately and was very adamant about it, which was very unexpected. The several vice chairmen at the scene were stunned and quite embarrassed. Not wanting to make things difficult for everybody, I did not pursue the matter. When preparing for the Consultative Committee, there was an incident involving the election of the executive committee members, chairman, and vice chairman which Hong Kong media described as "storm in a teacup." The election was held at the downtown Lane Crawford Building. The building was one of Mr. Pao Yu-kang's [0545 3768 3068] properties after his purchase of "Wheelock." He himself offered to turn over one floor to the Consultative Committee to be used as an office. Election of the executive committee members went fairly smoothly. Nineteen members were elected from among the entire Consultative Committee. The only thing was, Cheng Yao-tang [6774 5069 2768], labor representative and head of the FTU whom we thought had high hopes, lost by one vote. After the executive members were chosen, there was a break, and the five initiators talked about electing the chairman and vice chairmen. I indicted that based on experience in the mainland, we should let the executive members work out a list of candidates before proceeding with the election. But the others wanted an election right away, and I did not insist. In that way, after electing the executive members, the first executive committee meeting was convened; it was presided over by Pao Yu-kang. He immediately announced the election of a chairman and vice chairmen and read from a list of candidates. The executive committee members were taken by surprise. Pao Yu-kang asked if there were any objection, and one executive committee member indicated that he had no objection. Thereupon, Pao said, "if there are no objections, please applause, and the motion is carried." Everybody applauded, and that was that. After the meeting, the executive committee members were not pleased, saying that it all moved too fast, that they were not prepared, and the process did not comply with committee regulations and so on. The reporters asked me about it, and I could only made some excuses. Of course, we could not blame it on anybody. It only showed that the several vice chairmen, including myself, lacked training in democracy. To salvage the situation, I asked Mao Jun-nian [3029 6874 1628] to consult the others and follow regulations to draw up a new list of candidates and hold another election. Although it turned out that the original winners were again elected, it still brought some criticisms. On 18 December 1985, the day before the anniversary of the formal signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law Consultative Committee was formally established. Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378], in the capacity of chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, spoke at the meeting. At that time, he was in Hong Kong at the invitation of the British Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong branch of XINHUA SHE. [Installment No 47] [21 June 93 p 2] [Text] 4. Democratic Consultation, Cooperation, and Compromise (part 1 of 2): Hong Kong People's Wishes Were Taken Into Full Consideration; the Drafting Process Was Completely Democratic The air of democracy during the drafting of the Basic Law was unprecedented. The drafting process in fact was a process of cooperation, consultation, and compromise among the parties (primarily between China and Hong Kong), and it was also a completely democratic process. In a period of four years and eight months, the drafting committee held eight conferences, five special topic small groups, and met more than 60 times. The mainland's drafting committee members came to Hong Kong on several occasions to solicit ideas from various parties in Hong Kong, and on two of those occasions, formally organized groups were sent to solicit opinions in a comprehensive way. They were known as the "two ups and two downs." The first of these visits was made between May and September of 1988 to gather written suggestions for the Draft Basic Laws. The second was made between February and 31 October of 1989, whereby opinions on the Sixth Session of the Seventh People's Standing Committee's examination of the "Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR" were solicited. The Consultative Committee took an objective and comprehensive approach when gathering ideas. The committee members had a full schedule in Hong Kong and often went to Beijing to report on ideas they had collected. On the two occasions they made their comprehensive survey of ideas, they gathered many suggestions and compiled them into a written report. To preserve the originality of the ideas, no comprehensive editing was made, but each item was recorded individually and reported truthfully, without distortion or simplification. The suggestions were "categorized" to make reading easier. In addition, through its contact with individuals, groups, and others, the Hong Kong branch of XINHUA SHE had also gathered many suggestions. XINHUA SHE made special studies of those ideas, and some Chinese-funded organizations also heard and gathered ideas and brought them to the branch XINHUA SHE. The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the Hong Kong-Macao Affairs Office also obtained some information, and so did party and state leaders when they were meeting people from different circles in Hong Kong and Macao. It is fair to say that the Hong Kong people's wishes were given full consideration in those four years and eight months; most ideas were deemed very valuable. They were studied and discussed repeatedly, especially by the Drafting Committee. Members of the Drafting Committee in Hong Kong represented different interests and different stands; there were few consensus. The committee had no problem with the more simple, reasonable, and less controversial issues. For example, the question of the New Territories' native inhabitants' right to inherit land only involved residents of the New Territories; there was no controversy, and it was ratified easily and was written into Article 40 of the Basic Law. Another example was the churches' right to use and inherit properties and accept financial aid, which was a concern of the churches but not vital to the others, and was quickly decided in the Basic Law. But things were different when it came to issues that involved other interests, that were confrontational and controversial. For example, on the questions of the Hong Kong people's autonomy and the relationship between the central government and the government of the SAR, there were many disputes. The Drafting Committee had a principle: Do the easy things first; that is, tackle the easy, less controversial problems first to lay the foundation for the Basic Law and take ample time to consider and discuss the difficult problems. As far as the Drafting Committee itself was concerned, in order to deal with the relationship between members of the mainland drafting committee and the Hong Kong drafting committee and between the committee and the outside world, many mainland practices were changed to facilitate cooperation and compromises. For example, it is customary to keep everything secret in the mainland. The secretariat followed mainland practice and brought up the secrecy issue at the Drafting Committee' first meeting. Hong Kong's Drafting Committee members and the media objected, and public opinion demanded that the Drafting Committee's activities be made public, and so at the chairman's meeting the secretariat asked for a debate and suggested accepting the idea, changing past practices. And so it was decided that after each special topic small group meeting, a spokesman would talk to reporters about the contents of each meeting, but there was one provision, that while the contents of all discussions could be disclosed, what was said and who said it was strictly confidential. If individual committee members chose to disclose what he or she had said at a meeting, the Drafting Committee had no right to intervene, but the formal briefing (the background explanation sessions) would name no names, giving individual members the right to choose. Subsequently, the meetings became increasingly public. The entire drafting process was basically an open process and was completely transparent, drastically changing the mainland's usual workstyle and approach.

Democratic Consultation, Cooperation, and Compromise (part 2 of 2): The Hong Kong People Were Satisfy With the Basic Law Prior to "June 4" Between the mainland committee members and the Hong Kong committee members, it was the former who tried hard to let the latter express their opinions, to accept their ideas, and in the actual writing, they tried their best to satisfy the Hong Kong drafting committee and honor the Hong Kong people's reasonable wishes as much as possible. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong drafting committee members also adjusted to the mainland's regulations and discussion procedures. For example, when the Consultative Committee drew up its regulations, some members objected to the reference to "democratic consultation," saying that the term was "imprecise and unscientific," and they also felt that it connoted the sense that the democratic parties and factions were in agreement with the ruling Communist Party. But in the mainland, democracy and consultation always go hand in hand. Later a compromise was reached, and the term was included in the regulations. I once said that consultation was part of democracy, and for that I was criticized by some Hong Kong people. Actually it was just a misunderstanding. Consultation can be on equal grounds. In the consultative process, there is an assertive side, and there is also a side that accepts and agrees, or both sides may compromise. Subsequently, in the actual drawing up of the Basic Law, many in the Hong Kong Drafting Committee and the Consultative Committee accepted this approach, and everybody talked things over on equal footing. It became a way to give expression to democracy. Prior to the second plenary session of the Drafting Committee, the secretariat sent copies of the outline of the Draft Basic Law to the chairman and the vice chairmen. The reporters came to me, and I said, "I have read it, but I cannot disclose the contents." Little did I know that would cause trouble. Liu Yiu-chu [1675 3852 3796] asked, "We are all members. Why should he get to look at the draft first?" I learned my lesson. In the mainland, usually we pay little attention to procedure at meetings. To let someone in charge look at a draft first was nothing unusal, but in a capitalist society, procedure, also known as the rules of the game, is an important part of democracy. Later, Li Hou [2621 1775], the Drafting Committee secretary general in charge of the secretariat, said, "At first, we thought that the outline was not an essential issue; it had no substantive content, and we thought that we might as well make a rough draft, not knowing that it would lead to such misunderstanding. Because of this incident, we have decided to set up a special topic small group composed of mainland and Hong Kong committee members." Practice later proved that the small group approach was very effective. The Basic Law was based on ideas suggested by mainland experts and personages concerned about the Hong Kong question as well as people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, including some foreigners. By way of meetings and the broadcast media, and through debates and consultations, the "comment-soliciting draft," "rough draft," and "Decision" were written. In my opinion, overall, the Hong Kong people were quite satisfied with the Basic Law: Prior to "June 4," they were mainly interested in whether the Basic Law would really be implemented after 1997. After "June 4," they became more dissatisfied with the final version of the political system as written in the Basic Law, especially regarding Article 23 which amended the anti-subversion clause. Overall, the Basic Law was founded on the wisdom of the masses and compiled after a complicated consultative process. It was the result of compromises and the product of the expression of wisdom on both sides. Even today, I still think that it is a good choice that will put the people of Hong Kong on the road to democratic autonomy. 5. Trouble Over a Booklet (part 1 of 4): British Hong Kong Published "Green Paper" and "White Paper" The British Hong Kong government put out the "Green Paper" on the reform of the system of representative government in July, before the Draft Joint Declaration was signed by China and Britain in September 1984, and in November, before the formal signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December, it rushed to publish the "White Paper." In Hong Kong, these actions caught our attention, and we began studying them. The British Hong Kong government's goal as stated in the "Green Paper" was to "gradually establish a political regime, so that its power is firmly rooted in Hong Kong and has the full authority to represent the Hong Kong people's views and is held responsible to the Hong Kong people even more directly." By the time the "White Paper" was published, the goal was even more clear: It was to "gradually establish at the central level a system of representative government that is even more directly responsible to the Hong Kong people and is firmly rooted in Hong Kong." The British Government's goal was very clear. It was to set up a system of representative government in Hong Kong and practise so called "returning the government to the people." From our own intelligence and from public opinion trends, we had proof of British intention to radically change the basic framework of the Hong Kong government prior to 1997. [Installment No 49]
