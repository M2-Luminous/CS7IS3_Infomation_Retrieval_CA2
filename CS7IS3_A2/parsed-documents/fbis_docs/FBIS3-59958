A considerable part of those talks was devoted to military problems. On the basis of the results of the meeting the heads of governments signed among other things the memorandum "On Mutual Understanding on Questions of Ensuring the Functioning of the Baykonur Space Center." Commenting on the documents presented for signing, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation, noted that they now make it possible to carry out all work at the space center normally and determine the procedure for the shipment across the border of the goods necessary for work to be conducted at Baykonur. The Russian military contingent is remaining here and its daily life and activity will be governed by Russian laws. Viktor Stepanovich also added that the heads of the Russian and Kazakhstan governments have been instructed by those states' presidents to prepare documents on military and military-technical cooperation in January 1994. What does the memorandum say? It is important that it speaks not only about the space center but also about the test ranges sited on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan and about military cooperation. It is envisaged that Russia will use the military installations under lease from the Republic of Kazakhstan. In this regard the operation of the Baykonur space center and the test ranges will be ensured by the Russian Government or authorized organs of state administration. The Russian military formations supporting these installations are stationed on Kazakhstan's territory temporarily. Their status will be determined by a separate agreement. During the talks process the heads of the Russian and Kazakhstan governments expressed mutual satisfaction at the fact that the Republic of Kazakhstan has affiliated to the nuclear weapons nonproliferation treaty as a state not possessing nuclear weapons. The Russian side has expressed a readiness to offer guarantees of safety to Kazakhstan as a nonnuclear weapon state together with other depositories of the nuclear weapons nonproliferation treaty and at the same time to give military assistance if necessary to repulse external aggression and to counter other encroachments on the security and territorial integrity of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The sides recognized the need to begin holding bilateral talks on the implementation of the START I treaty and the package of Lisbon accords as well as the need to agree a timetable in the very near future for the withdrawal of all the nuclear warheads in the Republic of Kazakhstan to Russian territory. At the talks the sides also examined questions of scrapping the strategic offensive weapons stationed in Kazakhstan and to reimburse the republic the equivalent value of the fissionable materials and components of the nuclear weapons and so forth. As we can see, they relate to the most acute and vital problems affecting the life and service of Russian servicemen in this republic. The fact that the ice has finally been broken here is perhaps the most important outcome of these talks. After all, people in uniform, for all their discipline and composure, must have clear prospects and guarantees of social and legal protection. Here, you would think, there is still broad scope for the work of the politicians and lawyers: In addition to Baykonur and the ranges there are other Russian military units stationed in Kazakhstan. For example, it has part of the missile early warning system. Status and the conditions for continued presence abroad must be defined for these units, too. Meanwhile, unfortunately, all they can do is wait and hope.
