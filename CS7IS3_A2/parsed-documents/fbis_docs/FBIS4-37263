It embarked, since early this morning, on random and barbarous attacks with rockets and heavy, long-distance artillery against the peaceful residential areas in the suburbs of the city of Aden as well as against vital economic installations. This has resulted in the martyrdom of more than 20 persons, most of them children, women and the elderly, as well as a number of injuries. This was accompanied by attempts to advance on all fronts towards the capital, Aden, a matter which compelled our defensive Armed Forces to repulse decisively this new aggression of the forces belonging to the ruling military regime in Sanaa. They stopped them from advancing. Battles were still continuing while this communique was being prepared. [passage omitted]
