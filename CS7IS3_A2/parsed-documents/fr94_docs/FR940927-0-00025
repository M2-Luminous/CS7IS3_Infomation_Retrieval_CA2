FR940927-0-00025 FR940927-0-00003 7 CFR Part 457 Common Crop Insurance Regulations; Extra Long Staple Cotton Crop Insurance Provisions AGENCY: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure extra long staple (ELS) cotton. These provisions will supplement the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) which contains standard terms and conditions common to most crops. The intended effect of this rule is to move specific crop provisions for insuring ELS cotton to the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) for ease of use by the public and conformance among policy terms. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mari L. Dunleavy, Regulatory and Procedural Development, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 1, 1999. This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this rule are found in 7 CFR part 400, subpart H. It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. The policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amount of work required of the insurance companies delivering these policies will not increase from the amount required to deliver previous policies. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. The Office of the General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in subsections 2(a) and (2)(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought. This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. By separate rule, 7 CFR 401.121 will be amended to restrict the crop years of application to those prior to the crop year for which this rule will be effective. FCIC will remove and reserve the ELS cotton endorsement contained in 7 CFR 401.121. On Tuesday, May 31, 1994, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register at 59 FR 28027 proposing to revise the Common Crop Insurance Regulations by adding new provisions for ELS cotton crop insurance. Following publication of the proposed rule, the public was afforded 30 days to submit written comments, data, and opinions. The comments received and FCIC responses are as follows: Comment: Two comments suggested that the crop provisions should not be implemented for the 1995 crop year because: (1) Crop insurance reform will require many policy changes. Implementation of these crop provisions should be tabled until reform decisions are reached because impacts on policy terms are not yet clear. Delaying common policy implementation until it can be implemented in an orderly fashion should be beneficial to everyone concerned; and
