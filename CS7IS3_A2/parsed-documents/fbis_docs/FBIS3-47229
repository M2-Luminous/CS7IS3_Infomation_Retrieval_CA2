FBIS3-47229 "dreas007_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 Thailand Cambodia Stance Backed, Western Media Chided Western Press `Biased' BK1101030794 Bangkok THE NATION in English 11 Jan 94 p A4 BK1101030794 Bangkok THE NATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The Thai government and military yesterday reaffirmed Thailand's full support for the elected Cambodian government, and strongly denied a new wave of allegations that Bangkok still secretly backs the Khmer Rouge. "Why do some people in Cambodia always blame it all on Thailand every time they are defeated on the battlefield by the Khmer Rouge?" army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said at a press conference. He also criticized western news agencies for what he described as reports biased against Thailand. Fresh accusations concerning the Khmer Rouge were threatening to sour Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's planned visit to Cambodia tomorrow. On Saturday Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut demanded that Chuan clarify Thailand's stand during his visit. The following day Cambodian commanders and UN officials reportedly alleged that the Khmer Rouge launched recent attacks from inside Thailand. "The Khmer Rouge being pinned against the ropes is one thing, and attacking from Thailand is another," said Phalangkun. "The Thai army commander in chief has made it clear that the Thai military is strictly complying with the govemment's policy of supporting only the legitimate government of Cambodia." Thailand has never complained internationally about artillery shells landing on Thai soil as a result of fighting between Cambodian troops and the Khmer Rouge, added the army spokesman. "Since last December, nearly 100 shells caused damage along the Thai border. Who should be responsible for that? Can Prince Norodom Sirivut answer that?" He said the army has invited foreign journalists from two western news agencies to attend a briefing on Thai policy toward Cambodia. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the government has recognized and supported the legitimate Cambodian government since the 1991 Paris accords were signed. Cambodian officials should be more careful when giving interviews to foreign journalists, because their reports could indirectly affect the promising relations between the two countries. Prasong said the government wants reconciliation in Cambodia and he was distressed by allegations by Prince Norodom Sirivut's demand -- in comments to made to foreign reporters -- that Chuan again clarify his position. "If Cambodia cannot settle its internal affairs and bring about unity, its chances for accelerated development are not good. "The Cambodian government's failure to wipe out the Khmer Rouge rebels has nothing to do with Thailand's involvement. Cambodia should not try to put the blame on its neighbour," the foreign minister said. Prasong said Cambodian military leaders should not claim that Khmer Rouge guerrillas have launched attacks from Thai soil. He said people from both countries sometimes travel across the border without being properly checked by immigration officials. "It's too easy to say that Khmer Rouge forces have been using Thai soil as a military base. The military would not allow such activity in Thai territory. The Cambodian government should back its claims with substantive evidence," he said. "Relationships between the two countries will be on the agenda during Prime Minister Chuan's visit to Cambodia beginning tomorrow." First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said the Foreign Ministry and military have always supported the elected Cambodian government. He said Cambodia should not rely on foreign press reports, which sometimes give the wrong impression that Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge. "The two countries do not have any serious disagreement. I think we understand each other very well," Chettha said. The military is in control along the border and will continue efforts to curb weapons smuggling. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said Cambodian leaders should not doubt Thailand's support. "Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge was a thing of the past and not applicable to present political circumstances," he said. He also said economic cooperation will be a top priority at talks during Chuan's visit.
