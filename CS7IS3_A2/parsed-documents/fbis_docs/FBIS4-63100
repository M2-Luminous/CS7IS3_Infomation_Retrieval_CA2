It will not be difficult to sign the existing Partnership for Peace document, and Russia has nothing against the framework agreement. But since Russia believes that this document should be amended to take into account Russia's specific features and its relations with NATO, it will need time to draft the said document. It will not take long and the document is expected to be signed and formalised as a protocol, as President Yeltsin said in Bonn. Anyway, our intentions are serious and we are working hard to draft the document as soon as possible, Kozyrev said.
