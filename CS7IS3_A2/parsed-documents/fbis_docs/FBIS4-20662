First Shipment of Enriched Uranium by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. 94FE0271E Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Nov 93 p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0271E Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] On the 19th, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. made its first shipment of uranium fluoride VI (UF[.sub]6[/]) produced at the uranium enrichment factory at Rokkasho-mura in Aomori Prefecture. The uranium product was sealed into 15 cylinders and loaded onto a specialized truck bound for the reprocessing factory in Tokai-mura in Ibaraki Prefecture. This is the first shipment since operations began almost two years ago. The industrialization of uranium enrichment has entered into a new phase. The uranium products in this shipment are to be used by Tokyo Electric Power Co., Kansai EPC, and Chubu EPC. After the uranium is converted into uranium dioxide at the reprocessing plant, it will be assembled into fuel assemblies at nuclear fuel processing plants in Tokai-mura, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Osaka Prefecture, and will then be shipped to the various power plants for use as fuel. There are no further shipments planned for FY93, with the prospects for the next delivery coming in FY94. Regarding the transportation of this shipment, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said, "In the transport of this uranium we satisfied the country's technological standard from the outset, and carried it out taking total safety measures, such as forming a convoy which included escort vehicles in front of and behind the transport vehicle." The enrichment factory, which began operations in March 1992, currently produces enriched uranium at a rate of 450 ton separative work units (SWU) per year, but they are aiming at increasing production by an additional 150 ton SWU/year after April 1994. Ultimate plant capacity would be 1,500 ton SWU/year, however, permission from the government has only been obtained for 1,050 ton SWU/year. Operations to produce this level are scheduled to begin in FY98.
