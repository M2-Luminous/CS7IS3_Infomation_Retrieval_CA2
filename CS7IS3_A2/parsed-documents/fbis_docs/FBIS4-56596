In addition to the accusation that the FSLN "is turning into a party for the old," JS members say the party suffers from a lack of unity and democracy and "has lost credibility...due to the behavior of its leaders." Former JS leader Roberto Stuart points out that the party is no longer influential with young people because FSLN leaders "do not listen" to the ideas of others. Javier Cardoze, JS secretary in Rivas, warns that the FSLN will be hard pressed "to attract the youth vote in 1996." Youth leaders call for wider participation by JS members in decisionmaking activities and a higher standard of ethics.
