Composed in advance, committed to memory, rehearsed over and over in front of the mirror, they can even seem spontaneous and impromptu. Press conferences -- where you really do have to be spontaneous in response to journalists' malicious and sometimes underhand provocations -- do not suit him. He showed this again the other day when he allowed himself to say that RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], being a public service of the state, cannot set itself against the ruling majority. This displays an alarming conceptual confusion on his part between state and government. But this is not the worrying thing. What worries us much more is the fact that, in the face of a tide of angry responses, he said he was confident of having conveyed the thoughts and feelings of what he calls "the people," as is proved, he says, by opinion polls. We all know the unconditional trust that the prime minister places in opinion polls, and the fervent enthusiasm that the organizers of these polls grant him in return. But in this specific instance we are afraid that they did tell the truth: "The people" probably do like the prospect of six television networks (three RAI and three Fininvest) setting aside debates and disputes to praise the new regime and its "helmsman." We are very well aware of where this path leads. This is particularly clear to members of my generation, who have already experienced it. But before sounding the alarm, we who work in the "mass media" should consider why "the people" prefer a single sector of the media, not too concerned about whether or not it is free. Have we so badly used, or rather abused, this freedom, since the allies returned it to us, as to make "the people" long for a return to censorship? We put this question chiefly to the left-wing forces, recalling the fierce sectarianism with which they persecuted whoever sounded a different note from them. Some will say that it is not opportune to hold a trial on abuses of freedom at a time when freedom is in jeopardy. This is true, which is why we will not persist with it. But only these abuses can explain the indifference with which the so-called man in the street responded to the helmsman's remarks and justify his claim of having made them on behalf of the people and with their tacit consent. I was still in short pants when Matteotti [antifascist] was assassinated. But I still remember what people around me said about it. After six months of heated campaigning in the press (there was no television or radio at the time) in which nobody could any longer distinguish truth from lies, people welcomed with relief the 3 January 1925 speech with which Mussolini gagged the press and announced the dictatorship -- that which, amid the forced silence of its opponents, led us to the racist laws and to the disaster of World War II. Berlusconi is not Mussolini. He has no corpses on his conscience. And we see on the horizon no earth-shattering tragedies such as those into which fascism found itself drawn. But it is this very climate of fascism, of exemption not from problems (those, we have), but from the existential anxieties that make us receptive to the great principles, that could open Berlusconi's way to a "democracy by proclamation." Not of the Palazzo Venezia [fascist] kind, which would be too extensive for him. But that of the Casa Rosada, which permitted Peron to harangue the crowd as follows, "They say a dollar costs 10,000 pesos. But when your wives go to the market to buy meat, do they pay in dollars?" and to win the applause of those same "people" whom Berlusconi now cites to argue, on their behalf, the subjugation of the entire powerful and influential mechanism of television to the interests of his majority. He will succeed because the people are with him, and not with us. And when the people set themselves behind someone, the men of the media eventually support the people. I saw this happen at the start of my life. I never expected to see it at the close. But it seems that it must be so.
