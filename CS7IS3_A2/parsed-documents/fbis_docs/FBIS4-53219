A senior official of the Transportation Ministry strongly hinted yesterday that it might have to stop the negotiations with China and open aviation talks with Taiwan, instead. "Negotiations between Korea and China have been going nowhere over the past two years due to China's unacceptable demands. It is now time for Korea to consider another option, which is Taiwan," the official said. Korea switched diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan two years ago. Since then, regular flights between Korea and Taiwan have been cut off, while Korea and China have initiated charter flights between Seoul and China's two cities, Shanghai and Tienjin. For Korean Air alone, the loss from the closing of the Taiwan- Korea route is estimated to reach about 100 million U.S. dollars a year, according to an airline official. Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese visited Korea annually before the diplomatic breakup. "We can't accommodate China's demands, which are on the borderline with outrage," the official said. "Either they back off or else." The two countries will make last-ditch efforts to conclude an aviation agreement in the next meeting, expected to take place later this month or early next month. So far, there have been seven such meetings with the last one in February. A major bone of contention is China's demand to unilaterally use a beyond point right from Seoul, possibly to Los Angeles, while Korea reserves its due right to link their flight from Beijing to Europe. If that's not possible, China argued for its unilateral right to shuttle from a major Chinese city to Seoul, excluding the participation of a Korean airline. None of China's demands is acceptable to Korea since they violate the basic spirit of "fair and equal opportunities" evident in all air agreements, according to the official. He observed that China's demands are based on "fair and equal benefits," a typical socialist code but unacceptable in terms of market-oriented competition. "At the moment, Korean carriers fly about 70 percent of passengers using Korea-China chartered flights, while the rest go to Air China," he said. "If regular flights open, the gap will be soaring." He interpreted China's stubborn pursuit of the biased agreement as being aimed at rectifying the current imbalance of revenues and nipping in the bud the future runaway gap. However, he said that some of the imbalance can be corrected through the negotiations between the two countries' airlines. "The imbalance of revenues can be tackled through the consultations between the two countries' airlines, although the government can't dictate what policies they will take," he said. Despite Korea's hint at using the Taiwan option, it remains to be seen whether it will actually use it if the future talks don't promise much since China is the only remaining upscale market Korea's airlines can exploit. In addition, preventing Korea's strong hand is China's aviation policy that bans airlines flying to Taiwan, from serving Chinese routes.
