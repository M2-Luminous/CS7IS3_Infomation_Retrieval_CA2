The jury ruled that Noriega, who was toppled by the U.S. Army in December 1989 and is serving a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking, was the instigator of Giroldi's murder. The judicial file stated that on 4 October Giroldi was shot 15 times in the back on the patio of the extinct FDP headquarters. Former Major Heraclides Sucre was also found guilty of murder. He was the actual perpetrator of the murder and was tried in absentia. The jury acquitted the other three remaining defendants in the case: former Captains Ramon Diaz, (who was also charged with actually committing the murder), and Camilo Vega and former Mayor Lucinio Miranda, who were tried for complicity in the crime.
