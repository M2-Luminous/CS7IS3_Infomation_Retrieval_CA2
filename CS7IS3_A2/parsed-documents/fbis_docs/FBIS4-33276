Mr. Morales, although this event ends on Friday, could you tell us what issues were addressed. [Morales] Let me tell you that the 20th Conference of the SELA is important, not only because it is the 20th of its kind, but also because there have been important parallel events. One such event was an important seminar. Many Latin American figures participated, including the five permanent secretaries the system has had during its 20 years. There were four round table discussions on the dilemma surrounding development in Latin America and the Caribbean; on Latin America and the Caribbean within the context of the new international agenda; on Latin American and Caribbean integration, and on the challenges of the 21st Century. Comrade Ernesto Melendez, president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation, participated in one of these discussions. He addressed the issue of the 21st Century and the challenges that SELA now faces and its plans for facing these challenges. It was a very significant discussion, as were almost all of the presentations at the seminar. At this time there is a meeting with all of the participating ministers on a very special issue -- the relationship between the United States and Latin America and the Caribbean. That has become the main issue of this meeting, as the so called Hemispheric Summit, summoned by the United States, draws closer. The delegations here have all been probing to see what the various countries in America have to say about such an important matter as relations with the U.S. There has been plenty of work and the SELA reached a decision regarding the important issue of the contrasts between Latin American integration and hemispheric integration. Furthermore, they discussed the possible role of the so-called Hemispheric Summit. This is rather a quasi-hemispheric meeting because, as you know, our country has been excluded from the event. All the delegations here expressed their will.... [pauses] There are several doubts about the meeting: Why there is no agenda? Why and how was Miami selected as the seat? The lack of will by the U.S. Government to discuss issues such as trade, cooperation, investment, and the transfer of technology, which are so very important to Latin America. Minister Melendez pointed out other additional issues. He asked how Latin American can explain a debt of $487 billion, while more than 200 million people live in extreme poverty. [Govin] We also know that you plan to participate in a meeting of the technical committee discussing the creation of the Association of Caribbean States. The meeting is planned to begin today, and will last for three days. Please tell us about the meeting? [Morales] We are going to hold what we expect will be the last meeting of the technical committee on the creation of the Association of Caribbean States. We are sure the end results of our work here will be the installation of the Association of Caribbean States, which will then carry out its own agenda among meetings of Caribbean heads of states and ministers in the near future.
