The calls were made during a meeting with Thai Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon and included a request for Qantas, the Australian airline, to be granted more landing rights and easier tax terms. One of the issues Mr Uthai raised during the meeting at the Commerce Ministry was a complaint about excessively tight immigration restrictions for Thai businessmen and women, and for students. No resolutions were reached during the meeting, but Mr McMullen stressed afterwards that he considered the differences to be a small part of a "rapidly growing and harmonious" trade relationship. Some progress was made on setting up a bilateral economic commission, but details have not yet been completed, Mr McMullen said. With Thai and Australian leaders due to meet again in the next few weeks, including Australia's Prime Minister Bob Keating -- who will visit Thailand to open the bridge across the Mekong River to Laos next month -- an announcement on the commission might be made in a month or so, he said. Mr McMullen is on his first trip outside Australia since his appointment in January. He is making a series of courtesy calls in ASEAN before attending a meeting in Kuala Lumpur of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), a regional body representing governments, business and academics. Australia, along with other developed countries, such as those in the European Union, has been calling for rights equal to those granted to Americans under the 1966 Thai-US Amity Treaty, which allows US citizens to engage in a number of services and professional occupations normally restricted to Thais. Under pressure, both bilaterally and through the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, Thai ministers and officials have been considering whether to withdraw the special rights granted under the Thai-US treaty or to extend the same rights to other trading partners. Mr Uthai said he explained to his Australian counterpart that the Thai-US treaty was signed when Thailand had no elected government. The present, elected Government is reviewing the treaty to determine whether it should be maintained, revoked or amended. "I personally do not want to talk about revoking the treaty because it may harm the relationship (between Thailand and the United States). But a revision to reduce the coverage of the treaty is necessary to make it reflect the current situation," Mr Uthai said. Australia also wants Thailand to reduce the import duty on breakfast cereals from 60 percent to 20 percent. From Canberra's point of view, this would mainly affect products made in Australia by Kelloggs, a US company. Kelloggs wants the duty cut so that it can better compete with Nestle's corn flakes, which are made in the Philippines and enjoy a 6 percent tariff as an ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture -- a programme that cuts 90 percent from basic rates for at least four years. Thai sources say that in previous discussions, they proposed that the Australians talk to ASEAN as a whole. They also suggested that Australian-made breakfast cereal could be given a different customs classification because it is made using a different process. The Australian national flag carrier, Qantas, wants increased landing rights, but the two sides differ over whether the flights should be considered as using Bangkok as a stop-over point for passengers or as an origin or destination point. Qantas also desires its value-added tax [VAT] assessment to be "zero-rated" instead of "exempt". The former would allow the airline to claim VAT rebates for tax paid on purchases even though no tax is paid on sales, while the latter does not because it puts the airline outside the VAT system. The Finance Ministry has ruled that zero rating will be reciprocal, meaning it will be granted only to companies from countries that also grant zero rating to Thai firms. Mr Uthai said he had told Mr McMullen that these issues are not handled by the Commerce Ministry but he would pass on the requests. The two sides had prepared information for discussing multilateral issues such as the future of the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting nations, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, but Mr McMullen, who left yesterday afternoon for Manila after less than a day in Bangkok, said there was not enough time to discuss these matters. He said he could discuss the Cairns Group and APEC with Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and Mr Uthai at the PECC meeting in Kuala Lumpur next Tuesday. Briefing reporters at the Australian Embassy, Mr McMullen said his priority for the year is "open regionalism" through the development of APEC, which would be the dominant framework of Thai-Australian relationships and such issues as the Cairns Group. His comments reflected what Thailand and other ASEAN countries see as Australia's aggressiveness on developing trade and investment cooperation within APEC. ASEAN advocates a slower approach. Mr McMullen said he favours making the Cairns Group a permanent body to monitor implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements on agriculture. The Cairns Group was set up to lobby in the Uruguay Round for farm trade liberalisation. Australia is chairman and Thailand plays an active role. Dr Suphachai has also said he favours making the Cairns Group permanent. The group is to meet in Marrakech, Morocco, next month, when the 118 participants in the Uruguay Round convene to sign the round's agreements. Another formal Cairns Group meeting is to be held in May in Uruguay.
