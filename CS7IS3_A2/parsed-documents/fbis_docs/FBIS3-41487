Above the Wild Public Debate Ehrnrooth, chairman of the board of Kymmene Oy, emphasized that he is an individual thinker when it comes to current issues surrounding the forestry industry. In his view, it is possible that even the current management of the Kymmene Group may have different opinions on the matters. Ehrnrooth has been the chairman of the Central Federation of Finnish Forest Industries and the Central Federation of Finnish Industry for many years. In Ehrnrooth's view, the forestry industry should embark on a counterattack that should use an information strike based on scientific fact as its weapon. This endeavor would be supported by an international panel of scientists. ``One can certainly find bad conditions in the field, but the discussion regarding them must be elevated to a higher level, above the wild public debate. New argumentation must be developed, because it has become evident that the industry is unable to hold its own in today's public debate,'' said Ehrnrooth. According to Ehrnrooth, one should remember that within the forestry industry, significant changes have taken place by means of normal industrial evolution. For example, in his view, Greenpeace and other environmental organizations have not contributed to the fact that the pollution of waters has decreased in severity to a fraction of what it was 20 years ago. Ehrnrooth would like to see all the industry in Europe joining forces for a counterattack, as Finland, by itself, cannot dictate its views on the markets. ``Precise argumentation is necessary, as intimations only worsen the situation,'' he said. ``It is almost inconceivable that the industry has been unable, in connection with the talk about recycling, for example, to present its views on the burning of waste. The debate is conducted on the terms of Greenpeace and other movements, and the industry's attempts to defend itself have met with varied success. A large portion of fiber-based wastepaper lends itself to recycling, but clearly the best way of getting rid of bad cut is burning, at today's technology level. That is fire without smoke,'' said Ehrnrooth. According to Ehrnrooth, the industry has been unable to close its ranks, because, in a confused situation some parties will experience short-term competition advantages. ``Each and every one may look inward and consider how to benefit from industry or national advantages,'' he said. ``We can react with calm to the German magazine DER SPIEGEL's recent attack on Finnish forestry, at least as long as the information is spread through pictures taken in Canada. We have at our disposal some solid weapons for a counterattack, when we consider that hardly any other country can manage its forest resources with the same competence as we, and major mistakes lie way back in time. The national economy should be given the opportunity to utilize the tax funds that have systematically been sunk into our forestry sector,'' said Ehrnrooth. In domestic raw materials policies, Ehrnrooth still sees remnants of a closed economy. ``Slices from the national economic pie were amicably cut for milk production and stumpage. Such an interlinkage is not allowed anymore,'' he added. ``The pricing of wood raw materials is a different story, and the producers are represented on the markets by a strong interest organization. It makes one wonder why anyone still gives it any credence, considering the bad advice it has dispensed to its members during the last few years,'' he noted. ``It is not the first time that the Forestry Association, which is owned by the producers, is pushing for price increases in the entire field of wood products. It is difficult for me to understand why other companies would have to follow the Forestry Association's lead. I would imagine that, in the future, large forestry companies would deal directly with the forest owners. When lumber prices are increasing the way they are now, it should also be reflected in the stumpage prices. On the other hand, wood pulp prices are so low that it does not make sense to increase fiber prices,'' said Ehrnrooth. ``The dual role of the Forestry Association has been subject for discussions as far back as I can remember. However, the fact is that the interests of the industry represented by the Forestry Association are quite similar to the rest of the industry. Luckily enough, the disagreements regarding raw materials do not dominate the whole field,'' Ehrnrooth added. ``Instead of our returning to a policy of price recommendations, we should find other ways to peaceful solutions. My opinion is that, in a way, it is in society's interest that the wood does not rot in the forests. If we cannot reach an agreement on wood prices, we should consider, for example, the use of arbitration,'' he concluded.
