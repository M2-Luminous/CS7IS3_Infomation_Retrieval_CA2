In Pavlychko's opinion, the reasons for the defeat of the Ukrainian national democrats were the most profound economic crisis, the nostalgia that it has caused for the former times, inadequate political experience, and, of course, the absence of unity, which enabled the ruling nomenklatura "to heap the blame for what has happened on the national democrats." Dmitriy Pavlychko declared: "The very idea of Ukraine's independence is being called in question today. We are once again in a phase of struggle for an independent state." In his opinion, the national democrats should in the current situation renounce the protracted euphoria from the acquisition of state independence and attempt to link the idea of statehood with that of social justice, since antimarket views prevail in the present Supreme Council, and members of parliament are adopting a policy of a return to the command-administrative system. Pavlychko agreed that it is, indeed, today necessary for regulation of the economy on the part of the state, but that this should be done in the interests of the poorest strata of society and that "we cannot return to the socialist capitalism under which we lived for 70 years." Dmitriy Pavlychko cited the two principal most important tasks of the democratic camp: victory at the parliamentary by-elections for 112 people's deputies of Ukraine on 24 July and concerted support for the progressive candidate at the upcoming presidential elections. Pavlychko announced that the "Ukraine" Association has been able to agree on and put forward 73 united democratic candidates and that he would be pleased if only half of these were to win. In the opinion of Vladimir Klimchuk, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, the parliamentary by-elections are today the democrats' most important tasks, since it is they that can, if not alter the correlation of forces in parliament in favor of the democrats, then in any event, preserve for them the opportunity to ensure that the left cannot have in parliament a constitutional majority and cannot adopt a constitution and laws to their advantage. Apropos the presidential elections, Pavlychko said that the leaders of national democratic parties and movements had attempted to unite and had created a coordinating council of chairmen of political parties, which is to define a common approach to the presidential campaign and determine the candidate to be supported. At the same time, on the other hand, the leaders of the democratic association affirmed that they had been unable thus far to formulate a common strategy and tactics at the elections and had not settled on a single candidate. According to Dmitriy Pavlychko, the democrats should proceed, meanwhile, from the fact that they must under no circumstances "support regression" and should, consequently, oppose, in his opinion, the anti-Ukraine and antimarket programs of former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and the present speaker of parliament, Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party. In Pavlychko's opinion, democrats should support the "lesser of the two evils." Dmitriy Pavlychko declared that this candidate today is Leonid Kravchuk, who alone could worthily confront both Leonid Kuchma and Aleksandr Moroz, uphold Ukraine's independence, and be a predictable politician. "We are today at the Rubicon: Either you are for Ukraine or you are against it," Pavlychko summed up, and added that the ideal situation would be the distribution of the highest offices of state among all the dominant political forces and their leaders. Specifically, Pavlychko believes, Kravchuk would be acceptable as president, and Moroz, as speaker of parliament, and Ivan Plyushch and other presidential contestants would join a government of reforms and all-Ukraine accord. As far as Ukrainian society itself is concerned, it is, as before, in a state of social apathy. This may be confirmed, for example, by the data of a sociological survey of 1,200 persons from eight eastern and southern oblasts of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. The poll was conducted by the Democratic Initiatives center. Only 41 percent of those polled recalled that on 1 December 1991 they had supported Ukraine's independence. Also of interest are the responses to the direct question: "If you had once again to participate in a referendum on questions of the state independence of Ukraine, what would your choice be now?" Forty-seven percent believe that they would oppose Ukraine's independence, 24 would respond positively, 12 percent would not take part in the referendum at all, and 17 percent did not know. Such lamentable data after two and one-half years of Ukraine's independence are, according to the sociological poll, the result of the ill-conceived policy of the national leadership. Some 37 percent of those polled cited together with other factors as the main cause of the crisis the reluctance or incapacity of the leadership of Ukraine for implementing market economic reforms. Among the other causes, citing three alternative answers, 34 percent of respondents consider the main cause of the crisis the collapse of the Union; 28 percent, the absence in Ukraine of strong and authoritative leaders; 25 percent, the absence of a realistic program of an escape from the crisis; 26 percent, the incompetence and irresponsibility of the government bureaucracy; 28 percent, the activity of the mafia; and 14 percent, the lack of discipline and order in society. Only 23 percent of respondents believe that Ukraine could emerge from the crisis in the coming years; 39 percent are sure that it can overcome the crisis in the coming years, and 21 percent are sure that Ukraine can never emerge from the crisis; a further 15 percent did not know. Those polled were just as pessimistic about the coming presidential elections. Twenty percent declared that they would not be voting at all; 42 percent had not decided for whom they would vote; 21 percent gave as their choice former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma; 7 percent, the present president, Leonid Kravchuk; 4 percent, the socialist Aleksandr Moroz the speaker of parliament; 3 percent, Volodymyr Lanovyy, former deputy prime minister for economic reform; and 2 percent, former speaker Ivan Plyushch. Responding to a question as to what Ukraine needs to do first and foremost, 41 percent of those polled cited the assurance of government social safeguards for the working people; 32 percent, the restoration of the USSR; 26 percent, the imposition of order in society by any methods, power methods included; 22 percent, support for enterprise; 21 percent, a return to the socialist model of development with state regulation of the economy and the system of distribution; 25 percent, the introduction of Russian as a second official language; and only 15 percent, a strengthening of the Ukrainian state. Evaluating the activity of the political parties, 52 percent of respondents declared that the parties are engaged exclusively in a struggle for power; 8 percent, that parties are an essential component of the democratic development of society; 7 percent, that they express the interests of the mafia; and 6 percent each declared that the parties contribute to the emergence of conflicts or that they defend people's interests. The rest of those polled had difficulty answering the question on the role of the party in society. Responding to a question concerning the prospects of Crimea's existence, 48 percent of those polled replied that they would like to see it as an inalienable part of Ukraine; 16 percent, that Crimea should be an independent state and 10 percent, that it should become a part of Russia; 7 percent proposed other options, and 18 percent did not know. According to the data of this survey, the people of Ukraine are, as before, in a state of political apathy. Only 32 percent of those polled are prepared to take part personally in strikes with political or economic demands; 38 percent agree to put up with any material difficulties provided that calm and civil peace be preserved in the country; 14 percent of those polled responded that the political struggle did not concern them; and 16 percent did not know.
