As we write, a right-wing majority is emerging that has immediately shown deep divisions toward forming a prospective government. The transition to the new configuration of the Italian system thus appears incomplete, riddled with difficulties, marked, it is true, by the success scored by the various forces that rallied around Berlusconi, but also by a strong presence of the Left. In addition to electoral consensus, this is the result of a unity that represents an unprecedented and valuable heritage that should be put immediately to the test. The outcome expresses the climate of confused hostility that marked the last stage in particular of the election campaign: the total disregard for the rules, the body blows, the prevarication in the propaganda, the cunning rumors spread to further behind-the-scenes speculations. In the midst of so many difficulties, it is by no means rhetorical to mention the performance by the progressive alliance, which, while failing to attract all the votes that it required, has nevertheless introduced an element of rationality, reason, national responsibility, and good sense. Within this alliance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] emerges once again as the largest and best structured force, capable of mobilizing valuable grass-roots energy that has enabled it to honor its role as the major force uniting, leading, and gallantly supporting its allies. It remains to be seen how all this will translate into seats, but meanwhile, this acquired capital must be preserved and invested in the harsh reality that the poll opens up. The undeniable success of the so-called Freedom Pole is the fruit of a combination of factors that cannot be reduced to sticking together. The single factor that all the components of the cartel clearly had in common was fear of success by the progressive alliance: a negative feeling, a sort of psychosis brought to the point of paroxysm by the unprecedented force of its propaganda, which succeeded, to a certain extent, in resurrecting old fears, ghosts that wormed their way into the psychological and political void left by the old regime. As to the rest, in other words its platform, political consistency, and ideological identity, the right-wing camp presented no credentials as a cohesive, credible governing alliance. The conflict, the reciprocal, irremovable repulsion between the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the League, is the most obvious aspect of this lack of internal cohesion, which seems likely to have enormous political and parliamentary repercussions and to create a situation detrimental to the Right's ambitions. Although the mediating role performed by Berlusconi (who has promised a semi-alliance with the League in the north and a semi-alliance with the MSI in the south) has made it possible to pull in the whole moderate and conservative vote, it has not solved the political issue of the unity of a right-wing government. The statements in which Bossi has ruled out a full governing deal with the "reactionary right" of National Alliance in the name of a democratic undertaking on which the League does not intend to renege, may well mean that the Right's success will by no means translate automatically into the formation of a governing majority. The Berlusconi front's strong point, so to speak, lay in bringing together the votes of the opposing tendencies, the old seeking continuation by other means and the new protest movement that reduces everything to driving out the previous political personnel. The outcome is that this Right emerges as something very similar to what dominated the last decade of the first republic, with the addition of explicit regressive intentions in the social welfare field. All in all, it is a large but divided Right lacking unity in its goals and in its methods for pursuing them. The centrist PPI [Italian People's Party] and Mario Segni-led forces may be assessed as follows: They refused to believe in the logic of bipolar democracy. Indeed they rejected it with incomprehensible determination, and now they have to come to terms with the de facto bipolarism imposed by the electorate, albeit via a messy voting system. They rejected the path of a joint commitment to rebuild and reform Italian democracy, keeping the Right out, and they made the mistake of thinking that the country's vast moderate sector would rally to the forces proclaiming substantial continuity with the party that had dominated the first republic. But the issue that the poll now raises, and in no uncertain terms, is that of the quality of the transition and of the forces that can succeed in coalescing to lead it, including the forces of democratic Catholicism. This election, the most difficult in our history, has buried the old Italy but has not given us a predefined future. This creates enormous problems on the domestic political front and raises major uncertainties for our international partners. Although it will be difficult, reconstruction cannot be avoided. From today onward, we all bear greater responsibility for our destiny.
