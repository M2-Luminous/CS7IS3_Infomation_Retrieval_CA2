You said today that Austria's entry would be a chance for Austria. However, the people in Austria have witnessed for some days now a violent controversy over the blocking minority within the EU. The question is increasingly asked whether this entry date of January 1995 that one is striving for can still be maintained. Is the EU not currently giving a terrible impression to an applicant for membership or a nation that wants to become a member? [Stoiber] I agree with you because domestic policy problems in Great Britain are being shifted to the EU, and the behavior of the Spaniards, which is definitely too demanding, is also in the limelight. I can only say that those who upgrade the question about 23 or 24 votes as the Britons or Spaniards do -- I openly say it here -- wrong the spirit of the EU and the necessary development. We, the EU, have gone through most difficult negotiations with Austria, Finland, and Norway. In this way, Europe will be fantastically rounded off and this Western EU will develop into a pan-European union. Those who question this really have to expect most violent controversies. That is to say, my government, the Free State of Bavaria, but also Germany as whole, will do everything to dissuade the Britons from being stubborn in this respect. Personally, I openly have to tell you that new entries and the enlargement of the EU are so important to me that I would finally swallow the bitter pill and not necessarily insist on the correct solution of 27 votes. That is to say, I give absolute priority to 1 January 1995 and it has to be pushed through. [Oberhauser] Is that realistic? A few days ago, Parliamentary President Klepsch said on this program that the 27 votes cannot be changed. [Stoiber] This is the problem of the European Parliament. Certainly, if the Britons really do not move and continue to be uncooperative, one has to see, of course, the alternative. The alternative is that the four states cannot become members, which may be in the interest of one or another state. It may be the case that the Mediterranean countries say that there is no hurry regarding the entry of these strong countries. However, from the point of view of Germany, Europe, and Bavaria, this would be extremely disastrous because we simply need the Austrians to get the other Central and East European countries closer to the EU. The next would be Hungary, then the Czech Republic or Slovakia would come. Actually, Austria's function is to break things open. [Oberhauser] Let us come back again to Germany, where one is talking of the superelection year of 1994. The Bundestag election is the focus of interest, also for politically interested Austrians. If one can believe the opinion researchers, although they have repeatedly been wrong lately, there are many indications that Kohl's era is coming to an end. Do you see it differently? [Stoiber] This has often been the case, that is to say, it often looked like it. The reality was different. I am firmly convinced that Helmut Kohl will continue to be the chancellor, although I have certainly had many controversies with him, but I must openly say that one can see now the difficulties that Scharping has when something specific is at issue. That is to say, if he classifies those who earn 50,000 German marks per year in Germany as people with a better income and demands an additional tax of 10 percent from them, he deeply breaks into the group of skilled workers. This is also shown by the present controversies. I also think that now that we have a chancellor who is absolutely recognized in Europe and the world in these difficult times, it would be disastrous in the field of foreign politics. One cannot call someone to this office who is really an apprentice in this question, as compared to the chancellor. [Oberhauser] Putting it very cautiously, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] seems to have difficulties. Is a grand coalition between the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] conceivable for you? [Stoiber] No. The CSU stated several times that there will be no grand coalition with it in Bonn. Since the CDU/CSU can only make a uniform decision in this respect and the CDU, even if it wished this, had to show consideration for the CSU, there will be no grand coalition with the CSU and thus with the CDU/CSU in Bonn, unless there is a disastrous situation, which, however, is certainly not perceptible. [Oberhauser] Mr. Minister-President, thank you for having been our guest. [Stoiber] You are welcome. [Oberhauser] Have a nice evening in Vienna. [Stoiber] Thank you.
