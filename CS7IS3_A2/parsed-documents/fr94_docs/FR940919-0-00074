FR940919-0-00074 FR940919-0-00016 Universal Treatment Standard for Cyanide [Wastewaters] 1Regulated constituent 1Maximum for any single composite sample (mg/l) Cyanide (Total) 1.2 Cyanide (Amenable) 0.86 C. Consolidation of Equivalent Technology-Specific Combustion Standards Another improvement to the existing Land Disposal Restrictions program that is being made in today's rule is the simplification of two equivalent technology-specific combustion standards in: Table 1_Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based Standards in 40 CFR 268.42. The Agency is consolidating the descriptions of INCIN (incineration) and FSUBS (fuel substitution), by combining them into one term, CMBST (combustion). The definition of CMBST, as stated in ยง268.42 Table 1, is: ``combustion in incinerators, boilers, or industrial furnaces operated in accordance with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 264 subpart O, and part 266, subpart H.'' (Because the Part 265 interim status standards for incinerators are largely nonsubstantive, EPA does not view facilities operating pursuant to these standards to be performing BDAT treatment. This is not true of boilers and industrial furnaces, where the interim status standards are nearly as stringent as those for permitted units.) This definition includes a specific reference to boilers and industrial furnaces in order to clarify that combustion in these units is (and always has been) allowed as a means of complying with FSUBS. The Agency is also clarifying that any future regulations, such as potential emission limits on metals or halogenated organic content, established in part 264 subpart O, and part 266 subpart H, shall also apply automatically to the standard of CMBST (or INCIN) in part 268. The consolidation of INCIN with FSUBS to read CMBST does not represent any change to the promulgated standards and additional notice and comment was, therefore, not required. All of the K-, U-, and P-listed wastes that have technology-specific standards contain chemicals that are very difficult to quantify in treatment residues. The chemicals representing the waste codes for which the Agency has promulgated CMBST as a standard are, for the most part, thermally labile and are expected to be destroyed relatively easily in any type of combustion unit. EPA originally set up the two separate standards of INCIN and FSUBS (Final Rule for Third Third Wastes, June 1, 1990), because the Agency did not have in place the operating requirements for boilers and industrial furnaces (i.e., the requirements for FSUBS). See 52 FR at 17021 (May 6, 1987). Because these requirements have been promulgated (56 FR 7134 (February 21, 1991), both sets of standards should assure equally efficient combustion of hazardous waste. For the same reason, there is no need to distinguish between the types of units that are allowed to handle each specific waste code. (EPA is, however, actively reviewing current regulations for combustion units to assure the rules' protectiveness, and may propose more stringent standards for such units. See EPA's Draft Combustion Strategy of May 18, 1993). As a result of today's action the standards for the following waste codes are modified to read ``CMBST'': (1) Two treatment subcategories of D001 wastes (2) Six source-specific wastes listed in ยง261.32: K027, K039, K113, K114, K115, K116 (3) Seventeen wastes listed in ยง261.33(e): P001, P003, P005, P009, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P068, P081, P085, P088, P102, P105, P109, P112 (4) Forty-one wastes listed in ยง261.33(f): U008, U016, U023, U053, U055, U056, U057, U058, U064, U085, U086, U087, U089, U090, U094, U096, U098, U099, U103, U109, U113, U122, U123, U124, U125, U126, U133, U147, U154, U160, U166, U182, U186, U197, U201, U213, U221, U248, U328, U353, U359 Other technology-specific standards and/or numerical standards that have been promulgated for the above listed codes remain unchanged. In particular, the promulgated standards of CHRED and CHOXD (i.e., chemical reduction and chemical oxidation) remain unchanged as alternatives to CMBST for fourteen of the above U and P waste codes. These standards were established because the chemicals represented by these wastes hydrolyze relatively rapidly (i.e., react with water) and both of the technologies represented by these standards are typically performed under aqueous conditions. These waste codes include: P009, P068, P081, P105, P112, U023, U086, U096, U098, U099, U103, U109, U133, U160. Today's rule does not affect the existing standards for waste codes where INCIN was specified, but FSUBS was not. For those waste codes, the standard remains identified as INCIN, rather than CMBST. The Agency is further investigating potential modifications to the presentation in 40 CFR 268.40 of all of the technology-specific standards in order to simplify and clarify the promulgated treatment standards, and may propose additional changes in the future.
