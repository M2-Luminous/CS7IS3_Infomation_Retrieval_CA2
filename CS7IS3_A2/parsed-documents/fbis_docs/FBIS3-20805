Waters contaminated with black carbon, which were a threat to the environment, are now being processed into superconductive channel black. This is a product with outstanding absorption characteristics, which has become an export item. Among other uses, the material can be used in the elimination of oil disasters and in the purification of wastewaters. Its advantage is that it is more effective than other sorbents and costs less. It has a smaller mass, which reduces the cost of transportation. Currently, it is being tested in the United States, South America, Norway, France, and other countries. Maritime interests in the United States have used it to wash out the holds of tankers. The Chemopetrol Enterprise has shown flexibility in developing new sorbents. In one month, it changed the consistency of the material from a powder to granules. It thus eliminated dustiness, which was bothering potential users. Furthermore, the enterprise introduced packaging in smaller quantities, which facilitates manipulation and use. Work on the project was participated in by a Swiss commercial firm that was instrumental in expanding the circle of customers. In Argentina, sorbents are being readied to eliminate the lagoons that accompany petroleum drilling. Ivory Coast has also indicated an interest in the product. The cost of using the material in individual countries is being defrayed by the Swiss firm, without requiring financial participation on the part of Chemopetrol. Along with superconductive channel black, Chemopetrol introduced a new wastewater purification plant onto the market. Thanks to the new sorbents, the efficiency of this plant is exceedingly high. The first customer for this plant was the largest Swiss liquid waste incinerator near Geneva. With the aid of the technology from Litvinov, this facility will be able to do away with two-phase cleaning and will be able to release wastewater into the river following the first passage through the purification facility. After introduction into series production, the purification facility will cost 400,000 korunas, which is approximately one-third of the cost of existing devices with a similar capacity.
