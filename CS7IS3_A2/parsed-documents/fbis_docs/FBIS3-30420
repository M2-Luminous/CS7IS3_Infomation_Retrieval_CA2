Around 20 deputies as well as Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, took part. After a recess until 1600, the chamber is to vote on resolutions that a multiparty commission has proposed to the chamber. Kreso Zadravec and Jasenka Dudic have a report on the assembly's work so far: [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Addressing the deputies, Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke about the strategic goals of Croatian foreign policy. Explaining the goals of the joint Yugoslav-Croatian declaration, he said that the present situation is untenable and a military option would cause casualties and the complete isolation of Croatia, which, as he said, we were clearly told. There is no compromising over our fundamental goals -- reintegration and the return of refugees -- which will be our guiding idea in the normalization of relations. Asked why Croatia was not recognized by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the signing of the declaration, Granic replied: [Begin Granic recording] Of course, we demanded that in precise terms. However, as Milosevic was not ready for it at that time, we did not establish relations at the level of ambassadors, but at the level of offices, bureaus, refraining from forming judgements in advance. [end recording] [Correspondent] He also dwelled on the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina where, as he said, Croat-Muslim relations ought to be permanently regulated for political, economic, and strategic reasons with the cessation of hostilities as a priority task. He again denied allegations about the presence of Croatian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that he had informed the Security Council about the fact that between 1,500 and 2,000 Croat volunteers of Bosnian origin are in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while at least 3,000 to 8,000 Muslim volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina come from Islamic countries. Among other things, Minister Granic spoke about Croatia's admission to the Council of Europe and said that the admission was primarily blocked because of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He supported [Serbian National Party Vice Chairman] Pejnovic's proposal that legitimate [as heard] Serbs from the assembly be included in the talks with international factors.
