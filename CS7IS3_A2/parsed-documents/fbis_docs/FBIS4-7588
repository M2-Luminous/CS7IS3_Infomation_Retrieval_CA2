What are the political implications of the appointment of a career diplomat to the position of defense minister? [Tinca] It is obvious that the Army cannot be torn away from the Romanian social context. Its integration in the institutional system is totally different from what we understood as the relations between the Army and the political body in the past, when the Army was under the control of a totalitarian party. The Army institution will undoubtedly have links with the political structures, but they will be adjusted to the current pluralistic and democratic political system. The main issue is to protect the Army against partisan political influences. It cannot afford to tailor itself to the political interests of any given party, thus deflecting its attention from the main mission, which is the defense of the country. The civilian minister must ensure interaction between the Ministry of National Defense and the other state institutions or political forces in society. I was well received at the Ministry of National Defense and I feel encouraged by the people surrounding me. Their kindness and hope obliges me to do my best. The Ministry of National Defense is engaged in many contacts with the ministries of other countries. I could say that we are conducting a very intensive military diplomacy at this time. Therefore, the presence of a diplomat at the Ministry of National Defense has been considered as opportune. [Ivancu] What direction is the Romanian Army taking? [Tinca] A new geostrategic context has emerged, which requires a restructuring of the Army's missions, a readjustment of its equipment and training, and a process of reevaluation on the organizational plane. The Army must be the supreme defense instrument of our authentic national values, as stipulated by the Constitution. [Ivancu] How do you estimate the defense budget? Are there ways and means for self-financing? [Tinca] The Army's budget is relatively small. It is in accordance with the possibilities of our economy. I believe that the Army could find self-financing solutions in certain spheres. However, we must be careful that these measures do not impinge on the Army's training and equipment. [Ivancu] What significance do you attach to the national armaments industry? [Tinca] I appreciate the fact that the mass media has played a positive role in sensitizing public opinion on the difficulties faced by the national arms industry. One should realize that part of the budget money must go to this industry. One cannot have a modern army without making some effort and without ensuring its modernization in the technical, productive, and creative spheres. By proceeding cleverly and courageously, it is possible to ensure that production in the military sphere also have a positive impact on other spheres of our national industry. [Ivancu] In what stage is the process of working out Romania's military doctrine? [Tinca] Romania's military doctrine is being elaborated through the conjunction of the country's institutional and political factors. This document, which is being consolidated now, will be shortly submitted to the approval of the Country's Supreme Defense Council (CSAT). On the other hand, there is also the Integrated Concept on Romania's National Security (CISNR), a broader program that also includes the military aspect. This document is also being processed now, with a view to its adoption by the CSAT. The two documents will be endorsed by the CSAT and then submitted to parliament. [Ivancu] What is the situation of Romania's military alliances? [Tinca] Regarding the system of alliances, the situation is tougher here, since we do not have military alliances and no security guarantees either, in a military sense. However, we rely on the essence of our military doctrine and the essence of our defense policy. They are in accordance with the interest of many countries to have stability in our region and to be able to count on us in this respect. It is up to us to consolidate these interests and draw further sympathy and support. All our history proves that the essence of Romanian military policy has been defensive. We did not attack anyone. We only entered World War II because the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact obliged us to do so, including from the viewpoint of military honor. [Ivancu] What role is played by the "Partnership for Peace" agreement? What is Romania's political-military orientation? [Tinca] "Partnership for Peace" is no political-military alliance and offers no guarantees in a military sense. Nevertheless, it contributes to achieving stability, by granting equal treatment to all participants and by its convergence with our purely defensive military interests. It is a long process, which presupposes compatibility and gradual integration. We hope that we will also stand to benefit a bit from it, in the military technology and research spheres. We are interested in having peace around our country and in Europe and we want to develop relations with our neighbors, based on respect for international norms. Tensions and particularly conflicts are not good for us. Our long-term political-military and economic orientation is in accordance with our national interests and not with set patterns or passing fads. The overall modernization of the country does not mean losing one's identity in action, but necessarily requires various forms of integration. [Ivancu] How does the Ministry of National Defense view international military cooperation? [Tinca] The Romanian Army is interested in modernizing its technology in a price-efficiency ratio as favorable as possible to the targets of our national defense. We very much want to develop cooperation with the United States and other developed countries. In this respect, I would like to remind you that we cooperated with the developed countries in the sphere of defense industry before 1989, too. The elimination of obstacles raised by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) creates better prospects for cooperation in combat technology. We also hope that the "Partnership for Peace" agreement will entail positive developments in this respect, too. [Ivancu] What is Romania's riposte efficacy and capability? [Tinca] There is no reason to fear that the Army is not prepared, that it is hesitating or overwhelmed by difficulties, or that it cannot fulfill its basic duty of defending Romania's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We, like others, have problems and, unfortunately, have also had some accidents. But it would be wrong to draw hasty conclusions about the combat capacity and determination of the Romanian Army. It is not bad that these problems are brought to the fore in the media. The public becomes acquainted with our problems and thus more aware of the Army's needs. [Ivancu] What, in your opinion, are the prospects of the Romanian Army? [Tinca] I hope that the Army will make substantial progress in its modernization. For this year, I would like the Army's operative capability to be maintained and improved within the limits of the funds allocated to us from the budget. I -- and not just me -- am convinced that greater emphasis should be placed on the social protection of military personnel. It would be unjust to leave the soldiers -- who love their country both in good and hard times -- outside the current concerns with easing up the difficulties of the transition. However, I believe that now, when the Army is in full swing of the reform process, the civilian society should clearly indicate that it understands the Army's difficulties, including the social problems of the Army's military or civilian personnel.
