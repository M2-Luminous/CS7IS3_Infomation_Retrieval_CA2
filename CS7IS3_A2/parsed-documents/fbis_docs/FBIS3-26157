In order to strengthen the work of checking the weight of import and export commodities and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of parties concerned in foreign trade, these Measures are drawn up according to the stipulations of the "PRC Law on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter referred to as the "Commodity Inspection Law") and the "Regulations on Implementing the PRC Law on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations"). Article 2. Parties in foreign trade must submit to commodity inspection organs their applications for handling the work of checking the weight of import and export commodities, which refers to import and export commodities quoted and packed according to weight requirements listed in the "List of Import and Export Commodity Categories Examined by Commodity Inspection Organs" (hereinafter referred to as the "Category List") or refers to import and export commodities to be issued with weight certificates by commodity inspection organs in line with the requirements of foreign trade contracts. Article 3. For import and export commodities not in the "Category List" or those not issued with weight certificates by commodity inspection organs because they were not prescribed by foreign trade contracts, commodity inspection organs and the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, inspection organs appointed by commodity inspection organs, and other inspection organs authorized by the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities to handle the work of weight checking can accept applications submitted by parties in foreign trade or can be entrusted by organs concerned to handle the business of checking the weight of import and export commodities and to issue weight certificates in line with the provisions of these measures. Article 4. The State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities and commodity inspection organs supervise the work of weight checking carried out by inspection organs which are authorized or appointed by them. Article 5. Commodity inspection organs handle the work of checking the weight of import and export commodities according to the means of measurement prescribed by foreign trade contracts. If no means of measurement are prescribed by foreign trade contracts, commodity inspection organs can adopt various means of weight measurement such as weighing apparatus, water gauges, vessels, and flow meters according to applicants' applications and specific conditions of commodities, including their characteristics, package categories, transportation conditions, and means of delivery. Article 6. Personnel of commodity inspection organs who are responsible for weight checking must receive specialized training and pass examinations before they are qualified to take up their posts and check the weight of import and export commodities according to the provisions of the "Regulations for Checking the Weight of Import and Export Commodities." Article 7. All sorts of weighing apparatus, vessels, flow meters and complete sets of weight-measuring implements as well as inspection installations can only be used after state departments responsible for measurement have issued certificates of qualified checking marked with validity dates and confirmed by commodity inspection organs. Units using weighing apparatus, vessels, and flow meters should have a concrete inspection system and be equipped with corresponding means of inspection for regular maintenance and inspection. As far as large specialized weighing apparatus, vessels, and flow meters are concerned, commodity inspection organs must set up technology files for stronger supervision. Article 8. Personnel responsible for measuring weight by weighing apparatus, vessels, and flow meters must receive specialized technological training and pass examinations and their qualifications must be confirmed by commodity inspection organs, while personnel of commodity inspection organs supervise the operation of weight measurement conducted by qualified personnel. Article 9. Certificates of water gauge measurement can be treated as the basis for transactions and settlement between parties in foreign trade. If this is stated in weight provisions in foreign trade contracts, transporting ships should have the conditions for water gauging. If commodity inspection personnel examine and verify that particular transporting ships do not have the conditions, they will not handle the work of water gauging. Article 10. When parties in foreign trade apply for weight checking, they must go through the procedure of reporting import and export commodities for checking according to the "Regulations on Reporting and Checking Import and Export Commodities." Moreover, they must make arrangements for checking the weight and provide essential working conditions according to dates of loading and transport, dates of consignment and settlement, or validity dates for claiming damages. Article 11. For import and export commodities transported in bulk which have to be measured by weighing apparatus, commodity inspection organs should check the weight of all commodities at ports of loading and unloading as stated in foreign trade contracts or contracts of transportation. Meanwhile, consignees (consigners) must apply for supervision of the loading and unloading work. Packaged or unpackaged commodities which are transported in clear batches without changes in weight can be checked by commodity inspection organs at consigners' (consignees') premises, by commodity inspection organs at ports, or by commodity inspection organs in other places. Regarding import and export commodities which must be checked at ports, parties in foreign trade should guarantee that commodities are transported in clear batches and that goods match what is described in certificates. Article 12. Regarding commodities marked with their weight, including net weight and package weight, commodity inspection organs will implement spot checks on their weight according to the "Regulations for Checking the Weight of Import and Export Commodities--Checking Weight by Weighing Apparatus." Article 13. Regarding commodities priced according to their conditioned weight or dry weight, persons who apply for weight checks by weighing apparatus and water gauges should ask commodity inspection organs to select representative samples for moisture content tests. Article 14. Apart from applying for measurement of the capacity of holds carrying imported liquid commodities, applicants must also apply for checking of empty holds and holds for unloading. Dry hold certificates will be issued after commodity inspection organs have finished all these checks. Article 15. Units involved in the work of checking the weight of import and export commodities must use our country's official units of measurement. In case of special requirements, measurements are still converted on the basis of our country's official units of measurement. Article 16. Commodity inspection organs which handle the work of weight checking will collect fees according to relevant state regulations. Article 17. Anyone violating the provisions of these Measures will be punished according to the relevant provisions of the "Commodity Inspection Law" and the "Regulations." Article 18. These Measures are effective 1 March 1994, and the "Interim Measures for Checking the Weight of Import and Export Commodities by Weighing Apparatus" will be simultaneously abolished. Article 19. The State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities is responsible for the interpretation of these Measures.
