German security authorities have been informed of Palestinian groups planning terror attacks on the embassy. There is ``very serious evidence'' of possible bomb attacks ``by Hizballah'' on Israeli targets in Germany, a police spokesman said in Bonn yesterday. He did, however, not indicate whether the threats came from the pro-Iranian Hizballah operating from South Lebanon or from another group. A terror commando is said to have already entered Germany. The Israeli Embassy itself has not received any threats. [passage omitted]
