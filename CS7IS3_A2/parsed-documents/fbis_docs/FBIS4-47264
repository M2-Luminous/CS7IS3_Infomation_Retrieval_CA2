These and other properties drew attention to these compounds for possible use to prevent corrosion in pipelines. This requires a more detailed study of these compounds on steel in the cathodic region of potentials. In the present work impedenceometry was used to demonstrate that N-alkyl-N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine iodides are adsorbed onto the surface of steel in the cathodic region of potentials, thereby lowering the volume of electric double layer at the metal-coating-electrolyte interfaces. This in turn has a significant effect on the rate of cathodic sloughing off of the protective polymeric coating and the rate of corrosion of the metal being protected.
