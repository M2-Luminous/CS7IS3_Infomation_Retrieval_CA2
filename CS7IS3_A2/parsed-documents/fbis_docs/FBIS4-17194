Speaking to journalists after the talks in Moscow with his Danish counterpart, Niels Helveg Petersen, he called for support for the "Party of Reason" in Serbia and for Russia, the United States, the United Nations, and the EC to draw up a peace plan. "We cannot condone the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who carry out artillery bombardments of civilian installations," said the head of Russian diplomacy. "It is perfectly clear that these people have embarked on a road that runs counter to Serbian interests -- those of Serbia as a whole and of the Bosnian Serbs -- in the most blatant manner. Russia cannot see that road as being anything other than barbarism and a crime. So what trust can there be with these people?" "At the same time," the minister continued, "we think that there is the possibility of a political settlement. There are other Serbs, in Bosnia too, those whom I call `the Party of Reason'. There is President Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I spoke for several hours on the night of 16-17 April. He has a very rational approach, about which he and I talked when meeting journalists after the conversation. "The international community must now help those Serbs who are really concerned for the interests of Serbia and for the interests of the Bosnian Serbs, and put forward a peace plan. That, unfortunately, has not yet been done," Kozyrev emphasized. He spoke in favor of a joint plan drawn up by Russia, the United States, the EC, and the United Nations aimed at resolving the Bosnian problem. That is precisely what we are seeking from our partners, the Russian foreign minister indicated. "While they are working on a war plan in NATO, we want to work on a peace plan with them," A.Kozyrev said. "Otherwise it may happen that, in a day or two's time, there will be a war plan, worked out in detail inside NATO, but there won't be a detailed joint peace plan. It seems to me that that would be a defeat for the international community."
