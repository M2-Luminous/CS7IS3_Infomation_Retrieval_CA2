Their imminent release was announced by the Serbs this morning and confirmed later by the European negotiator, Lord Owen. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is in Washington, has confirmed this information to Philippe Reltien: [Begin Juppe recording] I would like to take this opportunity to say a word about the 11 hostages. According to news that has reached me from Paris, and also from Belgrade or Sarajevo, a possible release of the hostages could take place within the next few hours. I am still very cautious on this matter because I have no confirmation. I would like to recall -- to deny certain reports circulated in France -- that since the hostage-taking in early April, not a single day has passed without our diplomats deploying their efforts in Belgrade, Pale, Sarajevo, at the United Nations, the Greek presidency, and our allies. We have ceaselessly applied pressure, explaining clearly to the Serbs that we will not accept a mockery of justice, that this was a hostage-taking, that there was manipulation, that we will not bargain, and that we want the release of all the hostages. If the news were to be confirmed--I repeat that I am cautious--this will be the result of this continuous and efficient diplomatic effort. [end recording]
