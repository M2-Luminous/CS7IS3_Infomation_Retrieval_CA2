It is expected that the deputy foreign minister, who is now visiting a number of Latin American countries, will arrive in Washington on 26 February. According to a high-level Russian official, it would be possible, if we wanted to, to expose U.S. diplomats and some Russians collaborating with these special services working in Moscow, but we are not doing this. Just as the Americans were not doing this until now. It is not clear why they have to cast a shadow on their relations with Russia, which earns the highest number of points for Bill Clinton's administration, the high-level Russian official stated.
