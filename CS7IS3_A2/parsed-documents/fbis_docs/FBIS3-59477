Pohara points out that one can increasingly find local Muslims who dress and behave like mojahedin and find "their image in religious fanaticism" and who, in waging war, invoke the name of Allah. Pohara warns Europe to concern itself seriously with Muslim fundamentalism and the creation of the first Islamic state in the heart of Europe. Viewing the repercussions that the creation of a Muslim state would have on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, POLITIKA cites Predrag Simic, director of the International Institute for Policy and Trade in Belgrade. Simic judges that the existence of such a state would result in permanent military tension in the region and that the borders of the newly founded states would not be peaceful but increasingly resemble those between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Simic believes that the Republic of Srpska would suffer most in this situation through retaliatory attacks by the Muslim state. He warns that the corridor between the Serbian states would become a battleground because the Muslims would attempt to break it to gain access to the Sava River. It should be expected that an Islamic state, strengthened by the support of the Islamic world, would establish links to Sandzak, Kosovo, and Macedonia, Simic states, pointing out that statistics show that Albanians will become the majority population in Macedonia by 2005.
