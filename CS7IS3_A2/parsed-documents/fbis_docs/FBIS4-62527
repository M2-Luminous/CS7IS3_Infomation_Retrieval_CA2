FBIS4-62527 "drsov095_s_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Georgia Shevardnadze Answers Criticism of Abkhaz Agreement Shevardnadze Answers Criticism of Abkhaz Agreement LD1605225994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1406 GMT 16 May 94 LD1605225994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 92 (582): Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] The head of state Eduard Shevardnadze has turned down the accusations of the opposition which saw encroachments on the territorial integrity of Georgia in the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement signed last Saturday [14 May] in Moscow. He said there is not a word about the sovereignty or state system of Abkhazia in the document. He said the problem would be resolved later and Abkhazia would get a new political status, but within integral Georgia. Shevardnadze also denied the speculations of his opponents in parliaments claiming that Russia wants to send its troops to the conflict zone to secure the independence of Abkhazia and its separation from Georgia. He declared that divided Georgia is not in the interests of Russia and expressed confidence that in the near future Abkhazia would be returned. IF [INTERFAX] Note: At the talks that ended in Moscow on 14 May the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations agreed on the separation of troops and deployment of a CIS peace-keeping force on the confrontation line. Under the agreement, the formations of the two sides should withdraw 12 km from the Inguri river thus forming a 24 km buffer zone that will be occupied by the peace-keepers. According to a member of the Abkhazian delegation, a special envoy of the chairman of the Abkhaz parliament Andrey Jergenia, Russia troops are most likely to become the separating force. He said that the deployment of the peace-keeping force should be completed by the end of May. There will be a total of 2500 to 3000 peace-keepers. Russian units stationed in Abkhazia will be used among others. Jergenia said the Georgian side insisted on including in the agreement a provision on the patrolling of Kodor canyon in Abkhazia by peace-keepers. In an interview with local television Shevardnadze also said that if the Georgian delegation had refused to sign the cease-fire agreement in Moscow on which Georgian MP's insisted, it would mean that Georgia was giving up a peaceful settlement and opting for a military solution. Shevardnadze is convinced that Georgia could not afford that either morally or from the viewpoint of its possibilities. IF Note: The decision of parliament prohibiting the Georgian delegation to sign any documents in Moscow had no legal force because in making it the parliament exceeded its powers. Under acting legislation, the head of state has the right to hold talks and sign any documents on behalf of the country. The powers were given to Shevardnadze by the parliament. In an interview with INTERFAX the opposition leader Boris Kakubava said that the disregard for the decision of parliament means complete arbitrariness of the authorities. He believes it is impossible to speak of any democracy in Georgia after the binding agreement was signed in Moscow. Speaking of the essence of the agreement Kakubava declared that it allowed the Abkhazian side to legalize the genocide of Georgians and wrote off thousands of lost lives. He said:"Our organization, the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia that represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of refugees from Abkhazia cannot agree to that. We have our own road back to Abkhazia." At the press center of the Georgian Defence Ministry INTERFAX was told that the armed forces will carry out any orders from the head of state and Supreme Commander Eduard Shevardnadze. Troops and military hardware will be withdrawn from the Inguri river and a buffer zone will be formed that will be occupied by a peace-making force, a press center official said. In a traditional Monday radio interview Shevardnadze called the Moscow agreement a practical foundation for the return of refugees to Abkhazia. He said the process would not be long. Shevardnadze said a plan of sending a peace-keeping force to the conflict zone is being made which gives an especially active role to Russia. In the nearest future the plan is going to be discussed by the UN Security Council and the CIS Collective Security Council. The Georgian leader hoped for support from both organizations. Shevardnadze described the activities of parliament as confrontational and said that different political groups are demanding early parliamentary elections. He said the question is raised by the opposition as well as the Union of Georgian Citizens he heads. "The question is open so far. My stand is going to largely depend on the degree of constructiveness of the parliament," Shevardnadze said. According to the Georgian leader, certain social groups, intellectuals in particular, demand stronger executive power with the purpose of restoring order in the country. Shevardnadze said that today he favors greater toughness and responsibility. On the coming visit to Tbilisi by the president of Azerbaijan Shevardnadze said that the talks will center mainly around the situation in the Caucasus and ways of resolving local problems as well as bilateral relations which he said are developing perfectly. "I think that a dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus should become regular between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia," Shevardnadze said.
