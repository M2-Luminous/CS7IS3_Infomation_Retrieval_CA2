Although growth seems to have revived, unemployment is not yet a thing of the past. Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister for industry, trade, and tourism, was recently in Brussels to meet with Leon Brittan [European commissioner for external and economic affairs] and Henning Christophersen [European commissioner for economic and financial affairs]. On this occasion, we questioned him on the progress of the reforms in his country. Indeed, the Czech Republic is among the countries most convinced that it is necessary to carry out the changes rapidly, and it can probably afford to do so in view of the healthy state of its major macroeconomic parameters. The state budget is showing a surplus, and the foreign debt is low, and it seems possible to keep inflation between 6 and 7 percent this year. And yet, despite the neoliberal convictions of Vaclav Klaus, its prime minister, the Czech Republic sometimes proceeds with greater caution than you might think. [Delstanche] The Czech Republic is the one that first launched a mass privatization program, especially with a view to speeding up the process. Are you satisfied with how it is running? And what is the present position? [Dlouhy] Technically speaking, privatization is going well. The second phase of the privatization program by coupons should be completed by the end of the year. At that time, the public sector should no longer own more than 15-18 percent of the companies. And we include in this figure the health sector and the strategic holdings sector. We will probably therefore reach a paradoxical situation because state participation will probably be much less important than in many European Union countries. [Delstanche] Are there not some problems with investment funds, which are being gradually taken over by the banks? [Dlouhy] That is not exactly the case. It is true that the banks have created a number of investment funds and that these represent approximately 20 percent of the total. But this is not the result of the redemption of funds by the banks. Having said that, it is true that these funds created by the banks are among the strongest and biggest and that they have played a major part in the privatization process. They have sometimes also carried out debt equity swaps and other operations that reflect the financial problems of companies that are part of the mass sales program. But why should we consider that the participation of banks in the ownership of these funds is a problem? I do not think this reflects a problem in the privatization process. Obviously, it would be different if the banks held 80 or 90 percent of the funds. [Delstanche] Is there not a risk of witnessing too strong a concentration of these funds, when they are required to deal with financial problems? [Dlouhy] That is true up to a point. But it is clear that some funds will fail. That is logical because we have inherited a very inefficient economic system, and this is the law of the market. It is therefore possible to expect a great concentration of property, especially among these funds linked to the banks. But I have no fears that this concentration will become excessive. And we are also trying to develop, at the same time, a strong policy of competition, which should ensure the maintenance of a competitive environment, even with a greater concentration. Moreover, this is a question that should be linked to commercial policy and the opening of the internal market to foreign competition and so forth. [Delstanche] In this connection, the OECD detected your country's violations of the rules of competition by granting favorable treatment in the case of Volkswagen's takeover of Skoda. [Dlouhy] It is true that Volkswagen received special conditions but not very much if they are compared with the treatment offered by Spain and Portugal to foreign investors. That is also an exception to the rule. We are well known and sometimes even criticized by the international investment institutions or the internal opposition because we do not offer special treatment to foreign investors. We prefer to offer everybody the same conditions. We went against our principles in the case of Volkswagen because the automobile industry is very important for the Czech Republic. Not only per se, but also because it is the driving force for many other companies like textiles, the chemical industry, machine manufacturers. [Delstanche] You have a law on bankruptcy, but it has clearly not been forcefully implemented so far. Is this not a contradiction, when your country has chosen to carry out rapid reforms? [Dlouhy] It is not a contradiction. Our law is good. So far, it is true, there have not been many bankruptcies, but this is not because of the legislation. It is the result of the fact that the privatization process has not yet been completed and that the new owners are not making the restructuring very rapidly. This is also the result of internal insolvency, which creates a kind of vicious circle in which everybody is indebted toward somebody else, which prevents any flow of payment. Moreover, we cannot deny that it is also the result of the fact that you mentioned--namely, that some investment funds are partly owned by the banks. These institutions that hold shares in companies in difficulty do not want to push them into bankruptcy but are trying to carry out their financial restructuring. [Delstanche] But does this not also correspond to a desire by the government to delay the explosion of unemployment? [Dlouhy] I can assure you that it is not a problem resulting from a deliberate policy. We have always been cautious with bankruptcies, but we have never stated that we were going to tackle this problem in a gradual way. This is the result of the privatization strategy. Obviously, for the time being, we are gaining major political advantages from it because the unemployment rate is very low. It is now 3.14 percent, whereas the economic growth rate has reached 3.5 percent in the first five months of the year. However, it is true that we are going to face this unemployment problem in the future, but it will essentially be a problem at the level of certain regions.
