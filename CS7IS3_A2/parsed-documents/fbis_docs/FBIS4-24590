Kim was addressing a security-related cabinet meeting at which various means of coping with the DPRK's nuclear issue were discussed. The DPRK and the IAEA reached no agreement during their talks in Pyongyang last week over refueling at the DPRK's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. The IAEA claimed in a statement that the DPRK had rejected the IAEA's proposal for inspection to ensure that no fuel was being diverted to make nuclear weapons. Monday's meeting was attended by South Korean Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the National Unification Board Yi Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and other senior government officials. The meeting decided that South Korea would strengthen cooperation with the countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible action in case the nuclear issue is referred to the United Nations Security Council. "The efforts of the government and the international community to peacefully solve the North Korean nuclear problem are facing a grave challenge as Pyongyang has ignored the international community's demands and pushed for replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon," President Kim told the meeting. Kim urged the DPRK to immediately stop discharging the fuel rods, saying that "the selection, storage and measurement of fuel rods are indispensable to securing the transparency of past nuclear activities as well as ascertaining the non-diversion of nuclear material." The meeting also decided that South Korea will continue to try to solve the nuclear issue through dialogue ahead of the regular meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors scheduled for June 6. The South Korean Government plans to hold a unification and security policy coordination meeting this week to draw up detailed measures following Monday's meeting, official sources said.
