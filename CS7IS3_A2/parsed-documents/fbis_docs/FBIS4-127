The poll shows that 60 percent of whites are opposed to the idea of a volkstaat, and that 68 percent of right-wing supporters are opposed to withdrawing from the election. The poll shows that the Freedom Front leader, General Constand Viljoen, is far more popular among right-wingers than the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche. However, State President F.W. de Klerk, remains the most popular leader among whites with 72 percent support.
