The war started while the slum's samba group was beginning to parade along Marques de Sapucai Avenue. So far, seven people have been killed--three of them belonged to Manino's gang and four to his rival Polegar's gang. The atmosphere of fear kept the Manguera Hill slum residents off their own samba rehearsal ground. Very few of them accompanied the vote counting on 16 February to choose the winner of the special samba group parade. Some armed men freely circulated around the rehearsal ground and the neighboring alleys because there was no police patrolling of the slum. An eyewitness, whose identity is being kept secret, testified at the 17th Police Precinct (Sao Cristovao District) on the war's details. According to the witness, Polegar--who controls the part of the slum known as Chale--planned to increase his territory as soon as the Mangueira Samba Group began parading. He planned to invade Manino's area--the one known as Buraco Quente--while everyone was attentively watching the samba group's performance during the parade. Early on 16 February, 20 Polegar men wearing Civil Police jackets invaded the Buraco Quente area and killed three members of the rival drug trafficking gang. Manino answered the attack early the following morning, when four of Polegar's men were found dead.
