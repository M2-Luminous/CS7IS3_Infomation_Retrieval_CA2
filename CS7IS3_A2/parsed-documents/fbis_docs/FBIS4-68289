Yu. Kirsanov, "New Routes, Old Problems," that touched on the problem of the combining of defense and transport strategies. It evoked a vigorous response from specialists. Today we continue the conversation. Now that our economy is being reformed and the armed forces are being structurally reorganized and cut back, it is very important not to permit a lowering of the country's defensive potential. How can this be accomplished? Back in the middle of the last century, military minister I. Mordvinov expressed the idea that if necessary the army can be reduced without harm if in so doing transport is used for the rapid movement of troops to the "threatened borders" of the Russian state. In our time as well, transport communications fulfill not only economic functions but also military-strategic functions. It is for this reason, in my view, that the program "Transport Russia" now being developed is so important. The developers performed an in-depth analysis of the actual state of the country's transportation network. Here, for example, is what railroad transportation looks like, which accounts for 52 percent of conveyances. The overall length of our railroads is less than one-fourth that of those in the United States and the density of the network is one-seventh of what they have. But the freight traffic is almost 10 times that of the United States. The traffic on the West Siberian, South Urals, East Siberian, and Transbaikal railroads is especially intense. In the European part, major changes in the directions of freight flows may arise in the direction center-south. Of the four main lines that serve it, three cross the territory of Ukraine in their southern part. For this reason, the concentration of freight flows may shift in the direction of Moscow-Michurinsk-Liski-Rostov. This will require much work to increase the throughput and carrying capacity of this line or to establish a new main line with a terminal in Mineralnyye Vody. In the direction Kuznetsk Basin-Urals, freight is moved along the Main, Middle, and Southern Siberian routes. The last two mostly cross the territory of Kazakhstan. There there can be a shift in freight flows toward the Main Siberian Route. And this will also require additional strengthening. The high intensity of traffic leads to early deterioration of the railroads. In 1992, speed was limited on 12,000 km of railroads. This is equivalent to a railroad like the Moscow Railroad working at half capacity. The situation may worsen. More than 18 percent of the cross ties and a significant part of the rails have finished their service life. Their share is especially high on the main lines that were built long ago. For example, 21 percent of the accidents and malfunctions registered on all railroads can be attributed to the October Railroad, the first railroad in Russia, which accounts for 12 percent of the total length of the country's steel lines. One must also consider the factor that Russian railroads have tens of thousands of bridges, tunnels, and other artificial structures with a total length of 2,262.6 km. About 10 percent of them have defects but are in use. There is traffic across bridges built under the standards of 1884-1896, which have been in service for a time that is twice the norm. A further strengthening of the spans of such bridges is no longer possible. They must be replaced with new bridges. But this is an extraordinarily complex and costly measure, especially when it is a matter of bridges across such rivers as the Volga, Don, Oka, Kama, Ob, Yenisey, Zeya, and Amur. Last year the number of prolonged restrictions of speed doubled because of the unsatisfactory state of artificial structures. And there are many such slow-acting "mines" on the railroads. They include, for example, the defective road beds in the eastern areas of Russia in connection with a warming of the climate. On the Transbaikal Railroad alone, 75 percent of the earthen base of the road was laid on permafrost. As a result of the constantly increasing number of deformations, expenditures for the repair of the railroad have now increased by a factor of almost seven. If measures are not taken, the Transbaikal Railroad may become impassable. Overall for all kinds of transport, the depletion of production capital amounts to 38 percent. This is by no means a complete listing of the problems with our transport. But it indicates rather clearly that under these conditions it is very difficult for transport to satisfy the needs of the armed forces with respect to military conveyances. There is a widespread opinion that in the existing situation the mobility of units and combined units may be increased by taking the course of the priority development of military transport aviation. But one should not exaggerate the possibilities of this aviation, for above all it must provide for the landing of assault forces, accomplish the most urgent troop maneuvers, deliver weapons and other freight, and evacuate the wounded. The share of railroad transport in military conveyances remains high. Under today's conditions as well, it is seen as one of the most important forms of transportation that is most suitable and convenient for large-scale movements of troops and cargo, especially when it is a matter of heavy and bulky weapons and equipment. There are also other advantages inherent only in rail transport: For example, the rapid rehabilitation of the roads, the low degree of dependence on weather conditions, and the preservation of the relative integrity and accordingly combat capability of units and subunits during the time of their transport by rail. All of this puts rail transport into first place in military transport movements. Naturally this does not diminish the role of other kinds of transport in the realization of the requirements of military doctrine. All of these problems are now the focus of attention of the scientists of the Military Transport Institute, who in their research work closely with other higher institutes of transport learning in the country. In this respect, what prospects flow from the program "Transport Russia"? It is intended to overcome crisis phenomena and to guarantee steady work for the railroads in 1994-1997 and to achieve a world level of transport by 2005. Overall, the program shows the prospects for the formation of a transport network and the coordinated development of every kind of transport and the management of the transportation system. The subprograms "Transport Space" and "Transport Technology" constructed under the branch principle also make it possible to forecast the military strategic possibilities of new and rebuilt main lines and from this position to put demands on the established transport network and produced industrial goods. Unfortunately, however, overall defensive functions are not purposefully incorporated into the program. It is forecast that by 1997 the volume of freight moved in the trailroad network will decrease by 25 percent and no increase in its density is foreseen before about 2000. On the contrary, it is planned to write off up to 20,000 km of lines that have completed their service life. It appears that under these conditions the question of the elimination of unprofitable sections, leading to a reduction of the length of railroads, must be coordinated with the country's military leadership. A similar precedent arose in the United States at the beginning of the 1980's. When there were plans there for the closing and dismantling of several railroad lines, the leadership of the armed forces came out against this and took control of the network of the militarily most important railroads, proving their strategic necessity. There is still another problem. It is proposed beginning in 2000 to carry out preparatory work in the building of high-speed railroad lines. In world practice, this concept is realized through the reconstruction of existing lines (this is basically the course taken by the United States and other countries with a dense network of railroads) or through new construction. My opinion is that for defensive purposes it is expedient for us to take the second course. And now about the economic-mathematic model for the functioning of our transport. It was worked out with an orientation toward the transportation system of the United States and forces a redistribution of investments in favor of an increase in conveyances by motor vehicles, which does not take into account our special circumstances in Russia. The model also does not consider expenditures for the realization of defense demands on transport. The primary reason for the indicated shortcomings is the fact that the developers of the program "Transport Russia," having taken the initiative in such an important matter, did not involve specialists in military transport services in this joint work, above all the service for military transport communications that ensures the representation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in rail, sea, river, and air transport and that is empowered to raise military-technical demands on the development of these kinds of transportation. In our opinion, the existing draft of the program requires detailed study by military specialists together with interested transport agencies. Only after this can it be presented to the government for consideration. In the development of the defense aspect of the program, one certainly cannot discard such a purely Russian peculiarity of ours in which troops actively participate in the resolution of national economic tasks. Every year motor vehicle units carry out large volumes of agricultural conveyances and road building units work intensively to build roads in the Nonchernozem lands. The railroad troops are performing an especially large volume of work. Despite being at less than full strength and despite interruptions in financing and supply, they are continuing to build and reconstruct railroad lines of different purposes. In so doing, naturally, the troops are primarily being involved in the building of transport facilities of paramount significance for defense. The troops also play a major role in the elimination of the consequences of accidents and disasters. That is, the entire military transport structure is being fully loaded with work and in peacetime, accordingly, it is a great omission to fail to consider the role of the military in the country's transportation strategy. It may be that it even makes sense to include an independent subprogram in the comprehensive program "Transport Russia." We will conditionally call it "Military Transport" and it would reflect defense requirements and ways to carry them out.
