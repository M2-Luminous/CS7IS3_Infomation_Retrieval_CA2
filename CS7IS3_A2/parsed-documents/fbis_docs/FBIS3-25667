Tonight the spotlight falls on PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence Makwetu. As you probably know, at the weekend the PAC released its election manifesto. Well, Mr. Makwetu is with us in the studio this evening. A very good evening and a warm welcome. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Makwetu. [Makwetu] Good evening. [Bishop] A couple of soft questions first before I bowl you a fast and hard one. What are your particular qualities that make you the leader and acceptable to the people? What would you say they were? [Makwetu] Well, I don't think I have any particular qualities. Actually, I was forced into this position. I never aspired to it. I never canvassed anyone, but I was at a congress that was held here in Johannesburg and they decided to elect me to this position. [Bishop] A modest response. What about chances of the PAC in these forthcoming elections? Prediction polls say about 2 percent to 4 percent. What do you say? [Makwetu] Don't worry about prediction polls. This has happened in the past. We have seen it in various countries, for instance in Britain last time we were told that the Labor Party was winning and the Conservatives are in power. Next door here in Zimbabwe, before Mugabe came into power we were told that it was Joshua Nkomo or Bishop Muzorewa, and right here next door again in Lesotho, we were told...[pauses] nothing was mentioned about BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] until election results were announced. So we are not bothered. Not because of this history that I related to you, but because of the amount of work we have done in the country. We are happy about what we have done in the country. [Bishop] You are widespread in the country? [Makwetu] Throughout the country, we are represented. [Bishop] Now, only last Sunday, and I'll give you a quote, you said, if I am reporting you correctly, that you suspended the arms struggle but the PAC would return to the arms struggle if the land was not returned to the African people. Is that right? [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position. [Bishop] You'll also know that you registered as a political party, and could it not be said that you are now forbidden from making such statements because of the Electoral Act -- threatening armed struggle? [Makwetu] We are not threatening anybody. In fact we were involved in the armed struggle because we were forced into it by the regime. If anybody forces us to armed struggle, we will resort to armed struggle. [Bishop] You don't see that though as in any way contravening the Electoral Act, you know, your statement? [Makwetu] No. [Bishop] Have you been approached by anybody who has challenged you on that? [Makwetu] You are the first one to challenge me. [Bishop] And if somebody official challenged you, what would you say? [Makwetu] Well, we would look into the legal consequences of that. [Bishop] Well, another quote from Mr. Nemadzivhanani, the secretary general of the PAC. I think you'll probably know it. It was in all the papers. He said unless the elections are rigged the PAC will win. [Makwetu] Yes, he said so. [Bishop] You endorse that? Unless those elections are rigged the PAC will win. [Makwetu] We are sure to win, that's why he said so. [Bishop] I see, but what I'm going to say is that if the election is free and fair and the PAC doesn't win, how can the elections have been rigged? If the election monitors, the international people and everybody else say: no, no, no, there's no rigging. We're very sorry Mr. Makwetu, you have not won the election. What will your reaction be then? [Makwetu] But we have committed ourselves already to that, in that we said if the elections are free and fair we will respect the outcome of the election. That's what we have said. [Bishop] No, I do accept that, but you see I'm quoting Mr. Nemadzivhanani and he says unless the elections are rigged, in other words, I take it to be only rigged elections would mean that the PAC couldn't win. Is that not what he meant? [Makwetu] Well, I think what he meant is what is happening in the country right now. For instance, we were raided in May last year, our offices and our houses. Documents that we were using and that we should be using right now at the World Trade Center were taken away from us and those documents are still with the regime. Isn't that the rigging of elections? [Bishop] Well, I am not going to respond to that. The regime must respond, as you call them, to that. [Makwetu] Exactly. [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, Patricia de Lille, her statement made quite a lot of press and she has since made another comment about it. I am talking about saying that whites who wish to emigrate should be encouraged to do so. Do you endorse that sentiment? [Makwetu] Well, according to the information I have, and this information I got from her, she says she has been misquoted. She never uttered such words. PAC has no program to drive whites into the sea. PAC has no program to drive anybody out of this country. [Bishop] Didn't Mr. Barney Desai say something about whites going into the sea though, also quoted last week? What do these phrases mean, you see? [Makwetu] Well, they may mean anything in politics. For instance, if I say I fight elections it doesn't mean I am fighting you physically, but I am fighting. [Bishop] No, quite. But let's stay with the whites for a minute because I suppose there are quite a few whites watching and would like to know their position should the PAC come in and form a government. Now, who are whites as far as you are concerned. Are they forever settlers or not? [Makwetu] Firstly, I must state that we have never labeled anybody as settlers. It is the settlers themselves who have called themselves settlers, and I'm going to quote instances. For instance, if you go to Grahamstown today you will find a monument named 1820 British Settlers. That monument was not named by PAC. If you move from D.F. Malan Airport into Cape Town, you'll travel along Settlers Way, and that was not named by PAC. [Bishop] Well, we are actually in the manifesto now because in the glossary you mention settler, and it's defined by the PAC as any person who does not owe allegiance to Africa and is not willing to submit to rule by an African majority. [Makwetu] That's right. [Bishop] And you also say the term applies to anyone who espouses and promotes Eurocentric and colonialist values. [Makwetu] Exactly. [Bishop] Are those European, Eurocentric values of no value to Africa? Let me name some of them perhaps: democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rule of law, habeas corpus, great international music, and eternal poetry and literature. Aren't those of value to people who would call themselves truly Africans? [Makwetu] All these values you have enumerated are no monopoly of Europe. We were not taught democracy by Europe. [Bishop] Is that so? [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] It's thought that democracy originated in any kind of recent form, by recent I mean two and a half thousand years, in ancient Greece. You'd challenge that, would you? [Makwetu] I have no business to challenge that, but we practiced democracy before the advent of the whites in this country. [Bishop] But then the European values then, let's just get to that Mr. Makwetu, I mean, what must we do with those. I mean, should they be jettisoned for other values? [Makwetu] Not necessarily jettisoned, but values are values irrespective of origin. [Bishop] But European values, should we keep them in the new South Africa under a PAC government. [Makwetu] Well, PAC has committed itself already to borrowing whatever is good from each bloc, that is the Eastern bloc and the Western bloc. [Bishop] Right, let's move on into the manifesto. Violence -- you say the PAC has never been party to the wanton violence and carnage in our townships and rural areas. That's set down in the manifesto. [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position. [Bishop] Let's take that position as being absolutely true. The attacks attributed to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], carried out by APLA, on civilians in King William's Town, Queenstown, the Cape Town church, Heidelberg Tavern, and the late Amy Biehl. What do you say about those attacks? [Makwetu] Actually, we have suspended the arms struggle. I don't know whether you want us to reopen that now. [Bishop] No, but what I have to feel free to do is to ask you questions that I think are in the minds of the people outside. [Makwetu] Exactly, that is why I respond in this fashion. We thought by us suspending the arms struggle, we were trying to open up negotiations so that everybody should participate, including PAC, and as far as those instances you have just mentioned, that is not the violence that we are talking about. PAC or APLA, the armed wing of PAC, was engaged in armed struggle which has been suspended now. [Bishop] That's in the past. [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] All right, move on to land -- no protection of freehold title to land. Is that the general policy of the PAC? [Makwetu] If you mean by freehold title -- you mean the monopoly of land by whites in this country, therefore, PAC is opposed to that setup. [Bishop] Not the monopoly, but the idea of you and I having a freehold over a house. Is that all right? [Makwetu] I don't have that freehold. [Bishop] No, but if you did. Would that be all right? [Makwetu] There would be no need for me to have that freehold according to PAC policy. [Bishop] But isn't that sort of, absolute security for people who have bought a house? [Makwetu] We guarantee security to each and every individual in the country. That is PAC policy. [Bishop] But if you don't have freehold, you don't have title to your land, do you, or your house? [Makwetu] Why must you have freehold? Can't you have something else instead? [Bishop] What would that be, that something else? [Makwetu] Like leasehold rights. [Bishop] Well, you can have leasehold. Some people do have leasehold rights, but I am just asking then -- so the policy is no freehold in the new PAC Azania? [Makwetu] Well, our position has been put loud and clear, that we won't be selling and buying land. [Bishop] And you won't allow people to do that individually? [Makwetu] Why should we do that? [Bishop] Well, I don't know why you should. I'm just asking whether you will. [Makwetu] No we won't. [Bishop] So all private land transactions will be canceled under a PAC government? [Makwetu] We are saying that the land has been robbed from our forefathers. It has been stolen and taken away by force and this is the land we say should be returned to its rightful owners, the African people. [Bishop] When was that land stolen? [Makwetu] As early as 1652. [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, couldn't it be argued that that land has become the land of the people whom you say stole it, over a period of history? I mean, isn't it an impossibility to wind back history this way? [Makwetu] This land was -- there were no dealings between our forefathers and those who stole the land from them. [Bishop] But that applies all over the world, doesn't it? I mean the Anglos and Saxons, when they landed in England.... [Makwetu, interrupting] Well it is.... [Bishop, continuing] ... took by conquest from the Celts. [Makwetu] That's right. [Bishop] So, I mean this is how history, fortunately, or unfortunately progresses, isn't it? [Makwetu] Well, as far as we are concerned that is no progress at all. If you deny other people land, you can't call that progress. [Bishop] OK. Then, the PAC government would take back land? [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] And give compensation? [Makwetu] We will compensate you for improvements that you have made on that piece of land. [Bishop] But not for the cost of the land itself? [Makwetu] Because we never sold the land to you. Why must we buy it back now? [Bishop] But you weren't -- I mean it could be argued that you were not in possession, or there, to be bargained with! Not previously, not in history, not so when the.... [Makwetu, interrupting] That is an.... [Bishop, continuing] ...not so when the Afrikaner farmer bought this land, or took it over 250 years ago. I mean, you know, your party wasn't there, as it were. [Makwetu] Most of them never even bought that land, for that matter. They were given that piece of land. [Bishop] But in real terms, practical terms, wouldn't you see this kind of policy as a recipe for -- if not civil war -- mass exodus? The people will fight to hold on to their land, won't they, and really fight? [Makwetu] We are fighting right now to regain that land, and the sky has not fallen. [Bishop] I know, but I mean if you were in power, as a PAC government, and you instituted a policy like this? [Makwetu] There is a regime that is in power now, that has instituted a policy which has impoverished us. [Bishop] Well, the regime says it's given away, you know, given up the apartheid land laws, made it possible for everybody, black and white, to buy land and live wherever they like. I mean they, they've changed it. [Makwetu] How are we expected to buy the land when we have no resources whatsoever, denied deliberately those resources? [Bishop] Well, it's true, but then people, white people at one stage had no resources and had to find them somewhere. I mean with jobs and with progression and so on. [Makwetu] Exactly, that is what we contemplate too. We must create jobs for everybody to live. [Bishop] Well, the economy is quite a large piece of your manifesto, Mr. Makwetu. Redistribution of wealth figures prominently there. Just outline how that would take place under a PAC government? [Makwetu] At present we note that the whole economy of the country is in the hands of a tiny minority. PAC is opposed to this. We feel that the African people should have a stake in the economy which has been denied to them for centuries. We say, therefore, that the industries that are operating in the country should allow workers working in those industries to enjoy the fruit of their labor. In other words, workers should not be shear wage earners, but they should have a share even in the profits. Not only that, but they should have a say in decision making, and in order for them to be able to do so, they should be furnished with information pertaining to those industries. [Bishop] That's not too far from Mrs. Thatcher's caring capitalist. [Makwetu] That's why we talk of a caring economy here. [Bishop] Yes. Did you get the word from Mrs. Thatcher then? [laughs] [Makwetu] No, not Mrs. Thatcher. In fact, I never even knew that she ever uttered such a word. [Bishop] She did. She called it caring capitalism. It was also about shares, share capital being given to workers and so on. All right. Where does this much vaunted and flaunted market economy come in and are you for that? The market, you know, the market? [Makwetu] Well, we still have to be educated about the market forces, because we normally don't even see them. For instance, when you talk of the selling of land you say market forces are going to decide, only to find that there is hardly anybody who is prepared to sell the land. So we have a problem with that term, not unless it is defined properly. [Bishop] And nationalization, you say no nationalization? [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] But socialization and democratization. [Makwetu] Exactly. [Bishop] Now, what will they mean, those two things? [Makwetu] It's exactly what I said already. [Bishop] Oh, that one. [Makwetu] Democracy is the participation of everybody. Similarly with socialization. [Bishop] Looking at it, say, from the grassroots then, will people with small shops, businesses, be affected by your economic policies. Will they be restricted? [Makwetu] No. In fact we will encourage more people to open up businesses. [Bishop] And keep the profits of their labor? [Makwetu] Well, I have already indicated that they should share the profits with the workers, because whoever is going to start a business definitely will need somebody to assist in their business. [Bishop] Yes, but I mean, you know, will there be profit-keeping? [Makwetu] Of course, we have no problem with that. [Bishop] And now the big companies, you know, the Big 20, as they are called. [Makwetu] Similarly the big companies, that's where quite a big chunk of labor is involved. These are the people who must be catered for. [Bishop] If somebody said to you there is a large element of command economy, collectivisation, control from the center in your plan. Would you agree with that? [Makwetu] What is the quarrel with that? Let us suppose there is. [Bishop] No, I'm not saying there is a quarrel. I'm just saying -- would you agree that that would be a fair estimation of what you might be up to as a new government? [Makwetu] I'm not quite so sure that that is the correct assessment. [Bishop] Let's move on, and we'll talk about workers. You should put a big emphasis on the workers. Your party, I think, has always said it's a workers' party. Collective bargaining -- you go for that? [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] Some of the latest, and I think THE ECONOMIST carries it -- whether you, you know, like that magazine or not, carries a view that collective bargaining as applied in Germany, for instance, has been a rather large failure, that, in fact, instead of workers' wages being raised it has had the opposite effect, that collective bargaining seems to not be working. What would you say to that? [Makwetu] It doesn't mean that if something failed in Germany it's going to fail here. [Bishop] No. [Makwetu] Similarly, capitalism has thrived in other countries, but we have problems here at home. [Bishop] The reason I particularly mention Germany is because, under housing, you mention the German system soon after the war and you think that might be applicable or at least worth looking at as far as your system concerning housing might be. [Makwetu] Yes. Well, it was just an example. [Bishop] Yes, but you also stress it a little bit more, I think. The example goes on to say that after the war, in Germany, tax--wealth tax--was applied and you imply, in that sentence anyway, that it might be a good thing to do that here. Is that so -- wealth tax on property? [Makwetu] Yes, there will be tax. [Bishop] How would that be levied? [Makwetu] Well, that will be the task of economists and experts. I am not an expert. [Bishop] Yes. It's been mooted that the tax in Germany was simply on very large organizations, large land owners, hotel owners, blocks of flats, people who owned that kind of property -- not the individual man and woman with one house. Do you think that's how that might go here? [Makwetu] Well, I would not say so and so would be advantaged but we have made it clear that on issues like food, etc., we will see to it that there is no tax levied. [Bishop] Affirmative action, you say is not about lowering standards or introducing reverse racism by the back door. You don't see it then, but I would challenge you, you know, Mr. Makwetu.... [Makwetu, interrupting] Let's hear your challenge. [Bishop] All right, isn't affirmative action, really, it is--I mean, let's have it out on the table--it's discriminatory. It favors one race, sex, or age group, over another. Doesn't it? [Makwetu] That is not true. [Bishop] But if I was going to be affirmatively actioned because I'm a white, aging, or middle-class male -- we hear a lot about that incidentally -- then I am being discriminated against because I am not a black, young, virile male. [Makwetu] How are you discriminated against, since you have been benefiting all along? [Bishop] No, I'm not...I'm not.... I'm just making an example of myself. What I'm saying is -- if you start saying: men out, women in, or white people out and black people in, it's discriminatory, isn't it? [Makwetu] No, that is not affirmative action. We are saying that doors should be opened to those who have not benefited all along, long ago, through discrimination. That is what we are saying. We are saying people should be trained to fit in into certain positions which have been denied to them all along. [Bishop] How will you do that? [Makwetu] We will do that by developing skills. Instead of importing skills, we will see to it that human resources inside the country are developed. [Bishop] Training schemes? [Makwetu] Exactly. [Bishop] No instant changeover then, you know, of people? [Makwetu] No, these things are not going to happen overnight, really. [Bishop] How long would you say it would take with a PAC government to bring about the changes you would like to see? [Makwetu] That is not an easy question to answer. I may say, for instance, seven years or eight years, but the problem is, there are people who are suffering at the moment. Are they going to be patient waiting for me for that seven years or eight years? So it's not easy for me. This is a debate amongst the factor...[pauses] people who are involved. [Bishop] I don't see, and you will know that I would spot it, anything about freedom of expression or the media in your manifesto. Did you leave it out by accident or deliberately? It's not in here. [Makwetu] No, I don't think there was a need for it really in the manifesto, because that will be covered under a Bill of Rights. [Bishop] Well, let me ask you as leader of the party: What is your approach to freedom of expression? [Makwetu] Of course, we encourage freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of movement, etc. [Bishop] Freedom of opinion, even if you don't like it? [Makwetu] Exactly, exactly. [Bishop] Hard questioning of evasive politicians. Is that it? [Makwetu] We have no problem with that. In fact, we subscribe to Voltaire's position--that's the French philosopher who was prepared to die protecting your right to put your point of view. [Bishop] Under housing I spotted something that I thought might be a real vote catcher. You promised the township people that if they paid sufficient rent to cover the structure of their house, then it's theirs. [Makwetu] Yes, exactly, that is our position. [Bishop] But, says a fortunate township dweller who is now in this position, that Mr. Makwetu doesn't want freehold, so I'll never really own the house. I'll just hold it as a curator for the state. So, what would you say to him? [Makwetu] Not for the state. You'll be a curator for your next of kin. For instance, if you die it will be handed over to you. [Bishop] Oh, it can go to your next of kin. [Makwetu] Yes, exactly. [Bishop] So it would be an inheritable... [Makwetu] Exactly. [Bishop] We've got about 30 seconds. I could go on all night, but we just have another item, I'm afraid, Mr. Makwetu. Tribal leaders, traditional leaders -- PAC's views on those, because they hold a lot of land in their power as it were. [Makwetu] They hold no land in our country, really. [Bishop] Don't they really? [Makwetu] Absolutely next to nothing. You must bear in mind that 87 percent of the land is in the hands of the white community, and even the 13 percent is with them, a part of it is not in their hands. [Bishop] And in the last few seconds, health -- universal health -- you are bringing forward.... [Makwetu] Yes. [Bishop] Any private health? Would you allow private practitioners, private hospitals? [Makwetu] Well, that is a hot debate in PAC circles, but the majority feels that we must have public health. [Bishop] And education -- no private education? [Makwetu] On education we feel that education should be made free up to a certain standard, that is standard 10, or 18 years of age. [Bishop] No private education? [Makwetu] We are opposed to private education. [Bishop] What a pity, Mr. Makwetu. We've run out, I think. [Makwetu] There's nothing we can do. [Bishop] No, thank you so much anyway. [Makwetu] Thank you.
