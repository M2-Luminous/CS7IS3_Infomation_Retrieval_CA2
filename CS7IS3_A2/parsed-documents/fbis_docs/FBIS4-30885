FBIS4-30885 "dreeu105_b_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 BULGARIA India's Sharma Addresses Assembly on Democracy India's Sharma Addresses Assembly on Democracy AU2705115794 AU2705115794 BFN [Editorial Report] Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian at 0758 GMT on 27 May begins a live relay of the morning session of the National Assembly in Sofia, where Indian President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma is scheduled to address deputies. At 0801 a correspondent reports that Dr. Sharma's arrival seems to have been delayed, and proceeds to summarize the proceedings of the preceding ministers' question time session. He says that Prime Minister Berov answered a Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) question on the government's financial policy, following which an SDS vote of censure was defeated. After this, Industry Minister Rumen Bikov answered a question on the Neftokhim Oil Refinery. At 0810 GMT the correspondent announces the arrival of Dr. Sharma. National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov formally introduces Dr. Sharma and invites him to speak. Dr. Sharma begins his speech in his native language, with a simultaneous Bulgarian translation read out by the correspondent. After a formal expression of thanks, he reviews the development of the young Indian democracy, praising the key contribution of Nehru, and quoting his words: "Democracy is not merely a political and economic matter, but something linked with reason. It includes the maximum equality of opportunity for all people in political and economic respects; and it includes liberty for the individual to develop his best qualities." He notes that this year is the 30th anniversary of the death of "the outstanding world leader" Jawaharlal Nehru, "who provided an invaluable contribution to the cause of parliamentary democracy," whose spirit "is present today in the life of the institutions and processes of democracy in India," and "whose contribution is of immense importance for the dynamics of politics throughout the world." At 0821 GMT he offers India's warm greetings and good wishes to the Bulgarian parliament, "democratically elected as the result of the first multiparty elections in your country." He reminds the deputies: "You represent the will of your people." Dr. Sharma then reviews the historical development of "spirit of democracy in India." He notes that "the Buddha's legacy and testament" "influenced the establishment of pluralism and harmony." This and the ancient Vedic teachings are "key concepts" that lie behind present-day political life in India. Further to this, Dr. Sharma notes, "respect for the law is a permanent feature" of our spirit. "In our society, the law is historically identified with the truth, and not merely as a mechanism for ensuring law and order." He reviews the development of basic elements of parliamentary democracy in ancient India, including "the establishment and functioning of a representative assembly,... quorums, open voting, and secret ballots." He says "this created a lasting tradition of democratic mechanisms," and notes the important role of the traditional rural councils in India. Further, Dr. Sharma notes that "these democratic traditions and values substantially influenced the main features of our liberation movement," based on the campaign launched by Mahatma Gandhi in the name of "human liberty, dignity, and nonviolence." He emphasizes the peaceful and nonviolent nature of the independence struggle. The Indian president goes on to declare that "parliamentary democracy is the political system that most suits the cultural character and political aspirations of India." He notes that "elections are a key aspect of the democratic process," and that almost 280 million voted in the last Indian parliamentary elections. However, Dr. Sharma says, "democracy is not only a matter of elections." He points out that "true democracy is a synthesis of the rights and obligations of the individual and the state," that "democratic politics personify the principles of consistency and change that are so important for the life of a nation," and that "discipline and restraint are decisive elements that determine whether a democratic system develops or disintegrates." He says that "democratic consensus and national development can only exist when peace and understanding are present," and that the equality of all citizens before the law is also an important component. At 0832 he refers to the recent visits of the chairman of the lower house of the Indian parliament to Bulgaria, and of National Assembly Chairman Yordanov to India with a parliamentary delegation. He hopes that these fruitful parliamentary contacts will continue and develop, promoting cooperation and mutual understanding. Dr. Sharma ends his formal speech at 0835. National Assembly Speaker Yordanov thanks Dr. Sharma for his exposition of the principles governing democracy as developed in India. He assures the Indian president "that your visit to the Republic of Bulgaria really opens a new page in the relations between our two countries," and then declares a 10-minute recess. The relay ends at 0838.
