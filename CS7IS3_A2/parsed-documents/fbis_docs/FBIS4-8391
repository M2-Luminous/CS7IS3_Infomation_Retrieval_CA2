In a letter to UN chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali Karadzic said he was cancelling all accords signed by the Serb side in the Bosnian conflict prior to NATO airstrikes launched at the weekend against Serb forces attacking the eastern enclave of Gorazde, the SRNA news agency reported. "All of the accords that have been signed and the positive efforts, based on trust, are cancelled and we must interpret the behaviour of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) as coming from a potential enemy force," Karadzic said in his letter. He added that the strikes by warplanes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation against Bosnian Serb positions in the government-held Gorazde pocket could be not justified and meant that the United Nations was siding with Bosnia's Moslems. As such, he added, "relations between us can no longer be as they were before this thoughtless act." Karadzic said Butrus-Ghali should understand that the Serbs "could no longer cooperate" with the UNPROFOR command and said they would have to be "more careful regarding UNPROFOR troop movements and any equipment they transport." The airstrikes and other "hostile acts" toward the Serbs must "cease immediately," he warned. About 40 UN observers based in Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia were placed under house arrest following the NATO raids in Gorazde Sunday and Monday. UN peacekeepers have also been blocked in weapons collection points throughout the UN-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo. The Serbs have reportedly placed mines near these points. An AFP reporter observed Wednesday that a UN convoy was still held up at a checkpoint near the village of Kubiljaca, around 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Sarajevo, by Serb policemen who had placed a dozen anti-tank mines in front of the leading transporter and behind the three trucks that were following it. The convoy was stopped on Sunday "for customs reasons," the Swedish commanding officer said. Meanwhile the Geneva conference co-presidents, Owen for the European Community and Thorvald [Stoltenberg] for the United Nations, arrived here amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at defusing the crisis. They went immediately to the headquarters of the UNPROFOR chief in Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, for talks with U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin. Later they were to hold talks with the Bosnian authorities, a government spokesman said. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and the UN Protection Force chief in former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand de Lapresle, were also due in Sarajevo later in the day, arriving from Belgrade following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said. On Tuesday they had attempted without success to travel to Pale for talks with Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Churkin was making his third visit to Sarajevo in as many days, arriving from the Serb stronghold of Pale, 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of the Bosnian capital, where he has been in talks with separatist Serb leaders. Talks aimed at securing an overall ceasefire in Bosnia- Herzegovina have stalled following a UN threat to order air strikes against Serb forces unless they pull back from their assault on Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area.
