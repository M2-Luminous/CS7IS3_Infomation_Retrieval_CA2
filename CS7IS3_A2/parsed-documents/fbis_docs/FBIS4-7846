During his meeting with RSK President Milan Martic and its Prime Minister-designate Borisav Mikelic in Belgrade, Milosevic underscored that negotiations were the only right way of resolving the crisis in former Yugoslavia, it has been reported. In this context, Milosevic said an overall normalization of Serb- Croat relations was of utmost importance for peace and stability in the region. On March 30, the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb an agreement on the cessation of hostilities, which took effect on April 4. The Krajina-Croatian conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and its decision to downgrade Serbs to a national minority, after which the Serbs proclaimed the Republic of Serb Krajina in their ethnic and historical lands. The Republic of Serb Krajina has been a U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992. The Serbian president pointed out the danger coming from certain extremists who were working against interests of the Serb people, and, in this context, mentioned the activity of some members of the Serbian Radical Party, an opposition party in the parliaments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its federal unit, Serbia, and of irresponsible groups and individuals in the RSK. "Extremists compensating for their moral and political defeat in Serbia by behaving in a barbarous way in Krajina are a serious threat to Krajina's interests," he said. The Serbian Radical Party, headed by Vojislav Seselj and headquartered in Belgrade, maintains a very strong branch in the RSK. Last autumn, Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia -- which is the biggest party in Serbia and Yugoslavia -- bitterly criticized the Serbian Radical Party for its fascist ideas, raising paramilitary units and committing crimes in war zones in former Yugoslavia. He said it was necessary as soon as possible to push to the margin the extremist forces in the RSK and put them under control of the RSK authorities, whereas legal proceedings should be instituted against individuals who had broken the law and sunk deep in crime. Serbs, who are proud of their heroic past, must not allow extremists and criminals to strip them of their honour -- the Serbian president underscored. Martic and Mikelic advised Milosevic of their efforts aimed at peace and at stabilizing the RSK politically and economically.
