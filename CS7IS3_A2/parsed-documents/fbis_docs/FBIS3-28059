The move to dissolve the assembly by Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Pairin Kitingan did not surprise anybody because it had been the talk of the town for some time. It is still interesting, however, to discuss the timing behind Pairin's move to dissolve the assembly and gain a new mandate from the people. [passage omitted] Politically speaking, Pairin might have believed that the earlier-than-scheduled elections would serve as the most effective weapon against the 17 January court ruling. But looking at the current situation, the wellbeing of the Sabah people seems to be a more urgent matter which requires more attention than Pairin's fate on that day. Having experienced lengthy political upheavals in the past few years, the Sabah people now have the opportunity to think again and ask themselves what they really want from the coming state elections. The Sabah people should also ask themselves what they want to achieve, namely development and life's prosperity or a struggle still shrouded by irrelevant elements after 30 years of independence. They should be aware of the fact that blind faith and loyalty will bring about dire consequences to their grandchildren's wellbeing. The Sabah people naturally do not want to live an uncertain life, devoid of political stability and in constant hostility with the central government. They certainly do not want to lag behind other states which are making rapid progress in development programs. We have no idea of Pairin's plan for himself -- whether he wants to retire from politics and transfer the party leadership to another person or whether he wants to take part in the coming elections and continue his political life. In the current situation, the Sabah United Party apparently wants to test the waters and gauge its own strength, described by many observers as declining, before making noises as to whether it wants to rejoin the National Front, which it abandoned in 1990 in a truly unfavorable situation. Being the backbone of the National Front, UMNO [United Malays National Organization] is certainly very enthusiastic about taking part in the coming Sabah elections as a means to measure its strength in Sabah after it first entered the state in 1991. Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's remarks that the National Front is ready to run in all the 48 state constituencies shows that the ruling coalition not only wants to test the waters, but also to wrest Sabah back from the Sabah United Party, which won the elections in 1985. This is not an impossible task.
