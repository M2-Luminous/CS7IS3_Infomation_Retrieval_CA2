Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, noted that amendments cannot be made to the already initialled package of agreements, which consists of four documents. However, the interests of the Latvian side will possibly be taken into account during discussion of the mechanism for implementing individual points. Reaffirming Russia's willingness to withdraw its troops from Latvia by 31 August, Zotov stressed that only the signing of the entire package of documents relating to the withdrawal of the army units would be acceptable to Russia. In his turn Guntis Ulmanis, as was reported at his office, is insisting on the introduction of substantial corrections into the agreement on social protection for military pensioners resident in Latvia. Today representatives of the foreign policy departments of the two countries will set the date in Moscow for the meeting with President Yeltsin.
