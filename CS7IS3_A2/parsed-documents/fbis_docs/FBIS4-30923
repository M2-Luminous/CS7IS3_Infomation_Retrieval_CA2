"Conversion as we were doing it was bad," Moravcik said at a briefing after a meeting in Detva of directors of state-owned enterprises, bankers and business owners in the central Slovak region of Detva. However, he went on, the government has not enough money for converting arms manufacturing to civilian production to the necessary extent. "We want to release certain funds within several months, but this will not be enough to cover all requirements," Moravcik added. A possible early resumption of arms manufacturing could provide additional funds for speeding up the conversion process, he said. The government is currently working out the principles of privatization policy in the armament sector, which are to be ready by the end of June, said Moravcik. He added that in his opinion this sector can be revived through privatization and the transfer to private ownership, while maintaining reasonable state participation.
