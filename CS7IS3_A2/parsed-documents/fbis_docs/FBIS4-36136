The sources added that al-Majali told people close to him that he would not be reshuffling his government "because many qualified political figures have refused to join that government." They noted that al-Majali "has renewed his accusations claiming that certain political forces considered loyal to some former prime ministers were trying to bring down the government," and that the government now has no clear vision regarding the question of the reshuffle which has been pending and which has resulted in "complete paralysis and chaos in government organs." According to parliamentary sources, the efforts made by some ministers to pacify the House of Representatives' Financial Committee have failed. One of the committee members told AL-HAYAH that the committee "will not allow its members to be used in a government ploy to pass future decisions to raise the prices of water, electricity, and other services." The parliamentary sources emphasized that the government's future "is now in the hands of his majesty the king," who "might take surgical and dramatic steps." The political circles are unanimous that al-Majali's failure to carry out a cabinet reshuffle means that the end is near for his government, perhaps not more than a few weeks away. Observers believe that al-Majali's government has been lumbered with some ministers who are seen as a burden on its shoulders and who have failed to promote basic relations with the National Assembly and the political parties. Some sources say that al-Majali had hoped to replace a number of ministers through a cabinet reshuffle, including First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, because of the reservations of the House of Representatives and political circles about their characters and political trends." [quotation marks as published] Al-Majali's government has also been the target of severe criticism by senior Royal Court officials because of what they describe as the government's "excessive enthusiasm" for the Palestinian-Israeli agreements. They believe that "it would not be wise" to keep the present government because the peace process requires "a different strategy" for dealing with the future Palestinian entity in the occupied Arab territory.
