[Samahah, interrupting] Just a minute. Ask your questions one at a time. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you said that [words indistinct] by the Council of Ministers to study the draft law on organizing the media. Since the media are still capable of broadcasting, is there a public pledge regarding a specified period of time for the draft to be finalized? [Samahah] First and foremost, there is a pledge regarding the security of the homeland. There is a pledge regarding the security of the citizens. There is a pledge on freedoms. If you followed the statement properly, the printed media still has all its rights safeguarded by the law on printed media. The government's concern at this point in time is for our homeland to weather the storm blowing over it now. This storm takes us back to dark days. The government wishes to put an end to these dark days in every possible way. The government guarantees the rights of citizens to acquire information through the printed media at this stage and affirms that it will finalize the law on audio and visual media during its session on Tuesday, 29 March, and refer it to the Chamber of Deputies. This will give all media organizations that wish to continue broadcasting within the law the possibility to do so and practice their concern about freedom and the security of the citizens and the homeland within the framework of the laws that are being applied. [Correspondent] Do you expect any security reactions from the parties that have been harmed by these decisions? [Samahah] As a government, it is only natural for us to expect everything. This is why we have instructed all security forces, the Lebanese Army, the Internal Security Forces, the State Security Forces, and the Public Security Forces to continue their efforts in keeping peace and stability in the homeland and for the citizens. [Correspondent] Is there any intention to arrest some officials? [question is not answered] [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] to stop the newscasts of audio and visual media due to one issue to [word indistinct]. However, there are some media organs that are abiding by the state's laws.... [Samahah, interrupting] That is very true, but the law applies to all equally. We are at a very crucial stage now. We will finalize the law and within the framework of this law, media organs will resume their operations, provided they agree to function within the limits of the law. They will then continue informing the public through the audio and visual media by abiding to the audio and visual media law. While waiting for this to happen, the experiences of the past weeks and the attempts at shaking the stability in our homeland at this sensitive stage prompts us all to become more aware, open our eyes wider, join our ranks closer, and review all the methods we have thought about or practiced previously. We should go back four years in our memory to see where our homeland was and where it is now. The project for stability and unity in the homeland is worth our best shot and not sacrificing it for the sake of things, which though important, are not as important as the stability we are enjoying in our homeland. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the public media [words indistinct] the private media that are disrupting the march of the homeland. [Samahah] The private media that is disrupting the march of the homeland has no place in this homeland. There is no point in responding to it, because it has no place in the homeland. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what were your personal feelings when you announced measures stopping all newscasts and political programs? [Samahah] My real feelings were a sense of responsibility before the danger that is threatening all of us. Have you not had enough of dodging shells? Have you not had enough jumping from one catastrophe to the other? Have you not had enough going from one sad mother to another? Let us handle this situation at this stage and we will all emerge in the light with greater joy. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with respect to the security measures you have taken in Kasrawan, [words indistinct]. Today the security situation in the south is going through many [word indistinct]. Some circles have conjectured that perhaps there is pressure on the government not to declare the results of the investigations? [Samahah] The same conspiracy is moving from one area to the other. The same Israeli enemy is moving, along with its shells and mines, from the south to the inside. We all have to demonstrate solidarity in confronting this scheme wherever it may be. [Correspondent] Are there any practical steps to confront this situation? [Samahah] I believe there are some steps that we have announced. There are some issues that will be implemented and the security units have been instructed to do so. In addition, the judiciary is proceeding with its measures. We shall not interfere in its business. The judiciary is performing its duties within the framework of the Lebanese law that allows a defendant to have a defense lawyer and to be tried publicly within the framework of the applicable laws. We have heard requests for public trials. All trials in Lebanon since independence have been public and will remain public. Before the law, all citizens have the right to engage lawyers to defend them. They have equal rights before the applicable legislations, which guarantee the personal rights and public freedoms. [Correspondent] With the issuance of the law, what do you have to say to the representatives of the media organs? [Samahah and correspondents speaking at the same time] [Words indistinct] [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] This is a decision taken by the Council of Ministers and I would prefer not to delve into the details of setting dates. I hope we will overcome what we are going through quickly. We hope the law on audio and visual media will be issued speedily, and we will come back and meet with you before these cameras. We shall not miss you in the meantime because you work in the audio and visual media as well as in the printed media. [Correspondents speaking at the same time] [Words indistinct]. [Samahah] Would you please listen to each other? [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you expect any popular reaction to the decision that you have taken? [Samahah] I think the people are concerned about having their children go to school in the morning and return home without fears of explosions and without the various distortions we have been hearing recently, such as rumors and nerve-racking stories. Let the people have a peaceful time. People in Lebanon want to live in peace. A citizen is born in Lebanon to live in peace, freedom, and quiet, not to have the nightmare of explosions, fears, and terror follow them from district to district and region to region. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] I cannot hear you. [Correspondent] [Word indistinct] in the south [word indistinct] for everyone. Radios and televisions provide greater coverage than the official station. [Samahah] Who says so? [Correspondent] I can see and hear. [Samahah] I am also minister of information and can see and hear. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] geographically, the radios are very useful. If there is the possibility regarding the issue of the south only, [words indistinct]. [Samahah] Let us not delve into this subject. No one party cares more than another about confronting the enemy and informing the citizens about the dangers of events in the south. The official radio, if you have been listening to it, and Lebanese television are covering all these issues. We call on you to cooperate with them in covering these events. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] former Prime Minister 'Umar Karami regarding gathering light-caliber weapons. Has the implementation of such measures been discussed? [Samahah] I believe that one of the duties of the Army, which has been deployed in all areas, is, as was noted in the text of the statement, to control all violations, including gathering weapons. Upon request from the specialized ministers, some new laws have been proposed to take into consideration all these abnormal events in Lebanon and make the citizens live with the legitimate government under the protection of the Lebanese security forces, not security islands and individual security measures. It should be known what sort of licensed weapons each individual has and how it is moved from one place to another. [Correspondent] Has the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies been contacted and his opinion sought regarding these measures? [Samahah] Are you new here? Don't you know that there is a separation of powers and that the executive authority was meeting today? If the legislative authority has a different opinion, it is the master of its own domain and will express its opinion on it. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the four of five who are said to be responsible of the crime? [Samahah] The Cabinet has not issued arrest warrants. The arrest warrants were issued by an investigative judge trusted by everybody. Only two days ago, those who are now saying these things expressed confidence in him. Therefore, as part of the separation of powers, the judiciary is independent of executive authority, which the Cabinet represents, and so we cannot interfere in such matters and I have no authority to answer such kinds of questions. There is a judge who is doing his job and all Lebanese must comply with his orders. Once things reach the court, and I hope this will be soon, every defendant will have a lawyer to defend his case before the judicial council. [Correspondent] You have not spoken about the situation in the south. Is there anything new in the message that the U.S. ambassador handed to Prime Minister al-Hariri? [Correspondent] There is a reiteration of the U.S. position on the need to calm things down and a reiteration of the Lebanese position--namely, that calming things down will come, first and foremost, from ending the occupation of Lebanese territory and, consequently, regaining the territory and the having the occupiers depart. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] The judiciary is pursuing all matters, including the issue you just mentioned, and no obstacles are stopping the judiciary. Today's measures prove that there will be no cover-up in anything whatsoever, that there is a functioning state, and that there is a state that has a responsibility toward its citizens and before history for the future of the homeland, and it will not shirk this responsibility. [Correspondent] Did you discuss the 19 September [words indistinct] in today's meeting? [Samahah] We discussed all issues. If you wanted to score a point before being stopped from going on the air, you just did it. Thank you all.
