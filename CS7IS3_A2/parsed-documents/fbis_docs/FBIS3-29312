In past summit talks, Japan was obliged to accept unreasonable demands in the name of the Japan-U.S. alliance, and this caused an anti-American feeling among the Japanese. Also, the two nations tended to reach vague agreements to patch up things for the moment, thus leaving the seeds of conflict for the future. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton clearly said "No" to each other on economic issues. We believe their approach is much better than that taken in the past when the ultimate objective was to achieve successful agreements. However, if this result is to become what Hosokawa called a "mature and adult relationship," at least two conditions should be met. Prevent the Expansion of Confrontation One condition is to limit confrontation between the Governments of Japan and the United States to bilateral trade. It is important not to spread the conflict to the entire bilateral relationship. Regarding this, President Clinton said at a news conference: "The two sides will maintain good relations in the area of politics and security." We give high marks to his remark. What worries us are moves in the U.S. Congress. We sincerely hope that Congress will not present demands for Japan's greater cooperation in security as a means to push forward trade negotiations, and not pass discriminatory legislation against Japan. We call on Congress to act with calm. The other condition is for Japan to take aggressive action toward opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. We support the goverment's decision to reject U.S. demands for introducing numerical targets. The refusal, however, does not mean that urgent issues have all been resolved. Now that the government has rejected the path toward managed trade, it should make efforts to increase domestic demand, to drastically reduce government regulations and administrative guidance, and to establish a transparent and fair market. Further appreciation of the yen against the dollar would be an unavoidable development for the time being. Under the economic framework talks agreed to last July, the recent summit meeting was a sort of mid-course examination. The two nations plan first to produce results in the three priority areas, and then reach a final agreement on the other issues before the next summit scheduled for July. Five months is not very long. The Japanese Government should immediately set to work on devising counterproposals that will convince the United States. We call on the United States to take a flexible stance on numerical targets. "The setting of numerical targets will push Japan back to the past method of adjusting imports through government manipualtion." Such arguments have appeared in leading newspapers in the United States and Europe. Economists in Japan and the United States are also opposed to numerical targets. Washington should listen to what they have said. The United States Acts Too Rashly President Clinton expressed a sense of distrust in Japan by saying that despite more than 30 agreements reached on opening up the Japanese market, there had been absolutely no change. His understanding is not completely correct. Certainly, Japan's trade surplus has not been reduced remarkably. But bilateral agreements have produced results in the government procurement of satellites and supercomputers as well as the expansion of imports of beef and citrus. It was predicted from the beginning that framework trade talks would be rough. Some people said that the end of the Cold War would allow the two nations to discuss economic issues straightforwardly, and others said President Clinton, who seeks reelection, would call for quick results. Others also pointed to the differences in the trade policies of the two nations. Another factor that cannot be overlooked is the return of Japanese industry to a "Japan as Number Two" position. Semiconductor accords used as a model by the United States in recent trade talks and the plans by the Japanese auto industry to buy more U.S.-made auto parts were drawn up during a time when Japanese industry was increasing in prosperity. Faced with the difficult position of being sandwiched between the resurrection of U.S. industry and the rise of Asia, Japanese industry can no longer afford to accept difficult requests from the United States. Because of the appreciation of the yen since last year, Japanese industry has moved production bases overseas, and imports from Asia and other countries have rapidly increased. As a result, the trade surplus has begun to decrease slowly. Some people have made hasty predictions that if this trend continues, the fierce trade friction between Japan and the United States will disappear. It is unavoidable that economic relations between Japan and the United States will continue to be strained for the time being. It is also possible that bills will be submitted to U.S. Congress urging hard-line action against Japan, and that the U.S. Government will threaten to impose sanctions. However, if the world's two economic superpowers should turn inward and mutually implement protectionist measures, the negative effect on the world economy will be great. We hope the two nations will tide over the current difficulties with calm while not losing a long-term perspective.
