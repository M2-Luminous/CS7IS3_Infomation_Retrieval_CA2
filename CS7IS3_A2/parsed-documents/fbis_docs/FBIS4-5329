FBIS4-5329 "dreas069_i_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Cambodia Vietnamese Villagers Describe Attack by Gunmen Vietnamese Villagers Describe Attack by Gunmen BK1104111994 Hong Kong AFP in English 1056 GMT 11 Apr 94 BK1104111994 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Pean So, Cambodia, April 11 (AFP) -- Ethnic Vietnamese in this small village near Phnom Penh said Monday they could not identity the gunmen who massacred 14 of their number, contradicting reports which blamed Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The gun and grenade attack also left more than 20 wounded in the village in Tro Sla district about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Phnom Penh, villagers said. The Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom Penh said earlier Monday that local people blamed the Khmer Rouge for the attack late Saturday on the village along the banks of the Bassac River. But one woman whose grandson was killed when the group of about 10 gunmen attacked said: "We do not know who they were because it was dark." The assailants, who were dressed in shorts and T-shirts attacked at around 8.30 P.M. killing 14 people, mainly women and children, the Pean So villagers said. "They started running from the far end of the village and when they heard the sound of children playing they threw grenades. They did not care about young or old," said Pham Kory, whose sister was killed and whose son and daughter were injured in a grenade blast. Many of the ethnic Vietnamese villagers told AFP that they had never seen or heard of Khmer Rouge in the area and there was no evidence of guerrilla involvement in the attack. Lam Van Chiep, a 42-year-old fisherman, also said he did not think the gunmen were bandits. "It's very difficult to say who they were. Most of them wore shorts and T-shirts and they did not steal any belongings except for a little money," he said. The Vietnamese Embassy statement, which originally identified the village as Tro Sla, called the attack the bloodiest in a year against ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for several massacres during the UN-supervised elections in 1993. Among victims was [word indistinct]-day-old infant whose arm was torn off, said the embassy statement. Nguyen Van Ty, an official with the local Vietnamese residents' association, was among the victims, it added. The embassy said the "barbarous massacre" was an attempt to harm friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia. It called on the Cambodian Government for an immediate and effective inquiry, to bring the guilty to justice and prevent such killings occurring again. Thousands of people have fled Cambodia over the past two years after the Khmer Rouge attacked ethnic Vietnamese, many of whom have lived in Cambodia for generations. About 30,000 refugees are stranded in border provinces of Vietnam, unable to return to Cambodia, while another 5,000 to 6,000 are on the Cambodian side.
