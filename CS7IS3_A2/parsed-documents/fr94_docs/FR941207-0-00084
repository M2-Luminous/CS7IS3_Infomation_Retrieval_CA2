FR941207-0-00084 FR941207-0-00015 The amended rule, however, does require each joint claim to identify all claimants participating in the joint claim. Those who are not identified in the joint claim may not be added to it after the filing period. An exception, however, is made for the performing rights societies when they file cable and satellite carrier claims. If ASCAP, BMI and SESAC were to file a joint claim, those three organizations would have to be listed in the claim, but when ASCAP, BMI and SESAC file claims separately, they will not have to list their members or affiliates because of the burden of doing so, and the recognition that, together, they represent virtually every composer, lyricist, and publisher entitled to royalties. 6 A similar exception is not being made for the performing rights societies in the case of DART claims. There, it is not clear that the performing rights societies represent virtually the entire composer-lyricist-publisher universe, because they have an affirmative duty to obtain a separate written authorization to collect on behalf of their members and affiliates and it is unknown how many of them they represent, and because there are other organizations such as the Harry Fox Agency and the Songwriters Guild who file claims in that proceeding. 6 By this statement, we do not intend to prejudge controversies in the Music category. We know that there are composers, lyricists, and publishers, such as ACEMLA and Italian Book Corporation, who are unaffiliated with the three performing rights societies. However, to the extent that they file claims separate from the three performing rights societies, they become identified in the filing period as independent, leaving for future proceedings their proper share vis-a-vis the performing rights societies. While we are eliminating the requirement of identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant, we are not accepting RIAA and Baseball's recommendation of eliminating the secondary transmission identification requirement altogether. We agree with NAB that section 111(d)(3) of the Copyright Act authorizes distribution of cable royalties only to copyright owners whose works were retransmitted on a distant signal. Eliminating the requirement that the claim identify at least one instance of such qualifying retransmission would effectively eviscerate the claim requirement itself. See NAB, comments at 3. The argument has equal force for satellite carrier royalty claims. See 17 U.S.C. 119(b)(3). The Office also does not accept Baseball, NAB, and Copyright Owners' recommendation that the Office not review claims for eligibility and sufficiency. Section 801(c) expressly allows the Librarian, before a CARP is convened, to ``make any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would apply to the proceedings conducted by such panel.'' We believe that this grant of authority is broad enough to allow the Copyright Office to examine royalty claims for timeliness and sufficiency. Furthermore, we do not accept Baseball and NAB's argument that review of claims is a waste of copyright owners' money. Eliminating claims which are untimely filed or patently deficient on their face promotes administrative efficiency by reducing the workload for the CARPs, which will already be pressed to conduct proceedings and issue a report within the 180-day time period. The Copyright Office will, therefore, continue to examine royalty claims for timeliness and sufficiency on their face. IV. Precontroversy Discovery Of all the issues generated by the CRT Reform Act and the transfer of royalty distributions and rate adjustments to the Librarian and the CARPs, precontroversy discovery has generated the greatest amount of comment and concern. The questions are general (Should there be any precontroversy discovery? Who should conduct it?), as well as specific (What discovery motions may be filed? When and how will discovery orders be issued?). We have examined this controversial issue extensively and considered all of the arguments. We are adopting as our final rule a solution that we hope will streamline the evidentiary process for the CARPs: a limited discovery period of 45 days conducted by the Librarian prior to declaration of a controversy requiring exchange of cases among the participating parties and one round of discovery motions and rulings. The question of whether or not to have precontroversy discovery, defined as a period for exchange of evidence among the parties to a distribution or rate adjustment proceeding prior to the Librarian's declaration of a controversy and convocation of a CARP, has come full circle during the course of this rulemaking proceeding. In reaction to a statement of Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary, accompanying the passage of the CRT Reform Act and commenting favorably on the use of precontroversy discovery and exchange of information, see 139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993), the Copyright Office proposed a precontroversy discovery period in the NPRM. In the case of distributions, we proposed that the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for discovery and exchange of documents sometime after the filing of royalty claims for the distribution and ending with the declaration of the controversy. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). Similarly, the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for rate adjustment proceedings corresponding with the time period set aside for consideration of rate adjustment petitions. Any party to a proceeding could file motions related to discovery with the Librarian during these time periods, as well as ``objections to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings.'' Id. All parties were to be given 14 days in which to respond to a motion or objection, and the Librarian could not declare a controversy in a proceeding until he had ruled on all motions. Id.
