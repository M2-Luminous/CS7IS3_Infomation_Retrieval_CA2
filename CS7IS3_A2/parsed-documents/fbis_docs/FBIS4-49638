Lu Ping said that a meeting between him and Mr. Patten should be intended to produce results instead of making show. He added that a meeting without results would mean nothing but make people in Hong Kong more disappointed. Lu Ping was speaking at a discussion with PWC [preliminary working committee] members, deputies to the Chinese National People's Congress and members of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference here today. Lu said that he had come here in the capacity of the deputy director and secretary-general of the PWC to attend meetings of political and economic affairs panels of the PWC. So he had no time to meet the governor because he had a full schedule here and he had to return to Beijing ahead of schedule to take care of business there. "The British Hong Kong Government resists the PWC by not allowing civil servants to contact the PWC, however, the governor, as the top leader of the civil servants, asked to meet me. Isn't he contradicting himself?" Lu asked. Lu held that the PWC and the civil servants should contact each other through different channels to lay down a foundation and create a satisfactory atmosphere in which he could meet the governor and the meeting could turn out results. The British Hong Kong authorities expressed that they want to cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields, but people are judged by their deeds, not just by their words as Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said. He said that the report of the House of Commons of Britain on the Sino-British relations acknowledged Britain's policies including those towards China had changed fundamentally from cooperation to confrontation. "The British side has shown no sign of sincerity to cooperate with China," he said. "We want to cooperate with the British Hong Kong authorities in other fields but we will not compromise on matters of principle. The British Hong Kong authorities should show its sincerity," he added.
