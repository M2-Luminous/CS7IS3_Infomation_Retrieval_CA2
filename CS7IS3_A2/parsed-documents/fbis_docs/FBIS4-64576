Such views from high-ranking officers are typical of current moods inside the Bundeswehr. The cause of this is not just the difficult debate about the future personnel level of the Bundeswehr. Officer dissatisfaction mainly concerned equipment -- the Marder tanks that have become museum pieces, and the Leo tanks that can only be preserved by being reconditioned. Added to these are antiquated combat and transport aircraft and elderly vessels. Commanders are annoyed because the Bundeswehr is being treated increasingly like "the nation's savings bank," a sentiment echoed by the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] Karsten Voigt. With a shrinking Bundeswehr personnel level, the defenders of Germany are going to find it increasingly difficult to do their duty -- that of guaranteeing Germany's security in the NATO alliance. The red pencil is attacking from all sides. It is mainly major equipment and urgent projects that are suffering. The targets of the relevant people in the Defense Ministry are rather high. The 1994 white paper says: "The Bundeswehr must be capable of contributing at short notice to the combating of possible international crises and conflicts together with our partners and allies. It must have sufficient reserves and strength for currently the most improbable and most unfavorable scenario, the defense of Germany and the alliance." There is a huge gap between these expectations and reality. Says Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, former state secretary of defense: "It is remarkable how soldiers overcome difficulties by means of improvisation and initiative." A retired lieutenant colonel says that "what the political leadership is doing to the Bundeswehr" is the reason for the increasing deficiencies in the defense sphere. Even Joerg Schoenbohm, a confidante of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe with the rank of secretary of state, stuck his neck out very far at the latest Defense Industry Conference. The former general criticized the fact that the proportion of the defense budget allocated for investment purposes has fallen from 30 percent in 1990 to 22 percent. With such a level of spending, the long-term equipping of crisis-reaction and defense forces so that they may fulfill their tasks, and an efficient armament industry, cannot be guaranteed, says Schoenbohm. This has been a burning issue for the Luftwaffe, navy, and army chiefs for a long time. For years they have been shouting about the need for new, modern weapons systems in order to meet the noble objectives of the political leadership, but with little success, as the inventory shows. The army is the hardest hit. Geared for decades to the defense of German territory, this branch of the Bundeswehr is now expected to make a significant contribution to international crisis control. Says the white paper: "With its strength, the army can undertake tasks within a broad spectrum of future operations, from the defense of Germany and its allies, right up to participation in humanitarian and peace missions." But the reality is as follows: Once the 649 30-year-old M-48 tanks have been scrapped by 1995 in compliance with the Treaty on Conventional Security in Europe, the army will only have 2,007 Leopard 1 tanks left. But even these are 30 years old; 258 of them have been reconditioned. Even the successor Leopard 2 tank is being permanently reconditioned in order at least partially to meet the modern requirements for heavy track vehicles. The crisis-reaction forces are also to be equipped with these vehicles. The army is setting high hopes in the modern mobile armor-plated 2000 howitzer. Its predecessor, the M 109-G howitzer, has already been in the service of the fatherland for three decades, most of this time in repair workshops. The army is worried that there are only enough funds to acquire 185 of the Model 2000 howitzers, instead of the 760 required, and that they will be given to the crisis-reaction forces, which is giving rise to fears of the emergence of a two-tier army. The Luftwaffe is flying into the next century in a state of crisis. The Eurofighter 2000, desired so strongly by the Luftwaffe Command, is incapable of escaping from political flak. There has also been no cease-fire following the maiden flight of the technically and tactically proven Fighter 90. This aircraft is flying off into a turbulent future after a delay of almost two years. Even the former supporters of the 7-million-German Mark [DM] project now have doubts as to whether the Eurofighter is "politically and militarily survivable." The Luftwaffe only expects to receive 140 Eurofighters, which are to protect German airspace from 2002 onwards. Unless the new fighter is shot down by the autumn parliamentary elections, it will replace the F-4 Phantoms, which are now over 25 years old. These U.S. veterans, 150 are still operational, will be scrapped by 1996 as part of the combat upgrading scheme. Fortunately, the heritage of the GDR National People's Army includes the neglected but quite efficient MiG-29. Two dozen of these machines, brought up to Western standards, should last at least another 12 years. On the other hand, it is uncertain how long the workhorse of the transport division, the Transall C-160 D, will continue to fly. Luftwaffe experts doubt whether it can meet the growing demand for a modern transport system, as the Bundeswehr Command hopes it can. In any case, this aircraft will soon celebrate its 25th birthday. Its possible successor, the multinational Future Large Aircraft [previous three words in English], exists only on the drawing board. The men on the high seas are not free of problems either. But they have fewer problems adapting to new tasks. "We do not need any transport capacity, and are quite well-equipped," says Captain Manfred Hartmann, naval spokesman at the Defense Ministry. In the autumn, the navy will receive the "Brandenburg," the first of four new Type 123 frigates, each vessel coasting DM585 million. But there is a storm brewing even in the navy. The planned Type 124 frigate, the navy flagship for about the year 2004, is currently sailing in choppy waters. Instead of the planned four vessels at a price of DM650 million each, the officers in Gluecksburg, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven are expecting to receive only three. Thus, the three 25-year-old Luetjens-class ships are destined to see ignominious service beyond the threshold of the next century. Even under water there are problems. The 18 Type 206 submarines, 12 of which have been modernized, have been operating for 20 years. For a long time now, the budget planners have been torpedoing plans to build four modern Type 212 submarines, to the horror of the suffering shipyards. New business is simply impossible with the Bundeswehr.
