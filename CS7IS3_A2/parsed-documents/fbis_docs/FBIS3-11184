The officer, who asked that his name be withheld, says: "Military Intelligence continues to work, even during the cease-fire period and the peace dialogue,...to discover access routes into the mountains and the forest. Satellites are being used to identify Zapatist assembly areas, new entry routes for infantry units, and drop zones for Mexican Army parchutists." He also notes that "we have found new exit routes, and the more we look the more we find; this is ongoing because we have got to be ready for any eventuality, in case there is no [peace] accord."
