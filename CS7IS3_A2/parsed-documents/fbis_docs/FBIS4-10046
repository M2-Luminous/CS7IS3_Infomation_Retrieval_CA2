The latest tour was to the special municipality of the Isle of Youth, where Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived with 60 heads of missions accredited in Havana. [Begin recording] [Robaina] I believe everyone in the country, particularly the diplomatic corps, has always been interested in the work performed on the island. I believe that to become familiar with the island, one must do it from within and with its people. Nothing is more important than the explanations the people personally give. I believe the example we saw today, when the diplomats were able to stop and talk with whomever they wanted on the streets about whatever they wanted, is an example of what Isle of Youth residents can do; therefore, the best message is, above all, about pledges, not formal pledges but, rather, only a real pledge that only by working can we solve our problems and find the option we truly need. There is no need to explain this to Isle of Youth residents. The people on the Isle of Youth are doing it. [Unidentified reporter] Do you know.... [pauses] Did you know, before you came to the island, the people on the Isle of Youth had already decided they wanted to host the 26 July celebrations next year? [Robaina] I learned about it because certain media are already talking about this issue. I believe, first of all, it is an important pledge that reflects the Isle of Youth people's decision. I believe it is a decision, desire, and hope backed by hard work and achievements. If we could hope for something, on a personal basis, it is that they successfully achieve their goals. [Reporter] I understand that out of the five tours that have been made throughout the country, this tour has had a peculiarity: direct contact with the people. What is your evaluation of this point? [Robaina] I believe each tour has its own appeal. This tour has the island's attention and includes the possibility and privilege of enjoying a neighborhood and family atmosphere, among other things. If the island is like this normally, I see no reason why it should be different for this tour. I believe this is the most important thing, to show the way you really are. [Reporter] We heard you talk about your diplomatic offensive. What does that term mean? [Robaina] I think we have talked about a diplomatic offensive, and we think a diplomatic offensive can involve a stage in which it is necessary to increase a specific activity in connection with the absence or role of the media. I believe once that phase has been completed we must talk about a permanent diplomatic offensive in which we tell the world what we want the world to know rather than answer questions. We get tired of going around the world, answering questions, because Cuba also has many questions to ask and has much to say even though it is not asked. [end recording] Robaina gave those statements to local journalists upon concluding the visit to the Isle of Youth, where he and members of the diplomatic corps visited the main areas of economic interest in the territory, El Abra Farm-Museum, the reconstruction work carried out at Nueva Gerona's historical sector, the Presidio Modelo Museum, and one of the 60 rural schools in the municipality.
