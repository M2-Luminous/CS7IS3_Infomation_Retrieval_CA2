Dani Yatom told the commission of inquiry into the killings yesterday. However, he said, five of the six men -- one soldier, three border policemen and one policeman -- who were supposed to be on duty inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs were missing. The border policemen hadn't been awakened in time -- which had never happened before -- while the soldier had been sent to replace someone else. Because of the missing forces, Yatom said, no one saw Baruch Goldstein enter the Isaac Hall. It is still not known which of the three entrances he used. Goldstein's presence during the dawn prayer meeting, however, was normal, and therefore aroused no comment, he said. Yatom also said the army had not prepared for the possibility of Jewish terror, because past experience had not led anyone to believe this was a problem. Yatom's testimony, part of which was given behind closed doors, was the main event of the first day of hearings, though several other army officers also testified. Today, the commission will tour the Cave of the Patriarchs, and tomorrow it will continue to hear testimony from the Israel Defense Forces. The commission will begin hearing Palestinian testimony next week, after the end of Ramadan, according to Supreme Court President Me'ir Shamgar, who heads the commission. The other commission members are Supreme Court Justice Eli'ezer Goldberg, Nazareth District Court Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi, Open University President Menahem Ya'ari, and former chief of general staff Moshe Levy. Al-Zu'bi repeatedly asked why Jews were allowed to bring weapons into the cave, instead of leaving them at the entrance -- which, Goldberg pointed out, is the custom at all other public places. Though the ammunition must be removed from the weapons upon entry, it can be replaced within a second, Shamgar noted. "What is the logic of letting someone go among a crowd of worshipers with an automatic weapon?" al-Zu'bi demanded. In reply, Yatom stressed that the history of the past years has been one of Arab terror against Jews, not Jewish terror against Arabs. Therefore, he said, this is where the army focused its efforts. "Hundreds of attacks by Arabs against Jews -- that's the history of the past few years," Yatom said. "I look at the overall picture of Arab attacks against Jews and Jewish attacks against Arabs, and on the one side there are hundreds, while on the other, a few isolated incidents... We came to the conclusion that taking the Jews' weapons away would endanger their lives." "A crazy act like this isn't something we expected in light of our accumulated experience," he added, noting that even at the start of the intifada, when Jewish-Arab relations were much worse than they are now, Jews had not committed retaliatory murders. There have also been no intelligence warnings of planned attacks by Jews, only of planned attacks by Arabs, Yatom said. This was repeated by all the other officers interviewed. The idea of a massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs would have seemed particularly far-fetched, he added, because there were so many places not guarded by the army where it would be easier to commit mass murder. Furthermore, there has never been a murder attempt there in 27 years, and while there have been Jewish-Arab confrontations, these generally occur when both are using the Isaac Hall. This was not the case that morning. For all of the above reasons, no one ever raised the suggestion that Jews should leave their weapon at the entrance, nor has the army ever discussed the possibility of Jewish terror, Yatom said.
