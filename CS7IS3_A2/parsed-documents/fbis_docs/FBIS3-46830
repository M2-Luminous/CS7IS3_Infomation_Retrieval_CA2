What is your view on this point? [Hata] While attending the Seattle meeting, I truly realized the Asia-Pacific region has entered a new era. Acknowledging such reality, Japan must actively make contributions. It is a fact that nations in the Asia-Pacific region are in various stages of economic development. What is important is that Japan should play the role of mediator in various aspects toward helping developing countries, being attentive to their needs. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) project proposed by ASEAN? [Hata] ASEAN has indicated that the EAEC would be a consultative group within APEC. However, this is a sensitive issue as the Asia-Pacific region draws much interest as the center of global economic growth. I feel it is important that Australia and New Zealand (both of which are currently excluded from the EAEC) be included. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How does Japan plan to approach the ASEAN Regional Forum which will be established this year? [Hata] There is a tendency to compare this with the CSCE, but I doubt there is any need to rush it (setting up a framework). However, it is very important to help gradually build such projects by promoting a security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region with the PRC and Russia joining the effort. The world trend is that nations in a certain region act together to settle problems that occur there, and this idea is beginning to bud in Asia, too. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In consideration of security in Asia, the issue of suspected nuclear development in the DPRK (North Korea) cannot be avoided. What is your view on this point? [Hata] It has become an unstable factor for all of Asia. If North Korea should withdraw its decision to pull out of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and agree to conduct talks with the ROK, Japan and other neighboring countries would be able to help it. The unstable factor would be removed if North Korea opened up its door. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is still a noted tendency among Asian nations to take up the issue of Japan's World War II responsibilities. What is your view on this point? [Hata] Following a series of speeches of apology by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the atmosphere among Asian nations has certainly changed. During the Liberal Democratic Party's rule, Japanese words (of apology) were very difficult to understand, failing to straightforwardly convey Japanese feelings and consequently leaving the Asian people concerned bitter. We must also realize that there are some people in the United States who actually still feel Japan will eventually develop nuclear weapons. I feel it is meaningful for us to once again resolve to build peace in reflection of our past mistakes.
