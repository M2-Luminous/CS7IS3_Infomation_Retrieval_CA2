[Rabin] First of all, one must remember that when talking about the negotiations with the Palestinians and with the PLO on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed in Washington, we are dealing with the creation of a very complex situation. An attempt to bring about peaceful coexistence between two entities which still harbor some remnants of suspicion and hatred for each other. These two entities are jumbled together geographically with tens of thousands of cars crossing from one entity to the other every day. Therefore, the situation we wish to create is very complex and we must first and foremost guarantee the security issues. I think that we have taken an important step forward toward implementing the first stage of the DOP, and I am referring to Gaza-Jericho First. What was achieved overall? First of all, the issue of external security has been guaranteed. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will be deployed and will remain in control of all the external lines: the line separating Judaea, Samaria and Jordan along the Jordan River, and the international border between Egypt and Israel. The border crossings and the terminals near the Allenby Bridge and Rafah will be situated in an area under IDF control. Anyone familiar with the Allenby Bridge terminal knows that it is made up of IDF outposts which are situated several dozen or hundreds of meters from each other. The border crossings themselves feature security arrangements stipulated in the DOP calling for joint cooperation and a Palestinian presence. There will be two sections at the crossing: one for Israelis and foreign nationals and a second wing for Palestinians. There will also be adequate control measures to prevent the entrance of terrorists, the smuggling of weapons, or the flooding of the territories by large numbers of Palestinians. [Gay] What do you mean by adequate control measures? [Rabin] Adequate control measures means that things will not be like today, when everything is under our control. The Oslo agreement, later signed in Washington, calls for cooperation between the two parties. [Gay] Will we be able to completely prevent the entry of undesirable elements? [Rabin] Even today, we cannot prevent this with complete certainty. This will continue to be the case in the future; however, I believe that we have arranged for adequate control. Second, we mapped out settlement zones in the Gaza Strip: the Qatif Bloc and the Erez, Nisanit, and Eley Sinay blocs. Along the borders of the Gaza Strip and in areas abutting the settlements, there will be zones in which Israel will oversee security but, of course, the Palestinian authority will be responsible for the civilian affairs of the Palestinians living there. [Gay] Are you talking exclusively about the civilian aspect? [Rabin] Yes, only about the civilian aspect although there is a possibility of conducting joint security patrols. However, the overriding [last word in English] responsibility for security is Israel's. [Raz] Mr. Rabin, when all is said and done, will the Jewish residents of these areas enjoy more security or be less safe? [Rabin] In the event of full cooperation with the Palestinians, with them exercising strict control over their side, then security will be guaranteed in the Jewish settlements and along the three major roads used by the Jewish residents. One should bear in mind that some of the roads are used by far more Palestinians than Israelis. [Raz] What are the chances of achieving a high level of cooperation and security? [Rabin] Look, if the agreement is not bolstered by cooperation from the Palestinian residents, the Palestinian authority, and the Palestinian police, then there may of course be problems. However, the agreement is founded on the assumption of cooperation. The moment there is no cooperation, the future of the entire agreement is in doubt. [Raz] When will implementation begin in the field? [Rabin] Look, what was signed in Cairo is a very important step toward completing the agreement. Palestinian and Israeli teams will still have to meet in Paris, to deal with all the economic issues, and in Taba to discuss the details and technique for implementing the principles signed yesterday in Cairo. In my assessment, it will take at least another month to complete all the details of the agreement and formulate a completed document. I hope that we will finish this within a month but it could take a little more time. One must remember that we do not have any sacred dates. In the attempt to create peaceful coexistence in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, we must first try to predetermine all possible points of friction, which are very numerous, and attempt to find solutions for them, at least in principle. We must formulate all this in writing before we can start implementing the agreement. [Raz] In other words, there will be no prisoner release or operative Palestinian police until the end of the month required for drafting all the details? [Rabin] No part of the agreement will be implemented before it is fully consolidated, comprehensive, and final. [Gay] With your permission, I would like to return to the issue of cooperation. In the event of problems, what actions will Israel be able to take in order to guarantee its security? [Rabin] In any agreement, one does not discuss what will happen if it is not implemented. Each signatory to an agreement, and especially so in this case, has ways to safeguard itself; however, the intention of both parties to fulfill the agreement must be sincere and stem from a desire to achieve what was agreed upon in the best possible way in order to really give a chance... [pauses] and despite the dangers, I believe there is such a chance, and the chances outweigh the risks. [Gay] Can you confirm that all the security elements and the IDF were involved in drafting the agreement and gave their approval and support for it? [Rabin] Each party always seeks to achieve more and has to make compromises during negotiations. For example, the map we signed on to is a map that was already presented in Taba. [Raz] Mr. Rabin, why did you leave the issue of Jericho for an as yet unscheduled meeting between yourself and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat? [Rabin] Look, first of all we signed on to a map which includes the Jericho area. At the time, and with my approval, Peres told 'Arafat, who had raised several demands, to drop the matter for the time being and to eventually decide the issue in a meeting with me. I accepted this idea. I have made absolutely no commitment whatsoever other than agreeing to discuss the matter. [Raz] Is there any chance of Israel giving the Palestinians more than the 55 kilometers in the Jericho area previously reported? [Rabin] I did not measure the exact number of kilometers, but the issue remains open without any Israeli commitment to accept the Palestinian demands. [Gay] This agreement is valid for one year after which a joint Palestinian-Israeli committee will be able to review it. What does this mean? [Rabin] No. The agreement is final. What we said was that after one year there will be a possibility to review [last two words in English] and reexamine the agreement. Generally, after a year one has accumulated some experience; however, I am convinced that the agreement will be judged on the basis of whether or not it has achieved its goals -- and I believe it will -- far before the end of the first year. [Raz] How does the present stage of the agreement with the Palestinians influence the other negotiating tracks? For example, does it have any effect on the talks with Syria? [Rabin] I think that the very fact of signing the DOP with the Palestinians, first in Oslo and then in Washington, was extremely important. Instead of negotiating with four partners without knowing what kind of linkage they would create between themselves, we changed the situation, negotiated with one Arab partner, the Palestinians, represented by the PLO, and reached an agreement which stands on its own. The Madrid conference imposed the same limitations as an international conference. The advantage we achieved by this comprehensive move with the Palestinians -- aside from the fact that we had to resolve the feud between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the longest chapter in the Arab- Israeli conflict -- is that we created a reality of separate negotiations with each Arab partner for a peace agreement which stands on its own. [Gay] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Rabin.
