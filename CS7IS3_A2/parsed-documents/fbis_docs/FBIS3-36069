Reports from Afghanistan, he said, speak of continuing clashes between different factions. Obviously, not only does the emerging situation run counter to the interests of the Afghan people but poses a real threat to regional security as well, the spokesman said. The official says Moscow is taking necessary steps within the framework of the UN and during bilateral contacts with states concerned as part of efforts to step up international help towards a political settlement in Afghanistan. One of the elements of Russia's Afghanistan policy is to try to get Central Asian states involved in multilateral efforts for normalization in that country, the spokesman said. In his words, appropriate consultations are now under way with Uzbekistan. A series of reports trying to gauge Uzbekistan's actions in connection with the Afghan crisis do not reflect Moscow's official position, the spokesman said.
