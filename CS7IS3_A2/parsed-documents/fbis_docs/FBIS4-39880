The edict says that changes are needed due to the fact that the special purpose, rapid reaction and "mobile" units, which were set up in the past as part of the country's Armed Forces and were mainly staffed with volunteers, are at present having a negative effect on the process of creating regular units in the Georgian national army. According to the edict, the above-mentioned units are to be incorporated into motor rifle brigades of the Georgian Armed Forces. The commander in chief's edict abolishes the Military Police Directorate on the grounds that it duplicates the duties of the republic's law enforcement bodies and fails to meet modern requirements. The head of state's edict declares disbanded all military formations and groups that are not part of the Armed Forces. It says that their personnel and weaponry are to be used to staff and equip motor rifle brigades. With the aim of establishing strict military discipline and order at Defense Ministry units, the edict orders the setting up of commandant's offices and garrisons in all towns and settlements where such units are based.
