Two 40-foot container vans, each containing 22 tons of dangerous computer scraps [preceding two words in English] from Australia, were discovered inside the Russian ship Gamzat Tsadasa. A Greenpeace patrol group was able to follow the ship all the way from its port of origin in Australia. According to Greenpeace, these computer scraps [preceding two words in English] can cause health problems, specifically respiratory ailments. The computer scraps [preceding two words in English] are mixed with asbestos and other toxic materials. [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0728 GMT on 2 March in a similar report adds: "A Philippine senator and the environmental activist group Greenpeace protested the delivery of two containers Wednesday allegedly carrying Australian `computer scrap' to be dumped in this country. However, the Russian ship that brought the containers resisted calls to take back the shipment, which Greenpeace claimed included hazardous materials like asbestos and harmful plastics, back to Australia.] ["Senator Orlando Mercado, a vocal advocate of environmental measures, accompanied by journalists, located the two containers at Manila's port and ordered them loaded back on the ship `Gamzat Tsadasa.' Cranes were used to bring the containers alongside the ship but crew members told Mercado that their captain refused to take them on. Mercado was later joined by local environmentalists and members of Greenpeace who visited the Philippines on the last leg of a Southeast Asian tour to protest developed nations' dumping of hazardous waste in developing countries. They hoisted a huge banner over the two containers, saying `Australia, stop wasting Asia.' Greenpeace members said very little of the computer scrap could be recycled, saying the rest would be dumped. They added that this violated a Philippine law banning the shipping of toxic materials to this country.] ["Leigh Sarinas, terminal manager of Filipino-Soviet Shipping Company, a Philippine-Russian joint venture that owns the ship, confirmed its docking at Manila before dawn Wednesday had been delayed by Greenpeace attempts to intercept the ship. Greenpeace said the shipment had been 'impounded' but Customs officials could not confirm this."]
