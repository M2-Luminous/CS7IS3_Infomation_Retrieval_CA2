Take notice that on September 30, 1994, Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. (Iroquois) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, Seventh Revised Sheet No. 4. The proposed effective date of this revised tariff sheet is November 1, 1994. Iroquois states that pursuant to Part 154 of the Commission's regulations and ยง12.3 of the General Terms and Conditions of its tariff, Iroquois is filing the referenced tariff sheet and supporting workpapers as part of its annual update of its Deferred Asset Surcharge to reflect a scheduled reduction in the annual revenue requirement associated with its Deferred Asset for the Amortization period commencing November 1, 1994, as well as to reflect other changed factors used to derive Iroquois' effective rates pursuant to its general Section 4 rate filing in Docket No. RP94&hyph;72&hyph;000. The revised tariff sheet reflects a decrease of $.0003 per Dth in Iroquois' effective Deferred Asset Surcharge for Zone 1 (from $.0013 to $.0010 per Dth), a decrease in the Zone 2 surcharge of $.0002 per Dth (from $.0011 to $.0009 per Dth), and a decrease in the Inter-Zone surcharge of $.0005 per Dth (from $.0024 to $.0019 per Dth). Iroquois states that copies of its filing were served on all jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
