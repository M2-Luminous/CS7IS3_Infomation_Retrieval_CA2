In Southwest China's Yunnan Province, the total capital investment in farm production has jumped to more than 2.5 billion yuan this year. The provincial fiscal budget for agriculture has been increased at an average annual rate of 23.2 percent since 1988, the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions. Last year's total investment was over 2.38 billion yuan. To achieve good economic returns, the province has also restructured its farm products in a bid to achieve a total grain output of 11.25 billion kilograms this year. The total grain-growing land has thus been expanded to 2.46 million hectares by the end of March. Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has planned to put 800 million yuan more in agriculture than last year while the total grain growing land is also expected to increase. Over the past two years, the province has made efforts to improve 1.4 million ha of low-yield land and to reclaim nearly 20,000 hectares of waste land. In Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, land planted in cotton is expected to reach 740,000 ha, an increase of almost 140,000 ha over 1994. The regional government has also framed a number of preferential policies to expand cotton growing land and has given priority to supplies needed by cotton growers.
