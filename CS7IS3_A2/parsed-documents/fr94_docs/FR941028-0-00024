FR941028-0-00024 FR941028-0-00009 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Russell Frum, Acting Chief, Applicant/Violator System Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. Telephone: 202&hyph;208&hyph;4655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background. II. Rules Adopted and Responses to Public Comments. III. Procedural Matters. I. Background Section 510(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act) and 30 CFR part 773 establish certain requirements for permits and permit processing. These requirements include the identification of ownership or control links between permit applicants and individuals or entities who are responsible for unabated violations of certain Federal or State laws and rules. See 30 CFR 773.5; 30 CFR 773.15(b). The purpose of such inquiry is to determine whether a permit applicant is linked to unabated violations of the Act and related air and water quality requirements. See 30 CFR 773.15(b). In the event that a permit applicant is so linked, the regulatory authority may not issue a permit to the applicant unless the applicant submits proof that the violation has been or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation. In the alternative, the applicant may establish that the violation is the subject of a good faith, direct, administrative or judicial appeal which contests the validity of the violation. Id. In the event that a permit applicant is so linked and proof of the violation's correction or good faith appeal is not submitted, issuance of a permit to the applicant may constitute improvident issuance and may subject the permittee to certain remedial measures including suspension or rescission of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21. Under a court order in the case of Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. et al. v. Clark, No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. January 31, 1985) (Parker, J.), the Secretary of the Interior was required to improve the enforcement and implementation of Section 510(c) of SMCRA, and to establish a computerized Applicant/Violator System (``AVS'') to match permit applicants and their owners and controllers with current violators of SMCRA. OSM has developed such a computer system to enable OSM and State regulatory authorities to comply effectively with the responsibilities prescribed by Section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 773. On January 24, 1990, OSM and DOI entered into a Settlement Agreement attempting to resolve litigation with Save Our Cumberland Mountains (``SOCM'') and other plaintiffs. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the U.S. District Court on September 5, 1990, and became effective, by its own terms, on that date. See Memorandum of the Court, Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., et al., v. Lujan, No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. September 5, 1990). That Settlement Agreement contained provisions whereby OSM agreed to propose rules to implement Section 510(c) of SMCRA and the AVS. Accordingly, on September 6, 1991, OSM proposed rules whose purpose was: to require that, prior to issuing permits to applicants, regulatory authorities consider complete ownership and control information in conducting the analysis mandated by section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(b). The proposed rules would mandate the use of AVS as a critical component of the ownership and control information consideration process. See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval, 56 FR 45780, 45781 (September 6, 1991). While the proposal of the rules fulfilled certain provisions of OSM's Settlement Agreement with SOCM, OSM indicated that: it must be emphasized that OSM independently believes that the proposal and public consideration of such rules are important to assist OSM in implementing its duties under Section 510(c) of SMCRA and duties imposed by regulations such as 30 CFR 773.15. The proposed rules should be viewed as proposals that OSM would have made regardless of any litigation or settlement. Id. Subsequently, on March 16, 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals (D.C. Cir.) vacated the District Court's approval of the Settlement Agreement with SOCM. Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., et al., v. Lujan, No. 90&hyph;5374, Slip. Op. (U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Cir., May 22, 1992). In its decision, the Court noted that ``nothing'' in the Court's opinion precluded OSM's maintenance and improvement of the AVS as agency policy. Id., at page 22. As OSM indicated at the time of its proposal of September 1991, these rules are important and appropriate_independent of any litigation or settlement. OSM continues to be committed to the maintenance and improvement of the AVS as a matter of agency policy and believes that the publication of final rules is now necessary to the effective implementation of section 510(c) of the Act and the implementation of the AVS. OSM's commitment to AVS is in accord with the position recently expressed by the Senate Appropriations Committee:
