The foreign ministers were holding here a meeting on the Bosnia crisis, which ended today. The five EU nations are France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Greece. A statement issued after hours of talks here this afternoon urged the three warring parties -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- to reach a four-month truce and resume talks unconditionally within two weeks. The cessation agreement should include separation of the warring armed forces, withdrawal of heavy weapons and supervision of the proposed ceasefire by UN peacekeepers, it said. It stressed that the division of Bosnian land should be based on the proposal put forward by the EU -- 51 percent to the Bosnian Croat-Muslim Federation and 49 percent to Bosnian Serbs. The statement said it backs bosnia in continuing to exist as a country which will define in the constitution relations between the Bosnian Serbs and the Croat-Muslim Federation. It ruled out any possibility of lifting international sanctions against Yugoslavia before a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia crisis. Any attempt to make the lifting of sanctions a precondition for resumption of talks is unacceptable, it noted, adding that only after the peace plans are implemented, can phased lifting of sanctions be considered. The co-chairmen of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were also invited to the Geneva meeting. Speaking at a press conference following the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the international conference on the former Yugoslavia will continue to play an important role. He admitted that major obstacles remain toward the settlement of the Bosnia issue. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe agreed with Christopher and added that France will have to consider troops withdrawal from Bosnia if all parties refuse any peace proposal. Talking about the arms embargo on Bosnia, Christopher said the United States hopes to see the embargo still observed. The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to urge the government to cancel its arms embargo on Bosnia. Commenting on the Geneva meeting, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic [name as received], who is attending an international seminar on the Bosnia issue in Spain, told Radio Belgrade today that without active participation by all the Bosnian warring parties, it is impossible to settle the Bosnia crisis. He said the Bosnia crisis has become a serious threat to peace in the whole of Europe. "It is impossible to resolve the Bosnia issue without active participation by the three warring parties in Bosnia, without equal treatment, without the removal of dual standards and without participation by Yugoslavia," he stressed.
