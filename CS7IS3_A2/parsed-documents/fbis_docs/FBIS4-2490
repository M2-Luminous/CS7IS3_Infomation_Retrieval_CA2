The goal, set by Mayor Li Qiyan yesterday, is 2 percent less than last year but 1 point higher than the national gross domestic product (GDP) target of 9 percent for 1994. The mayor opened the Municipal People's Congress [MPC], the city legislature, by outlining several of the capital's economic priorities for the coming year. The MPC session runs for one week. Li said agriculture and industry should grow 3.5 and 9.8 percent respectively. He stressed the importance of the city's service sector -- a development priority -- and projected an 11.5 percent increase in output, making up 47.5 percent of GDP. To ensure sustained, rapid and healthy growth, Beijing will focus on improving economic efficiency and product quality. It plans to spend 484 million yuan ($55.6 million) this year to promote agriculture, 11.8 percent more than last year, Li said. Arable land should be preserved and more bases of non-staple food set up. Vegetable farms will be expanded by 10,000 hectares. Top finance official Sun Jiaqi shrugged off the city's $500 million deficit for 1994. Sun said revenue will grow by 9 percent to reach 4.25 billion yuan ($488 million). And expenditures will reach 8.56 billion yuan ($984 million), up 5.7 percent over last year, the Finance Bureau director said. But a roughly balanced budget is expected because of central government tax refunds and subsidies, as well as last year's financial surplus. To increase farm income, the city will promote a high-yield, quality and efficient agriculture. Meanwhile, Beijing will encourage industry development that consumes less water and energy and produces less pollution, Li said. The capital's three key industries of cars, electronics and new building materials will be accelerated. And technical renovation of enterprises will be stepped up, he said, calling for one-third of the key plants to be revamped. Retail sales are expected to increase 20 percent to hit 66.4 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) -- just the beginning of the city's shopping bonanza. Ten more shopping complexes with a floor space of at least 1O,OOO square metres will open to business in 1994.
