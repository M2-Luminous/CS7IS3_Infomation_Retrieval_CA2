Our Correspondent Leonid Nikitinskiy Talks With Justice Minister and State Duma Deputy Yuriy Kalmykov"] [Text] [Nikitinskiy] Which of your two hats would you prefer to wear as we begin -- minister or deputy? [Kalmykov] I would like to divorce the two roles. Although as justice minister I can probably see the problems in legislation more clearly than most of my Duma colleagues. Our rule-of-law area is reminiscent of the diminishing ozone layer over the earth -- and saving it and launching a mechanism for reviving it will take emergency measures. [Nikitinskiy] The Duma has been at work for four months, and not a single law in the proper sense of the word has been passed in that time.... [Kalmykov] To a certain extent this hiatus is normal since it is due to the discussion of the standing orders and other documents regulating the work of the Duma itself. At the same time, each plenary session in the Duma begins with a heated debate on the agenda which has already been approved the previous day by the Duma Council. Feelings run high, and, as a result, we are not in a position to tackle actual legislative matters. I put this down mainly to a lack of experience. [Nikitinskiy] Experience is something you have to earn. But the first and, so far, last legislative attempt to "pass" the law on the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds vote failed for purely political reasons. For certain factions and groups in the Duma torpedoing the Constitution is a very important element of their strategy of preparing for the next elections. [Kalmykov] Nonetheless the majority of people in the Duma, as I see it, are sensible enough to stay within the constitutional framework. This was stated by Speaker Ivan Rybkin as a representative of the majority of deputies. For its part the government and the president have enough carefully prepared draft laws in reserve that they can and should "bombard" the Duma -- but the correct utilization of these drafts is being impeded by the fact that the procedure for their submission has not been regulated in detail and there are no set precedents. [Nikitinskiy] Do you mean that there is political rivalry even in the sphere of legislative initiative? [Kalmykov] I probably have to agree. I believe that, for instance, the president should initiate only the most important draft constitutional laws and major codified acts. The legislative initiative of factions and deputies' groups should in the course of time become more the exception, with the bulk of draft laws -- as is the case worldwide -- being submitted by the government. [Nikitinskiy] As long as draft laws are being used for political advertising they will merely distract lawmakers into rehashing their deliberately unpalatable product. Yet there are many filters in different branches of power designed to prevent any "foreign bodies" from getting into the legislative apparatus.... [Kalmykov] These mechanisms often do not so much help each other by sticking to a unified strategy as produce conflicts, which creates chaos in lawmaking and a loophole for lobbyists. Answering on behalf of the Justice Ministry, I can say that, owing to apparatus intrigues, it is often bypassed and prevented from carrying out its direct duties. Our functions are expanding on paper, but other structures -- primarily the State Legal Administration -- are constantly infringing them. From the very beginning, by dint of its role, this has been one of the departments at the Presidential Administration responsible for the legal side both of its own edicts and of legislative initiatives. Initially, it also included departments dealing with awards, appeals, and citizenship. These were then hived off into independent Presidential Administration structures, but the State Legal Administration was not only not cut back, it grew to an absurd size. This structure now has a staff as big as a sector ministry, but it has arrogated intersector functions to itself. You get the impression that the State Legal Administration is not controlled either by the Presidential Administration or by the president himself -- not to mention the government, with which it is in constant conflict instead of organizing working contacts. [Nikitinskiy] There are some very qualified legal specialists working at the State Legal Administration. According to lawyers, a comparison of their expertise with that of the Justice Ministry leaves the latter coming off worse. [Kalmykov] The level of provision and benefits in that mysterious structure is an order of magnitude higher than we have. But many of them are not at all doing the job that should follow from the modest functions of the president's apparatus. When it comes to the legislative process the State Legal Administration constantly obtructs the government and even the president and torpedoes many draft laws merely because they carry an "outside stamp." We can now expect friction between the State Legal Administration and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's representative in parliament. We recently received from the State Legal Administration a draft of the Labor Code with a proposal that we study it and make our comments. But how did it get there, bypassing the Justice Ministry and the government? At the same time, the draft Civil Code, on which long and painstaking work has been done by specialists at the behest of the president and the government -- and that was no secret to the State Legal Administration -- has gotten bogged down there "for coordination" and has not made any progress for months. This after having been approved by the government and receiving a promise from the president to support the legislative initiative. I suspect that the real reason for this delay lies once again not in the sphere of the law, but in the sphere of official ambition. In order to spite the specialists drawing up the draft Civil Code, another group of lawyers is now urgently working on the Trade Code. The draft of this code, which rivals the Civil Code, has to all intents and purposes been kept secret, and we can so far only speculate as to what it will look like. We only know that the working group is headed by Academician Vladimir Laptev, formerly a vigorous opponent of the development of trade and monetary relations in the country and an advocate of administrative regulation of the economy within the framework of the concept of so-called "economic law." [Nikitinskiy] If the law-drafting process is such a mystery even to you, the justice minister, imagine yourself once again in an ordinary deputy's position. How can he sort all this out, what should he think? [Kalmykov] That this is a mad house, of course....
