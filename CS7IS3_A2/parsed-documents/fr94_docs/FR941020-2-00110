FR941020-2-00110 FR941020-2-00063 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION [Notice 94&hyph;084] National Environmental Policy Act; Cassini Mission AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of availability of draft environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508), and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR Part 1216, Subpart 1216.3), NASA has prepared and issued a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the proposed Cassini mission. This planned action would involve the preparation for and implementation of the Cassini mission, including, but not limited to, launch of the Cassini spacecraft, its cruise to Saturn, and a variety of scientific operations and investigations focused on Saturn and its rings and satellites. DATES: Comments on the DEIS must be provided in writing to NASA on or before December 5, 1994 or 45 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability of the Cassini DEIS, whichever is later. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dr. Peter B. Ulrich, NASA Headquarters, Code SL, 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546. The DEIS may be reviewed at the following locations: (a) NASA Headquarters, Library, Room 1J20, 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546. (b) Spaceport U.S.A., Room 2001, John F. Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899.

Copies of the DEIS are available by contacting Dr. Peter B. Ulrich, at the address or telephone number indicated herein. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Peter B. Ulrich, 202&hyph;358&hyph;0290. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The DEIS considers and analyzes the alternatives associated with the proposed Cassini mission and their related environmental impacts. NASA's baseline proposed action and preferred alternative would involve the launch of the Cassini spacecraft from Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, using a Titan IV (Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade)/Centaur. The primary launch opportunity is in October 1997, with contingency launch opportunities in December 1997 (secondary) or March 1999 (backup). The primary launch opportunity would place the spacecraft into a 6.7-year Venus-Venus-Earth-Jupiter-Gravity-Assist trajectory to Saturn. The preferred alternative would use three radioisotope thermoelectric generators for onboard electrical power, and radioisotope heater units to control the thermal environment of the spacecraft and its components.
