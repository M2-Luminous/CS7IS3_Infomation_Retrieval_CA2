Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will maintain in the state of the nation debate, which begins tomorrow, that in the first place the facts must be fully clarified. To this end there will be two essential mechanisms -- a parliamentary committee of inquiry and the judiciary's activity through the government attorney's office and the courts. This stance is unanimous in the government, although some ministers believe that the government should have responded vigorously to the corruption phenomenon much earlier. Mistaken Line The mistake, they assert, was not to appoint Rubio as Bank of Spain governor or to defend him when the first irregularities in connection with Ibercorp were attributed to him, but to have maintained an irresolute political line on the corruption cases. Various government sources consulted believe that the previous days' rumors about the possibility that the Rubio affair, combined with a possible severe electoral setback in June, could lead to Felipe Gonzalez' resignation, are unfounded. "It is a possibility that must be completely ruled out," a member of the government said yesterday, stating that a resignation of this kind "is not at all in keeping" with Gonzalez' personality and would not be consistent with his analysis of the government's proper role against corruption. Thus the prime minister will open the state of the nation debate by referring immediately to the Roldan and Rubio cases, in order to reaffirm the government's commitment against practices involving the misuse of power for private advantage. Gonzalez will state that he has undertaken this commitment in personal terms, as he explained in the campaign that led to the 6 June election. The government is preparing a set of specific proposals for the debate, on the basis of the conviction that the essential thing is to apply the regulations already existing at various levels in order to ensure the institutions' good functioning or to suppress, where appropriate, conduct contrary to it. The government is concerned about the lengthy duration of the penal proceedings in these cases; hence the idea of introducing more summary trials in certain cases. However, this conflicts, on the one hand, with the need not to reduce procedural safeguards, depending on the type of offense, and, on the other, with the obvious fact that some proceedings for matters connected with corruption, such as the investigation into Filesa -- the PSOE's [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] illegal funding network -- have been under way for two years, with no end in sight. However, various government sources consulted acknowledge that the debate will center not on the future, with respect to what can be done, but on analysis of the episodes that have emerged over the past few weeks and of the existence or otherwise of immediate political accountability in this respect. This discussion, a prominent member of the government asserted yesterday, "is clearly fraught with subjectivity," because the concept of political responsibility "is anything but objective." The government's line of argument against these charges is to state that the accusations against Rubio and the issue of whether these influenced his public activity must be verified. To this end, the government has set in motion all the machinery at its disposal, with the aim of dispelling the idea that there is "impunity" for corruption in Spain. Last Friday's [15 April] parliamentary session, with the appearance of Rubio himself, forms part of this line of argument. Thus it is believed in government and Socialist group circles that the speech by PSOE spokesman Juan Pedro Hernandez Molto to the Economy Committee had the virtue of making clear to the opposition and the public at large the intention to clarify the matter completely. Yesterday, Molto himself made statements in which he asserted, with respect to his speech last Friday, that "the important thing is that the Socialist group said what it believed and also what many citizens believe." Molto also said that in this matter there are no political responsibilities, just personal responsibilities, since nobody has linked Mariano Rubio's private actions with his conduct in charge of the Bank of Spain. A prominent PSOE Executive Committee member, for his part, said yesterday that the reaction of the government and the party to the Rubio affair has been similar to "the massive administration of drugs to a patient: Now everything depends on how his organism responds." According to this leader, neither Felipe Gonzalez nor Carlos Solchaga has political responsibility for this case. However, he stated that the investigation opened after the first accusations about Ibercorp must have detected irregularities on Rubio's part in the handling of his finances.
