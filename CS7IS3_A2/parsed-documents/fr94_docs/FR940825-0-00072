FR940825-0-00072 FR940825-0-00015 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 83&hyph;2&hyph;6581a FRL&hyph;5030&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, South Coast Air Quality Management District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is taking direct final action on revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revisions concern rules from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). The revised rules control VOC emissions from Polyester Resin Operations, Manufacture of Polymeric Cellular (Foam) Products, Fugitive Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds, and Sumps and Wastewater Separators. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). In addition, the final action on these rules serves as a final determination that the deficiencies in these rules have been corrected and that on the effective date of this action, any sanctions or Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) obligations are permanently stopped. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: This final rule is effective on October 24, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by September 26, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, a timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.
