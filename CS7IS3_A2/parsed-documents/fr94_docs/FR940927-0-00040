FR940927-0-00040 FR940927-0-00006 (2) For fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rates that are less than 1,300 hours per year or less than 900 cycles per year, within four months after the effective date of this AD, determine the initial utilization rate for each stage 7 through 12 HPC disk in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(1) of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. Determination of disk utilization in accordance with PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 3, dated May 8, 1992, constitutes an acceptable alternate method of compliance to paragraph (a)(2) of this AD. (i) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an initial utilization rate equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a high utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (c) of this AD. (ii) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an initial utilization rate less than 1,300 hours per year or less than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. (iii) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an unknown initial utilization rate, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. Note: Once a disk is designated as low utilization, then it must retain this designation for the life of the disk or until recoated. (iv) For recoated or new disks, designate this disk as a high utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (c) of this AD. (b) For high average utilization fleets and sub-fleets, excluding those disks identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this AD, perform the following for each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk in that fleet or sub-fleet: (1) Inspect, and recoat or replace if necessary, at the next part accessibility of the disk, in accordance with paragraph 2.D.(1)(b) and Chart A of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. (2) Recalculate the fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rate at 12 month intervals after the previous date of utilization determination in accordance with paragraph 2.B of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. (i) For fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rates that are equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, continue to designate all stage 7 through 12 HPC disks as high utilization disks and comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this AD. (ii) For fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rates that are less than 1,300 hours per year or less than 900 cycles per year, within four months of compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this AD, determine the utilization rate for each stage 7 through 12 HPC disk in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(1) of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994, as follows: (A) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with a utilization rate equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a high utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (c) of this AD. (B) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with a utilization rate less than 1,300 hours per year or less than 900 cycles per year, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. (C) For each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk with an unknown utilization rate, designate this disk as a low utilization disk and inspect in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. Note: Once a disk is designated as low utilization, then it must retain this designation for the life of the disk or until recoated. (c) For high utilization HPC stage 7 through 12 disks, perform the following: (1) Inspect, and recoat or replace if necessary, at the next part accessibility of the disk, in accordance with paragraph 2.D.(1)(b) and Chart A of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. (2) Calculate the disk utilization rate at 12 month intervals after the previous date of utilization determination, or after installation of new or recoated disks, in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(3) of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. (i) For HPC stage 7 through 12 disks designated as high utilization in accordance with (c)(2), comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this AD. (ii) For HPC stage 7 through 12 disks designated as low utilization in accordance with (c)(2), comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this AD. (d) For low utilization HPC stage 7 through 12 disks, perform the following: (1) Determine the type of disk surface treatment for each HPC stage 7 through 12 disk in accordance with paragraph 2.E. of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. Determination of type of disk coating in accordance with PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 3, dated May 8, 1992, constitutes an acceptable alternate method of compliance to paragraph (d)(1) of this AD.
