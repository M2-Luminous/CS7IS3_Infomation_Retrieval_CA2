He stressed the need for legally confirm that the Kaliningrad region, Russia's most western area separated from the rest of the country by Lithuania and Belarus, belongs to Russia as successor to the former Soviet Union, to which the region was handed over after World War II as part of former East Prussia. At present, the Kaliningrad region's population makes up about one million Russians. Shumeyko also pointed to another aspect of the problem, that of a greater autonomy and economic freedom the enclave should gain to ensure for its residents living conditions comparable with those in the rest of Russia. The house speaker intends to employ the Federation Council's right for a legislative initiative and move a law on the Kaliningrad region's status in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, which certainly has no doubts about the region's belonging to Russia.
