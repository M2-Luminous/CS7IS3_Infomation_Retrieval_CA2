He took his oath of office before the yang dipertua negeri (governor), Mohamed Said Keruak, at 10.05 am local time. Pairin had stationed himself by the istana [palace] gates since 9.40 pm on Saturday soon after his party won a simple majority, to stop any other person to be sworn in as head of state government. His action was to prevent a recurrence what is now known in local political circles as the 1985 incident. [passage omitted] Eight PBS winning candidates were sworn in as state cabinet members after Pairin took his oath of office. They are Bernard Dompok (Moyog), Amirkahar Mustapha (Banggi), Chau Tet Onn (Api-api), Joseph Kurup (Sook), Wilfred Bumburing (Tamparuli), Lajim Ukin (Klias), Lau Pui Keong (Karamunting), and Adib Sigoh (Nabawan).
