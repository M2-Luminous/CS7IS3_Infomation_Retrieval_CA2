(1) This section covers the requirement for filled fiber optic cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations either by trenching or by direct plowing. (i) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called ``fibers'', herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, or in tight buffer tubes. (ii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core. (iii) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material to exclude water. (iv) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. This jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs. (v) Buried installation requires an armor under the outer jacket. (vi) For self-supporting cable the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core. (2) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twenty-four colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, stripings, or markings provide fiber group identification. (3) Cable manufactured to this section must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications. (4) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed if accepted by REA. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. (5) All cables sold to REA borrowers for projects involving REA loan funds under this section must be accepted by REA Technical Standards Committee ``A'' (Telephone). For cables manufactured to the specification of this section, all design changes to an accepted design must be submitted for acceptance. REA will be the sole authority on what constitutes a design change.
