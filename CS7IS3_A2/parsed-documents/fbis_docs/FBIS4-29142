Statements from the North Korean Foreign Ministry have only come through the media, IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said today on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR). The IAEA inspectors have also not yet been asked to leave the country. Meyer stressed that North Korea leaving the IAEA does not automatically mean it has to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Separate control agreements exist here. These also still allow for on-the-spot checks. According to the IAEA spokesman, the nuclear danger posed by North Korea is being "played up by the media." "The IAEA has never said that North Korea has bombs."
