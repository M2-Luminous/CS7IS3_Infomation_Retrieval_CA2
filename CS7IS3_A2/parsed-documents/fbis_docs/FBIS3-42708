Our correspondent talks with Yuriy Sakharnov, president of the AO Boguchangesstroy [Joint-Stock Company Boguchanskaya GES Construction]. [Khrustalev] From the government's decision on joint-stock conversion of the Boguchanskaya GES to the issuing of certificates is an enormous distance. [Sakharnov] The lengthy procedures have in no way violated the privatization conditions stipulated by the Russian Federation President's edict for the version chosen by us. What has occurred has been just the transfer from the Krasnoyarsk Kray's Property Fund to the Russian Joint-Stock Company, the Unified Power System of Russia, of 49 percent of the shares intended for sale at auctions to large investors, including foreign ones. This, I believe, is a correct and sensible step. We have overcome the psychological barrier of the preconceived opinion: whatever goes outside the boundaries of the kray is no longer ours. Indeed, if things are considered objectively, the kray authorities are in no position to invest in a construction project. But, having transferred the block of shares to RAO YeES Rossii [Unified Power System of Russia], they have opened the oxygen valve for a project which is of paramount importance both for the kray's economy and for the transformations of all of Russia. In other respects, however, the distribution is as before. Almost a fourth of all the securities will be sold to small investors at check auctions. And 26.6 percent remains in the labor collective. [Khrustalev] Is this a lot or a little? [Sakharnov] Sufficient, if it is kept in mind that the overall number of shares is around one and a half million. A third of the cited portion, or 8.7 percent, will be received free of charge by the workers of AO Boguchanskaya GES Construction. A tenth part, or 2.6 percent of the securities, will go by private tender at a discount of the face value of 30 percent and on a 3-year installment plan. Five percent of the shares is for officials and the administration. In the event of the introduction of new production lines and an increase in the collective, there still remains an enterprise workers joint-stock conversion fund of 10 percent. [Khrustalev] I would like to know, what will the individual Ivanov, Petrov and Sidorov have? [Sakharnov] The collective is diverse. And here, of course, consideration will be given to the realities in each specific instance. The number of preferred shares, for example, will depend on the salary (after all, it corresponds to the qualifications) and the length of service in Boguchanskaya GES Construction. Also not forgotten will be those who are on pensions or who left because of a reduction in force. If a male worker's length of service in Boguchanskaya GES Construction is not less than 10 years and that of a female worker is 7.5 years, they are alloted securities at a 30-percent discount on the installment plan. Of course, one owner will not be equal to another. But if you are interested in average figures for the joint-stock company, here they are: each worker will receive 38 shares, of which, 11 will be preferred. [Khrustalev] And how will it be with the vouchers? [Sakharnov] They will also figure in. Half of all the shares can be acquired using privatization checks. [Khrustalev] Tell me honestly, Yuriy Viktorovich, will it be possible for the shares owned by a Boguchanskaya GES Construction worker to provide income for him in his old age? [Sakharnov] Everyone will very quickly become aware of the fact that this is no mirage. Judge for yourself: just the July revaluation raised the face value of a share from 1,000 rubles [R] to R27,000. I am confident that the new revaluation will increase this figure by a factor of 5 or 6. But it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the dividends and the actual cost value of a share. Of course, the income will depend, first of all, on how many shares the worker has and, to a large extent, on what kind of dividend there is. Presently, it amounts to 10 percent of the net profit. If we currently have a net profit of R500 million, then the portion for each shareholder is determined arithmetically: we divide R50 million by the number of securities. Pretty slim, you might say. True, it is slim for the time being. However, profit is a quantity which fluctuates. When the plant is commissioned and all credit debts have been paid off, it will become very respectable. But the actual worth of a share is already currently sufficiently high. In really comparable current prices of the charter fund, if a share were sold at auction, it might, even today, go for $100. Under conditions, however, when new projects are started, the worth of a security also increases. It is also possible to give a specific example of this. It would be appropriate, for example, to recall that, after the power plant's start-up, according to the specialists' calculations, the annual profit will amount to $280 million. So it is easy to imagine what kind of pursuit will begin for Boguchanskaya GES shares in some 5 to 10 years.
