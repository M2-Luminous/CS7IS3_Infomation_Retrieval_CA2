Tere- and isophthalic aldehydes and bis-(3-hydro-formyl-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl(methane) [BHPM] that had been purified by vacuum sublimation were used as starting monomers. Terephthalic aldehyde was reacted with SmI[.sub]2[/] in tetrahydrofuran [THF] in an argon atmosphere. Hydrolysis was performed with diluted hydrochloric acid. A study of the effect of temperature on the reaction in the temperature interval from -25 to +65�C demonstrated that a portion of the aldehyde groups do not participate in the reaction at low temperatures (from -25 to -20�C). Increasing the reaction temperature to 5-7�C results in a slight increase in the polymer's logarithmic viscosity; however, once again not all the aldehyde groups are involved in the condensation. Finally, when the temperature is increased all the way to 65�C, it is possible to obtain a polymer of the desired structure (i.e., a polymer with no absorption band at 1,680 cm[.sup]-1[/] and intensive absorption bands at 3,400-3,500 cm[.sup]-1[/]). The polymer's molecular weight also increases slightly as the reaction temperature is raised; however, the solubility in organic solvents of the polymer synthesized at 65�C is significantly diminished. The said polymers only dissolve upon protracted heating in amide-type solvents and lose their solubility when the duration of the synthesis process at 65�C is increased to several hours (evidently on account of cross-linking at the hydroxyl groups). The noticeable ash (samarium) content in the reaction products was also deemed attention worthy. Increasing the concentration of dialdehyde dissolved in the THF from 0.05 to 0.50 mol/l did not result in any increase in the polymers' viscosity characteristics but did increase the tendency toward formation of coordination compounds with samarium (even those products purified by reprecipitation contained samarium). The polypinacols obtained from other dialdehydes and SmI[.sub]2[/] under similar conditions were found to contain carbon and hydrogen in quantities corresponding to the theoretically calculated amount and no ash at all. This finding was attributed to the fact that side processes expending OH groups are suppressed as a result of steric factors and because of the fact that the mutual effect of the aldehyde groups in such cases is weak. The said compounds also had a lower molecular weight than the polymers formed from terephthalic aldehyde. This lower molecular weight was attributed to the lower concentration of starting monomer on account of its limited solubility in THF. The newly synthesized polymers on the basis of BHPM were white powder materials, and those synthesized on the basis of tere- and isophthalic aldehydes were yellow powders. All had an amorphous structure, a softening temperature of 160 to 190�C, and a 5 percent mass loss in air at 200-230�C. The polypinacols based on BHPM had the lowest softening points and temperature of onset of heat destruction. All of the newly synthesized polymers were distinguished by their solubility in a number of organic solvents (those based on BHPM were soluble in chloroform and even acetone), and all were interesting as functional compounds from the standpoint of subsequent synthesis of derivatives at their hydroxyl groups (e.g., by reaction with isocyanates, etc., coordination with organometallic compounds, and synthesis of poly-_a_-diketones via oxidation). The possibility of modifying the newly synthesized compounds by reacting them with aldehydes to form polymers that are easily soluble in various organic solvents was demonstrated.
