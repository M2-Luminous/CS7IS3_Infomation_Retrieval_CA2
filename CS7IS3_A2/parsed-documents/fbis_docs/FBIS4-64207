FBIS4-64207 "drweu084__a94003" FBIS-WEU-94-084-A Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs Agreement Near on Netherlands-German Corps Agreement Near on Netherlands-German Corps 94EN0312 Zurich NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG FERNAUSGABE in German 23 Apr 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94EN0312 Zurich NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG FERNAUSGABE German CSO [Unattributed article: "The German-Netherlands Corps Within Reach; Agreement on the Command Structure and Organization"] [Text] Bonn, 21 Apr--Announced last year as a general plan, the merging of the staff of the German 1st Corps in Muenster with the Netherlands 1st Corps, stationed up to now in Apeldoorn, to form a binational German-Netherlands Army corps in Muenster has progressed to the point that an overall agreement and an implementation agreement have been completed. The first of these agreements is to be signed in The Hague on Friday [22 April] by the two defense ministers, Ruehe and Ter Beek, the second by the German Army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Bagger, and the supreme commander of the Netherlands ground forces, Lt. Gen. Couzy. According to the agreements, the post of the commanding general, his deputy, the chief of staff, and a few other high-ranking officers of the joint corps will rotate regularly between the two armed forces for a period of two to three years. As first commanding general, the present deputy supreme commander of the Netherlands ground forces, Major General Reitsma, will take over command of the corps beginning in October of this year. The corps will achieve operational readiness in the course of the next year in its fully integrated form. The German deputy, however, has yet to be appointed. The Hague Contributes Army Remnants A command support brigade will be assigned directly to the integrated corps staff in Muenster. The staff of the brigade will be stationed on Netherlands territory, presumably in Eibergen, near the border with Germany. The Netherlands Army--which henceforth will no longer have an independent corps staff, and which will achieve this command level, at least initially, through the merging with parts of the German Bundeswehr in the form of the binational corps staff--will contribute the 1st Division to the new structure together with the existing corps troops and the Netherlands brigade stationed in the Lueneburg Heath. Significantly, this integration, in comparison with the original plan, was strengthened even further at the suggestion of the Netherlands. This corps merger represents, de facto, the linking of the remnants of the dismantled Netherlands Army with a part of the German Bundeswehr. Belgium is following a similar path with the assignment of its last Army division to the primarily German-French Eurocorps. Germany will assign primarily the 1st Armored Division to the binational corps. In the new Army structure, this division comprises the three armored infantry brigades 1, 19, and 32, all of which are partially manned. This structure--both on the Netherlands and on the German side--indicates that the troops of the joint corps are being assigned to the main defense forces, which will not grow to their planned authorized defensive strength until there is an appropriate increase in the partially manned units. Special Use in Crises In normal peacetime, Germany will also assign to the joint corps the 6th Armored Infantry Division in Schleswig-Holstein and the 7th Armored Division in Duesseldorf, both of which have been assigned to the 1st Corps. In case of crises or conflicts, a different use if foreseen for both units. The 7th Armored Division, with its two fully manned brigades-the Armored Instruction Brigade 9 and the Armored Brigade 21--belongs in any case to the rapid-deployment crisis-reaction forces and as such forms the principal part of the German contingent for the Allied Rapid-Reaction Corps, NATO's rapid intervention force under British command. On the other hand, according to existing plans the 6th Armored Infantry Division, with its two partially manned brigades--the Armored Infantry Brigade 7 and the Armored Brigade 18--will continue, for the time being, to be under the command of the German-Danish Landjut Corps.
