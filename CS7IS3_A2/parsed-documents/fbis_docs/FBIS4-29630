The regulation on foreign investment continues to generate different opinions even six days after it was announced. Some believe that the regulation has openly "sold out" Indonesia to foreign investors. "We are not yet ready to accept foreign investment to such an extent," they said. The government has stated that the open doors for foreign investment are meant neither to sell out the country nor to serve the interests of a certain group. Nevertheless, the general public is already "scared." This is normal because sectors accessible by foreign investors are vital. They are ports, power production, transmission, and distribution, telecommunications, shipping, aviation, waterworks, railway, atomic energy generation, and even the mass media. On the one hand, this deregulation package is understandable. The government seems to be all out in harnessing the available domestic potential to attract foreign investment. It is hoped that the deregulation package will enable Indonesia to compete with other countries which have opened their doors wider. In this context, Government Regulation No. 20/1994 may also serve as an indicator that the government has begun to feel the constraints of shouldering development expenses by solely relying on domestic funds. On the other hand, however, the deregulation package has led to a very basic question. Is our domestic condition ready for it? First of all, let us see several outstanding domestic economic problems! First, economic sectors are confined to a certain business group. Second, domestic economic players lack competitiveness and the spirit of entrepreneurship. Third, the bureaucracy has yet to set regulations consistently. Fourth, small-scale economic players remain in the backseat. Fifth, the infrastructure is weak. Thus, there are five problems. However, let us discuss just two problems. Economic sectors are confined to a certain business group and small-scale economic players remain in the backseat. Is the domestic economy ready for the influx of foreign investors? Won't there be an economic liberalization that will eventually sacrifice small-scale economic players? One thing is sure. The deregulation (liberalization) package will lead to stronger competition among economic players in the country, and we know that the weak, in this case small-scale economic players, will surely become the victims under a very liberal system. In the meantime, we have yet to enact an anti-monopoly law although such a proposal has been made for several times. In that case, how should we protect our small-scale economic players who are already staggering?
