Under a policy to complete the issue of resuming the inspections of North Korea's facilities as soon as possible, The IAEA is accelerating a final-stage compromise to remove stumbling blocks through a series of working-level contacts with North Korea or through the delivery of documents. The IAEA did not hold a working-level contact with North Korea yesterday, 25 January. Instead it arranged the IAEA's position on the problems revealed at the 24 January working-level contact as an official document and delivered it to the North Korean side. IAEA Spokesman David Kyd revealed that since the IAEA urged the North Korean side to accept full-scope inspections of the seven nuclear facilities on 19 January, opinion difference between the two sides has been somewhat narrowed, thus a little progress has been made. He stressed that he expects that if a series of contacts is held in the future, the stumbling block factor will be completely removed. Spokesman Kyd's remarks are analyzed as while reaffirming the IAEA's position on full-scope inspections of the two key nuclear facilities, the IAEA is assuming a flexible attitude toward the working-level negotiations over the inspection method and scope. In the meantime, diplomatic sources in Vienna pointed out that even though inspections can be conducted early if a final compromise succeeds, considering the recent North Korean Foreign Ministry statement, it is early yet to have an optimistic thought.
