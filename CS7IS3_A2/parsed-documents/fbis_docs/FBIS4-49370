Some say its focus is still Europe, while others say its focus has already switched to the Asia-Pacific region (or East Asia), and still others say its focus is in the process of switching from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region. I would like to express my views on this. Unquestionably, after Clinton assumed office, the U.S. Government laid more emphasis than in the past on strengthening its economic and trade relations with the Asia-Pacific region. To put it more accurately, it will, as some Western academics said, strengthen its economic and trade relations with the East Asian region, where "economic miracles have appeared." The United States has always maintained close relations with Japan, Austria, and Canada, and regarded Japan as an important pillar supporting its Asia policy. In the last few years, East Asia has made rapid economic development, expanded its market, and performed what many Western academics call "East Asian miracles." According to an estimate, the Asian "four small dragons'" GNP's increased by 5.6 percent last year and are expected to increase by 6.5 percent this year; ASEAN's GNP increased by 6.4 percent last year and is expected to increase by 7.2 percent this year. China became the "locomotive of the East Asian economy" and registered a 13.4 percent growth last year. Aiming to "invigorate the U.S economy," the Clinton administration is trying to cure its economic sickness, which has disturbed the United States for a long time, to cope with the ever-intensifying world competition and preserve its leading position in the world. This being the case, the United States of course wants to seize the so-called "newly emerging opportunity" to explore East Asia -- "a market full of vitality" -- and to compete against other developed nations for a favorable position in this market. But in developing economic cooperation with the East Asian region and taking this region as a diplomatic focal point, the United States does not mean to switch its strategic focus from Europe to Asia. Similarly, the United States, Canada, and Mexico have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement and are trying to expand this plan to all of Latin America. This only indicates the U.S. effort to strengthen economic cooperation with American nations and does not mean that the United States wishes to switch its strategic focus from Europe to the American nations. Europe has always served as the corner stone for U.S. strategy. Despite the disintegration of the bi-polar pattern and the Soviet Union, Europe still remains unsettled. As many Western academics point out, Europe is the region with the most developed economic, scientific, and technological foundation in the world; the United States has major economic, political, and strategic security interests in Europe; and Europe is an important investment region for the United States; so to maintain its leading position in the world, the United States, as always, will need the support and cooperation of developed European nations. The end of the Cold War and East-West confrontation has not changed the fact that major U.S. interests are in Europe or that Europe is strategically important to the United States. Moreover, the change in the international situation has caused many new problems and contradictions to become more complicated. The United States and Russia are on guard against each other and suspicious about each other. Examples are a recent exposure of Russian spies in the United States and expulsions of one other's diplomats. A Russian leader said that Russia is a big country, not a small companion. The turbulent political situation in Russia, the deterioration of its economic difficulties, the fluctuations of its reform measures, and, particularly, the growth of extreme nationalists and rightist forces, have all made the United States uneasy. There are many economic, political, and social difficulties in republics of the former Soviet Union and conflicts are serious between these republics, as well as between these republics and Russia. Some of them have resorted to the use of arms. East European nations are facing great internal and external difficulties and unstable situations, fear the reemergence of Russian chauvinism, and are not sure how important the role of their "peaceful partnership" with NATO will be. In addition, since the disappearance of the Soviet Union -- this common enemy -- the coherent force of Western nations, particularly that of NATO, has become tremendously lax, nationalist feelings and the wish for independence are escalating, and differences and conflicts between various NATO countries -- as well as between NATO and the United States -- are increasing along with frictions and contradictions in their economic and trade relations. And following the rapid development of information technology, Western developed countries are facing intense global competition in this field. Following the disintegration of the bi-polar pattern and the emergence of a multipolar world, the previously suppressed and concealed nationalist and religious feelings have strongly risen, broken out, or aggravated ethnic conflicts and clashes, seriously affecting the stability of regional situations and social progress. The ethnic armed clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the so-called "powder keg" of the Balkan peninsula, which is populated with many different nationalities, are particularly intense and cruel. Refugees are flooding developed European regions and are expanding to larger regions. In addition, there are many ethnic problems in Europe and other countries, and because of economic difficulties and serious unemployment, nationalism is rising and rightists' and new fascists' activities are increasing. This has found expression in Russian, German, and Italian elections. The deterioration of ethnic and religious disputes and armed conflicts in Europe's surrounding regions, such as the Middle East, North Africa, and west Asia, has also caused concern. Western newspapers pointed out that most of the explosive points and tense regions in the world are in Europe and its surrounding countries. Viewing all these, we can say that the situation in Europe is not stable. In the present-day world, it is not easy for the United States to maintain a balance and stability between all forces in Europe or to preserve its leading position and strategic interests there. Such being the case, it is quite hard to presume that in the predictable future the United States will switch its strategic focus (including its diplomatic strategic focus) from the turbulent Europe to the comparatively stable Asia-Pacific region or East Asia. Of course, the view that the U.S. strategic focus is still in Europe does not hamper us from assuming that it values and is strengthening economic cooperation with Asia-Pacific or East Asian nations; developing economic cooperation with them will be favorable to strengthening its strategic position in Europe. Even during the previous period of U.S.-Soviet tense confrontation and contention the United States never overlooked the changes in other regions' situations. For the United States, Europe's strategic position is more important than Asia's. Although East Asia is making fast economic development, it is still far behind developed European regions in terms of economic and technological foundation, nor can its capital and personnel be compared with these regions'. For a long time to come, East Asia will not be able to surpass Europe. At present, the United States is strengthening its relations with the Asia-Pacific region, but it is impossible and unnecessary for the United States to switch its strategic focus from Europe to the Asia- Pacific region now. As President Clinton said not long ago, "Europe is still where U.S. interests lie" and the U.S. "security nucleus is still in Europe."
