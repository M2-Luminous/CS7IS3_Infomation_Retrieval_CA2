Ngonhamo has said that the United Nations will be to blame, if war resumes in this country. Gen. Lelio da Silva told NOTICIAS that the United Nations was invited by the government and Renamo to supervise the implementation of the Mozambican peace process, so Gen. Ngonhamo's remarks make no sense whatever. On 7 February, Gen. Ngonhamo said that a resumption of the war would have to be blamed on the United Nations, and in particular on UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello, who has not known how to be impartial when he has mediated in a bid to settle certain differences.
