Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Move Puts Kashmiris on Centre stage"] [Excerpt] Dr. Farooq Abdullah, on the other hand, emphasised the critical relevance of a tranquil Jammu and Kashmir to Indo-Pakistan relations and to the secular traditions of India. In an interview in Geneva to a Pakistani newspaper, THE NATION, Dr. Abdullah said: "Kashmir should be the bridge of friendship between India and Pakistan, not a battleground for their destruction." Asked if the Kashmiris should be held "hostage" to the cause of the Indian Muslims, he said: "When Pakistan was made, did you think about the Indian Muslims or as to the tragedies that might befall them? No. You just took a chunk of India thinking "well, we have got our homeland, let these people go to hell or wherever they have to go. We are not bothered about them." ... "I think I would not like to see the blood of 200 million people on my hands." On whether the future of Indian Muslims would depend on what might happen in Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah said: "The very fact of secular India depends on the crown of India which is Kashmir. The strongest pillar of that (Indian secularism) is Kashmir, whether you like it or whether I like it. It is there and that is what is going to maintain the secular character of India." As for the political future of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah said the existing Line of Actual Control (LAC) should be "made into an international boundary," with both India and Pakistan retaining the portions now under their respective control. He also wanted Pakistan to give to the people of Jammu and Kashmir on its side the same rights that "India is going to give to this part." "That way," according to him, "neither Pakistan will feel defeated nor India." He also expressed readiness to talk to the Kashmiri leaders on the Pakistani side within this framework of ideas. Dr. Abdullah did not wish to make any distinction between Kashmiri Muslims and the Hindus and other religious groups of the State. He also spoke of the "training" given by Pakistan to the Kashmiri youth and of "a number of instances where (the Indian) security forces have lost their control and cool" in dealing with the "terrorists." He did not want the northern territory to be excluded from any settlement of the Indo-Pakistan "territorial dispute" over Kashmir.
