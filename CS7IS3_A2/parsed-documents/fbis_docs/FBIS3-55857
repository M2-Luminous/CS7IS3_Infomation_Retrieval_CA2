More than that, in the past days it provokes military actions on the Armenian-Azeri border. Northern areas of Armenia were shelled in the most barbarous way, the presidential spokesman Aram Abramyan has told the briefing in Yerevan. He has said Azerbaijan has again illusions to solve the problem militarily. Armenia's position is unchanged, the problem cannot be solved militarily, said Abramyan. That is why the Armenian leadership will use every possibility to try to solve the problem politically, said the spokesman. In this connection he said that Armenia backs any peace-keeping initiative in this direction, including the recent initiative proposed by Iran. Out of its two key provisions -- the ceasefire and the status of Nagoro-Karabakh -- Armenia has concentrated on the first one, since only during the ceasefire it is possible to conduct talks on a political status.
