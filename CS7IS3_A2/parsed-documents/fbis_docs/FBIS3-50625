According to Decree No. 1834, engineer Miguel Horacio Gini Espinola was appointed today as Antelco board of directors chairman, replacing Colonel Eduardo Yasuo Kishi Ichikawa, a general staff school graduate, who tendered his resignation from the post. As a matter of fact, these changes within Antelco further aggravated the already tense relations between President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and [Colorado Party President] Blas N. Riquelme. It was reported that the Colorado Party president challenged the removal of his brother-in-law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the Antelco board of directors. It was reported that Colorado Party President Blas N. Riquelme went to Government Palace to visit the president of the Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and to challenge the removal of his brother-in- law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the Antelco board of directors. This is the first time that I have left worried after an audience with the president of the Republic, the Colorado Party leader said. [Begin recording] [Riquelme] We will discuss it. I will hold a news conference at the appropriate time. [Unidentified reporter] What did the president tell you? [Riquelme] No. I am telling you that I left worried. [Reporter] Would you resign? [Riquelme] Within the next few hours I will know what I will do (?to be able to) ... [Indistinct questions by several unidentified reporters who speak at the same time] [Riquelme] We will see. We will see. [Reporter] Was your resignation requested? [Riquelme] Thank you very much. No. That is all. [Reporter] For party reasons? [Riquelme] Party reasons. [Reporter] Party issues? [Riquelme] Party issues. [Reporter] Was your resignation requested? Will you resign as party president? [end recording] After talking with Riquelme at his residence, [Colorado Deputy] Ismael Echague explained the tense atmosphere and the concern over the tense relations between the president of the Republic and the Colorado Party president. [Begin Echague recording] I am aware that there actually have been some setbacks. A request had been made, had been sent to the executive branch by the Colorado Party executive board president, Mr. Blas N. Riquelme. This request was not satisfactorily dispatched by the executive branch. Therefore, this caused the Colorado Party president's personal anger and prompted the drawing up of a communique that will be released within the next few hours. [end recording] Nevertheless, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stressed that there are no problems over the changes made at Antelco. He said he just exercised his constitutional rights to remove government officials and that his government is far from being dictatorial. [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] Blas N. said this. In his speech, he said ... [Wasmosy, interrupting] That is his business. I just exercised my rights, to which a president is entitled. That's it. [Reporter] What did you specifically do, Mr. President? [Wasmosy] Nothing, gentlemen. [Reporter] What was Mr. Blas N. Riquelme's attitude? [Wasmosy] Ask him. [Reporter] There has been talk that you removed his brother-in-law, Blas N. Riquelme's brother-in-law, Luis Yanez, Mr. Yanez. [Wasmosy] Well now, I can do ...[changes thought] I believe I can reorganize all the organizations using my criterion. I am our country's administrator. [Reporter] But Blas N. Riquelme asked you not to remove him. [Wasmosy] Ask him. [Reporter] Deputy Ismael Echague said a dictatorship is hatching at Government Palace. [Wasmosy] This is Ismael Echague's business, miss. [laughs] The government is far from being dictatorial. Well now, good-bye. [end recording] Concerning this issue, we must report that the news conference announced by Ismael Echague never materialized, although there have been successive meetings. A meeting is now being held at the Colorado Party president's house. Present at this meeting are other Colorado Party executive board members like Dr. Diogenes Martinez, Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, National Republican Association [ANR -- Colorado Party] legislators, and ANR grass-roots leaders. Let's wait for developments.
