FR940111-1-00032 FR940111-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Part 9 [Notice No. 787 and 93F&hyph;022P] RIN 1512&hyph;AA07 Seiad Valley Viticultural Area AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is considering the establishment of a viticultural area located in Siskiyou County, California, to be known as ``Seiad Valley.'' This proposal is the result of a petition filed by Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad Valley Vineyards. ATF believes that the establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising allows wineries to designate the specific areas where the grapes used to make the wine were grown and enables consumers to better identify the wines they purchase. DATES: Written comments must be received by March 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to: Chief, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, P.O. Box 50221, Washington, DC 20091&hyph;0221, Attn: Notice No. 787. Copies of written comments received in response to this notice of proposed rulemaking will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at: ATF Reference Library, Office of Public Affairs and Disclosure, room 6300, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marjorie D. Ruhf, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising of wine. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, providing for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), title 27, CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include: (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition; (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on features which can be found on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the boundaries prominently marked. Petition ATF has received a petition from Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad Valley Vineyards proposing to establish a viticultural area in Siskiyou County, California, to be known as ``Seiad Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is located in northwestern California, about 15 miles south of the Oregon border. It contains approximately 2160 acres, of which approximately 2.5 acres are planted to vineyards. Seiad Valley Vineyards is the only commercial grower and the only wine producer currently active within the proposed viticultural area. Evidence of Name Evidence that the name of the proposed area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition includes:
