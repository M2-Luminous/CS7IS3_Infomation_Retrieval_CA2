Shumeyko said that during the forthcoming visit the Russian premier is expected to sign a package of documents that are of importance for the development of cooperation between the two countries. This subject was also the focus of a meeting here on Monday between the Russian parliamentarians and Professor Lyuben Berov, chairman of Bulgaria's Council of Ministers. Special attention was devoted to matters connected with settling the two countries' mutual debts. The two sides believe that it is now essential to approach this problem "in an unprejudiced way and find a mutually acceptable compromise", Shumeyko said. Military-technical cooperation, including that between defence industry enterprises, was discussed as well. The two sides agreed that one should now renounce primitive forms of perestroyka-period cooperation, barter in particular, and move on to civilised forms acceptable throughout the world.
