Addressing in Tbilisi Friday the conference of the Union of Georgian Citizens, he said that the signed agreements would provide results shortly. Shevardnadze called groundless the fears by certain forces in Russia and Georgia that the treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries may destabilize the situation in the North Caucasus. The Georgian leader said that the treaty had been signed for a ten year period, and if one of the sides did not demand its annulment, it would be extended automatically. Speaking about the possible creation in Georgia of Russian military bases, Shevardnadze said that the problem was not yet solved. At the talks, he said, the two sides only agreed on forming expert teams to consider the problem. Answering the question on circumstances behind the death Thursday in Tbilisi of deputy Georgian Defense Minister Niko Kekelidze, the Georgian leader said that the act of terrorism (Kekelidze died following an explosion in his house) was not committed for political reasons. Organized crime is behind the murder. Speaking about the resignation of Georgian Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili, Shevardnadze said that he would meet him and ask him to explain the reasons.
