Correspondent Emir Avdakovic, reporting from Bugojno on the situation in the past 24 hours, says that "Bugojno is a veritable hell, as the city is pulverized by dozens of the most destructive howitzer and tank shells. From their lairs in the mountains encircling Bugojno, particularly from the direction of Kupres, the chetniks are continuing to shell the town. The fervor with which they are doing this is proportional to their failures in direct clashes with the members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army who have courageously and effectively repelled the enemy's attempts at infantry breakthroughs, with a further 15 chetniks being killed in the process. I say further, because in recent clashes on the Bugojno front over 60 chetniks were killed. According to reliable information, chaos rules in their ranks. The members of the UN Protection Force's British Battalion stationed in Bugojno have witnessed all this. For the time being, they are silently observing from their armored personnel carriers the horrors that the citizens of Bugojno are being forced to endure. This morning the town was once again shelled and the general alarm remains in force." Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "throughout the night, the Serbian aggressor used artillery and tanks to shell the Bihac and Cazin areas. The attacks were particularly fierce after 2300 and in the early morning hours, when they shelled the town centers and the roads linking Bihac and Cazin. The aggressor is obviously employing a new strategy of shelling civilian targets in those periods when there is less chance of NATO planes patrolling the skies over Bihac. The situation on the defense lines remains the same with the chetniks continuing their bestial attacks, alternating artillery and infantry attacks. Actually, there is not a single inch of the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac that has not been hit by several shells overnight and in the early morning hours. [Words indistinct] the Serbian aggressor has been sporadically attacking in the theater of operations of the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council on the Pljesivica part of the front, where snipers are particularly active this morning, while the area of Skoce has come under artillery attack. All the defense lines are firm and stable. [Abdic's] paramilitary forces have not been quiet overnight and this morning. They are attacking the defenders with all (?available means) in the areas of Krivaja, Leskovac, and Trs [words indistinct]."
