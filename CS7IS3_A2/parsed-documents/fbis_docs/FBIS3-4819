It had become only too obvious that Serbia had become both arrogant and complacent. Months of a varied conduct perpetrated against Bosnian Muslims had gone unchecked. In fact, many were becoming quite cynical of the U.S. because of its slow reactions to Serbian aggressions. Malaysia was among the first group of nations that broke off diplomatic links with Serbia. At the same time, the Malaysian community has been providing both moral and material support for the harassed Bosnians. Now a unit of the Malaysian armed forces is with the UN Protection Force in Bosnia. It is, therefore, not surprising that all factions of the Malaysian community have voiced full support for the action taken by the Atlantic alliance. If anything, the feeling is that this type of retaliation with military force should have been launched much earlier. The Serbs have only themselves to blame if the fighting escalates. Their horrendous ethnic-cleansing policy is nothing less than genocide. It is totally unprecedented in modern times. A small religious minority was singled out. The Bosnian Muslims have had to cope with the trauma of homelessness, starvation, and mass rape. The situation has been so bad that a special tribunal was set up to try the war crimes. A Malaysian judge is a member of the tribunal. The NATO shooting of the Serbs' planes represents a new stage in the Bosnian crisis. It should cause the Serbs in Belgrade and outside it to face reality. To try to force a solution through military means is going to be counter-productive. Everyone knows that the political situation in the former Yugoslavia is very messy and complicated. There are various issues to be settled. They are not unique to Yugoslavia. Many multi-ethnic nations have been able to work out reasonable solutions for their internal governments. Wherever the give-and- take spirit has been prominent, a stable order has emerged. What the Serb leaders did was to grab as much territory as possible forcibly. They have so far only paid lip service to negotiations. Serbian propaganda has not hesitated to claim that the planes shot down by the NATO aircraft were somebody else's. The world will know how much credibility to attach to this story. The UN troops serving under difficult conditions in Bosnia will be greatly encouraged by the use of air power. For thousands of Bosnian Muslims, too, this action will be a great morale booster. Everyone hopes that the Serb leadership will draw the obvious conclusion. No one wants to see an escalation of the fighting. The Serbs must accept peaceful solutions for all problems.
