The reporter said: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in February 1974, 20 years ago, proclaimed modelling the whole society on the chuche idea as the supreme programme of our party with his scientific insight into the mature requirement of our developing revolution which had entered a new stage and into the process of development of the world socialist movement. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "...It is a completely mature requirement to dye the whole society in one idea, the revolutionary idea of the leader under the present condition of our country." The reporter pointed out: A new guiding idea was required by the new historic era in which the popular masses had presented themselves as masters of history and their destiny and the revolutionary struggle of the popular masses for socialism had entered a new stage. It had become the desire of the revolutionary people of the world and urgent requirement of the times to build socialist and communist society with the chuche idea of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as the guiding idea of revolution and under its banner. This demand of the times concerning the destiny of the socialist and communist cause was fully met when the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il scientifically formulated the revolutionary idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaimed it as the guiding idea of revolution in our era. The revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is, in a word, a system of the idea, theory and method of chuche. The characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song which distinguishes it from the preceding revolutionary theories of the working class, is that its quintessence is the great chuche idea, the first of its kind in the history of human thought, and it systematizes the revolutionary theory and the method of leadership in an integral way on its basis. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expounded that the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, different from the preceding revolutionary ideas of the working class which were the combination of separate doctrines, gives answers to all the theoretical and practical questions of revolution and construction, proceeding from one man-centered philosophical principle and one basic idea of respect for humanity. This is an immortal exploit in that he elucidated the fundamental characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song and its absolute superiority to the preceding revolutionary ideas of the working class. Comrade Kim Chong-il, formulating the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, scientifically expounded that his revolutionary idea is an encyclopedic revolutionary idea containing theories of all fields of transforming nature, society and man and all stages of revolution and construction. Thus it has been convincingly proved that the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is a flawless communist revolutionary theory leading the revolution and construction of our era to victory and an almighty treasured sword which should be tightly held in the whole course of the revolutionary struggle to realise the independence of the popular masses. Comrade Kim Chong-il, after proclaiming the great chuche idea as the guiding idea of the times, set it forth as a great programme of communist construction to dye the whole society in one idea, the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song. The programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is a programme of communist construction to remould man, reform society and remake nature as required by the chuche idea and thus build and complete communist society which is based on the chuche idea and to which it is fully applied. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was the first in history to define the course of socialist and communist construction as a course of embodying the revolutionary idea of the leader and dying society in the revolutionary idea of the leader by proclaiming the programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea. The proclamation of the programme is a scientific discovery that socialist and communist society is, in essence, a society in which the independence of the popular masses has been fully realised and, at the same time, the whole of it is singleheartedly united. With the proclamation of the programme by Comrade Kim Chong-il, it has become clear that socialist and communist society is a society in which the independence of the popular masses has been completely realised in all fields of social life and that the strategic target of socialist and communist construction is to occupy the ideological and political fortress and the material fortress by remaking nature, reforming society and remoulding man to meet the demand of the popular masses for independence. Thus the limitation of the preceding theory that communism can be realised only if the material wealth is increased by developing productive forces was overcome and the unreasonableness and reactionary essence of the view of the modern revisionists who pursued only "material prosperity" was exposed and refuted. At the same time, the programme clarified that socialist and communist society is a society of singlehearted unity all members of which are closely united as comrades to form a socio-political organism. The programme is a programme of singlehearted unity which fully embodies and consummates the unique idea and revolutionary stand on dying the whole society in the chuche idea to make it a community of destiny whose members are united around the leader with comradely love and revolutionary obligation on the basis of the idea of the leader. For this the banner of singlehearted unity is a great revolutionary banner which firmly guarantees the victory of socialist and communist construction. It is, indeed, the immortal exploits of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il which will shine through generations with the advance of history and the eternal treasure of the chuche cause that, by scientifically formulating the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaiming the programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea, he exalted the revolutionary idea of the great leader as the guiding idea of the age of independence and opened a true way of building socialism and communism in which the independence of the popular masses will have been completely realised on the basis of the chuche idea. The reporter noted that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the struggle of our people to materialize the programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea. He said: What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has led the socialist cause of our people to victory under the banner of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is, first of all, that he made clear the essence of socialism and the law of its realisation and has turned our socialism into socialism of chuche. By studying socialism centering on the popular masses by applying the chuche idea, he overcame the limitation of the preceding socialist idea and theory attaching decisive significance to economic necessity by placing economic relations in the center and clarified that socialism is not only a society where social equality prevails, free from exploitation and oppression of man by man, but also a society where the popular masses lead an independent and creative life suitable to the intrinsic character of social human beings, firmly united in comradeship as the common masters of the state and society. After establishing the scientific idea and theory on socialism centering on the popular masses, he has successfully applied this great idea and has wisely led the struggle to remould and develop man, economy, culture and all other sectors of social life under the banner of the three revolutions, ideoligical, technical and cultural, to suit the nature of socialist society. What holds a brilliant place in his great exploits in leading the socialist cause of our people to victory under the banner of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is also that he expounded a new revolutionary idea on the formula of building socialism and has decisively turned the chuche style, the Korean style into a universal revolutionary formula of our times. He, making it his motto of revolution to establish chuche, put forward the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own way" and successfully applied the unique idea of carrying on revolution our own way and creditably fulfilled the historic tasks raised by the socialist movement of our times. Embodied in our style, the chuche style are man-centered chuche philosophy, politics centering on the popular masses, our people's consciousness of national independence and national self-confidence. He, with the faith and will of chuche, has built the party our own way, built the state by our own faith and developed politics, economy and culture our own way. This is why the socialism of our country is being built and developed by our people's own efforts, not by imitation of other countries nor by instructions or pressure of someone, and is making a long drive as invincible socialism unshakable and indestructible in any political storm of the world. What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the dear leader is also that he has remarkably strengthened and developed the political forces of revolution and the Armed Forces. He gave precedence to firmly building the party organisationally and ideologically in leading the revolution and construction and has strengthened the people's power and enhanced its function and role in every way. It is an outstanding exploit of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander, and a shining fruition of his chuche-based military idea and commanding art that he, as a peerless brilliant commander, has built up our People's Army into the army of the leader, the army of the party whose lifeblood is loyalty to the party and the leader and has strengthened and developed it into each-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed Forces capable of defeating any aggressor. What holds a brilliant place in his exploits is also that he has established an orderly scientific theory on the inheritance and completion of the socialist cause on the basis of the revolutionary outlook on the leader and given a steadfast continuity to the vitality of our revolution. He defined it as an important task concerning the destiny of socialism to correctly resolve the issue of succeeding the socialist cause and gave a most correct answer to this by studying the course of starting and developing the socialist cause with the leader in the center for the first time in history, on the basis of his scientific analysis of the practical experiences of the Korean revolution and the historic lessons of the socialist movement. It is thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker and theoretician produced by mankind that our party has become a great party with the immortal guiding idea of the completion of the revolutionary cause of chuche, our motherland has become a glorious country glorifying the guiding idea of the times generation after generation and our people have become a great people who are building socialism and communism along a most straight road. The reporter in conclusion laid stress on adding shine to our-style socialism centering on the popular masses by thoroughly implementing the programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea and upholding with loyalty the idea and leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order to reunify the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche.
