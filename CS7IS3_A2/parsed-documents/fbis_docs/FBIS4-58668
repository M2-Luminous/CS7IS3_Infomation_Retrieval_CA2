FBIS4-58668 "drnes088_j_94004" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Kuwait Officials Said Concerned Over Austrian, Iraqi Contacts Officials Said Concerned Over Austrian, Iraqi Contacts LD0505135694 Kuwait KUNA in Arabic 1057 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505135694 Kuwait KUNA Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Vienna, 5 May (KUNA) -- Austrian economic and trading circles have received warnings from Kuwait that the contacts between certain trading and industrial companies in Austria and other European states and the Iraqi regime may have a negative effect on the future of cooperation between Kuwait in particular and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general with those companies. A well-informed Austrian source told KUNA here today that Kuwaiti officials have expressed deep concern over the contacts between some Austrian companies and a delegation from the Iraqi Ba'th Party which visited Austria recently under the leadership of former ambassador 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, the director of foreign affairs in the Ba'th party. The source also said that Kuwait is closely following these contacts and officials consider that "the relevant Austrian and other European companies are in breach of the international sanctions imposed on Iraq" at a time when the Iraqi regime is not committing itself to implementing the UN resolutions as a condition for lifting the economic sanctions imposed on it since it occupied Kuwait in 1990. Kuwaiti officials do not rule out the possibility of interrupting cooperation with those companies if they continue their contacts and cooperation with the Iraqi regime before it implements all the UN resolutions.
