Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry European Affairs Department, today told PRENSA LATINA that this conclusion was reached during the negotiations held by the two parties to resolve the situation triggered by those who illegally entered the house. Over 100 people have been inside the residence for more than 40 hours. They are attempting to pressure Belgian diplomats to request their departure from the country. Today, Paul Vermkirsch, leader of the Belgian delegation in Cuba, who has refused to give statements to the media, went to the Foreign Ministry and met with officials from the European Affairs Department and from other Foreign Ministry departments. PRENSA LATINA has discovered that in addition to ratifying the Cuban position of refusing to accept the use of force against foreign delegations in Cuba as a means to leave the country, the purpose of the meetings was to reach a common position on the illegality of the move. Meanwhile, it was also agreed that once they leave the residence, those who want to travel to Belgium, or any other nation, must start the official procedures to obtain visas. Rodriguez explained that the Foreign Ministry advised the Belgian ambassador that it will not refuse to help the Belgian legation acquire supplies needed to take care of the unexpected guests. Meanwhile, residents of the Havana neighborhood of Miramar, where the Belgian ambassador's residence is located, told PRENSA LATINA that early this morning, one person who was inside the residence decided to leave and went home without being intimidated by local authorities. A discreet police surveillance is under way in the area without interrupting the normal movement of vehicles and people, as well as the presence of journalists and news photographers in the area.
