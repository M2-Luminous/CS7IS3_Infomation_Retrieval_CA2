FBIS4-27349 "dreas105__a94030" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 9 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Ministries Grappling With `Green GDP' Concept Ministries Grappling With `Green GDP' Concept 942A0252A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 May 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0252A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The study work on a "green GDP" [gross domestic product] indicating the monetary cost to the environment such as destruction of the environment or loss of resources is having rough sailing. Three ministries and agencies, the Environment Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, and the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], have been doing joint research in a three-year program since fiscal 1992, but they are still no further than "the study stage" (EPA). The prospects are that preparation of a specific proposal will be slipped to next fiscal year or thereafter. The main cause is that many elements must be considered in the worsening of the environment such as atmosphere, water quality, and soil, and the calculation has become complicated. Also in the background is the fact that attention has been diverted to economic growth with the prolonged sluggish economy, and concern about environment issues is waning. The green GDP also is called the "environment economic calculation" and it reckons the monetary cost of environmental pollution or the extent of environmental destruction and the outlay it will require to preserve the environment. This is checked against the GDP proper as the cost to the environment and the aim is to see the relationship between economic growth and preservation of the environment. The reason the study work has not progressed is due to the many items comprising the green GDP. For example, if there were tropical rain forests where the chief problem was felling of forests, the cost to the environment would be easily calculated. However, the economy of an advanced nation like Japan embraces many problems linked to worsening of the environment such as various kinds of pollution, waste materials, fluorocarbon gas exhaust, or reduction of resources, and it is difficult to see or determine what the cost is. The progress of technology also has been swift on reutilization of resources and pollution prevention, and is making it difficult to decide on the scope of calculations.
