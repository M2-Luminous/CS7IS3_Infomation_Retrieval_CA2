FBIS4-60495 "drnes102_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi Interviewed on Current Concerns Al-Qadhdhafi Interviewed on Current Concerns PM2505151594 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 25 May 94 p 6 PM2505151594 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Interview with Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given] [Text] [AL-HAYAH] Your Excellency, Colonel, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the revolution, 25 years on from the revolution, do you believe you have succeeded, and in what area? [Al-Qadhdhafi] That is a traditional question which is put to me every year. [AL-HAYAH] No, the 25th anniversary of the revolution is different... [Al-Qadhdhafi] No. The question was put to me on the 24th, 20th, and 10th anniversaries. Of course, the event that occurred 25 years ago in Libya had been shaped and decided by us since 1959 on the basis of the philosophy for which the revolution was launched. The aim was to bring about a turning point in the history of mankind. And we are determined to bring about a new era like that of the French revolution, which initiated the era bourgeois republics. We decided that the al-Fatih [1 September] revolution would end the era of republics and launch the people's jamahiriyat [of masses]. From our serious analysis of history, we can expect results, proceeding from the available factors. This is why we announced that the era of the masses would begin, and nationalities would triumph, and that there would be a conflict among nationalities. And that the states comprised of several nationalities would break up. We expected that before the separation in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. And we still expect the collapse of the United States. The United States consists of a mosaic of conflicting pieces. It will not hold together in the era of the masses. The blacks will become independent, the Red Indians will become independent, the whites will become independent, and so will the other minorities. And a civil war could begin in the United States one day like in Lebanon if no American takes the initiative like Gorbachev to grant the peoples of the United States their independence, hence conducting the separation peacefully, as happened in the Soviet Union. But to cling to the domination of Washington, the White House, the CIA, the National Security Council, and the major companies... all these are nightmares which will lead to a rebellion, and hence to bloody separation. That is, unless someone forestalls events, allowing these peoples to become independent, as happened in the Soviet Union. It is another prophecy which will come about in the future. We had said that the Soviet Union, which consisted of several nationalities, would collapse. There is now one state about which no one is talking, that is the United States. We say that the United States will break up peacefully or through war. I mean that the Libyan revolution is a revolution of a new prophecy and new vision for mankind which we cannot judge on the basis of what has happened in Libya. Its results will emerge in decades and centuries, and after generations. It will then be said that the al-Fatih revolution was the historic turning point. The early sign was the emergence of the revolution of originality, that is fundamentalism, which spread and was exploited and distorted, turning it into bullets and oppression... But at the beginning we launched this cry, namely that the south must advance toward the north, and that the fringes must advance toward the center, which should be destroyed. And that the oppressed should climb onto the stage. And that purity should begin from the desert. And that originality should be revived and whatever is alien abandoned. We announced the revolution of originality and fundamentalism. Analysts believe it was us who sparked off this revolution. The important factor for the Libyan revolution is laying the foundation for the era of the masses, that is, the establishment of people's power. There is now for the first time a state run without a government, without a president, without a king, and without a regular army. It is run through the people's committees and congresses. Whatever arrogant, ignorant, absurd, and spiteful people say to undermine that, it is an irrefutable fact, namely that Libya is the cornerstone of a new era called the era of the masses and the jamahiri system, represented in the people's congresses and the people's self-government. This is what Bakunin and Proudhon tried to achieve. Even before Marx there were philosophers like al-Razi and al-Mu'tazilah [group of Muslims applying logic] who dreamt of achieving what has just now been achieved. [AL-HAYAH] What is preoccupying you most these days? [Al-Qadhdhafi] At the national level, we are preoccupied with the current confrontation between a small country and a small people, that is, the Libyan people, and three major states, all of which are nuclear and Christian states. Libya is a Muslim state and they are imperialist states which have the right of veto (in the Security Council). And they have atomic bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact that we are very busy with the confrontation with three oppressive, arrogant, insolent, and tyrannical states. At the pan-Arab level, we are preoccupied with the fact that no one has torn down the raised slogan, that is, the Arabs' unconditional surrender. All that is happening, beginning with Madrid through Oslo, falls under this slogan, that is, the Arabs' unconditional surrender. Because in view of the Arab defeat, the Arab collapse, the tyranny of the Western states protecting the Israelis, and the nonexistence of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, no negotiations will be in the Arabs' interests. In fact they will mean capitulation. It is their opportunity to impose capitulation on the Arabs. All that is being talked about -- like Gaza and Jericho, land for peace, and the Golan... all this falls under the slogan that the Arabs must surrender unconditionally and immediately so that the existing balances will not be upset thereby allowing the Arabs to raise their heads. At the international level, we are preoccupied with that international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth -- which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what imperialism is doing. [AL-HAYAH] So you are totally opposed to what the Palestinians have done so far? [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is not like that. We are looking for a radical solution to the Palestinian issue. The only peaceful radical solution is the South African model. If they want to solve the Palestinian issue, let them follow the South African model -- which means the Palestinian people's return and free elections under UN supervision for both the Palestinians and the Jews, then a democratic Palestinian state would be established. Without that there is no solution. Proof of this is that the fighting is still continuing, because Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] does not represent all the Palestinians. What we hear on the news, namely that the PLO has signed an agreement with Israel is untrue. It is not the PLO; it is Fatah. Even in Fatah there is a big split. The agreement took place with the Fatah chairman and his group. They give him Gaza and Jericho, because they fit their measure. The agreement with the PLO will be on the scale of Palestine [as a whole]. [AL-HAYAH] Did Abu-'Ammar not contact you? Did you not tell him your opinion openly? [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is an ordinary relationship. He contacts us and sends messages to put us in the picture. But our position is clear. We support the Palestinian people's return and the recovery of their rights. We do not support the Gaza and Jericho accord. [AL-HAYAH] What about Algeria? Is it not preoccupying you? [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, regrettably, France is currently taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United States are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is backed primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The Mosad, French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the murder, financing, training, and armament operations, so that Algeria would pay the price for its independence and rebellion against France. That is what is happening in Algeria. [AL-HAYAH] How can you help Algeria? [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, that is a worry.... If the aggression was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But as long as the Algerians are fighting one another inside the country, no one can do anything except offering advice and kind words. They [not further identified] are also trying to get Egypt to pay the price for its war against the Israelis, the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and its leadership of the Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price for that, because the Americans, the West, and the Israelis consider Egypt the archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy Egypt. There is a truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace. They want to exploit this truce to destroy Egypt so that it will be under Israel's heel. [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the Libyan issue and the blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is possible? [Al-Qadhdhafi] If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, there are solutions proposed which are very feasible and which will save face for all the parties. But if the Western states have another objective, then the attempts are improper and we would be facing a state of colonialism and insolence. And thus we should prepare ourselves for a confrontation and a war which the enemy should lose or not win. If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily in accordance with the formulas being proposed. All international organizations and the world as a whole support Libya. The three states are isolated, exposed, and lack even a fig leaf to cover their nakedness before the world with regard to the Lockerbie issue and the Libyan position. If their objective is colonialist, then in this case we are facing a new colonialist attempt and we will fight. [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the proposed solutions, is there anything new and practical? [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, there is a proposal from the Arab League and from international jurists, namely that a Scottish court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for example. And that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab League and then to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This is the latest solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan solution or a Libyan proposal. It is a proposal made by international jurists, espoused by the Arab League, and supported by the world as a whole. [AL-HAYAH] What is the fate of all the weapons in your possession? Can you look after and service them? You purchased large quantities of weapons.... [Al-Qadhdhafi] It has become clear that we were not wrong when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time has shown that Libya is a target for aggression. One day al-Sadat was against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri was against us, and Hissein Habre was against us. France and the United States fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And Niger's Kountche was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us from the sea. And we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest states in the world, that is the United States and Britain. Our children were killed while asleep in their homes. It has become clear that we were right when we purchased the weapons and that we were targeted by an oppressive and direct aggression, and that we were entitled to have weapons to defend ourselves. The biggest danger threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of atomic bombs and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed against Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states. It is a very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and the United States and the West are refusing to talk to the Israelis about them or to deprive them of this weapon. While the United States continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. As for the Israelis, they are exempt from the pursuit, punishment, and questioning. They are above international law. They are above Chapter VII of the UN Charter. If the Security Council decides a punishment for Israel, the United States uses its right of veto. Actually we are faced with a very serious situation: An adversary state is exempt from punishment and from Chapter VII of the UN Charter, is above international law, and is entitled to own any weapon of mass destruction, and no one questions it about anything. They pursued us because of a pharmaceutical plant until they ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why do they not pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of atomic bombs and who have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? [AL-HAYAH] You have helped numerous allies since the revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned against you, and who has been able to help you during the blockade period? [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, all those we helped support us, each according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in the world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics and heads of state. The West used to say that these are terrorist camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads of state and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in Namibia, or the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique... all of them had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to call them terrorists. [AL-HAYAH] Who has actually offered help since the blockade began? [Al-Qadhdhafi] All peoples are sympathizing with us. But the international arrogance represented in the United States and the Western states is terrifying the world and the peoples. Nevertheless, the world as a whole is sympathizing with the Libyan people. [AL-HAYAH] In Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's view, what is left of the Arab unity idea, especially in view of what is happening in Yemen? [Al-Qadhdhafi] Indeed what is happening in Yemen is a sinister event and gives a bad impression. Regionalism has been consolidated until regional states have replaced nations. We now hear about the Kuwaiti nation, the Tunisian nation, and the Mauritanian nation.... It is amazing for regionalism to be perpetuated among Arabs to such an extent. What we aspire to now is an Arab unity that achieves an economic unity and defense unity, and let the petty states enjoy their regimes and systems: The kingdom as a kingdom, the sultanate as a sultanate, the emirate as an emirate, and the republic as a republic. But in the end there has to be a union for the Arab nation -- a union that achieves economic unity and defense unity. Even the nature of the age now does not prompt a move toward centralism, but, rather, toward localism and the grassroots. [AL-HAYAH] So you still believe in unity? [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is a necessity, not a triviality. Without it, there is no future for any Arab state. [AL-HAYAH] What would you say to the Yemeni brothers? [Al-Qadhdhafi] Frankly, as a revolutionary, I am against sick stability in the Arab homeland. To me, explosions are better in order to change the stagnant situation. The Arab land is plundered and should become hot so that it will not be plundered again. As a revolutionary, I am against sick stability, futile stability. Instability is better than having an Arab state that is subservient to the West and Israel. However, as a revolutionary, I am not concerned over what is happening in Yemen.... This is from a revolutionary angle. But politically, the battle must be settled quickly in favor of Yemen's unity and without further bloodshed. [AL-HAYAH] Are you in touch with officials there? [Al-Qadhdhafi] We are in constant contact with them. With regard to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, he always contacts me, appealing that it is better that Yemen should not drown in war and blood. As for the brothers in the north, they say that the only solution is Aden's surrender in the name of Yemen's unity. They proceed from the premise that there is one state which has a president and a capital. I believe that what is happening in Yemen now is an internal affair, as there is no longer two states. It is an internal issue. [AL-HAYAH] Which view do you support more? [Al-Qadhdhafi] Unity and the revolution, of course. [AL-HAYAH] A final question regarding those describing themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you say to them? [Al-Qadhdhafi] I say that with the establishment of people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose whom? The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his homeland. If there is a rational person who really has a political opinion, and his opinion is successful, he has the opportunity to join the people's congresses and to include his opinion on the people's congresses' agenda. If the congresses are convinced of this opinion, they will implement it. If they do not, they will discard it. If there is really a person who is useful for the homeland, the people's congresses are his opportunity. If there is a ruling party, he could say that he has no opportunity because the party is not giving the opportunity to apply his ideas. The same applies if there was a ruler ruling the country. But since the people are ruling through the people's congresses and the people's committees, it is his opportunity to join the people's congresses. I believe that it is not possible for anyone of them to oppose, because the people are the ruler. There is no possibility of opposition at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are miserable. Most of them are businessmen. A large number of them returned, carrying catalogs and business contacts from which we have benefited. They enter and leave the country after they realized that matters are different. They laughed at the conditions they had been in. Even people who used to attack us over the radio came and laughed at their previous conditions, admitting they had been miserable and their statements were unreasonable. They told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when they entered the country... Anyone who wants to return can return, and anyone who repents is forgiven. God accepts repentance, so shouldn't human beings do the same. Anyone who repents enters the country safely. As for anyone who does not repent, his only option is to become an agent for foreign intelligence, and this is what has happened. One escaped after stealing the people's money and another escaped to avoid military service and national service.... These cases do not represent opposition. Opposition takes place when there is colonialism in the country, when there is dictatorship or exploitation.... This is opposition. But when the people have the power, foreigners expelled, and the homeland and the people are free, what do you call those who escaped? Miserable. They are informers for U.S. intelligence. They say things against their own people and their own homeland, like hit Libya, boycott Libyan oil, or attack Libya. What does this incitement mean? It means that intelligence services tell them: say this. So they say it. They do not even merit a question being put about them.
