FR940902-0-00053 FR940902-0-00010 For most States, the existing allowable cost guidelines of the Governor already meet the requirements of this paragraph and few, if any, changes are necessary. All States should review their current allowable cost guidelines and ensure that each of the 16 listed cost items are treated consistently, as well as any other cost items for which the Governor thinks consistent treatment is necessary. A commenter raised the question about whether the regulatory requirement would be met if the OMB Circulars on Cost Principles were adopted. The Department agrees that all 16 cost items would be covered if the Circulars were adopted. The Department cautions, however, that: (1) It does not intend to approve or disapprove any prior approval requests, as required by the Circulars, and (2) the OMB Circulars contain restrictive requirements in areas in which States, SDA's, and SSG's may desire greater flexibility, e.g., staff compensation, fees/profits, fund-raising. Administrative Cost Pools Section 627.440(a) is amended in the final rule to add language on cost pools. Section 627.440(f) of the interim final rule required that costs charged initially to a JTPA administrative cost pool (ACP) be allocated, for JTPA Federal reporting purposes, to the benefitting programs based on the benefits received by each program. The Department recognized that this language represented a departure from previously established policy on the manner in which pooled administrative costs could be reported. Commenters were requested to identify the impact, if any, of the revised requirement to allocate pooled administrative costs solely on the basis of ``benefits received''. Many commenters responded to the provisions of this paragraph. Most of the responses fell into one of three groups. One group viewed the ACP language as effectively prohibiting ACP's by requiring detailed time distribution or some type of cost allocation process for each item of joint administrative cost. These commenters thought the new requirements involved too much recordkeeping, were an unreasonable burden, inefficient, illogical, and went beyond the requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;87. A second group expressed concerns about the effect of the ACP requirement on the administrative cost limitations for each program and that they would lose their ability to ensure cost limits are not exceeded. They were also concerned programs would be overexpended. A few commenters stated that there are not enough administrative funds available for EDWAA at the State level to absorb its share of costs. The third group of commenters made suggestions that included going back to the old regulatory language, which allowed ``true cost pools'', specifying that using direct expenditures was an acceptable methodology, and requiring application of A&hyph;87 principles. One commenter suggested eliminating any mention of ACP's in the regulations and, instead, requiring JTPA entities to follow GAAP and section 108(a) of the Act. In addition, a few commenters requested guidance on the use of intake cost pools. Several commenters raised questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B administrative costs at the State level. Several commenters also raised questions about the ``benefits received'' language of paragraph (a) in ยง627.440, which requires all JTPA costs to be charged to the benefitting programs and cost categories based on benefits received. That language has been a part of the JTPA regulations since the inception of the program. A few commenters recommended that this paragraph should specifically allow cost pools. The ACP language contained in ยง627.440(f) of the interim final rule was not intended to eliminate the use of ``true cost pools'' in accounting for the costs of JTPA programs. It was also not intended to go beyond the requirements of section 108(a) of the Act, GAAP, paragraph (a) of this section or similar provisions in OMB Circular A&hyph;87. The final rule removes the specific ACP provisions in paragraph (f) and adds a new sentence on cost pools within paragraph (a). The new sentence is intended to be consistent with the A&hyph;87 meaning and treatment of cost pools. JTPA entities may continue to use ACP's. They may also continue to use indirect cost pools, training cost pools, intake cost pools, pools for supplies expense, and any other pool they find beneficial to have in their accounting system, including intermediate cost pools for the recording and temporary accumulation of joint or similar types of costs, pending distribution (allocation) at a later date to the benefitting cost objectives, e.g., programs and/or JTPA cost categories. Having, or using, a JTPA ACP has never been an issue and is not one now. The issue is how to distribute or allocate those accumulated costs back to the benefitting programs and whether allocation methodologies other than ``benefits received'' by each of the benefitting programs can be used. The ``old'' JTPA regulations did not address this issue. Since the 1992 Amendments directly incorporate the requirement to follow GAAP, and GAAP requires costs to be charged based on ``benefits received,'' the basic issue is whether the Department can waive a specific statutory requirement, especially when it affects up to 20 percent of the funds.
