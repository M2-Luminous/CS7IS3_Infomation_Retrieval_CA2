Invited at the banquet were delegates led by General Doan Khue, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam and minister of national defense, and Duong Chinh Thuc, Vietnamese ambassador to our country. Comrade O Chin-u, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and minister of People's Armed Forces; Kim Kwang-chin, vice marshal of the Korean People's Army [KPA]; Col. Gen. Pak Chae-kyong; Lt. Gen. Pak Sung-won; and other generals and officers of the KPA were also on hand. Comrade O Chin-u made a speech at the banquet. He warmly welcomed the delegation's visit to our country and said that its recent visit will serve as a momentum in promoting traditional relations of cooperation and friendship between the two countries onto a higher stage. He said that the fraternal Vietnamese people and army are invariably marching along the road of socialism which they themselves chose, and are achieving great results in the struggle for building prosperous socialist Vietnam and strengthening the country's defense power, by upholding the will of President Ho Chi Minh. He said that they were very pleased with this and hoped that greater results would be achieved in the course of future struggle. Comrade O Chin-u pointed out that our people and the officers and men of the army are overflowing with confidence and optimism that we will be ever-victorious as long as the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership exists as they strive vigorously for socialist construction and for the independent, peaceful reunification of the country. He said that the United States and its follower forces are intensifying more than ever before, anti-Republic maneuvers to isolate and crush our country's socialist system by finding fault with the fictitious nuclear issue of ours. He also said the government of our Republic took self-defense measures of immediately withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and no longer allowing any inspections against the IAEA Secretariat's shameless maneuvers of demanding the agency's overall [chonmyon] inspections with the threat of sanctions. He stressed that our people and the officers and men of the People's Army will defend, adhere to, and develop, the popular masses-centered socialism of our own-style under the wise leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, and will unfailingly realize the historic cause of national reunification. Our people will accelerate the socialist construction of the two countries, will fight with the fraternal Vietnamese people to build an independent, peaceful, and prosperous great Asia, and, on this course, will make positive efforts to strengthen and develop friendly relations with Vietnam, he said. Next, National Defense Minister Doan Khue made a speech. He expressed gratitude for the warm welcome given to the delegation. Saying that Vietnam and the DPRK are socialist countries which have a tradition of friendly relations formed by the respected Comrade President Ho Chi Minh and the respected Comrade President Kim Il-song, he stated that the two countries have supported and helped each other in the arduous yet glorious struggle for national independence, the country's reunification, and socialist construction. National Defense Minister Doan Khue said that today's situation calls on Vietnam and the DPRK to be firmly united in the struggle against the imperialists' plot to terminate socialism. He said that we were happy about the great results achieved by the DPRK people and the People's Army in the struggle to lay the material basis for socialism and to peacefully reunify the country without the interference of outside forces, and under the leadership of the WPK headed by the respected Comrade President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA. He said he firmly believes that the DPRK people and the People's Army, with their steel-like conviction, and energetic and creative labor, will overcome all sorts of difficulties and trials, and achieve a new result in the struggle for socialist construction and the country's independent, peaceful reunification. Saying that he is happy that the people of the two countries have strengthened and developed friendship and unity in the past, he emphasized that this has contributed to consolidating cooperation and development not only between the two countries, but also in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. He said that the delegation's recent visit to the DPRK will contribute to further promote friendship and unity between the people and army of the two countries. The participants of the banquet proposed a toast for the fraternal friendship and unity between the people and army of the DPRK and Vietnam; for the long life of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song; for the long life of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA; for the long life of General Secretary Do Muoi; and for the long life of the respected Comrade President Le Duc Anh.
