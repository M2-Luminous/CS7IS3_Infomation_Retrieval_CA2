In an exclusive statement to MENA, the source said most of the amendments concern the area of Jericho. The source said that the Israelis are sticking to their offer of 54 square km covering the Palestinian camps and some lands around Jericho city. The source said the Palestinian amendments include the following: First, al-Nabi Musa area should be under the supervision of the Palestinian authority. Second, the al-Maghtis. The Israelis believe the area should not be part of the Jericho region during the interim stage, but the Palestinians want it to be under the Palestinian authority. The Israelis say the Palestinian flag cannot be raised over that area without annexing it. Third, the Palestinians demanded the Musa al-'Alami area; the Israelis accepted this during the discussions. Fourth, as regards al-Qurunful mountain, the Palestinians demand the right to approve joint Palestinian-Israeli projects there, and to approve projects with Jordan later. Sixth [as received] The Palestinians demand that the international and foreign presence mentioned in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles be extended to the border crossings. The Palestinian source stressed that the amendments did not affect the essence of the agreement laid out through the joint working minutes. The draft working paper reached between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations in Cairo included several issues on foreign security and arrangements relevant to the border crossings. According to the border crossings arrangements, there will be one terminal for arrivals and departures with two doors, one Palestinian and one Israeli, separated by a glass barrier. Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza will pass through the Palestinian door and then move to the Israeli door. Electronic inspection will be used in a manner respecting the dignity of those who pass through. The Palestinian-Israeli draft on the crossings also says that each side has a right to see the identity cards of any traveler and veto the entry of any person. Each side will also report anything suspicious to the other. The draft exempts public Palestinian figures from crossings procedures and stresses that when there is a need for personal inspection of Palestinians, the Palestinian side will do the inspection in the presence of an Israeli observer.
