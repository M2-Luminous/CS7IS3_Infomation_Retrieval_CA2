Martino, who is on a brief working visit to Yugoslavia, told a news conference at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade that an extra reason for Italy's more active role was the summit of the world's leading seven industrial countries, which opens in Naples on July 8. Martino, who visited Sarajevo and the Croatian capital of Zagreb on Monday, said it was necessary to hear all sides involved in the conflict. The Italian foreign minister said all officials with whom he had conferred during his current Balkan tour had expressed pleasure at Italy's more active role. 'We are a neighbouring country and we are very much interested in the resolution of the problem in the region. and, I, myself, despite all the caution, believe that we can find a solution,' Martino told the news conference. Martino said that, after the talks held with the Serb, Croat and Muslim sides, he had the impression that all sides had confidence in the international community. Asked about the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina prepared by the international 'contact group', the Italian foreign minister said he had not seen the plan yet but expected that it would be acceptable to all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked about the Osimo accords signed between the former Yugoslav Federation and Italy, Martino said it was the Italian Government's stand that the accords should be respected. All territorial issues between Italy and the former Yugoslav Federation, i.e. its western republics of Croatia and Slovenia, were resolved under the Osimo accords. Slovenia and Croatia, which forcibly seceded in 1991, reject everything that has any connection with the former Yugoslavia, but, nevertheless, feel that the Osimo accords are valid and not subject to revision.
