The two announcements have hurt Thai fish products sent earlier to France and those that are to be exported there. The Association of Processed Food Producers estimated that the loss is valued at about 70.66 million baht or 17 million francs. The does not include losses by other associations such as the Associations of Frozen Food and Marine Animal Traders. Government agencies such as the Fishery Department, the Commerce Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry are keeping close contacts with France's agriculture and fishery ministries to solve the problem. Since the new regulations have been imposed at the request of French fishermen dissatisfied with falling fish prices, French agencies are reluctant to allow Thailand and other countries to resume exporting fish products to their market. The European Union has also expressed disagreement with the action taken by France. The Thai private sector is disappointed with France's sudden imposition of restrictions and has proposed that the Thai Government resort to trade retaliation against it if negotiations to tackle this problem fail. On 9 March, the Foreign Ministry summoned the French ambassador to hear to the Thai complaint and has asked France to allow Thai fish products to be sold in the French market as before. Phirat Itsarasena na Ayutthaya, deputy permanent secretary for foreign affairs, has been assigned to follow up. The French ambassador has promised to bring Thailand's request to French agencies for urgent consideration.
