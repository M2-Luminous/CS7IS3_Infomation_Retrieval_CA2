According to sources, the Japan Key Tech Center will spearhead establishment of a research corporation at the end of March with collaboration of five private manufacturers including Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Shimadzii Corporation. They plan to jointly invest a total of 9 billion yen during the 7-year period by the end of the year 2000. The project's objectives are to establish a technology for reduced noise, safety and scheduled flight in order to develop high operability commuter helicopters less dependent on good weather or pilot skill. Based on the research results, the project will be expanded to include joint development with overseas aircraft and helicopter manufacturers. The ability of helicopters to take off and land at urban heliports has attracted considerable attention as part of a high speed transportation system in the 21st century. In addition to the Japan Key Tech Center (investment rate:59.9%), 5 private companies including Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Ltd. (19.3%), Shimadzu Corporation (3. 6%), Tokyo Avionics Instruments (3.3%). Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. (2.3%), and Japan Aircraft Mfg. Co.. Ltd., (l.6%) have jointly invested to establish a research development corporation called. ``The Commuter Helicopter Advanced Technology Research Corporation,'' (tentative name) on 2l March. The headquarters will be located at KHI's Gifu Plant. KHI President Hiroshi Oba will also hold the presidency of the new research company. The research will include ``outside aircraft noise reduction technology'' for quieter rotor systems using the latest computer fluid analysis technology, a control system for easy operation, and ``flight safety technology'' which combines flight and management systems. The research will be funded at a level of 9 billion yen during the 7-year period by the end of the year 2000. Helicopter pilots will concentrate only on conducting flight safety. Details of the research schedule include concept study, specifications at the system level, and system initiatives in FY94, basic level research and testing in FY95-97, testing at the system and operational levels, and evaluation of research objectives in FY98-2000. Environmental safety and expansion of the helicopter market are expected to be realized through establishment of this key technology. It eventually will lead to technology exchange and international joint development. Also a wide range of applications in other areas such as general purpose helicopters, ship navigation support systems, and reduced noise blower are said to be possible
