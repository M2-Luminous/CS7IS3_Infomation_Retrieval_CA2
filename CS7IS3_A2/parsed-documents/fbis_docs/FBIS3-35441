They described it as one of the greatest events in spying operations so far. In the wake of the disclosure of this news, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that he has ordered an enquiry and investigation in order to speedily clarify the details of such an event. The subject of espionage and the reason why Russia and America, under the conditions when the Cold War has already ended, are trying to get informed of one another's secrets, have drawn the attention of the world people. At the end of the Cold War the heads of the CIA and the Russian intelligence organization, KGB, in their speeches, had dismissed continuation of the past policies that arose from mutual distrust and proposed cooperation in various fields. But facts now show that both countries still lack trust toward the other. For this reason they continue to make use of their spy organizations for acquiring secret information on the actions and decisions adopted by the opposing country. America is now trying to acquire precise information on Russian policies in various parts of the world, especially in the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and possibly to create grounds for its political influence in them. In this regard one may refer to the murder of a CIA official in Georgia last year. That event roused Moscow's anger, vis-a-vis America. It appears that spying measures of America, in order to penetrate Russia and the newly-independent republics, have led to the fact that Russia's spy organization too pursues its operations to counter the rival's designs. However, it often happens that spy organizations, based on their facilities, penetrate sensitive administrative and intelligence centers of the opposing country. Of course such an act, based on undermining the prestige of one of these two states, may bring sharp reactions in its wake. In connection with the disclosure of the recent spying episode, it appears that Mr. Clinton is extremely wrathful and it is probable that he may adopt fresh decisions on U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties. Inflection of this blow on the Clinton Administration will compel Washington to have a closer survey of the rulers in Moscow and to adopt caution in its ties. But despite this one cannot stress the point that America will also reassess its policies on supporting the reformists and checking the ultra-nationalists. This is because in such case America will have to ready itself for return to the Cold War era and intense rivalry between the CIA and the KGB.
