This is the third best figure so far, after the record in 1990 (22.33 billion net kilowatt-hours) and the 1992 result, which was 0.5 percent higher than that of 1993. The average rate of use for Swiss nuclear reactors was 85.6 percent. In addition to electric current, the nuclear reactors at Goesgen and Beznau I and II also delivered long distance heat. The cardboard mill in Niedergoesgen took some 150 million kWh of industrial heat from the Goesgen reactor. The two Beznau reactors provided around 108 million kWh of thermal energy to the regional distance heating network in the lower Aar Valley. Since the Leibstadt reactor was commissioned in 1984, total Swiss nuclear production has stayed above 20 billion kWh. Fluctuations from one year to the next are mainly the result of shutdowns of varying length for annual inspections. Goesgen Leads The Pack In 1993, the Beznau I reactor was down for 100 days. That is the longest stoppage for this reactor since it was commissioned. The two steam generators were changed and the Nano emergency system was put into place. Goesgen recorded the highest net production of all Swiss nuclear reactors, with 7,408.130 million kWh and a 90.5 percent rate of use. It was followed by Leibstadt (7,338.055 million kWh). Beznau I produced 2,156.305 million kWh, which was less than the 2,650.931 million produced by Beznau II and the 2,568.475 million produced by Muehleberg.
