FR941206-1-00129 FR941206-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 242 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Personal Services Compensation AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to establish a dollar threshold for DoD contractors for application of the FAR requirements for contractor compensation system reviews. DATES: Comments on the proposed rule should be submitted in writing at the address shown below on or before February 6, 1995, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, ATTN: Mr. Eric R. Mens, PDUSD(A&T)DP/DAR, IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 602&hyph;0350. Please cite DAR Case 91&hyph;085D in all correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eric R. Mens, (703) 602&hyph;0131. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This proposed DFARS rule supplements a proposed FAR rule concerning the allowability of personal services compensation costs which was published in the Federal Register for public comment on October 11, 1994 (59 FR 51399). The proposed DFARS rule would limit the FAR compensation system review procedures to DoD prime contractors or subcontractors which have received awards totaling $50 million or more in the previous fiscal year and for which cost or pricing data was submitted. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DAR Case 91&hyph;085D in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 242 Government procurement. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR Part 242 be amended as follows: PART 242_CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Part 242 continues to read as follows: Authority: 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR Chapter 1. 2. Subpart 242.13 is added to read as follows: Subpart 242.13_Contractor Compensation Systems Sec. 242.1303␣Applicability. Subpart 242.13_Contractor Compensation Systems 242.1303␣Applicability. (a) The review procedures at FAR 42.1306 apply only to DoD contractors which in their preceding fiscal year received Government prime contracts or subcontracts totaling $50 million or more for which cost or pricing data was submitted.
