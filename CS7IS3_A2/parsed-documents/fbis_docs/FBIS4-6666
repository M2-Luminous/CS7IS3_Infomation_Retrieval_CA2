It cannot be denied that Egawa's comment was rather inconsiderate in giving the impression that the testing of high-vision broadcasting will stop immediately--even tomorrow. However, a closer study of the background of this comment allows us to find a significant meaning hidden in it, and this makes us realize that this comment should not be overlooked as a slip of the tongue. Egawa abruptly mentioned, "We should seek the digitalization of high vision, the analog-type HDTV," at the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Social Capital Group meeting held on 18 February. The point is that this took place during the Shinseito group meeting. In fact, the heated confrontation between Shinseito and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] over the issue of running the MOPT has been accelerating since last summer, when the new government was born. The future course to be pursued by the respective parties on the issue of HDTV, which will be a generator of enormous demand in the 21st century, has often been rumored. Although NHK and the MOPT have been taking the initiative in developing HDTV, MOPT-related members of the LDP have served as the actual decisionmakers. Rushing to embrace the digitalization of HDTV by making high vision out-of-date will permit Shinseito to obtain new political power. Amid such circumstances, we can regard Egawa's comment as a reflection of the intention of the MOPT to get out from under the LDP and move toward Shinseito. If such a comment as "Executive officials of the MOPT frequently visited (Shinseito Secretary General) Ichiro Ozawa before Shinseito group meetings," is true, it is possible to assume that extensive groundwork had already been laid prior to Egawa's comment. In the MOPT, there is a group of people who have developed close relations with Ozawa since he was a member of the LDP. They first met at "Ichinokai," a study group in the ministry once formed around Ozawa. Participants in this study group include Mr. Misuo Igarashi, director of the Telecommunications Policy Bureau; Akiyoshi Takada, deputy director of the same; Kanichiro Aritomi, director of the Policy Division of the same; Hideo Shimizu, director of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau; and other opinion leaders on the issues of the telecommunications and broadcasting administration of the MOPT. This illustrates that the Shinseito-oriented course had already been established. The important point here is that a change in the direction of the MOPT does not merely mean a shift in the domestic power structure; it is also a matter of international concern. Ozawa, who made positive commitments to solving U.S.-Japanese construction-related frictions, as well as electronics- and telecommunications-related frictions, has been relied on heavily by the U.S. Government and has been considered "pro-U.S." Although I do not intend to discuss the real meaning of Ozawa's approaches here, it is clear that "taking a pro-Ozawa course means choosing a pro-U.S. course" (as was stated by a person with the MOPT). As far as HDTV is concerned, the United States has already decided to adopt the digital method. Because European countries are also inclined to take the same course, the isolation of Japan, a country that is proceeding with the analog method, is becoming increasingly decisive. The United States is displeased by Japan's continued intention to stick with the high-vision choice because this will possibly prevent the entry of U.S.-method hardware and software into the Japanese market. At the Shinseito group meeting, Egawa stressed, "Japan's high-vision-oriented commitment will create another trade friction," and he added the importance of taking a concerted step with the U.S. method by giving up Japan's own standard. It can be said that the MOPT's pro-U.S. attitude was reflected well in the February resolution of trade frictions over the issue of Motorola's mobile telephones. The MOPT resolved the issue by making a substantial concession, which was a big surprise to other government agencies. Ichiro Ozawa is said to have taken various steps to settle the negotiations. Because of the heated criticism of the Japanese bureaucracy by the U.S. Government, Kasumigaseki is becoming increasingly fed up with the United States. Amid these circumstances, the attitude of the MOPT appears to be odd. It is particularly interesting to observe the response of the Ministry of Trade and Industry [MITI], which is a rival of the MOPT. Such an abusive comment as "The decision made by the MOPT is traitorous in promoting Japan's becoming technologically subordinate to the United States" is heard from it. It is well-known that MITI is strongly opposed to the U.S. demand to introduce numerical targets at the U.S.-Japanese economic framework talks. This clearly illustrates a discrepancy between two high-tech ministries, MITI and the MOPT, in dealing with the United States. Which ministry will take the leading role in Japan's information technology policies for the 21st century? It seems that the answer to this questions will significantly influence the U.S.-Japanese relationship in the future.
