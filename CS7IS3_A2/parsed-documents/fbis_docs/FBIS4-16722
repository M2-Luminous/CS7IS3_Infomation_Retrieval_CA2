The main objectives of his visit are to get acquainted with the Far Eastern frontier guard districts and to start the putina (fishing season) operation. The putina operation will begin in the Far East in the third decade of April. Its purpose is to stop the illegal fishing of Russian and foreign poachers in the economic zone of the Russian Federation. For half a year frontier guards jointly with the Fish Protection Service and the Navy will exercise a tough round-the-clock control over a vast part of the Pacific zone -- from the Chukotka Peninsula to the South Kuril islands. Nikolayev said at the ramp of the plane that the operation would not affect the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk where Polish, Chinese and South Korean poacher vessels are illegally fishing the young fish, which are maturing there. "This is the problem of the national resources of the whole world and not only of Russia. It is necessary to resolve, in the first place, international problems connected with the use of biological resources of the Sea of Okhotsk," Nikolayev said. Responding to the ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of Russia's Far Eastern neighbours to the putina operation, Nikolayev said that "all law-abiding states approve of those actions, aimed at protecting Russia's economic interests in the region."
