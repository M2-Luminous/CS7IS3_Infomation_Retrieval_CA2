He added that Matutuine District Administrator Joao Namedinga has been making it difficult for Renamo to coordinate its activities. After Renamo holds a meeting with the people, [Frelimo] activisit groups proceed to contradict Renamo's messages. Chirinza also said that another problem is the absence of premises for Renamo to have offices in various areas of Maputo Province. That Renamo official noted that despite those difficulties, his party continues to work to show its true image to the people of Maputo Province. [Begin recording] [Chirinza] Frelimo, (?like the government) has been creating many difficulties. For instance, the [words indistinct] that have been created in terms of the General Peace Accord and which are not functioning yet because, quite simply, they lack government permission. [Unidentified correspondent] How do you view the work that should be done in view of the upcoming elections? [Chirinza] For its part, Renamo is doing very serious work with the people because we have to clean up the picture painted by Frelimo. We have to improve our image with the people, so they become aware that Renamo is not what Frelimo made it out to be for so many years. [Correspondent] Have you experienced any difficulties in your political work in Maputo Province? [Chirinza] (?Very much so) because the government is creating so many problems. There is a shortage of premises and transportation. The government is aware that it is the UN Operations in Mozambique that provides us with vehicles but at this stage the vehicles have not been released without any justification. [end recording] When Radio Mozambique approached Marciano da Cruz, provincial director for support and control, and acting governor while Governor Raimundo Bila is on leave, he said that there are legal avenues for Renamo to express concerns, rather than through the press. He added that the provincial government is ready to cooperate with Renamo and do its best to solve that party's problems in accordance with means available locally. He also noted that he had no information about the behavior of Activist Groups in Matutuine District, because the local administrator has not reported any unusual incidents to the provincial government.
