Concluding a two-day meeting in Korsoer, near Copenhagen, to assess the situation of Nordic peacekeepers in the war-ravaged republic, the ministers said it was "important to reinforce the decision-making process" to give the UN a credible role and protect its troops in crisis and war zones. While the UN possessed an effective network of civilian mechanisms, there were chinks in its military armour which had to be eliminated, Norwegian Defence Minister Joergen Kosmo asserted. He said he and his colleagues were "satisfied" with assurances given them Monday by the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who promised the Nordic troops would receive the air protection they required. "New procedures" which the UN forces had set in motion would accelerate the provision of air cover, Rose told the ministers after he was invited to address them on the UN mission in the former Yugoslav republic. But the Nordic ministers said in response to Rose's call for more troops for the international peacekeeping effort that their nations were not in a position to add to the contingent the Scandinavians already have on the ground. Danish Defence Minister Hans Haekkerup said the Nordic nations have proportionately more troops in the UN force than any other country, while Swedish counterpart Anders Bjork called on the United States in particular to contribute to the peace mission.
