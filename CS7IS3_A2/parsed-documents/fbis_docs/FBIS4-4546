They should regard themselves as Malaysian in equal terms with people in the other states.

Everyone in the country enjoys the same rights, including holding top posts regardless of the state of origin, community, or religion. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir added that federal government supervision of the new Sabah administration is necessary to ensure that the abuses of past governments do not recur. The supervision is not deemed as colonizing Sabah but to make sure that the state is administered well.
