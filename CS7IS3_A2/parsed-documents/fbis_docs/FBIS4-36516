They also believe they can convince the world that they are saying and doing the right things. These leaders are carrying out flagrantly savage attacks on Lebanon and destroying homes over the very heads of their peaceful civilian inhabitants. At the same time, they allege that these attacks are not directed against the peace process and will not affect it. The Israelis are also carrying out acts of piracy and abduction and encroaching upon the sovereignty of a UN member state. Moreover, they daily threaten Lebanon with an open war. In their statements, however, the Israelis are trying to convince the world that all this does not mean they have abandoned the peace process or the objective of obtaining peace. But how can a reasonable man be convinced that the large military buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon as well as the threats, the continued shelling of southern Lebanese villages and towns, and the beating of war drums can be in harmony with the atmosphere of peace? It is impossible to put summer and winter together. Israel's contradictions and allegations will convince anyone. If the Israelis believe they can mislead the world and portray their savage attacks as a defense of Israeli security, they are undoubtedly deluded. This is because the actions of the Lebanese national resistance are a result, and not a cause, of occupation. Thus, as long as the occupation continues, the resistance will continue because it is the Lebanese people's right, as acknowledged by all international laws and norms. If Israel is working to achieve its security, as it claims, all it has to do is to comply with UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to unconditionally withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon. It has become well known that Israeli security has never been threatened and that the opposite is actually true. In other words, Arab security is currently threatened, and for more than half a century the Arabs have been subjected to Israeli aggression. Moreover, the Arab territories are still under occupation at a time when Israeli aircraft, artillery, tanks, and warships bombard and destroy Arab villages, towns, and houses in Lebanon and other Arab territories and kill Arabs. So, it is not the opposite that is taking place. For those who want further confirmation and information on who is the aggressor and who is the victim, and who is the executioner and who is the victim, the records of the United Nations, specifically the UN Security Council, are replete with resolutions condemning Israel for its aggressions against the Arabs From this premise, the security excuse is not convincing. Israel is trying to use this card to cover up its real stand and reason for escalating its aggression against Lebanon. On one hand, Israel wants to bring the utmost pressure to bear on Lebanon to confuse it and force it to submit to its conditions which Lebanon rejected at the negotiation table. Israel wants to separate Lebanon from Syria and to end coordination between them as part of its policy of dealing with the Arab parties one after the other, thus making it easier for it to impose its conditions and will on them and to drag them into partial agreements and separate deals that would secure its hegemony and control over the land it occupies. What is more important is that by carrying out aggression and threatening to wage an open war against Lebanon, Israel would thus resort to the most effective means for torpedoing the peace process because a just and comprehensive peace limits its moves, checks its designs for expansion, and demarcates its borders which, as yet, have been demarcated only on the basis of the well-known Zionist concept of the borders from the Euphrates to the Nile. By igniting the situation in Lebanon, Israel brings the region to the brink of war and makes it move far from the peace which the entire world seeks to establish in this region whose people have been afflicted with wars and destruction since Israel's establishment. It goes without saying that the absence of a deterring punishment of the agressor, the adoption of two yardsticks, and the failure to adopt a firm stand toward the recurrent Israeli attacks against the Arabs, encourage Israeli leaders to continue threatening the opportunities for peace, and push the region to the brink of war. Had the international community been as firm and as decisive as it was in other areas in confronting the aggressor and forcing it to implement UN resolutions, Israel would not have continued its defiance of the international community, and peace in the region would have been closer than at any other time. Israel is exposing peace and security in the region to unfathomable dangers. The international community, specifically the sponsors of the peace process, should take the initiative before the opportunity is lost and peace is endangered.
