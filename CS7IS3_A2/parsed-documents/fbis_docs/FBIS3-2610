This is the first economic law which has not been drafted by the executive branch but by experts organized by the National People's Congress. It will replace the Provisional Regulations Governing the Issue and Trading of Securities previously promulgated by the State Council and local regulations on securities trading promulgated by Shenzhen and Shanghai, thus erecting a national legal framework in securities. The introduction of the Securities Act is naturally related to the mainland's fast developing and booming securities markets. By the end of 1993, there were already 122 listed, joint-stock companies on the mainland, six major companies listed outside China, and 51 securities companies across the nation, and the number of shareholders reached some 25 million. Moreover, over 13,000 enterprises across the country already utilize the shareholding system, with the total amount of shares amounting to 208.6 billion yuan, and many of these companies are hoping to be listed or are pooling funds to expand production. It is known that mainland enterprises are also planning to issue 5.5 billion yuan of stocks this year. In the meantime, the number of negotiable securities of all types keeps increasing. According to statistics, between 1981 and 1993, negotiable securities issued on mainland China totalled 432.3 billion yuan, of which 138.9 billion yuan were short-term state treasury bonds; 39.7 billion long-term state treasury bonds; 20 billion yuan special government bonds and indexed bonds; 40.7 billion yuan state investment bonds (including state construction bonds, state major construction bonds, and capital construction bonds); 96 billion yuan in corporate securities, 61 billion yuan of financial bonds; and 36 billion yuan in enterprise shares. On the other hand, owing to the unsound system, some unpleasant things have occurred in the securities investment market; for example, one shareholder committed suicide following great losses due to his failure in securities speculation after obtaining an overdraft from a local securities company. His wife then brought a suit against the securities company, demanding reasonable compensation. Therefore, the question of whether or not shareholders should be allowed to speculate in future by taking out overdrafts has arisen, and this needs to be standardized by the Securities Act. A bigger issue is the fact that state-owned enterprises are gradually changing to the shareholding system and are listing one after another. Given the fact that "state-owned shares" are tokens of public ownership, should we legislate to protect them to prevent the state from losing controlling power over those enterprises? In the process of drafting the Securities Act, people have argued greatly about it all along. Professor Li Yining, who was head of the drafting committee and who is the deputy director of the Law Committee of the NPC Standing Committee, disclosed not long ago that the question of whether or not state shares should be protected should ultimately be decided in keeping with the laws of the market economy; that in stressing competition, we should not determine power by the main body of shares; and that all investors should be on an equal footing. Therefore, the Securities Act provides that state shares, corporate shares, and personal shares should be treated equally without discrimination. Another question over which there has been a comparatively big difference of opinion is whether or not the trading of securities should be allowed outside the floor [of the exchange]. It was finally decided that there was a need to set up roadside exchanges [chang wai jiao yi suo 1034 1120 0074 2496 2076] outside the major exchanges but that these sites must first be approved. If roadside exchanges are banned, this will surely hinder the development of the shareholding system and will aid the growth of underground securities trading, and will thus produce many loopholes. In addition, there is also the question of whether or not civil servants should be allowed to buy and sell shares. It was finally decided that it was inappropriate to lay down in the Securities Act any clauses preventing any person from buying and selling stocks. As for whether or not civil servants can buy and sell stocks, provisions should be made in other laws, regulations, and policies. According to Ji Xiangyu of the Exchange Department of the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, the forthcoming Securities Act includes a national central clearing system. The variety of the central clearing system should include listed A shares, futures, bonds, and debentures in the initial stage. At a later stage, it should also include B shares, corporate shares, funds, foreign shares traded in China, and other financial varieties to be expanded in China in the future. As for the shareholders of the national central clearing company, he said that membership for foreign banks could be considered, but holding rights must absolutely be held by the Chinese side. We can see, therefore, that the formulation and introduction of the Securities Act really has great significance.
