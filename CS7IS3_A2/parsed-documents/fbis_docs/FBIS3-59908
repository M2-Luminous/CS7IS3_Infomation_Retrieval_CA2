He also stated the need to set up without delay an international space company involving foreign capital "for the sake of saving" the cosmodrome and to open it for the implementation of very diverse international commercial projects. "If this option is not adopted, Kazakhstan is prepared to consider the question of leasing the Baykonur Cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk to Russia on condition that Russia takes over all the costs," G. Abilsiitov said. In that case Kazakhstan will require reimbursing for the expenditure on Baykonur over the past 2.5 years, the minister said.
