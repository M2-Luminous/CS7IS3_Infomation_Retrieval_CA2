FR941220-1-00050 FR941220-1-00009 B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA(ICR No. 270.34) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information has an estimated annual reporting and recordkeeping burden averaging 9.3 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. National annual burden and cost estimates for PWSs and States are presented in Table 11. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget; Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA''. The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. C. Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership Executive Order 12875, Enhancing Intergovernmental Partnerships explicitly requires Federal agencies to consult with State, local, and tribal entities in the development of rules and policies that will affect them. EPA has complied with the Order in proposing the sulfate rule in the following ways. First, the Agency met with interested parties, including representatives from four States, Region 8, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators in Denver, Colorado in November, 1992. Secondly, the Agency plans to meet with the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), a group composed of representatives from State, local and tribal governments in addition to water suppliers and environmentalists. Thirdly, the Agency is developing generic contacts with State, Tribal and local fiscal and program officials which will enable various programs to consult with affected parties in a coordinated fashion. Identification of appropriate contacts was not accomplished in a time frame which enabled EPA's Office of Water to have extensive consultation with affected parties in compliance with the E.O. before proposal. However, a contact person has now been designated from ASDWA, and the Agency will be meeting with this designee and other interested State officials. EPA is committed to expanded dialogue and collaboration with State, Tribal and local governments. EPA will schedule a work group or public meeting to solicit comments of fiscal and program officials or State, Tribal and local governments. The intent of such a meeting is to allow for the maximum input from the regulated community for the drafting of the final rule. EPA will also send copies of this proposed rule to these governmental bodies, as well as to national and local associations (e.g., the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Towns and Townships, the National Association of County Health Officers, etc.) VII.
