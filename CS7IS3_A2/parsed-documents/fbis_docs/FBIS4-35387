FBIS4-35387 "drnes105_n_94002" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 LEBANON Buwayz on Christopher Tour, al-Dirani Kidnapping Buwayz on Christopher Tour, al-Dirani Kidnapping JN3105200794 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1727 GMT 31 May 94 JN3105200794 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by correspondent Randah Habib in Amman -- date not given] [Excerpts] [Habib] Mr. Minister, what is Lebanon's stand on the settlement of the Yemeni crisis in light of the proclamation of an independent state in the south, given that Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has stated that most of the Arab countries will recognize this state? [Buwayz] In principle, we do not believe the time is appropriate to review the map of the region. From this premise, we as the Lebanese Government pause before adopting a final stand on what is taking place in Yemen to give the opportunity for initiatives to settle this problem. Our hope is that the brothers in Yemen realize that the current Arab situation is tragic and can do without further divisions and fragmentations and further infringement on Arab sovereignty through the imposition of international tutelage. [Habib] How does Lebanon view the solution to the Palestinian presence on its territory following the conclusion of the autonomy agreement between Israel and the PLO, and how many Palestinians reside in Lebanon? [Buwayz] In principle, there is a consensus in Lebanon among all the parties, communities, and forces to reject any form of resettlement on Lebanese soil. The Lebanese constitution explicitly states its rejection of this possibility. From this premise, Lebanon with its limited area, and sensitive structure absolutely does not believe that it can sustain the burdens of the resettlement of Palestinians on its land. [passage omitted] [Habib] What about their numbers? [Buwayz] There are no accurate statistics. Many Palestinians have made statements implying that the Lebanese state is carrying out specific plans, proposals, and contacts. I would like to state here that the Lebanese state has not contacted anyone and has not held discussions with anyone on the Palestinian presence in Lebanon and that it is not currently carrying out any action dealing with this Palestinian presence. Their number ranges between 300,000 and 350,000. [Habib] There is talk about a new tour of the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Will it include Lebanon and is there a date for holding the next session of bilateral negotiations? [Buwayz] What is certain is that we do not accept being summoned to any place outside the Lebanese territory. We welcome all those who visit us in Lebanon to discuss the problems of the region. Lebanon is an essential part of the Middle East equation, whether historically, politically, economically, or culturally. We expect that Secretary Christopher will carry out a new tour to prepare for a new round of negotiations. I expect this. With respect to his visiting Lebanon, we have not received, as yet, any information about this topic. [passage omitted] [Habib] Is there anything new with respect to the Believers Resistance official Mustafa al-Dirani? [Buwayz] Israel carried out an operation deep inside Lebanese territory. The outcome of this operation was the kidnapping of Mr. Mustafa al-Dirani under the pretext of seeking the release of an Israeli pilot who was arrested in Lebanon in 1986. Any comparison between the two is rejected. Israeli pilot Ron Arad was taken prisoner after he carried out a raid on Lebanon, during military operations and when the Lebanese state was absent. The Lebanese state has no information and does not know anything about this topic. The operation against Mustafa al-Dirani took place on Lebanese territory, without there being any military operations and against a person who was in his house and among his family. We view it as an aggression and as an act of piracy with all the sense of the word. [passage omitted]
