He declined for the time being to disclose the names of the companies. The details of the lease will be worked out in the course of the talks, Molder said, but the ministry gives top priority to border guard and defense forces' vessels having access to the port. One of the two companies plans to use the port facilities for trade in groceries, and the range of activities proposed by the other firm is even wider, Molder noted. The ministry expects to wrap up the deal by March 9. The port will be rented out for a term of three years. The Tallinna Sadam (Port of Tallinn) company is seeking a good business plan to develop Paldiski's South Port. It has so far received about a dozen projects but as new plans keep coming in the company's administrative board at its recent meeting put off making a decision, General Director Peeter Palu said in an earlier interview with BNS. The South Port of Paldiski is ice-free round the year. The projects mostly propose building an oil terminal at the port or using it for export of timber and metal, Palu said. Neither the Defense Ministry nor the Port of Tallinn is prepared to consider joining the two ports, since one is determined to keep it a naval port and the other regards it as a commercial port.
