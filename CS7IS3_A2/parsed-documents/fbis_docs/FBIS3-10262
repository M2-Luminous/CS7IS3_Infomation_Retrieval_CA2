To the people of Mexico, the peoples and governments of the world, the national and international press, and our brothers: The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command of the EZLN addresses you all respectfully and honorably to make a statement. First: The EZLN came to this bargaining table with the real intention of stating its views and explaining all the reasons that forced us to take up arms in order to avoid dying dishonorably. We came here to hold a dialogue, that is we came to talk and listen. We spoke to the supreme government and all the good and honest people in the world. We also spoke to the bad people so they will listen to the truth. Some heard our word; others followed the path of despise against our voice and our race. Second: We met heedful ears ready to listen to the truth coming from our lips. The San Cristobal dialogue was truthful. There were no ill intentions or lies, nothing was concealed from our hearts and the people of reason and kindness. There was no sale or purchase of dignities. There was equality when speaking and listening. There was a good and truthful dialogue. Third: We now have answers that reflect the real interest of the peace commissioner to find peace. We now have the obligation to reflect on what his words say. We must now speak to the collective heart that commands us. We must listen to its voice to be able to walk again. From it, from our people, from the Indians in the mountains and the creeks will come the next signal to take the following step on this path, whose goal will be peace with justice and dignity or it will not be. Fourth: We have found in the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas a man who is willing to listen to our reasonings and demands. Not only did he listen to us and understand our position, but he also sought possible solutions to our problems. We salute the attitude assumed by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. Fifth: We have seen in Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the national mediation commissioner, a real and permanent interest in eliminating all the obstacles that could get in the way of peace. Along with him, good men and women worked day and night to make sure nothing interrupted the dialogue. Sacrificing their personal safety, well-being, and health, the mediators fulfilled their mission by negotiating not between peace or war but between two voices that are still trying to reach a peace agreement. These men and women received us because they want peace. If peace is achieved in this region, it will be thanks first of all to their peace efforts. We recognize the sacrifice and dedication of the National Mediation Commission, particularly that of Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia. Sixth: This phase of the dialogue is over now, and we are on the right path. Let us eliminate all obstacles and continue moving forward. Freedom! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully, [Signed ] Subcommander Marcos [Issued] From southeastern Mexico by the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army -- Mexico, March 1994.
