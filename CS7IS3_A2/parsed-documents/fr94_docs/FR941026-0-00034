FR941026-0-00034 FR941026-0-00010 Based, in part, on these studies, the Petitioners ask EPA to create a regulatory regime for response planning for non-petroleum, ``non-toxic'' oils separate from the regime established for petroleum oils and ``toxic,'' non-petroleum oils. The Petitioners further submitted, as an Appendix to their Petition, specific suggested language to amend the July 1, 1994, facility response plan rule to allow mechanical dispersal and ``no action'' options for responding to a spill of animal fats and vegetable oils. III. Addressing Issues Presented in the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Studies EPA acknowledged in the Final Rule that response strategies for petroleum and non-petroleum oils may differ (59 FR 34088). However, because the Agency was aware of little data to support developing a separate regulatory regime for non-petroleum oils and because the OPA calls for resources to remove ``oil'' (broadly defined in section 311 of the Clean Water Act), the Agency adopted the regime described in the Final Rule (see 59 FR 3470 at 34087, 34088) and summarized above. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) took issue with many statements in the ENVIRON Report in a letter to the Research and Special Projects Administration (U.S. Department of Transportation). (See Letter from Michael J. Spear, Assistant Director, Ecological Services, FWS to Ms. Ana Sol Gutierrez, Research and Special Projects Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, April 11, 1994.) The FWS expressed concern with ENVIRON statements suggesting that edible oils and fats pose no real risk to fish and wildlife. FWS states that although petroleum oils may pose greater risks than vegetable oils for acute toxicity to fish and wildlife from ingestion and inhalation of petroleum oil's hydrocarbon component, both types of oil pose chronic effects from the fouling of coats and plumage in wildlife, which often leads to death. FWS also stated that in some circumstances, edible oils can persist in the environment for extended periods of time, forming mat and encrustation similar to petroleum products, potentially causing chronic adverse effects to fish. NOAA also has evaluated the effects on the environment of spilled non-petroleum oils, including coconut, corn, cottonseed, fish, and palm oils. (See a Memorandum for the Record, date June 3, 1993, from NOAA Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division.) The NOAA assessment, based on literature research, addresses physical and chemical properties and toxicity of these and other oils, and indicates that some edible oils, when spilled, may have adverse environmental effects. Some of these effects seem to contradict conclusions in the ENVIRON study. According to NOAA, coconut and palm oils are very viscous; in most coastal waters, these oils probably would persist for over a decade. By contrast, ENVIRON concluded that animal fats and vegetable oils ``are easily biodegraded by bacteria,'' and that the physical impacts of non-recoverable animal fats and vegetable oils ``would be of limited duration.'' Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research (TSBR) made a statement on the ENVIRON study in response to a request for comment from the Department of the Interior. (TSBR provides contingency planning, training workshops, and emergency response for wildlife affected by oil spills.) A summary of the TSBR statement was published in its ``Wildlife & Oil Spills.'' (See Vol. 4, No. 1-Winter/Spring 1994.) In the summary, TSBR makes the following observation: ``While edible oils do not contain the toxic components of many of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons, they do have many of the same physical properties as petroleum oils; the animals and birds will suffer the same physical effects from edible oils as they would from contamination with petroleum products.'' Among the studies reviewed by USCG (for the USCG rule referenced above) attesting to the harmful effects of non-petroleum oils in the environment is an International Maritime Organization (IMO) study titled ``Harmful Effects on Birds of Floating Lipophilic Substances Discharged from Ships.'' The IMO study underscores ENVIRON's findings of the physical hazards associated with non-petroleum oil. IV. Request for Public Comment In view of the differing scientific conclusions reached by the Petitioners, the FWS, and other groups and agencies, EPA requests broader public comment on issues raised by the Petitioners. These include whether to have different specific response approaches for releases of animal fats and vegetable oils (rather than increased flexibility), and the effects on the environment of releases of these oils. EPA also asks for information regarding the following specific questions. What data are there on both the probability that spilled animal fats and vegetable oils will persist in the environment, and the physical effects of these substances on wildlife and aquatic biota? To what extent do environmental factors such as water temperature affect the physical characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils and the strategies for cleaning up the oil?
