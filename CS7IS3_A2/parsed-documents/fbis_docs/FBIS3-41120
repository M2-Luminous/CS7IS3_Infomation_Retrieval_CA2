The Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister Remmy Mushota said Zambia was committed to ridding itself of the scourge of drug trafficking but did not have adequate resources to carry out the task alone. Dr. Mushota told diplomats in Lusaka that while Zambia appreciated the concern of the donor community about drug trafficking, corruption, and transparency, it was also imperative that heads of diplomatic missions did not become over-zealous. He said diplomats should observe diplomatic propriety and etiquette.
