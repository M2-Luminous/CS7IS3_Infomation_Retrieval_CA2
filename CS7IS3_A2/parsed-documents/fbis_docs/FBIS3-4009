On March 7, the Hewlett-Packard Company simultaneously launched six state-of-the-art computers in the United States and Shanghai. On March 17, the China Hewlett-Packard Co. Ltd signed contracts with three well-performing South-east Asian international computer companies, authorizing them to be special retailers in China. On March 10, the Digital Equipment Company, the largest computer network producer in the world, signed a long-term cooperative memorandum with the Shanghai-based Pudong Software Park. On March 18, International Business Machines (IBM) announced it was going to donate 5.5 million U.S. dollars worth of computer equipment to the Shanghai University of Science and Technology and to help it set up a teaching center of computer auxiliary software engineering. Late last year, Shanghai declared computers to be one of its pillar industries. Overseas computer producers quickly reacted to this declaration. Nearly one-third of the world's 100 largest computer producers have discussed cooperation with Shanghai. Domestic enterprises are also competing for the market. Changjiang Computer Group, of Shanghai, is planning to popularize its computers in such fields as securities, finance, posts and telecommunications and commerce. Major Chinese computer companies like Legend and Giant are also accelerating their pace to step into Shanghai. Recently, the Shanghai Computer Square, sponsored by the China Corporation of Science and Technology Books and joined by Shanghai Computer Bookstore and Giant and Legend companies, opened here. It sells books, provides information and develops software and hardware and is open to the whole country.
