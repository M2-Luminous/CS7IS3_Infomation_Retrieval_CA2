FR941110-0-00111 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: Several commenters raised concerns with the provision that facilities must meet all requirements because they wonder how many follow-up surveys will be necessary to ascertain that a facility is in full compliance. Response: As we discussed earlier, we reconsidered our position spelled out in the proposed rule that prospective providers had to comply perfectly with all requirements to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Instead, we are requiring that providers and prospective providers be in substantial compliance with all requirements in order to participate in both programs. If a State survey agency is requested to conduct more than one initial survey of a prospective provider because it was not in substantial compliance, the State survey agency will have the flexibility to conduct follow-up surveys up to three weeks after the facility alleges correction of the noncompliance that disqualified it from Medicare and/or Medicaid participation. This is consistent with section 2008 of the State Operations Manual which established 3 weeks as the timeframe in which the State should conduct an initial survey of a prospective provider after its notification of full operation. The 3-week interval is necessary to allow the State survey agency adequate time to schedule a revisit, and gives the prospective provider who has corrected noncompliance the opportunity to demonstrate that it is capable of continued substantial compliance. Comment: Some commenters suggested adding a phrase at the end of the sentence in ยง488.330(b)(2)(ii) to require that when a provider has achieved compliance, the State can only remove the remedy if the State has reason to believe that compliance will be maintained. Response: We accept this suggestion, but only with regard to the denial of payment and State monitor sanctions imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act, and for the imposition of temporary management as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act. Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act provide that, if the State or Secretary finds substandard quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys, the State or the Secretary must impose a denial of payment remedy and monitor the facility until the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary or State that it is in compliance with the requirements of sections 1819 (b), (c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d), and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements. Likewise sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act specify that temporary management must not be lifted until the Secretary or State has determined that the facility has the management capacity to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of sections 1819 (b), (c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act. We are, as explained earlier in this preamble, imposing a substantial compliance standard for the purpose of imposing and lifting sanctions. Therefore, for the above mentioned remedies, we are requiring that the remedies be lifted when the facility achieves substantial compliance and the facility has demonstrated to the Secretary or the State that substantial compliance can be maintained. There is no statutory authority for the continuation of any other remedies past the date that a facility achieves substantial compliance. We are making changes to ยง488.330(b)(2)(ii) accordingly and corresponding changes to proposed ยง488.236 (redesignated as ยง488.454).
