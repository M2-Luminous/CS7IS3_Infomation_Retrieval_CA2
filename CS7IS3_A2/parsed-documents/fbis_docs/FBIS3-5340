FBIS3-5340 "dreas044_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 North Korea Paper Views Preconditions for Inspections SK0703050794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0459 GMT 7 Mar 94 SK0703050794 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- If the United States lays obstacle to the complete implementation of the agreement reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York and create artificial difficulties in the way of the talks by bringing forward such a precondition as the exchange of special envoys between the North and South of Korea in the future, it will reveal its intention not to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a signed commentary Monday. At a time when the agreed conclusions of the DPRK-USA contact in New York have begun to be implemented, the United States intends to set the exchange of special envoys between the North and South of Korea and the inspection by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] as preconditions of the suspension of the "Team Spirit 94" joint manoeuvres and the opening of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks, the analyst says, and continues: This makes us doubt whether it has the willingness to fully implement the conclusions or not. The stand of the United States that it will take an action only when the other side acts first, shows that it seeks a solution to the issue from the position of strength. This will only bring difficulties to the solution of the issue. Whether the issue is solved or not depends on how sincerely the United States, a dialogue partner, work to implement its commitments. Of importance here is for the United States to strictly observe the principle of the joint statement between the DPRK and the United States and renounce the attitude and stand to set preconditions, persisting only in its assertions. Such attitude and stand are only harmful to the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The United States must show in deeds its sincerity and willingness to solve the issue as a partner of the dialogue.
