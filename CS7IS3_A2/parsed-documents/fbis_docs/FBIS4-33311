Carlos Sosa Coello, chairman of the Chairman of the National Drug Interdiction Committee, told NOTIMEX "there are Honduran ships that illegally smuggle Chinese citizens into the United States and others transport fuel to Haiti." Sosa Coello charged that ships registered in Honduras were also detected in international waters carrying drugs. The Honduran National Congress is getting ready to discuss the existing Merchant Marine Law, through which a government leases its flag to foreign businessman who request it. The military controls the merchant marine, and the civilian government receives no income from the registering of foreign ships. The military does not provide or report on the amounts of money they earn for leasing the national flag, but sources at the Congress said the business could yield close to $40 million a year. "We have an open registry of merchant vessels in Honduras, from which every one profits except the treasury," Sosa Coello indicated. Nelman Sabillon, secretary of the Maritime Commission of the Foreign Ministry, said that since 1993 ships flying the Honduran flag have violated the then "partial" agreement to put a blockade on Haiti. The U.S. Coast Guard Service informed the Honduran Government that in 1993 it intercepted Honduran-flag vessels carrying fuel to Haiti. Bilateral agreements allow the United States to intercept and come aboard Honduran vessels and aircraft in international waters within the efforts the two countries are making to fight drug trafficking. Sabillon also disclosed that the previous month Japanese authorities filed a complaint against the Honduran-flag vessel Montana for carrying 60 Chinese nationals who were trying to enter the United States. Honduras has to deal with complaints from the United States, Japan, Canada, and France that Honduran-flag vessels are fishing illegally in their territorial waters to the detriment of their fishing resources, the Foreign Ministry official indicated.
