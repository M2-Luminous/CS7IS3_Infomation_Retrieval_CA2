FR940303-2-00151 FR940303-2-00083 [Release No. 34&hyph;33678; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;92&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 2 of a Proposed Rule Change Regarding an Information Memo on Odd-Lot Trading Practices February 24, 1994. I. Introduction On May 19, 1992, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 therunder, 2 a proposed rule change regarding the Exchange's odd-lot limit order handling procedures. The Exchange addresses several potential abuses of the procedures through the issuance of an Information Memo to all Members and Member Organizations. On November 20, 1992, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 The proposed rule change was published for comment, as amended, in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31615 (December 17, 1992), 57 FR 61137 (December 23, 1992). No comments were received on the proposal. On January 21, 1994, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change. 4 For the reasons discussed below, this order approves the proposed rule change, as amended, including Amendment No. 2 on an accelerated basis. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Brian M. McNamara, Managing Director, Market Surveillance, NYSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Commission, dated November 16, 1992. Amendment No. 1 clarified the Exchange's proposal by providing an example of a pattern of activity that could suggest day trading of odd-lot limit orders. 4 Amendment No. 2, in addition to other clarifying amendments, defined the term ``day trading'' as used in the Information Memo to describe prohibited odd-lot limit order activity. II. Description of the Proposal In February 1991, the Exchange implemented changes to its odd-lot 5 order handling procedures. 6 The changes were intended to afford pricing benefits to members and member organizations' customers and to provide an inexpensive and efficient order execution system compatible with traditional odd-lot investing practices of smaller investors. 5 An odd-lot market order is an order of less than a unit of trading to buy, sell, or sell short, which carries no further qualifying notations. The normal trading unit, or round lot, is 100 shares. 6 See NYSE Rule 124 for a complete description of the NYSE's odd-lot order execution system. One change established the use of ``Best Pricing Quote'' for pricing odd-lot market orders. This assures that an odd-lot market order sent to the Exchange for execution will be priced on the basis of the best prevailing national market system quotation for that security. 7 The second change eliminated all differentials on odd-lot limit orders entered by member organizations through the Exchange's system for odd-lots. 8 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28837 (January 29, 1991), 56 FR 4660 (February 5, 1991). 8 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28837 (January 29, 1991), 56 FR 4660 (February 5, 1991).
