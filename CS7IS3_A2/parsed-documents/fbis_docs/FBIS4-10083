Rebolledo said: "Ethics, transparency, and integrity constitute a very high priority for the government as a guideline for its public activities. The government acknowledges the concern expressed by politicians and congressmen over corruption. The government believes the Chilean political system is not suffering generalized corruption. It is very important to point this out. Our concern follows some signs that have turned up. It is yet not a generalized problem, but it is necessary to confront corruption promptly, to prevent this evil from installing itself in our political system." Rebolledo said that in the next few days measures will be adopted to combat corruption. The government will establish regulations to prevent corruption from installing itself in Chilean public life. The Political Interministerial Committee studied the priorities of the government's legislative agenda and concluded that tension over the prioritization of social and political-institutional subjects do not exist. The meeting confirmed that social aspects will be stressed, without overlooking other political reforms. There has been a total consensus regarding some reforms, like procedures to be adopted by joint committees in case of disagreement on a constitutional amendment between the two houses of Congress. There was consensus on subjects linked to citizenry, nationality, and other issues, like the case of direct elections for mayor. The committee also ratified other wide-reaching reforms that require open dialogue with the opposition: "We want to explore possibilities for consensus. We believe there is a spirit of dialogue, and it is understood that our institutional system can be modernized and improved."
