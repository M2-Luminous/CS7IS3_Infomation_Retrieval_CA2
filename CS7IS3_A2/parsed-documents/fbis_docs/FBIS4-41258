There are seven presidential nominees (often called "big seven"), and only a few of them have real chances to win. The state press, whose circulation has dramatically decreased, were the first to show their sympathies to this or that nominee. "HOLOS UKRAYINY" (parliament's newspaper) has the circulation of just 325,000 copies while "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (workers' gazette) -- 90,000. This concerns not only the state press, but also the popular "KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI" (Kiev news) and once mighty "VECHIRNIY KYYIV" (Kiev at night) -- 185,000 and 36,000, respectively. Even such small numbers of copies create the illusion of influence in the broad public. Last week, "HOLOS UKRAYINY" published 10 articles supporting Kravchuk's candidature and seven articles backing up Speaker Moroz. The articles supporting Moroz were the biggest (17,500 characters) which is quite natural since the newspaper belongs to the parliament. At the same time, "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (founded by the Cabinet and interregional association of businessmen) published just one but big article (13,000 characters) supporting the candidature of L.Kuchma. According to poll results, 27 percent of the electors will vote for Kravchuk, 20 percent for Kuchma, 11 percent for Moroz (sociologic center "Socis"); 35 percent for Kuchma, 20 percent for Kravchuk, 10 percent for Moroz (sociologic center "Ukrainian barometer"); 37 percent for Kuchma, 27 percent for Kravchuk, 16 percent for Lanovyy (sociologic center "News"). So, the basic contenders are Kuchma and Kravchuk. Regional studies in Ukraine's south and east show the following: 21 percent for Kuchma, 7 percent for Kravchuk, 4 percent for Moroz (center "Democratic initiatives"); 23 percent for Kuchma, 19 percent for Kravchuk, 10 percent for Moroz (center "Naval- express"). It is evident that Kuchma and Kravchuk will win the first round but it is hard to say who will be elected the President. The basic role here belongs to the central Ukraine having 10-15 percent of electors who still have not decided whom to support -- Kuchma or Kravchuk. Taking into account the fact that all votes of Plyushch and Talanchuk will go to Kravchuk like part of the votes of Lanovyy and Moroz, while the other part and all votes of Babych will go to Kuchma, I can predict that Kravchuk will receive 47 percent of votes, Kuchma -- 53 percent, or 35 percent and 33 percent of votes, respectively.
