The entire system characteristic of the political police has been organized by the UM 0215 -- the secret service of the Ministry of Interior [MI]. Under the leadership of the former interior minister, George Ion Danescu, and his close aide, General Dan Gheorghe, a few days ago still the chief of the UM 0215 Secret Service, a comprehensive and extremely precise work method was drafted, which is compulsory for all regional intelligence services. This method, which we possess, constitutes an indubitable proof that top officials in the Ministry of Interior have initiated the most flagrant violation of the Constitution and the country's laws, thus seriously jeopardizing our citizens' freedom. We want to specify that all information obtained from this extensive network of agents is entered on a daily basis in the computer of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. Then this information is used for political purposes. Thus, SRI is doing its dirty work with the help of the secret service of the Ministry of Interior. The astonishing thing is that a parliamentary commission (which checked unit 0215 some two months ago) discovered a number of irregularities, but failed to discover the essential thing. The secret of this monster within the Ministry of Interior has been carefully preserved so far. The espionage affair in which Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, counselor to President Ion iliescu and secretary of the country's Defense Council, was allegedly involved and the dismissals of Major General Gh. Diaconescu, chief of the SRI Espionage Department, and of General Dan Gheorghe, chief of the UM-0215 within the Ministry of Interior, as well as the espionage affair made public by Traian Basescu, at the end of which is General Grylakis [involved in Romanian fleet sale scandal], seem to be linked by certain threads but also through mysterious rivalries at the top executive level. Until the situation as a whole is clarified, we will reveal to the public the following details about the most serious political espionage case after 1989. If an earthquake will be triggered in the Ministry of Interior and the SRI, and in Romanian society on the whole, ending with the main protagonists on the accusation bench, then this means that Romania still has a chance to improve. Secret Work Method Here are the things with which the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Interior -- UM-0215 -- dealt beginning 26 March 1993 (when Circular No. 00608801 was officially and secretly disseminated). We will now summarize some of the compulsory objectives pursued by the agents at home and abroad: "1. Actions against national security; 2. Nationalist, irredentist, separatist, and racial actions; 3. Actions regarding the physical life and security of Romanian and foreign citizens whose security falls within the competence of the Ministry of Interior (so far nothing abnormal, the above activities being legal); 4. Specific information about antiterrorist actions (a strange activity because there is a specialized antiterrorist unit attached to the SRI, while, through the nature of things, the Watch and Protection Service (SPP) performs such activities); 5. Foreign citizens' actions; 6. Romanian citizens actions (and in this connection we will reproduce and specify certain aspects of the secret work method clearly revealing what 0215 actually pursued: `F. 63 -- attitudes, positions, assessments; F. 38 -- went abroad for specialization; F. 39 -- studied abroad; F. 40 -- went abroad for specialized assistance.'" Above I have outlined certain typical activities of the political police. And now further details). 7. Specific essentials regarding state and professional interests; 8. Specific essentials of the activity of information protection; 9. Essentials regarding antecedents; 10. Specific essentials regarding operative information about Romanians abroad. (And again some information about the method regarding these "essentials": "F. 12 -- employed at foreign missions or foreign branches in Romania; F. 81 -- temporarily resident abroad; F. 101 -- possession of funds; F. 107 -- people holding dual citizenship.") We hope that our readers realize how extensive and dangerous this network is, which has been set up under the guidance of the generals from the secret unit of the Ministry of Interior. Circular No. 00608801 is signed by deputy directors -- Colonel Marica, Colonel Condoiu, and Colonel Stan. We also want to specify that following dispositions issued for all regional units in a secret radiogram in May 1993, the information obtained by this network is no longer passed on to regional chiefs, but is necessarily entered in the SRI computer. We doubt that the opposition parties have access to the data obtained in this way. Sealing the mechanism whereby the Ministry of Interior is gradually being subordinated to the SRI, a decision was made whereby no one can be employed in the Ministry of Interior, without the agreement of the institution headed by Virgil Magureanu. We are waiting for the reaction of parliamentarians.
