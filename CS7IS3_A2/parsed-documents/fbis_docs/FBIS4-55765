Instead of slinging mud at its main rival, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), it strives to emphasize differences between the two parties and demonstrate why it would be advantageous for the country to vote for the Free Democrats, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a party meeting at Budaors today. "The SZDSZ fared well in the first round and retained almost all of its electoral base," Peto said, attributing his party's success to its unique reliability and well-founded policy. "In the first round, voters cast their ballots on parties rather than candidates because they wanted to dismiss the governing coalition. Now they will rather consider which candidate would better fit the post," Peto said. "For this reason, it would be advantageous for SZDSZ candidates to expound their views to the broadest possible audience, in various forums covered by local TV stations. In this competition, the SZDSZ has excellent chances because it has fielded plenty of highly qualified candidates," Peto said.
