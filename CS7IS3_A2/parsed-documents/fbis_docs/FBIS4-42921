However, once the problem had hit the fan -- "due to a number of newscasts which were too partisan" -- the Senate speaker joined issue and, in an interview with TG1 [RAI newscast] director Demetrio Volcic, which was broadcast yesterday during the "23.00 Hours" program, he agreed with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi on the fact that the public broadcaster ought not be antigovernment, and he added that, in the future, the company's top management ought to be appointed by the government. Here is the gist of what he said. [Volcic] Is it good or bad that the issue of the broadcast media has been posed now, and in such terms? [Scognamiglio] The problem must now be tackled, but it would have been better if it had never been posed and if things could have continued the normal way. However, I do not think that this was a piece of naivety, but rather a reaction against an attitude that called for such a reaction. What attitude? The broadcast media in general, not only the RAI, were showing a marked hostility toward the government. However, when a political force becomes the "state," the tone used must be adapted accordingly. [Volcic] Do you think the RAI is too critical of Berlusconi? [Scognamiglio] I think so. I do not watch TV very often, but two days ago I watched the TG3 newscast, which was an example of factiousness against the government. [Volcic] Must the company's senior management go? [Scognamiglio] The board of directors will stay legitimately in office until the end of its term. Afterwards, in the unfortunate event that once again the parliamentary speakers are called upon to appoint the top management, I can anticipate that another power-sharing agreement will not take place. [Volcic] Who should appoint the RAI's board of directors? [Scognamiglio] Just as in the United States the "agencies'" top management is appointed by the government under the control of a parliamentary commission, I believe that also in the RAI's case the government should be entrusted with the task of appointing the management, and the opposition forces should be entrusted with the task of critically vetting the appointments made. [Volcic] Does this not involve the risk that the winning tribe will eat up the losing tribe? [Scognamiglio] In a democracy, every rule can be used against the majority eventually when citizens, through their vote, decide to send the majority into opposition. [Volcic] Would you place public broadcasting in the government's hands? [Scognamiglio] Information should remain neutral, but someone must be responsible for appointing the top management. Whoever has been chosen by the citizens to govern the country must assume responsibility for the appointments. The citizens will judge. [Volcic] Is this not an unrealistic position? [Scognamiglio] In the United States, the vetting process undergone by the government's appointees is such as to make it very difficult for a professionally and morally unqualified person to be vetted.
