The study specimens, which had been deformed by rolling to a degree of 98 percent with intervening cycles of tempering, were examined under light and transmission electron microscopes. The structural studies were performed on specimen strips with a thickness of 10 �m. The alloy 0Kh12N12M3 was determined to have a coercitive force of 29.5 kA/m, a saturation induction of 0.13, and a residual magnetization of 0.09. The alloy 0Kh12N12K3 was determined to have a coercitive force of 62.9 kA/m, a saturation induction of 0.15, and a residual magnetization of 0.13. The particles of the specimens' _a_-phase were found to have very diverse shapes and sized and to contain the following characteristic types of particles/regions: 1) isolated small equiaxial or anisotropically shaped _a_-phase particles with a cross section of 4 to 10 nm and an axis (l/d) ratio of <3:1; 2) highly fragmented (i.e., in a block structure) particles of rather diverse shape with cross sections of 10 to 165 nm; and 3) colonies of elongated uniaxial particles with cross sections of 4 to 20 nm and an axis ratio between 3:1 and 12:1 (the direction of their long axes was generally close to the direction of rolling, and the particles often appeared to consist of individual fragments or chains of smaller particles within the confines of the defect band); and 4) regions with a relatively low density of _a_-phase measuring 0.5-3 �m. The studies indicated that the main contributor to the study alloys' level of magnetic properties are anisotropic particles with a heterogeneous structure consisting of disoriented fragments (blocks) and/or individual microparticles separated by _g_-phase interlayers.
