Shortly after 1000, members of the Nordic battalion arrived in this area. Their arrival was immediately followed by shelling of the settlements of Vrazici and [word indistinct] from the direction of Brusnica. At the same time, infantry attacks were launched on the northeast part of our commune, from the direction of (?Siljes and Kupusanik), which was supported by anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. The infantry attack was preceded by a strong artillery attack on the settlements of Celic and Ratkovici. More than 40 122-mm howitzer shells were fired from the direction of Markovac. In addition to material damage, they also wounded (?four) people in (?Celic). [passage omitted] The last report we received refers to an attack on the members of the Nordic battalion. As we were told, the chetnik fired five [words indistinct] directly at the armored vehicles of the Nordic battalion [words indistinct]. We do not have many details of this attack, but it confirms best the hypocrisy of the chetnik leader Karadzic, who promised that such incidents would not happen.
