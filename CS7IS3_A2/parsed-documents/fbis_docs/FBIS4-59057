In a statement to the Saudi news agency, the source said that Saudi Arabia remains committed to the Gulf Cooperation Council's [GCC] decisions whose stance has been general and unified. The source stressed that Saudi Arabia and the GCC states have not adopted a stance that poses difficulties, as Bentzur said. Posing difficulties, the source added, is procrastinating in the implementation of agreements.
