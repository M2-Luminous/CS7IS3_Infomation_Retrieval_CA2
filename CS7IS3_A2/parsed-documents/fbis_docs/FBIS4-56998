The amendment on the expropriation of U.S. citizens' property recently approved in the United States does not affect Nicaragua. The amendment contains three key points required for its application: 1. If the governments that have entered a democratic process have not returned the property in three years. 2. If an effective compensation process has not been implemented, or if the compensation is not adequate. 3. If a domestic procedure that foresees the prompt, adequate, and effective compensation according to international law has not been established. [Begin Leal recording] The recently approved amendment is not applicable in the case of Nicaragua. Why? Because for the last two years... [pauses] or for the last 18 months, we have been implementing an effective process. Some U.S. citizens have already received compensation bonds. Some U.S. citizens already have been given back their properties. The amendment is accordance with international law. [end recording] According to international law, the citizenship which is recognized is the citizenship one had at the time of the confiscation. At present, Nicaragua has 22 cases of U.S. citizens pending, Foreign Minister Leal explained. He said that any local or foreign citizen who does not agree with the value assigned to his property by the Confiscations Quantification Office may resort to international arbitration. Leal said Nicaragua is the only country that has a high number of claims by U.S. citizens, but it is trying to resolve them. [Begin Leal recording] We have the political will to resolve these cases. The president of the Republic has ordered the creation of a compensation system, a process whereby the property can be compensated for or returned. In addition, several ministers, such as the finance minister, myself, and others, are constantly meeting to review the progress of these cases. [end recording] This amendment is applicable to more than 30 countries worldwide.
