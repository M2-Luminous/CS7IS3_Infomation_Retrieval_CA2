We may say this is natural for Western nations. This implies that these nations seek to limit exports by developing countries and secure employment at home. Wages are low in developing countries. On top of this, these countries are proceeding to destroy price standards on a global economic scale by keeping the exchange rate of their currencies lower than their actual values. In this way, these countries are definitely taking away jobs from workers in the major industrialized nations. It can be well expected that sooner or later, Japan, too, will tread the same path as the Western nations because, among other reasons, it has proceeded with technological transplants, and its domestic industries have been hollowing out. Consequently, Japan should go along with the United States, but that would antagonize Asian countries. Therefore, Japan cannot choose this option. In that case, the only alternative is for Japan to thoroughly open its markets to foreign access and, as a result, help create more jobs. Unless Japan promotes industrial restructuring and clenches its teeth to strive toward high net productivity, it will not be able to open its markets to developing countries' products, nor will the Japanese economy continue to thrive in the future.
