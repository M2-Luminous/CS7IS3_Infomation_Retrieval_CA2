Aleksandrov article: "Thinking (dumayushchiy -- containing word "duma" in bold print) Ambassador. Is Lukin Wearing His Deputy's or His Ambassador's Hat Today?"] [Text] The State Duma International Affairs Committee intends to send President Boris Yeltsin an interesting document. This is its approximate content: Having considered your inquiry about the recall of Vladimir Lukin from the post of Russian Federation Ambassador to Washington, we express our agreement with his recall. At the same time we must inform you that probably for technical reasons your inquiry failed to reach our committee. Through this message the committee is reminding the president of his constitutional obligations or, to be more accurate, of his obligation to appoint and recall ambassadors only after consultations with the International Affairs Committees of both Federal Assembly chambers. But a strange situation has come about: Vladimir Lukin, elected a State Duma deputy and soon after chairman of a State Duma committee, has not yet been officially recalled from his previous position as ambassador and is consequently technically speaking serving in two roles. Whichever way you look at it, the Constitution is being contravened. Not at all because Lukin wants this but owing to the forgetfulness of the people in the presidential apparatus who should be making sure that the Constitution is being implemented -- especially in such minor and simple matters as an ambassador's recall. This situation is, however, certainly not absolutely unimportant. There has not until now been a sufficiently clear idea in the committee of how to interpret the reference in the Constitution to "consultations." The enquiry sent to the Russian Foreign Ministry seeking clarification by 1 February remained unanswered several days after the deadline. People within the committee think that there is no point in insisting on the American procedure for appointing ambassadors whereby the final say rests with the Senate. In Lukin's view, notification should be given in writing, after which hearings should take place in which experts and, of course, the nominees themselves participate, then the committee should make a decision which is brought to the president's attention and automatically made public. If the committee supports a candidacy proposed by the president, there is no problem. If, on the other hand, there are objections and the president nevertheless insists on his choice, then, Lukin says, the ambassador will have to live with the knowledge that people throughout the world, as well as in the country where he is posted, will know that parliament rejected his candidacy. Incidentally, the "unwanted" ambassador is not to be envied in these circumstances. The committee will have to try out this mechanism in practice in the very near future. Several key ambassadorial appointments are expected: Yuliy Vorontsov will replace Lukin in Washington, and current Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will replace Vorontsov at the United Nations. Lukin will finally have to be recalled....
