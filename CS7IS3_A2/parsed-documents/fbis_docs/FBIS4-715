[passage omitted] In the streets of Kigali there is already talk of trench warfare, something seen on the front line by Jean Helene: [Helene] Boulevard Umugamba has become a veritable front line: 200 meters from the airport, controlled by the government army, is the RPF's first barrier, and from this point on, along the lower lefthand side of the boulevard, runs a very long trench holding several dozen RPF fighters, who have positioned heavy machine guns in firing positions at regular intervals along it. Even when escorted by UN vehicles you must not hang about here, because bullets sometimes whistle past all around you. On the left is the former rebels' billet, which today is the core of the pocket of resistance taken by the RPF in the northeast section of the capital. To the right, just below the hill, extends a vast no-man's land, where its commandos venture out. [passage omitted]
