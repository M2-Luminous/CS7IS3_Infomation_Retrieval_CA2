The ministry's Director-General of Asian Affairs, Yu Pyong-u, called in Minister Shigeta and expressed regret over Nagano's remark, which runs contrary to the Tokyo government's official position on comfort women stated last Aug. 8. Nagano earlier enraged South Korea and other Asian countries by claiming in an interview with the MAINICHI newspaper that Japan was not an aggressor in the war and that the "rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese soldiers massacred thousands of Chinese civilians, was "a hoax." In a separate interview with KYODO News Service, he said comfort women were licensed prostitutes and their use by Japanese soldiers therefore could not be considered an insult to women or discrimination against Koreans. Minister Shigeta said he would report Seoul's protest to Tokyo. Historians say some 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers in front-line brothels between 1932 and 1945. Tokyo has formally admitted government involvement in running the brothels.
