Certainly, such an acknowledgement does not relieve the U.S. Administration of its prime responsibility for the outcome of this siege of Jordan's only port. It even doubles the U.S. responsibility for this siege, because the U.S. Navy is the party that carries out acts of harassment and inspection, and because the U.S. Administration is the party that controls the international decision that is supposed to be made to end Jordan's suffering and the pressures on it as a result of this unfair siege. By addressing this message directly to those concerned and by dotting the i's and crossing the t's by requesting the parties concerned to halt their pressure and lift the siege, Jordan is asking each party to assume its responsibility if this part of the world is to be stable and if peace based on justice, comprehensiveness, and durability is to be established. Jordan has never failed to comply with international norms and laws. Likewise, it has never departed from its policy on abiding by the UN resolutions. In return, the international community is supposed to champion Jordan's just demands by safeguarding its legitimate rights, understanding its constructive pan-Arab and regional role, and fairly examining the burdens Jordan is shouldering due to its position in the center of a region rocked by catastrophes and events due to international reasons, regional interpretations, and continued Israeli aggression after the Zionist entity was established on the land of Palestine. Having realized that it is mainly behind many of the reasons for the suffering Jordan is facing and for the repercussions Jordan is enduring, the United States must move from sweet words that indicate it is aware of Jordan's suffering as a result of the siege to making a decision. Such a decision should not only lift the unfair embargo, but should also prove, by deeds, that the U.S. Administration is in the process of addressing the repercussions resulting from the series of injuries and mistakes committed against this country. Everyone should be confident that Jordan will not yield to pressure, change its positions, or relinquish its constant principles to suit circumstances or occasions.
