[passage omitted] RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] military spokesman, Dr. Emmanuel Ndahiro, is at their headquarters in Mulindi in northern Rwanda. Robin White asked him how much progress they were claiming to have made. [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Part of our force that has been heading toward Kigali is within and around Kigali. We are holding about four positions within and around Kigali. [White] And when did you capture these positions? [Ndahiro] We started fighting (?there) in the morning and just before midday, we had already taken those positions. [White] And what is your objective? Are you trying to capture Kigali at the moment or what? [Ndahiro] We still feel Kigali is still in chaos; there is no order and the priority objective is to reestablish law and order in that capital, and then we can think about what to do next. [White] So, you are trying to capture Kigali? [Ndahiro] We are being very cautious but ultimately, we are moving into Kigali. [White] Do you not think that that is likely to cause even more bloodshed? [Ndahiro] Inevitably, there will be bloodshed, but we shall have at least stopped the force that is busy killing our people and mainly killing the innocent civilians who are not armed. So, if we can neutralize that force, the government force, that is killing the people, we shall certainly stop fighting. [White] You said this particular force. Which force do you mean? [Ndahiro] Specifically the (?first) force that is busy liquidating the people is the Presidential Guard and certain elements in the Gendarmerie. So until we achieve that primary objective of making this force incapable of operating, we shall not stop fighting. [White] Have any people from the national Army defected to your side? [Ndahiro] We have had some who have been captured, not necessarily defected, but in certain quarters we are told that some forces are not ready to fight and they are only being forced to fight. So, we feel that that is a potential force that can come on to our side. [White] You have been talking about Kigali, is there fighting going on any where else? [Ndahiro] Yeah, fighting is going on in the northern part of the country. We have so far, I would say, liberated most of Mutara that is the eastern part of the country in the north. We have gone far as Gabiro. Gabiro has fallen, it is in our hands now. We had earlier seized [words indistinct] Nyumba, we are shelling it. We hope to thrash other forces out, but the UN monitoring force that is in Nyumba requested us to hold our fire so that they could be able to evacuate their forces there, and we complied for as long as they are evacuating their own. [White] Do you really believe that you can win a military victory? [Ndahiro] I told you earlier that our intention is not a military victory. We want to stop the senseless killing that is going on in Kigali. [end recording]
