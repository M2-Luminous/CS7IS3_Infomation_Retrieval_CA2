As if that were not enough, 17 of the aircraft have the capacity for intervention on the open sea, allowing their crews to board suspicious vessels. It is a powerful armada. In Portugal, there is no clear perception of whether the surveillance on the coast for this purpose is assigned to the force that resulted from the abolishment of the Customs Guard, or to the Navy, although it is the former that controls the sophisticated system for detecting suspicious vessels that has been set up along the coast. At least the results of this type of surveillance have never been observed. However, since the early 1980's, Portugal has been one of the main entryways for traffickers into Europe. The Portuguese Criminal Investigations Police inspector, Dias Costa, a specialist in the investigation of the international traffic, prepared a study on Portugal's transformation into a major area for the entry of South American cocaine and Moroccan hashish into Europe. Factors of a political and economic nature, particularly the Spanish authorities' protectionism for the public tobacco enterprise, prompted the Galician contraband and drug trafficking groups to concentrate their drug unloading activities in Viano do Castelo and in the Algarve, particularly in Lagos, Portimao, and Sagres. Dias Costa remarks: "Although the Spanish traffickers harbor a special preference for the Algarve in their activities, since it is a region protected from winds, even those in summer, and is located closer to Morocco, they have begun spreading their influence more toward the north. Some still remained in the Palmela area until 1986." According to Dias Costa, the advancement to the Alentejo coast and the Setubal peninsula may have been due to the "considerable support that was found, enabling them to carry out the unloading without any problems." The fact is that, after the arrest of the drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and of the Charlins brothers, in Troia, the Galician traffickers' methods changed. This occurred because they concluded that they could avoid risks and expense by transporting drugs to the Portuguese coast, since they have at their disposal here "a multitude of fishermen with financial and logistical problems of all kinds." Dias Costa recalls that: "At that time, there were fishermen who were selling essential parts of the equipment on their boats, even anchors, so as to be able to meet the most fundamental needs of their families." As a result, a situation difficult to control was created. "Let's not deceive ourselves. The unloading of hashish and cocaine on our seacoast is occurring at such a rate that no one could, in all honesty, tell how many hundreds of tons of either drug passed through here last year."
