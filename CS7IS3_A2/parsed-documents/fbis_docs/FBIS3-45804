Hubei, a major agricultural province, has abundant extra labor. Last year nearly 800,000 rural people left their homes to hunt for jobs elsewhere. To enhance labor management, an overall labor export management network has been set up across the province, with more than 700 employment service centers which are responsible for surveys relating to rural labor resources, basic training and establishing contacts with enterprises short of workers. So far, the province has set up over 110 training centers which run short-term training classes covering nearly 100 types of work. To reduce the haphazardness of labor exports, the province has made efforts to improve its information service to supply appropriate workers to enterprises in the economically vibrant southern China provinces like Guangdong and Hainan. In addition, the province has began to arrange for laborers to go abroad for job opportunities -- chiefly people engaged in medical, mechanical and manual services. On the other hand, a lot of experienced laborers are returning home to start their own businesses. Provincial government officials said the province is also reforming its own labor employment by improving its social security system and fostering a healthy labor market.
