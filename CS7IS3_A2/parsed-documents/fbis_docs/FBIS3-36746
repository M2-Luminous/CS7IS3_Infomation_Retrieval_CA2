Because at the end of the day, the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Skrunda and the dismantling of the Skrunda radar station are currently the most topical issues for Latvian security policy. The government is currently working on Latvian stance at talks with our eastern neighboring state and on the signing of corresponding agreements. And Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs is reporting about that. [Begin Birkavs recording] Now it has become more or less clear to everyone that security is really the number one priority for Latvia and I would say for the whole Baltics. Taking into account that the talks with Russia are entering the decisive phase, I think that we have to give a wide and complete idea of what will happen if we conclude the agreement and what will happen if we do not conclude the agreement. Latvia has to conclude an agreement with Russia on possibly earlier troop withdrawal and the deadline is 31 August. Skrunda is to be left here for four years and 18 months. With our strong stance not to yield, we have practically secured very stable support for Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania from American and European states and a guarantee that they will support us and that they will bolster us, but this agreement has to be concluded. These signals which come from other countries of the world. They will considerably intensify in the future, as soon as the agreement is concluded and they will become particularly active after the 31st when there will be no [Russian] Army here. [end recording] However, as the experience shows, agreements concluded with Russia do not at all mean that they will be really complied with and Valdis Birkavs is continuing about possible guarantees in such case. [Begin Birkavs recording] We wish to begin the dismantling [of the Skrunda radar] much sooner and I hope that we will succeed in it. However, while it is worked on -- and the Russian side, at least at the previous talks, agreed -- we will also work on a corresponding security mechanism, which means that the system of international security guarantees would come into effect in the event that the agreement is not complied with. [end recording] This is an excerpt from yesterday's press conference, at which Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs was speaking.
