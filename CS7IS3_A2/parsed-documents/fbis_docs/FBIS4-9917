He added that the OAS "has always thought" that the reintegration of Cuba to the organization "is desirable." "However, most countries believe that given the current circumstances, it is impossible," he pointed out. In an interview published today by EL ESPECTADOR newspaper, the Colombian president said, "it is not up to me to determine the scope of the changes," but "I hope that within a few years, this change will be possible." Gaviria recalled that the so-called Group of Three -- Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela -- has always favored holding talks with Cuba to seek ways to implement reforms in Cuba. However, Gaviria underscored, "there are countries that are very skeptical about conducting such talks; nevertheless, we have always advocated them."
