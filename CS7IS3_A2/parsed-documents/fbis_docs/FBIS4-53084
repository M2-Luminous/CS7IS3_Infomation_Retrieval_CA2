The rally, called the "Okinawan People's Rally To Protect Peace and Livelihood," was sponsored by the Okinawa Peace Movement Center. Approximately 3,000 participants, including members from local labor unions and other organizations, gathered at the rally held at Kaneku beachside park in Kaneku, Kadena Township. At the rally, Zenshun Arakaki, chairman of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center, which sponsored the rally, first delivered a speech. He said: Even after the conclusion of the battle for Okinawa, the Okinawan people have been deprived of their human rights under U.S. military rule. Twenty-two years have passed since the reversion of Okinawa to Japan, but damages continue to be inflicted upon Okinawa due to U.S. military exercises and accidents. Recently, it was disclosed that there exists a secret deal which was concluded between the Japanese and U.S. Governments regarding Japanese approval of the U.S. military's bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa in case of emergencies. We cannot allow a situation like this at all. We must now join our hands to turn Okinawa into a peaceful island. Later at the rally, representatives from various participating organizations delivered speeches, expressing opposition to war and advocating peace. Most of the participants at the rally were those who started marching on 13 May from various locations in the island in the peace parade, during which they walked the streets and appealed for peace. The participants, whose faces were sun-tanned, listened attentively to the speeches. The rally concluded after the participants adopted a resolution calling for immediate removal of U.S. military bases and clarification about the issue of the secret deal regarding bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa.
