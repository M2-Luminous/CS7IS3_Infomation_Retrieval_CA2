ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA partially approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ), including: control measures, technical analyses, and other Clean Air Act SIP requirements, with the exception of the quantitative milestones element. The SIP was submitted by the Governor of Colorado in a letter dated March 17, 1993 to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable SIP for the Telluride, Colorado moderate PM 10 nonattainment area. EPA conditionally approves the quantitative milestone element because the SIP does not demonstrate maintenance of the PM 10 NAAQS through 1997. However, the State has committed to adopt control measures necessary to provide for maintenance. In addition, EPA approves the SIP revision submitted by the Governor with a letter dated December 9, 1993 to address contingency measure requirements for the Telluride moderate PM 10 nonattainment area. Finally, EPA amends the boundary for the Telluride nonattainment area to clarify the original description. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on October 19, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amy Platt, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, (303) 293&hyph;1769. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Telluride, Colorado area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991), 40 CFR 81.306 (Telluride). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 2 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and Subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992 and 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) [including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)] shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). The State has submitted such a permit program, and EPA will address that submittal in a separate action. Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve reasonable further progress or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). The State of Colorado has submitted contingency measures for Telluride and EPA is addressing those measures in this action. On June 23, 1994, EPA announced its proposed action on the Telluride, Colorado moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP and contingency measures (59 FR 32397&hyph;32405). In that proposed rulemaking and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described its interpretations of title I and its rationale for the proposed rulemaking taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 32404). No comments were received. This final action on the Telluride moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP is unchanged from the June 23, 1994 proposed action. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred to the June 23, 1994 proposed rule for a more in depth discussion of the action now being finalized.
