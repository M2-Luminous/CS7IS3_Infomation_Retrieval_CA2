Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee and first secretary of the party committee of the garrison; and Yang Zhihua, commander, and Yang Huichuan, political commissar of the garrison, attended the session and presented awards to the advanced units and individuals who were commended. The session discussed ways to implement the guidelines of the recent enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission and the enlarged session of the party committee of the Beijing Military Region, summarized last year's work, and arranged this year's tasks. Under the leadership of the party committee of the Beijing Military Region and the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee, the Tianjin Garrison paid great attention to the education for studying the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the enlarged meeting of the military commission and achieved notable results in raising the political level of its units in the past year. It made conscientious efforts to meet the requirement for taking military training as the focus and thus created a new situation in military training. It made efforts to improve party style and maintain honesty in performance of duty and further strengthened the leading bodies of the party committees at and above the regimental level. It conducted strict management and education to maintain a high degree of stability and unity of its units. It also enhanced the capacity for logistic support and achieved new development in logistic technical support and production. The session urged that in the new year, all the units of the garrison should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission and the enlarged session of the party committee of the Beijing Military Region; achieve good results in the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, in the improvement of the ideology and work styles of leading bodies, in the reform of the military training, and in the implementation of the "outlines of the grass-roots building of the Army;" maintain a high degree of stability and unity; and successfully fulfill all tasks. It urged the vast number of commanders and soldiers, militiamen, and armymen in reserve duty of the entire garrison to "attach importance to study, abide by discipline, stress unity, and carry out work," raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, and further open up a new situation in army building and building the forces in reserve duty. Gao Dezhan gave an important speech at the session. He said: The Tianjin Garrison and the units stationed in Tianjin have actively participated in Tianjin's economic construction and various public welfare undertakings over the past many years. They have played an important role in building key projects, conducting emergency rescue and relief work, and safeguarding political and social stability and made outstanding contributions to promoting the two civilizations in Tianjin. Every achievement of Tianjin in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive is linked to the great support of the People's Army and embodies the painstaking labor and wisdom of the people's own army. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our minds and guide our action is the basic guarantee for promoting reform, opening up, and the modernization drive and also for comprehensively improving the contingents and revolutionizing, modernizing, and regularizing the Army. All levels should regard the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as a basic task and conscientiously fulfill it. We should intensively study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on the army building of the new period, exert great efforts to improve leading bodies, and successfully build the Army to make it "politically qualified, militarily competent, good in work styles, strict in abiding by discipline, and reliable in providing logistic support." Gao Dezhan pointed out: The Tianjin Garrison and the Army units stationed in Tianjin should set a good example in consolidating and developing the unity between the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians, in supporting local economic construction, in safeguarding social stability, and in building the spiritual civilization. They should fully develop their advantages and make new contributions to accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic development. While improving themselves and conducting training for war preparedness, they should actively support local key projects, social welfare projects, farmland water conservancy projects, and emergency rescue and disaster relief work. They should actively participate in the comprehensive management of public security to safeguard the political and social stability of the municipality. They should continue the activities for the Army and the civilians to build the socialist spiritual civilization together to create a good social environment for accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development. They should continue the activities to build the districts and counties exemplary in the double-support work and, through the concerted efforts of the Army and local authorities, make the advanced districts still more advanced, make the mediocre districts catch up with and surpass the advanced districts, and promote Tianjin's double-support work to a new height. Speaking on intensifying efforts to improve reserve forces, Gao Dezhan said: Party committees and governments at all levels should correctly handle the relationship between economic work and the work of the militia and reserve forces and make conscientious efforts to address the specific problems in the work of the militia and reserve forces. We should embrace the idea of focusing on economic construction when developing the militia and persistently use, train, and make strong the Army on the major battleground of economic construction. We should conduct study to explore the new ways to improve the reserve forces in the condition of the socialist market economy and make efforts to achieve success in the work of the militia and reserve forces in the new period. With the establishment of the socialist market economy system, the work of the militia and reserve forces can only be strengthened and not weakened. We should improve the organizations of the grass-roots people's armed forces departments in line with the "regulations on the militia and reserve forces of enterprises." Gao Dezhan also urged: Local party committees and governments at all levels should intensify the work to support the Army and give preferential treatment to disabled servicemen and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and consider it their responsibility to support army building. The municipal party committee and government should take the lead in conscientiously studying and addressing the issues on supporting army building. They should wholeheartedly help local Army units resolve the difficulties in the duties for war preparedness, construction for national defense, production and business, and scientific research. They should comprehensively implement the various policies on giving special care to disabled servicemen and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen; place demobilized and retired soldiers, Army cadres transferred to civilian jobs, and retired cadres in a down- to-earth manner; earnestly solve the problems in the job and school arrangements for the accompanying dependents of Army officers; and do a good job in the special care and medical service to disabled servicemen and the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen in order to eliminate their misgivings and provide favorable conditions for strengthening army building. In conclusion, Gao Dezhan emphasized: Strong unity between the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians is a fine tradition of our party and our Army and an important magic weapon to win success in revolution and construction. We should develop this tradition still more in the new situation. Let us unite more closely round the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, establish closer ties between the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians, work hard in unison, follow the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and win new success with full confidence.
