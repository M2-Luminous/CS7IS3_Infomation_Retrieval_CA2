According to the survey, a move is accelerating to expand the network throughout Europe beyond national and agency precincts to provide for effective use of research resources and the operational and maintenance systems for the network should be of interest to Japan. The STA will step up its dialogue with Europe with a view to connecting Japan's research data network with the European network. According to the survey report, there are two research data networks which cover the European region, including "E-Bone" which has grown from what was once a grass-roots-type network and "Europa NET" which was built under the sponsorship of the European Commission. Both have been in existence for one or two years since beginning official operations, but it is said that "There is a need to watch future developments and trends in various nations and agencies." The two systems utilize data bases such as a research and development data system known as "CORDIS" maintained and offered for use in a broad range of applied research and considered necessary for future use by Japan. Dialogue between the survey group and the European Commission produced a desire for future reciprocal linkage and conduct of joint research by Japan, the United States and Europe in expanding Japan's research data network. Further, France expressed the opinion that, "Since U.S. influence is disproportionately strong in the area of research data networks, it is important that Europe and Asia exert greater effort in collaborating with each other."
