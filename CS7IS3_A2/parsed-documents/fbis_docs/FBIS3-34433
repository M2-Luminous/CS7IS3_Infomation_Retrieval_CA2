[passage omitted] Referring to the arrogant powers' propaganda invasion of Iran His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: The enemies of the revolution accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran of having military tendencies and seeking banned weapons, while America and her accomplices, including the usurper Zionist regime, produce, sell, and use -- wherever they feel necessary -- the most forbidden of weapons such as chemical and nuclear weapons. They placed masses of chemical weapons at the Iraqi regime's disposal during the imposed war, which were used right in front of their noses, and they saw our wounded, too. But they still continued selling banned weapons to Iraq. The leader of the Islamic revolution said the arrogant powers have no right to talk about banned arms. He said: We will do anything which conforms to our principles, and if we deem it necessary we will manufacture or obtain weapons, as we did during the imposed war. But we do not seek to obtain and use banned weapons, because we respect our principles and faith. His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i attributed the largest volume of weapons' sale in the region and the world to countries in line with the aims of arrogant powers. He said: We have no fear of the false and biased propaganda of the enemy. Such propaganda will not prevent us from continuing on our correct path. We have no arms deals. Compared to the large purchases of countries which act in line with America's goals our arms purchases are infinitesimal, because we do not need them. [passage omitted]
