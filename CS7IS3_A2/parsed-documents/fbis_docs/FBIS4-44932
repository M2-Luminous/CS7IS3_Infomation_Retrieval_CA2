He said that his country "seeks to build a modern state, to achieve development, and to lay down the bases of democracy." The Syrian minister made the statements yesterday at a symposium that followed the inauguration of a Syrian products fair, entitled "Made in Syria" and sponsored by the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce in London. The fair will continue until 6 May 1994. The Syrian minister touched on his country's economic policy, saying that Syria is working to achieve economic independence and to take advantage of advanced knowledge in the science and technology area "while it bolsters the Arab economic cooperation procession." He added that the backbone of Syria's socio-economic and political system is an economic plurality that "guarantees every individual's economic freedom." He pointed out that economically this means the "presence of a public sector along with a private sector and a joint sector." Al-'Imadi said that one of the important distinguishing marks in the Syrian economic procession is the process of gradual opening up to the market economy "in which the public sector coexists with a competing private sector." He pointed out that Syria launched this process by educating the people and preparing them to accept these principles "so the experiment will proceed in a fashion that spares the country social and political obstacles." He also said that Syria has managed, despite the recent difficult years, to raise its gross national product (from 83 billion Syrian pounds to 410 billion pounds in 1993). On inflation, al-'Imadi said that it was reduced from 26.3 percent in 1985 to 5.7 percent in 1993 "when capital components rose from 20 billion pounds in 1985 to 100 billion pounds in 1993, and when the exports and imports volume rose from 33.8 billion pounds in 1987 to 60.7 billion pounds in 1993." Minister al-'Imadi also touched on political relations between his country and Britain, saying that they are good and that mutual visits between Syrian and British ministers "have laid down the foundations of mutual understanding between the two countries on problems facing the Arab region and the world." He added, "I still recall Mrs. Margaret Thatcher's visit to Syria when she was the shadow cabinet prime minister. Our president welcomed her and introduced her to his family members." Al-'Imadi further added, "I also still recall the post-World War II period when British forces ousted Vichy's military regime from Syria when Syria's wheat was the source of the bread that fed Allied troops in our region." He also said that the accord, which he had the honor to sign in Damascus in 1976 with Michael Mitcher, the then deputy minister for parliamentary affairs [name and title as published] "is still the basis on which relations between our two countries are founded." Al-'Imadi noted that the said accord called for bolstering economic relations and industrial exchange in the service of both sides. The accord further called for establishing a British-Syrian Council to achieve various objectives, including determination of the areas from which both sides can benefit and examination of the means that ensure the implementation of development projects. He said that the aforementioned council met in April 1980 and underlined the importance of increasing trade between Britain and Syria and of visits by businessmen's delegations, as well as the benefit of participation in trade fairs, particularly specialized fairs. Minister al-'Imadi welcomed foreign investments in his country, saying, "Syria enjoys numerous advantages, including geographic position; a balanced industrial base that includes agriculture, oil and gas, industry, tourism, and commerce; a significant market of 13 million people; trade ties between Syria and the Arab countries; tax exemptions offered by Syria's investment laws; the stability Syria has achieved in the past one-quarter century; the availability of labor and skilled manpower; the presence of large groups of energetic businessmen; and people's openness and their ability to cooperate with others." The "Made in Syria" fair is the first Syrian products fair organized outside the Arab world. A total of 160 Syrian companies have participated in it. The fair opening was attended by hundreds of Arab and foreign businessmen, plus Arab ambassadors and officials and a Syrian delegation comprised of 10 individuals representing Syria's various ministries. Displayed products range from food products to traditional and modern products and textiles, machines, and other products. At the symposium, held at the Hilton Hotel, Sir Richard Beaumont, the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce chairman, said in the address with which he opened the symposium that the fair idea "was welcomed by our Syrian friends." The discussion touched on Syria and focused on its political importance in the Middle East. It also highlighted Syria's trade importance in history "when it was a sea region [engaged] in the silk and frankincense trade." On the sidelines of the symposium, AL-HAYAH interviewed Muhammad Khadr, Syria's ambassador to Britain, who said that now that British-Syrian relations have improved, "especially since British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd's visit to Syria," the idea of the fair has become necessary. Khadr added that the fair comes within the context of bolstering trade between Britain and Syria, of "familiarizing British export and import companies with Syrian products, and of providing the opportunity to Syrian businessmen from the public, private, and joint sectors to take part in this fair, which we consider more of a demonstration than a fair." In a related development, AL-HAYAH has also interviewed Dr. Ratib al- Shallah, chairman of the Chambers of Commerce Union and of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce. He pointed out that the idea of the fair emanates from Syria's keenness on the future, "especially since what we produced a few years ago wasn't enough for us, whereas we produce a surplus now as a result of the projects implemented in accordance with Investment Law No. 10 of 1991." Al-Shallah noted that the goal of the fair is to familiarize the Syrian producer with world markets "so he can hear praise, criticism, and recommendations; so he can learn the type of standards demanded by the world market; and so he can be in constant contact with available technologies that enable him to compete in world markets." Despite praising his country for producing an agricultural and industrial surplus, al-Shallah said that Syria does not want to encounter a crisis of production surplus for which there are no markets, "whether at home or abroad or in terms of quality or of prices." Answering a question on whether displayed products reflect the degree of development achieved by Syria in the industrial and agricultural sectors, al-Shallah, who is a prominent Syrian businessman, said, "The fair doesn't at all reflect the true character of Syria's agricultural and industrial production." He added that officials of the Chambers of Commerce Union and of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce were not able to contact all producers, especially those who have no surplus to sell. "But we expect that participation by Syrian producers in future fairs will be much stronger." Adib Ghanam, the assistant information minister, said in the question-and-answer session of the symposium that in addition to the current television channel, Syria plans to establish a television channel operated by artificial satellites. He told AL-HAYAH that Syria has concluded an agreement with Arabsat, Arab Satellite, to start transmitting via artificial satellites by 1996. He said that the channel will transmit in Arabic and English. Martin Baker, the official in charge of the branch that deals with British exports to Asia, Africa, and Australia at the British Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has said that Mike Heseltine, the British secretary of trade and industry, has decided that Syria will be included in a list of 80 countries to which Britain aspires to export. Baker added that tourism is the most attractive sphere of investment in Syria currently. A participant asked Dr. al-'Imadi if multiple currency exchange rates continue to exist in Syria and if there is a possibility of floating Syrian currency or of establishing a single uniform price for the Syrian pound in the near future. The minister answered, "The purpose of the policy embraced by the Syrian Government recently is to unify the exchange rates so they will be as close to the market rate as possible." Al-'Imadi noted that unifying the various exchange rates has created the so-called "neighboring countries exchange rate." Al-'Imadi added that customs tariffs have been applied as of the beginning of this month on the basis of the average exchange rate, which is 23 pounds per dollar instead of 11.25 pounds per dollar, excluding foodstuffs and raw materials. However, al-'Imadi warned that changing exchange rates dictates that the Syrian Government be aware of the social ramifications. Dr. Ratib al-Shallah said that, even though it is desirable to have a unified exchange rate, the step could be "costly" to some people. As an example, he cited the question of applying an exchange rate of 44 or 45 pounds per dollar to assess customs tariffs. He said that such a rate would pose hardship to the working classes and to people with a limited income.
