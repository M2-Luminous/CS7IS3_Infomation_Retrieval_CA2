FBIS4-27485 "dreas106_n_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Vietnam * Factory Produces Quality Liquid Nitrogen * Factory Produces Quality Liquid Nitrogen 94P30060B 94P30060B CSO [Editorial Report] The 7 April QUAN DOI NHAN DAN reports that for many years, production at the Yen Vien Oxygen Plant has satisfied domestic industrial and medical needs for oxygen, CO2, nitrogen, and calcium carbide, particularly in the north. Recently, the plant succeeded in producing 99.99 percent pure liquid nitrogen, essential for the manufacture of TV picture tubes and for other high-tech industrial sectors. Yen Vien is the only plant in the country which can produce liquid nitrogen. Research and development efforts on liquid nitrogen were begun by the plant's own cadres and technicians in 1993, with the first successful test production occurring in early 1994. It is noteworthy that this was achieved with old Soviet equipment. Tests conducted using equipment from the Netherlands confirmed that international standards had been achieved. Thus, as of this year, the plant can reliably meet all domestic needs (including joint enterprises) for 99.7 percent pure liquid oxygen, 99.9 percent pure liquid nitrogen, CO2, and C2H2. For the first quarter of 1994, the plant's total sales rose 13.2 percent over the same quarter of last year. Sales of oxygen, the chief product, increased by 73.26 percent in the same period.
