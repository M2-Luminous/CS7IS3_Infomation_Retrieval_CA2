How do are you proceeding? [Vork] Our people -- a total of 240 men from over 20 states -- have been positioned at all important border crossings into Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine. They monitor all deliveries to and from Serbia and Montenegro. In 19 months, we have discovered several thousand violations of the embargo. [Correspondent] Who breaks the embargo most frequently? [Vork] The large European states are mostly involved because the majority of businesses with Serbian participation are located in Germany or Italy. Many of them claim to have subsidiaries in FYROM. Our investigations usually reveal two things: Either these businesses do not exist, which means that they have been invented by criminals. Or the business exists, but it never issued the consignment documents. [Correspondent] This applies to the export of goods from Serbia. What about imports? [Vork] Since the adoption of UN Resolution 820... [Correspondent] ...which was adopted in May 1993 and also bans the transit of goods through Serbia... [Vork] ...the number of attempts to import goods has declined. Yet the number is still very high. In addition, false UN documents are being used. Instead of applying for permits with the Sanctions Committee in New York, perfect fakes are used. The biggest problem continues to be attempts to smuggle crude oil into the country. [Correspondent] You are facing strong criticism because ships on the Danube have succeeded to this very day in smuggling tanker-loads of oil products on the Danube before the eyes of the controllers. [Vork] It is right that there are logistic shortcomings. The Romanian customs authorities, for example, had no fast boat. We have now acquired one, but we cannot be everywhere at the same time. In the Black Sea, a Ukrainian 5,000-tonne steamer recently ignored all requests to stop. A Bulgarian warship finally stopped it. The ship wanted to unload oil for the Serbs at a small Romanian port. The local authorities decide whether ships are stopped or not. [Correspondent] What is coming from other directions, that is from West Europe? [Vork] Things are easier for us on the Danube in Hungary. Road crossings are being monitored tightly. For this reason, violations are increasing in the Adriatic Sea. Ships appearing on the radar screen claim that their crude oil is destined for Croatian enterprises. We then contact the ports of Rijeka or Koper and ascertain whether the company mentioned really exists. A few days ago, we sent back another 85,000-tonne oil tanker in cooperation with NATO warships. [Correspondent] Let me ask you a question about deals with third countries. It is well known that Serbian enterprises are operating under cover everywhere in East Europe. With the proceeds earned from these trade activities, the headquarters in Belgrade buys goods in the international black market. [Vork] Things like that happen even in Vienna. A Swiss company may act as the agent of an enterprise in Kiev, for example, which is known to belong to a Serb. The financial transaction takes place in Vienna. Completely new mafia-like structures are developing in the East. Frequently, these criminals are armed. [Correspondent] Are Austrians involved in the smuggling activities? [Vork] A total of 224 violations on the part of Austrian companies have been registered. Of an overall number of 5,855 cases, 1,600 violations alone have been committed by the FYROM. Over 600 infringements have been carried out by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, and Germany.
