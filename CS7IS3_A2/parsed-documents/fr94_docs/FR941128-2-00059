FR941128-2-00059 FR941128-2-00044 The Reserve Banks project that 1995 revenues will recover 100.0 percent of expenses, including targeted ROE and $5.0 million in automation consolidation special project costs. Approximately $0.2 million of automation consolidation special project costs that were deferred and financed in prior years will be recovered, leaving $12.0 million of accumulated special project costs to be recovered in the future. Automated Clearing House (ACH) Table 4 presents the actual 1993, estimated 1994, and projected 1995 cost recovery performance for the commercial ACH service.

The principal factors contributing to the revenue shortfall were (1) higher than planned costs for the development of new ACH processing software to operate in the consolidated automation environment and (2) lower than expected non-automated revenues. Overall, commercial volume increased by 16.4 percent over the 1992 volume level. 1994 Performance Through September 1994, revenues from the ACH service recovered 97.4 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 96.9 percent for the year. Due to the planned underrecovery, all $7.6 million of automation consolidation special project costs are being deferred and financed. Year-to-date commercial volume increased 16.9 percent, compared to the same period in 1993. For 1994, the Reserve Banks now forecast that revenues will recover 94.0 percent of commercial ACH costs, based on estimated volume growth of 14.5 percent for the year. While the Reserve Banks' current estimate may be conservative, the following factors contribute to the Reserve Banks' projected variation from plan: (1) The ACH service's $1.9 million share of the pre-tax reduction in pension credits; (2) Faster-than-planned conversion of paper returns and notifications of change (NOCs) to electronic alternatives; and (3) Lower revenues due to shifting commercial volume from the premium exchange to an earlier exchange, which was made possible by the addition of two ACH processing cycles beginning October 1, 1993. 1995 Issues The slower, 12.9 percent, rate of increase in commercial ACH transaction volume projected for 1995 reflects anticipated, increased competition from private-sector ACH operators and continued consolidation in the banking industry, which creates more ``on-us'' transfers. While the volume of commercial ACH transactions has been growing at a decreasing rate, dropping from 24 percent in 1990 to 17 percent for the first nine months of 1994, it is likely that the Reserve Banks' forecast for 1995 understates the potential growth rate. The Reserve Banks' cost control programs are expected to result in a 3 percent reduction in operating expenses. During 1995, the Reserve Banks will test the new ACH application software developed over the last several years and begin to implement it. Although all Reserve Banks expect to make the transition to the new processing software by year-end 1995, the precise schedule of that transition remains uncertain. Delays in the implementation schedule may cause costs to vary significantly from budget. 1995 Fees The Board has approved only one change to the current ACH fees for 1995, an increase in the fee for processing government paper NOCs from $5.00 to $10.00, the current fee for commercial paper NOCs. 5 The higher fee better reflects the cost of providing this manual service and would provide an additional incentive for depository institutions to migrate to a more fully electronic ACH processing environment. 5 On October 26, 1994, the Department of the Treasury agreed that the Federal Reserve Banks may assess a fee of $10.00 for government paper NOCs beginning in 1995. Based on the approved fee schedule, the Reserve Banks forecast that the commercial ACH service will recover 100.0 percent of costs, including targeted ROE and $3.4 million of the current year's automation consolidation special project costs. The remaining $0.6 million of current year automation consolidation special project costs and the charges that were incurred and deferred in prior years will continue to be deferred for recovery in future years.
