[Gur] The latest katyusha shelling was apparently carried out by one of the Palestinian organizations which broke away from the PLO in the wake of the peace accord. [Levi] We seem to be lenient toward those Palestinian organizations since it was the second katyusha attack in the past month. [Gur] We are not tolerant with anybody who shells us. I do not wish to go into all the operational, intelligence, and political problems, but you can be sure about one thing -- that we make every effort to locate them and reach them immediately and effectively, and I am certain we will do so. [Levi] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] required more than 20 hours to defeat four terrorists in Hebron. [Gur] That is because of the tactics used, because of the fact we operated in a built-up area, since we want to reduce to a minimum the number of civilians harmed and to reduce to zero the risk to our fighters. It does not point to any reduction in the IDF's offensive capability. We have already stormed, conquered, and blown up much larger installations. The two constraining factors I mentioned above were very important, and that is why those tactics were used. They are special tactics for a built-up area of that type against a very defined target.
