Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that it has emerged that the Palestinian leaders have failed to explicate the written details of the agreement to the Palestinian population and security forces. A Palestinian source told our correspondent that the Palestinian leaders often prefer to explain events on the ground in their own way and contrary to the agreement, perhaps in order to win the Palestinian public's support.
