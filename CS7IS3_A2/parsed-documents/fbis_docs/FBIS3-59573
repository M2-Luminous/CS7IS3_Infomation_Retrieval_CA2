This technology, which carries the reference ECLP07, is designed for circuits operating at 3.3 volt and presenting an integration density of 1,300 gates per square millimeter for logical functions (7,000 gates per square millimeter for memory functions). The technology also features a frequency of 150 MHz (identical to that of current 0.7-micron 5-V CMOS technology) for a consumption cut by a factor of 2.3 (1.5 microwatt per gate and per megaHertz).
