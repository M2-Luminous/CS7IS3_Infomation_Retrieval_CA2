The same Ames whom FBI agents recently arrested for spying for Moscow. "I myself was blown in 1985," Gordiyevskiy said in an hour-long Finnish television broadcast. "And all these years I have been trying to find out who exactly was to blame for this happening. When the scandal of Ames' arrest broke I realized that he was obviously the one...." How exactly could Ames have known about the former KGB colonel's double game if, according to Gordiyevskiy, British intelligence did not give his name to the Americans? He said that the most important information he passed on to the British was sent from London to Washington, but in a "depersonalized form." Nevertheless, based on knowledge of these reports Ames evidently came to the conclusion that the information was coming from a person who at that time was working in London and who was previously in Scandinavia. Thus the KGB determined the source which was leaking important information. This supposition, Gordiyevskiy believes, is confirmed by the following fact. It has now been learned that the Soviet side transferred the first major reward to Ames' bank account 18 May 1985, while Gordiyevskiy, the KGB station chief in London, was recalled to Moscow 17 May. In the USSR it became clear to him that he had been exposed, but he managed to escape abroad. The former KGB colonel recounted that, as it turns out, he was acquainted with Ames. After his flight from Moscow he traveled to the United States several times and met with leading CIA officers there. Gordiyevskiy now recalls that Ames was present at these conversations, during which Ames smiled at him. It is clear that the Soviet Union knew everything that was told to the Americans. A large part of the interview was devoted to the Soviet special services' work against Finland. The KGB colonel reported that the main agent network was recruited immediately after the war. At that time the country "was on its knees," so it was not so very difficult to incline people toward cooperation. Agents were recruited from various strata of society. Even from among church officials. Not to carry out intelligence work but to make, for example, a copy from the church register needed by a Soviet Karelian illegal agent concerning his "birth in Finland." Gordiyevskiy disclosed that the KGB's strongest positions were in the Finnish Center Party, which formed the country's government many times. The station later penetrated the ranks of the Social Democrats and even of the Conservatives. The KGB station chief in Finland, Gordiyevskiy stated, used to receive encrypted messages from Moscow containing the main points of comments which were to be put into the mouths of eminent Finnish politicians. For instance, he met with former Finnish President Urho Kekkonen and spoke to him in roughly the following terms: It is desired that during your visit to such-and-such a country you could say the following for the sake of world peace.... "For your convenience we have even composed the text," the station chief would smile and take a sheet out of his pocket with the main points typed in Finnish. The former colonel believes that Finland is now being used in work against the Baltic countries. Gordiyevskiy said that Moscow believes that Western intelligence services are actively using these states to spy on Russian territory. On the other hand, Russia wants to know everything about the intentions of the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian Governments. At the end of the broadcast the double agent was asked whether the death sentence pronounced on him back in the years when the USSR existed had been quashed, and whether he had received an amnesty from the State Duma, which released Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, Makashov, and others from custody. "No, it has not been quashed," Gordiyevskiy said. "But I do not want any amnesty from this Red-and-Brown Duma. The death sentence is my reward and my banner...."
