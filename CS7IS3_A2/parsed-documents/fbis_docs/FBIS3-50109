The oldest casualty was born in 1981. At the time of this massacre General Briquemont was handing over to General Michael Rose. [passage omitted] The children who were killed, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, were playing in a protected zone, in Klara Cetkin Street, just 200 meters from the main UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo. The Serb aggressor welcomed the changeover of UNPROFOR commanders for Bosnia-Herzegovina in a most serious way today -- by killing children. What else should happen in Sarajevo before you set in motion mechanisms that would lead to the realization of UN resolutions? We request that, in keeping with the relevant UN resolutions and NATO conclusions, you request that the aggressor's positions around Sarajevo be bombarded, the letter from Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic says. A letter with the same content was also sent to Karolos Papoulias, the president of the European Union Council of Ministers, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, and Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
