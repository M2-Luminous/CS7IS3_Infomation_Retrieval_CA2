These 48 hours, expected to be a difficult test for the current BSPSh leadership headed by Valer Xheka, ended without any dispute among the fractions that have recently arisen within the trade union. Chairman Xheka confirmed his dominance by receiving 90 percent of the delegates' votes in the elections at the end of the congress. It might be said that what was expected to be the congress of the great split ended with the triumph of the present leaders, who will continue to hold their positions at the head of the first anticommunist trade union for four more years. In fact, the neutralization of the fractionist group of Valer Lubonja and Imir Kamba, the latter a cousin of PD Secretary Tritan Shehu, was evident on the eve of the congress, when their names were absent from all the lists of the presidiums that were to chair the plenary sessions. Their vilification as "separatists," "Red whippersnappers," and "gangsters" in the general report delivered by BSPSh Secretary Vilson Qendro, which provoked a positive reaction from the audience, then sealed the fate of the "rebels," whom various sources claim to have decided to create another trade union. In this case, we would have a reprise of the secession of such names as Gezim Kalaja and Sami Karriqi, who formed the autonomous miners' union. The BSPSh's first congress once again underlined the current crisis of relations between this trade union and the state of Berisha, despite their one-time alliance in the struggle against communism. The end of this alliance became explicit at this congress and was justified by the trade union's need to continue its struggle to defend the workers' interests. "Becoming the tool of parties means death for a trade union," Vilson Qendro declared. He later accused the franctionists precisely of being manipulated by "certain political forces," without naming them. Vilson Qendro set out the demands on which the BSPSh will base its strategy in the coming years. These include stemming the hemorrhage of lay-offs, the linking of wages to the index of inflation, pension increases, and a social policy from today's state. Mr. Qendro criticized the government's indifference and arrogance in excluding the trade union from making decisions that involve social consequences for the population, and in not seeing fit to negotiate a number of parliamentary bills with trade union representatives. He went on to say that the Strike Law is in fact an anti-strike law. The tone of the speeches at the congress and the harsh criticisms addressed toward the Meksi government might indicate a reawakening of the BSPSh, which has so far been considered a body approving the Meksi cabinet's economic platform and reforms. President Berisha, in his speech of greeting at the start of the first day's proceedings, openly stated that he had followed developments within the BSPSh, wishing to convey the idea that he continues to have total control over the trade union that brought him to power. High-flown and euphoric, the Albanian president said that he would act as a mediator between the trade unionists and the government and that he considered the trade union's demands to be fair, while he of course also expressed satisfaction at the phrase in the report expressing support for the reforms of the PD's state. He speech was an official permit for Xheka to continue on his path for four more years after this congress, which is time enough to settle in....
