In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations with Angola. Qian said that China has been paying close attention to Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize domestic peace and stability. He noted that China has never interfered in the internal affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible. China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said. Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African nations build their countries according to their own situations. If big powers really care about Africa, they should not write out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said. They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of African economies. Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic support of his country. He noted that in Angola's struggle for national independence, the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples still stood together. The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country firmly insists on a "one-China" policy and will not develop any official ties with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola realizes internal peace.
