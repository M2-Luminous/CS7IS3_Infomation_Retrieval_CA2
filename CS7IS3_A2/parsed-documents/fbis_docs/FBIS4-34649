He added, however, that Chile would have to abide by Mercosur rules. [passage omitted] Lacalle said: "We consider Mercosur to be the most significant undertaking in the River Plate area since our countries' independence. It is a key factor for bringing about change. Yet Mercosur has its own rules." On 8 June, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa handed to his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella an official proposal on behalf of his country for joining Mercosur. Argentina at present holds the presidency pro tempore of Mercosur, and it is incumbent upon that country to officially inform Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay of Chile's intention to join Mercosur. Uruguay has so far been reluctant to accept a new partner in Mercosur before its current members consolidate this free trade zone, which will become effective at the end of the year. Mercosur is, moreover, in the throes of establishing a common external tariff, which will reportedly range between 0 and 20 percent. Chile has set a tariff ceiling of 10 percent, which in principle precludes it from joining Mercosur. High-ranking sources close to the Foreign Ministry told EL PAIS that Chile's possible incorporation into Mercosur will be discussed by the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) within the framework of the Brazilian proposal to establish a South American Free Trade Area.
