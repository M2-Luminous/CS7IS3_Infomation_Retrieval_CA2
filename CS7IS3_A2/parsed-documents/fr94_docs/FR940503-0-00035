FR940503-0-00035 FR940503-0-00009 Comment: One consultant suggested revision of §285.23(a) Granting and renewing accreditation to remove decisions based on variations of compliance. Response: Full compliance results in accreditation action. Less than full compliance can result in accreditation or other actions depending on variation from full compliance in terms of deficiencies and the expectations of corrective action. Comment: One consultant suggested that §285.23(b)(3) Granting and renewing accreditation should contain a stronger statement than ``reminding'' laboratories of their legal obligations. Response: NVLAP has no responsibility or authority to do more than remind laboratories of this fact. Comment: One trade association and one laboratory suggested that §§285.32(a)(10) and 285.33(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) be either deleted or limited to ensure that the requirement for laboratories to avoid undue or coercive commercial or financial pressures on staff are not applied to the normal course of employer-employee and independent contractor relationships of a manufacturer's in-house laboratory. Response: These Sections clearly avoid undue interference by limiting the requirement to ``pressures which might adversely affect the quality of the work.'' Accreditation of a laboratory depends on NVLAP's confidence that the laboratory will provide accurate test and calibration services. These services must no be degraded by pressures of any kind. NVLAP cannot deal with degrees or types of pressure, only with the accuracy of data provided to customers. Comment: One trade association suggested that NVLAP needs to clarify its policy for addressing the recognition of foreign-based laboratories based on accreditation by a foreign government or accrediting organization. Response: The policy will be clarified by adding to §285.11 Requesting a LAP a new paragraph (f) which states that ``consistent with applicable laws and regulations, the Director may negotiate and conclude agreements with the governments of other countries for NVLAP recognition of foreign laboratories. At a minimum, any agreement must provide that accredited foreign laboratories meet conditions for accreditation comparable to and consistent with those set out in these requirements''. Comment: One manufacturer suggested deleting the requirement in §285.26 Change in status of laboratory for laboratories to advise NVLAP of any change in location and/or configuration of its facilities. Response: NVLAP must get this information prior to the laboratory making any changes. The fact of moving or reconfiguration of a laboratory could significantly affect the quality of its testing or calibration activities. Comment: One trade association suggested revising §285.32(a)(6) Conditions for accreditation, to limit the services that a laboratory offers to customers to NVLAP accredited areas. Response: NVLAP accreditation does not limit the freedom of laboratories to offer services outside the scope of accreditation. NVLAP only limits laboratories from claiming accreditation for services not included on their Scopes of Accreditation issued to the laboratories. Comment: One trade association asked that the regulation be made more specific in defining the meaning of ``staffing'' in §285.26., stating that it is too broad. Response: NVLAP believes that there are so many possibilities regarding staffing changes that the reference needs to be general so that an objective opinion can be made on the specific change proposed or made. NVLAP focuses on staffing changes that could affect the quality of the testing or calibration work. Comment: One trade association suggested changing §285.33 (1) Subcontracting of calibration or testing to limit subcontracting to accredited laboratories only. Response: This section is in full conformity with international requirements which do not impose such a restriction. This is partly based on the fact that no other accredited laboratory may be geographically available or willing to provide the services needed. NVLAP believes that its procedures for subcontracting will ensure that the data provided by the subcontractor will meet the established quality standards.
