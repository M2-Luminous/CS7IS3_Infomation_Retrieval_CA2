The head of the North side made a keynote speech first at the contact. He said the whole course of discussions and working contact between the North and the South in the past ten months since the North side proposed the exchange of special envoys leads us to a conclusion distinguishing between unity and confrontation, between national independence and dependence on outside forces, and between patriotism and treachery which are incompatible with each other. Clarifying the North side's stand toward the working contact, he said: "Firstly, our side, considering that the four-point demand we have raised in keeping with the prevailing situation are entirely just, insist on it again. "Executing a swift volte-face, the South side is now crying for a `tough reaction' against its dialogue partner. It is openly blaring that the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises must be resumed, the plan to introduce Patriot missiles be reexamined and international `sanctions' be taken against the North. "This is, indeed, an act that scuttles the working contact for the exchange of special envoys and brings the situation of Korea to a touch-and-go phase. "We strongly demand that the South side bear responsibility for the obstacles it has laid intentionally to the working contact and make clear its attitude toward our side's just four-point demand at today's contact. "Secondly, we cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the South side has tried to use the exchange of special envoys for other political purposes, taking a dishonest attitude toward the working contact." He strongly urged the South side to apologize to the nation, frankly admitting that it has abused the working-level contact to hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks, fully revealing its dark intention. "Thirdly," he said, "we cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the South side is bringing the North-South relations to the phase of an unpredictable confrontation by trying to hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks and make the exchange of special envoys abortive." He stated: "We will never look with folded arms at anybody trying to ignite a war on the Korean peninsula. "As we have already declared, we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue, and war with war. "We makes it unequivocal to your side that we do not like empty talk and will take every necessary countermeasure." [sentence as received] At the contact today, the South side repeated its unreasonable argument, far from showing a positive attitude toward the North side's just demand and position. The North side urged the South side not to utter unnecessary words but to give an answer to the North side's position and clarify whether it would accept the North-proposed exchange of special envoys or refuse it. The North side sternly said that the South side was free to part with the North, if it wished to. Noting that the South side at a "high-level strategic meeting" the day before yesterday adopted a "policy of tough reaction" toward the North and said it would resume the Team Spirit exercises, promote the plan of Patriot missile introduction and join in "sanctions" against the North, the North side said, "is this not a declaration of refusal of the exchange of special envoys, a declaration of all-out confrontation and war with the North." Upset by this, the South side brought forward an "emergency proposal" urging the North side to stop slandering the chief executive of the South side and refrain from inciting the anti-"government" struggle of the South Korean people and exchange special envoys primarily for the solution of the nuclear issue. The North side turned it down, saying that the working-level contact was not a place for making such argument. Noting that the exchange of special envoys had already been scuttled by the South side, he pointed out that the recent "high-level strategic meeting" was aimed at foiling it. "So, the South side must be held wholly responsible for bringing the exchange of special envoys to a head," he added. The chief delegate of the South side, much upset, said if the exchange of special envoys were scuttled and the working contact broken up, the danger to be entailed by it is unpredictable. The head of the North side told him: "Never mind. We are prepared for anything. As I already declared in my keynote speech, we are prepared both for dialogue and war. If any forces took "sanctions" against and provoked us, we will promptly take a decisive self-defensive measure. We mean what we say." The South side did not utter a word in answer. Since the South side failed to answer our proposal, our side said today's contact should be closed. Closing the contact, the North side said it would come to the next contact if the South side notified it of the date with the willingness to accept our proposal.
