The meeting was attended by representatives of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which was admitted to the Council at the current session. The cooperation program involves joint efforts in 12 areas of space activity, including space communications, remote earth exploration, manned flights, new scientific space systems and the creation of new rocket-launch vehicles. The program's overall cost is estimated at 1.2 trillion rubles (in January 1994 prices), the "minimum sum", to quote Russian Space Agency officials, needed to carry the program out. Each party to the program will decide how to finance the program on an individual basis, taking their government's real contribution into account. The countries also agreed to become involved in financing vital facilities, such as the Baykonur (Kazakhstan) and Plesetsk (North Russia) launch sites. The program must be submitted to the Intergovernmental CIS Council for consideration.
