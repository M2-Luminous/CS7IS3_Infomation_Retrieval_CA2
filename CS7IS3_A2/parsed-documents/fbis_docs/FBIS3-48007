In addition, preparations for admission to the OECD (Organization of Economic Construction and Development) will be stepped up, along with efforts to increase cooperation with the group of seven advanced economies. For increased cooperation with Asia-Pacific nations, summit diplomacy will be promoted, including summit meetings with Southeast Asian nations, in addition to the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation summit slated for November in Indonesia, Han said. A multilateral security forum in Northeast Asia will be promoted, and the government will participate in the foreign ministers conference and security forum of the associations of Southeast Asian nations. Increased cooperation with the international community, especially with the United States, will be sought to solve the North Korean nuclear issue in such a manner as to guarantee North Korea's nuclear transparency and promote inter-Korean coexistence and cooperation.
