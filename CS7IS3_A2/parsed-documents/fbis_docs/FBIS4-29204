The two leaders also agreed to set up a policy forum, the officials said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa attended the meeting arranged by the nation's largest labor organization, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), which provides the main base of support for the two parties. The DSP is a junior party in the coalition. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and DSP Secretary General Kansei Nakano also attended the session. Rengo President Akira Yamagishi represented the 8 million strong labor group at the meeting. Murayama told the meeting his party will continue to carry out reform policies formulated during the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, of which the SDP was a member party. Yonezawa was quoted as saying he hopes for exchanges of opinion between the two parties so that they can deepen their understanding and realign the coalition framework. Yamagishi said divisions between the two parties are having a detrimental effect on Rengo. Yamagishi urged them to rebuild the coalition framework of the Hosokawa administration, which preceded the present government of prime minister Tsutomu Hata. The SDP, the largest force in the Hosokawa government, withdrew from the coalition in late April after the abrupt formation of a parliamentary bloc excluding the party, forcing Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four decades.
