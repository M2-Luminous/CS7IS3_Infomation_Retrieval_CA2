As Head of State E. Shevardnadze has emphasized, a catastrophic disparity has arisen between standard of living, prices, and wages. A person here now receives on average less than 100,000 coupons [per month] while, in order to sustain at least a minimum standard of living, according to specialists, the standard wage should be 9.3 million coupons. How can we eliminate this extremely negative discrepancy and what can the state do in order to help people to survive in this extreme situation? We raised these questions with Mirian Murdzhikneli, first deputy minister of finances. [Murdzhikneli] There can be no doubt that social policy should form the principal element in the government's activities; it is essential to implement at once measures aimed at increasing the population's standard of living. As is known, in January, there was a 100 percent increase in wages in all budgetary organizations and a 150 percent increase in pensions and benefits. Since 1 February, teachers' salaries have increased two to threefold. [Nikolaishvili] Nevertheless, during this time, prices have rocketed so much that this increase has, to all intents and purposes, been nullified. Furthermore, the coupon is falling at a catastrophic rate before our very eyes. [Murdzhikneli] Yes, given current hyperinflation, even a wage that has increased threefold does not constitute a living wage. In order to alleviate somehow the destructive effect of inflation, it has been decided to increase the wages of workers in budgetary organizations on a monthly basis by 20 percent as of 1 March of this year. Of course, this will not bring about cardinal changes in the standard of living but, nevertheless.... [Nikolaishvili] For how long can wages be made to keep up this vain chase after prices? After all, it is patently clear that we will always be on the losing side.... [Murdzhikneli] Yes, until we get production going again and until there are sufficient goods on whose purchase at least 50-60 percent of the wage fund can be spent. After all, almost nothing is currently being produced; there is nothing in the shops; we are forcibly chained to the market where speculators reign supreme and jack up prices at their leisure. Notice that, as a rule, genuine peasants are being pushed off the territory of the market and very often forced to raise their prices. Furthermore, the market has haphazardly gone over to trading only in rubles and made the coupon literally worthless. [Nikolaishvili] Yet, measures have been taken to strengthen the coupon.... [Murdzhikneli] They are still demanding in Parliament today that we propose some emergency measures in this respect. What can you propose in the circumstances? The republic should start working and producing goods. That's the first thing. Second, all economic ties should be restored with the former Union republics, first and foremost, with Russia. Up to now, we have been destroying everything with a stubbornness that could be put to better use and have imposed a self-blockade. However, it is clear today that we cannot survive without Russia. [Nikolaishvili] A final question concerning the budget. Can one hope that the social measures you have outlined will find reliable support in the state's financial law? [Murdzhikneli] Absolutely. Expenditure on the indexation of the population's losses that lead to inflation has already been included in the budget for the second quarter. True, there are certain complications with implementing the income part of the budget; the mechanism for levying taxes has not been properly developed. No one wants to pay on time while there are plenty of people who are keen to have more money.
