Although they form less than five percent of the world population, the Arab League's 22 members account for nearly 12 percent of total world farm imports, according to official Arab figures. The agricultural imports averaged 23 billion dollars a year over the past decade, while exports did not exceed five billion dollars, said Ma'mun Hasan, director of the Kuwait-based Arab Corporation for Investment Guarantee (ACIG). "When subsidies on farm output are removed, in line with the recent accord by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, world food prices will naturally rise," he told the United Arab Emirates daily AL-FAJR. "This will have two effects. It will force Arab states to pay more for food while it will also encourage farmers to upgrade output to face competition and get higher prices for their products." Several Arab states are now members of the Geneva-based GATT, which has turned into a new group called the World Trade Organisation. The deal signed in Morocco two months ago called for removing trade barriers among its nearly 120 members and lifting subsidies on national products. Experts said Saudi Arabia would suffer more than other Arab states from the agreement, as it spends billions of dollars on agricultural subsidies, mainly for wheat. Other Gulf states also subsidise vegetable and fruit in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency. Outside the Gulf, political instability, lack of investment and poor infrastructure are blamed for the deterioration of the agricultural sector in Arab countries. "Development of the farming sector in Sudan could solve the Arab food problems, as it has vast arable areas," a Gulf-based expert said. "But Sudan has no funds, its infrastructure is primitive and the country is threatened with disintegration because of the civil war. Only a crazy investor will put his funds into the farming sector now." The situation in other fertile Arab countries is not much better. Iraq is facing international sanctions and an uncertain political situation, and Algeria is hit by Moslem militant unrest. Somalia, also a member of the Arab League, is torn by civil war. The four countries account for more than 70 percent of the total arable area in the Arab world, estimated at 198 million hectares. So far only 27 percent of the land has been exploited due to lack of investment. The rapid growth in Arab population has combined with such problems to aggravate the region's food gap, the difference between farm imports and exports. According to the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund [AMF], the cumulative Arab food import bill totalled around 210 billion dollars between 1980 and 1990, while exports stood at only 40 billion dollars. A breakdown showed the growth in imports covered all farm products except fruit and vegetables, though they are still imported by some members. From around 18.6 million tonnes in 1980, Arab cereal imports surged to 34.3 million tonnes in 1992. Wheat imports jumped from 12.4 million tonnes to 21.1 million tonnes, the AMF said in a study. Dairy products also soared, from nearly one million tonnes to 9.1 million tonnes, while tea, coffee and tobacco rose from 461,000 tonnes to 530,000 tonnes and meat from 666,000 tonnes to 794,000 tonnes. Investment in the Arab farm sector did not exceed 7.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product annually over the past decade, while loans extended to agriculture stood at only 3.8 billion dollars between 1973 and 1992.
