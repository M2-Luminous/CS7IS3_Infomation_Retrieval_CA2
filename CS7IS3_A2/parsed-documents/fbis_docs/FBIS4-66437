(Nippon Oil), in the Nippon Oil Group, has constructed a co-generator that burns slop oil recovered from ballast water and has begun operation of it. The base had previously been using slop oil for a boiler to heat tanks and pipes. This was the first time for the Nippon Oil Group to use slop oil as a fuel for power generation. In November 1993, the in-house power generator (1,000 kW), completed with an investment of ¥370 million, began operation, and there has been no problem thus far. Slop oil is recovered from sludge from ballast water and the bottom of oil tanks. At Kiire Base, 20,000 kl per year of treated slop oil are recovered. The oil had previously been used as boiler fuel to heat tanks and pipes for crude oil from South Asia that had solidified at a low temperature as a result of its high wax content. Now the slop oil is going to be used as fuel for in-house power generation. The newly installed co-generator is designed to supply one-third of the base's power requirement and is said to consume 2,000 kl of slop oil. This generator will reduce the base's power consumption by approximately ¥2 per kWh from the cost of purchased power (contracted as a large consumer). The application of slop oil for power generation is expected to be used by other oil refineries within the Nippon Oil Group.
