Although the fact that the talks are being held at all is in itself a positive development. The Georgian side's position on the return of refugees to Galskiy Rayon remains unchanged: Their safety has to be ensured. As for Abkhazia's political status, the United Nations has produced a document on setting up a coordinating council, which is to operate until the conflict is completely settled. It has also become known that Jaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian delegation, has expressed resentment with the stand taken by the United Nations, which decided not to send its peacekeeping contingent to the area until this August. According to Ioseliani, it is quite possible that Georgia will accept the proposal put forward by the Russian Federation, which offered to send its forces to Abkhaz territory as soon as possible. But in the view of Aleksandr Kavsadze, the head of state's personal envoy for the settlement of the conflict, all prerequisites exist even now for the UN Security Council to make a decision to deploy international peacekeeping forces on the entire territory of Abkhazia.
