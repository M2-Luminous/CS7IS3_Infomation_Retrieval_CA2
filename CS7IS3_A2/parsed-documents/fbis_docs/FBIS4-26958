Speaking at the Third National Agricultural Conference, Hsiao said the government has set a series of measures targeted to help the agricultural industry, which he said will be the sector most affected by Taiwan's GATT entry. The principal countermeasures to be taken will include grooming farm workers for nonfarm jobs and releasing land currently used for agricultural production for other purposes. Hsiao said the government expects to cut the ratio of agricultural workers in Taiwan from the current 12 percent to three percent in 10 years. If that goal is reached, a total of between 700,000 and 800,000 farm workers will have to find work in other fields, Hsiao noted. The government in the future will also earmark a sufficient budget to help the agricultural sector resolve problems that may hinder the upgrading and the rise of productivity of the sector, he added.
