It is 12 days since this shocking tragedy took place, and despite extensive regional and international reaction condemning it, the continuation of strong protests by the Palestinians, and the unprecedented clashes between the Zionist occupiers and the oppressed Palestinians, the UN Security Council has refrained from issuing a resolution on this. The only thing that has prevented this resolution has been U.S. opposition to the condemnation of the Zionist regime's unprecedented crime in the massacre of worshipers. Despite fundamental changes in the international balance of power with the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Eastern bloc, one can see that UN decisions do not go beyond the traditional frameworks based on alliances and that criteria such as justness and humanity, as well as true security, have not found their suitable place in UN decisions. Even though the United States feigns to be a mere observer in the so-called Arab-Israeli compromise talks and should thus take an impartial approach to incidents, it has impudently adopted a pro- Zionist policy vis-a-vis a calamity, the condemnation of which no one has the least bit of doubt, and is ignoring world public opinion. This stance by the White House stems from the fact that on the basis of international laws and the conventions on war, prisoners of war, and occupied territories, especially the Fourth Convention of Geneva, the Zionist regime is legally responsible for ensuring the security of the residents in the occupied territories. If the Zionist regime is unwilling or unable to ensure the security of the Palestinians, it should hand over this duty to international organizations. Since the Zionist regime wants to crush the risen Palestinians, on the one hand, and does not want a third party to enter the scene in order to cover up its crimes, on the other, it opposes the dispatch of UN peacekeeping forces to the occupied territories. Thus, the United States, which regards the Zionist regime's behavior to be part of the confrontation with the wave of Islamism and the Islamic revolution and in line with its own and the Zionist regime's interests, extends unconditional support for this regime. However, behind the U.S.-Zionist regime's confrontation with the wave of Islamism and the just uprising of the Palestinians, talks are being held in the UN corridors between the United States and the compromising Palestinian faction on the one side and the Zionist regime and 'Arafat's representative on the other. Egypt also plays the role of mediator in these talks. Political experts consider the issuance of a Security Council resolution on this issue to be contingent on a compromise between Tel Aviv and 'Arafat on the Palestinian demands on what should be stated in the resolution. The Palestinian side--which has been greatly disgraced among the Palestinians because of its recent compromise on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as well as ensuing agreements--has lost its support, is propounding demands that ultimately benefit the Zionist regime, and is trying to slightly repair its domestic image. Thus, it wants the resolution to emphasize international support for Palestinians and to clarify the situation of Jerusalem. However, experts believe that Israel will not give in to these two demands and, in view of U.S. support for the Zionist regime and the composition of the Security Council, no serious resolution is expected to be issued.
