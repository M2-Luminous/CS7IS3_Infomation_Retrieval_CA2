If we add to this Decree No. 2780 on promotions and transfers in the judicial branch, the lack of enthusiasm with which [Colorado Party Deputy] Bernardino Cano Redil -- the government's main intellectual operator -- champions some government positions, and the Colorado Party's sensible silence last month, we recognize an increasingly isolated president at Lopez Palace. Even [Colorado Party Senator] Juan Carlos Galaverna seemed out of place this week. It is not possible to ask the government to solve in less than one year of administration the problems of the oligarchic agrarian structure bequeathed by numerous decades of wealth concentration. It is also not possible to ask the government to work a miraculous economic swap that will allow a large GDP growth rate. It is not possible to ask the government to affect the international prices for soybean or cotton, and, with the assistance of a saint, conclude the military's reform within eight months. It is not possible to ask the government to abruptly improve the quality and scope of education. No one is asking Engineer Wasmosy to perform these miracles. The problem is that there are not even favorable signs of a political line allowing us to guess that we have a government management that seeks to overcome these and other serious social and economic deficits. The Social Development Council represents an attempt to find a solution to the growing social crisis. And, as a general framework, we must mention a policy of basic agreements sought through discussions among various parties or directly through agreements on concrete issues. And the "democratic compromise" is a sign of the latter method. Bearing in mind the new political arena, involving an increased balance of forces, a broad conciliatory policy has been sought. And even though the National Encounter, the [Colorado Party leader Luis] Argana supporters, and the [Hermes and Miguel] Saguier supporters uphold a critical stance toward [opposition leader] Domingo Laino, they are actually implementing a moderate opposition and have signed the "democratic compromise." In a nutshell, President Wasmosy has a potentially favorable arena to achieve a broad spectrum of basic agreements that might represent a contribution to the credibility of President Wasmosy's government. Nevertheless, for reasons that we cannot entirely understand, the president sometimes seems to be his government's main opponent. The last measure taken on the judicial issue violates the spirit and letter of the "democratic compromise." In addition, the president has not taken drastic measures on the IPS issue or agrarian problems. It seems to be a government that does not take any initiatives. Wasmosy's Men The selection of his advisers reflects a president's political bias. It is hard to believe that a figure like Duarte Prado can contribute anything to the government's democratic credibility. It is also not possible to trust in Engineer Wasmosy's effective willingness to advance with all the democratic segments in the improvement of justice with actions like those taken this week. Therefore, the question of who are the men governing with Wasmosy arises. We assume that they are not the main shareholders and directors of the companies that allowed him to accumulate wealth recently. We trust [Army Commander Division] General [Lino] Oviedo is not one of them. The Colorado Party leadership does not have a clear position on the social problems. And since the ANR [National Republican Association -- Colorado Party] already is involved in its primary campaign, some of its main leaders are reviving their traditional language, with the exception of Education Minister Nicanor Duarte Frutos. The UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] is withdrawing its support. The trade unions are calling a general strike. The president should -- at least -- attempt to keep fluent communications with his moderate opposition. And he does not do it. Therefore, who is or are advising him? What is the president's political strategy team? It is worrisome. We still believe that the first civilian president since 1954 must be successful. And that he is still in time to change the course.
