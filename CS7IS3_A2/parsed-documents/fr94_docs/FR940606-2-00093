Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options on the Phlx Phone Index May 27, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 On February 18, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal: (1) To provide that the Index will be updated during the trading day at least once every 15 seconds, rather than once every minute; (2) to provide that the exercise prices will be set at five point Index intervals rather than 2.5 point Index intervals as stated in the original filing; (3) to specify that the expiration cycle applicable to options on the Index will be three expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months; (4) to clarify the Exchange's obligations with respect to delisting and replacing components of the Index; (5) to clarify that all of the proposed Index's component stocks are, and any future replacement or added component securities will be, traded either on NASDAQ National Market, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or the American Stock Exchange (non-ECM); and (6) to clarify that all of the current Index component stocks have overlying exchange traded options on them. See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 16, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). On February 24, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal to change the name of the Index from the Phlx Baby Bell Index to the Phlx Phone Index. See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 24, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). On April 6, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal to represent that the Phlx will submit a Rule 19b&hyph;4 filing to the Commission prior to opening any new series of options on the Index for trading if at any time less than 90 percent of the component securities, by weight, are eligible for exchange options tradings, or if at any time the number of stocks in the Index increases to more than ten or decreases to less than eight. See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 3, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3''). On April 11, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal: (1) To change the manner in which the current Index value would be calculated; (2) to represent that the surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options, which include having complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities comprising the Index (all of which are traded on the NYSE), also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index; (3) to provide that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on the Index; and (4) to confirm that the trading hours for the Index will be 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. (New York time). See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Thomas McManus, Esq., Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated April 7, 1994 (``Amendment No. 4''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Phlx Phone Index (``Index''), an index developed by the Phlx and comprised of eight common stocks representing the companies created as a result of the divestiture of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (``AT&T'') in 1983, as well as AT&T itself. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to list for trading an American-style option on the Index. The Index, which is comprised of the common stocks of the eight companies created as a result of the divestiture of AT&T in 1983, includes the seven regional telephone companies spun off from AT&T as well as AT&T. AT&T and the spun-off regional telephone companies represent some of the largest and most widely-held U.S. common stocks. If at any time the number of stocks comprising the Index increases to more than ten or decreases to less than eight, the Exchange will submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act prior to opening any new option series on the Index. The Phlx believes that there is a need for an index option that represents solely AT&T and its spun-off regional telephone companies. In this regard, the Phlx states that there is a significant segment of the investing community that avidly follows these companies. The Phlx believes that the Index, therefore, would fill a current market void by creating a pure U.S. telephone industry index that would not be diluted with other telecommunications stocks.
