Sporadic shooting from heavy artillery and bursts of automatic machinegun fire were heard this morning in the southern district of Brazzaville, especially at Bacongo and Makelekele districts, which have been sealed off for the past three days by government forces. Armored cars have been deployed at Makelekele district over the past three days in an attempt to prevent new clashes between the opposition coalition militia and government forces. These clashes have claimed about 75 lives in southern Brazzaville since mid- December. The cordoning off of Bacongo is the result of the kidnapping of Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiala, an officer of the presidential security, who has still not been found. The presidential security has accused the private militia of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas of carrying out the kidnapping. The opposition has denied any involvement in this affair. Meanwhile, about 100 armed supporters of the presidential group gathered around the seat of the ruling party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy this morning. They are demanding their integration into the Army. According to witnesses, the police did not intervene.
