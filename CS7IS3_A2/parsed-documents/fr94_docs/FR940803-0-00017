FR940803-0-00017 FR940803-0-00006 The 1993&hyph;94 budget was published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule on June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32600), and finalized on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43066). The administrative expenses and assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year were based on an estimated assessable tonnage of 1,700,000. Due to an unexpected short crop, the assessable tonnage is estimated to be only 1,476,377. In order to have sufficient revenue to cover budgeted expenses of $1,020,000, the Committee unanimously recommended that the 1993&hyph;94 crop year administrative assessment be increased from $0.60 to $0.70 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts. An interim final rule was published in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24633). That interim final rule added ยง998.407 which authorized expenditures for administration and indemnification, established an assessment rate, and authorized continuation of an indemnification reserve for the Committee. That rule also amended ยง998.406, paragraph (c) to increase the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through June 13, 1994. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers signatory to the agreement. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing agreement. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1993&hyph;94 crop year began on July 1, 1993, and the 1994&hyph;95 crop year for the program began on July 1, 1994, and the marketing agreement requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply to all assessable peanuts handled during the crop year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 998 Marketing agreements, Peanuts, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 998 is amended as follows: PART 998_MARKETING AGREEMENT REGULATING THE QUALITY OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED PEANUTS 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR Part 998 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule adding ยง998.407 and amending ยง998.406, which was published at 59 FR 24633 on May 12, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: July 28, 1994.
