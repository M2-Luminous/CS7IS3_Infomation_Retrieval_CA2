These slogans are nothing new, but today they arouse particular alarm. All the actions of the executive and legislative authorities make increasing numbers of people doubt whether the present political system is capable of dealing with the lawlessness, inflation, and unemployment. Politicians and journalists have described this social chaos as "the Weimar syndrome." The comparison with Germany in the 1920's is reinforced by the appearance of would-be fuhrers, each with his own program for solving every problem. At the moment the greatest dreamer with hopes of becoming the savior of the nation is Father Gelemenov. The mass media have contributed to his popularity to no small extent, and this arouses certain suspicions. With all his eccentricities, the good father is unable to gather enough supporters and funds to fulfill his threats. However, his statements, widely publicized in the newspapers, create a mood in society that may bring it to accept a really "strong hand," not only without resistance, but even with feelings of relief. There are enough examples of this in Bulgarian and world history. Accordingly, in this case the militant priest is playing the role of a John the Baptist, who clears the way for the person who is to come and "baptize" the nation, and to baptize it "not only with the Holy Spirit, but also with fire," as the Gospels state. As everyone knows, a flame does not only burn tinder, but consumes everything else as well.
