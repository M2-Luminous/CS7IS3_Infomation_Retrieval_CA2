During his two-day visit to Dhaka to attend the Joint Economic Commission [JEC] meeting it has become clear to Mr. Mukherjee that Bangladesh is not willing to reach any understanding with India on any issue unless the problem relating to the sharing of the waters of the River Ganges is resolved. At present Dhaka's only appeal to Delhi is to resolve the water issue. It is not willing to discuss any other bilateral issues with Delhi until the Ganges water issue is resolved. The representatives of Bangladesh did not raise the water sharing problem during the JEC meeting held in Dhaka as this issue does not come within the purview of the commission. However, this issue figured prominently during the talks which Mr. Mukherjee had with Bangladeshi leaders outside the JEC meeting. The Ganges water issue came up for discussion and dominated virtually all of the hour-long meeting which Mr. Mukherjee had with Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in Dhaka on December 28. The prime minister requested the Indian minister to see for himself the damage caused to Bangladesh due to the nonavailability of the Ganges waters. She urged the Indian minister to take a personal initiative for a speedy resolution of this issue. Similar sentiments were voiced by other Bangladeshi leaders when Mr. Mukherjee called on them. The problem relating to the sharing of the Ganges waters with India is a major issue in the politics of Bangladesh. Because of it, the ruling party is reluctant to extend its hands of friendship to India until the problem is resolved. A close aide of the Bangladesh prime minister has said that if the BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] Government is unable to reach an honorable settlement of the water dispute with India before the next general elections, then the party will have to face bitter criticism from its opponents. It would be harmful for the BNP to accept the proposals given by India on other issues before resolving the water dispute. The next general elections in Bangladesh will be held after two years. Due to this unwillingness of the government, none of the proposals given by India during the JEC meeting, which concluded in Dhaka on December 29, were accepted by the Bangladesh delegation. The proposals which were given by Pranab Mukherjee, who led the Indian delegation to the talks, include: 1) signing of a border trade agreement to prevent illegal trade; 2) signing of a motor vehicles agreement to ensure smooth movement of goods from each other's country by road; 3) the provision of transit facilities to India for the transportation of goods to its northeastern states through Bangladesh. Apart from the above proposals, India also proposed the setting up of two working groups to resolve various matters relating to trade and use of the common border. Though extensive discussions were held on these proposals at the JEC meeting, the Bangladesh side later declined to accept any of them. The joint press conference at the end of the JEC meeting was addressed by the Bangladesh foreign minister, Mustafizur Rahman, and the leader of the Indian delegation, Pranab Mukherjee. At this press conference the two sides announced that they had decided to reduce the trade gap between the two countries. With this end in view, the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India will import 150,000 tons of urea fertilizer from Bangladesh during the next fiscal year. It may be mentioned that the relationship between India and Bangladesh is not likely to improve unless both the countries decide to change their current stand. It is the undeclared policy of Bangladesh that it will not negotiate with India on any issue unless the Ganges water problem is resolved. India's position is that the relationship between the two countries will improve after a consensus is reached on various outstanding issues. Given the prevailing situation, the Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is likely to visit Dhaka soon. This visit is likely to take place at the end of January or early February.
