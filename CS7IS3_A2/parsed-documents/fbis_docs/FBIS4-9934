The conversation was unrestrained and served to resolve some pending problems that opened the doors for the visit Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will make to Buenos Aires on 13 April. "The telephone conversation took place," Robaina confirmed for PAGINA/12 in a brief chat on Juventud Island, located in western Cuba. [Izquierdo] But who took the initiative? [Robaina] Well, an incoming call was received some days ago. That means it came from over there, because that is the only way an incoming call can be received. Robaina, 38, smiles about his remark while he is surrounded by some 50 foreign diplomats accredited to Havana during a visit to the archipelago's largest island. "There was no need to use the language used in the past, because the topics that were discussed did not need the type of language that was used before the microphones," he said. Despite the official secrecy regarding the topic, it has been learned from diplomatic sources that the conversation lasted for some minutes. The sources stated that Menem presumably showed interest in medical treatment for the son of his cousin, Alfredo Menem, who is currently recovering in Cuba from a physical illness, but this could not be confirmed. Castro was presumably willing; thus the dialogue was held on a cordial basis and helped reduce the tense relations, according to the sources. In the same natural way that he dances a salsa at a diplomatic corps party, or when he makes a present of a caricature of an ambassador to the ambassador himself, Robaina agreed to chat with PAGINA/12. [Izquierdo] Menem will receive you on the day of your arrival in Buenos Aires. How will you handle the interview with a president who openly declares himself to be "anti-Castro." [Robaina] The exists a bilateral relationship that comes above any type of declaration. This is something my government has decided to work on, and I do not believe Argentina will be an exception. We are in a position to speak openly when a disagreement crops up. [Izquierdo] Up to what point have bilateral relations been affected by Menem's continuous attacks against Fidel Castro? [Robaina] Our relations are not difficult. The insistence (Menem's attacks) is something that only he can comment on. It also would be important if there could be time for us to explain what we are doing in Cuba. [Izquierdo] The objective of your visit? [Robaina] Argentina is not an exception among the other countries of the world. We seek to speak the truth about our program with its virtues and defects. [Izquierdo] Is there any progress in the renegotiation of the more than $1 billion debt Cuba has with Argentina? [Robaina] It was I who began the negotiations, and it will not be myself who will conclude them. We are taking steps to see how we can move that debt. We have no capital but there are other possibilities. [Izquierdo] What possibilities? [Robaina] We must see what interest there is in Cuban products, and we also must see whether some investments can be made in order to pay part of the debt. The Cuban foreign minister will arrive in Buenos Aires from Peru on 13 April, and on the same day he will be received by Menem at Government House, according to Argentine Ambassador to Cuba Susana Grane. "There is nothing to prevent an improvement in Argentine-Cuban relations. For this to happen, I have confidence in the rationality, intelligence, and good sense of the Argentines." Thus the Cuban foreign minister concluded his chat with PAGINA/12. Robaina will remain in Argentina on 13 and 14 April, but he will return on 17 April for a short visit to Posadas, Misiones Province, after his semi-official visit to Paraguay.
