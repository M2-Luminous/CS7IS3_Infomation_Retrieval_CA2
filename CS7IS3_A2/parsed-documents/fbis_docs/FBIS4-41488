RC leader Yegor Gaydar said his faction was led by two main reasons in reversing its decision. On the one hand, any attempt to try to improve the budget by the present parliament would be hopeless. On the other, the RC did not want any political gambling by the Liberal Democrats over the budget. Gaydar described the proposed budget as totally unrealistic with its revenue and expenditure parts being far too high. In his view, the paper reflects the existing balance of forces in the State Duma following last December's election and a strong pressure by sectorial lobby groups in parliament. The RC leader said both administration and government representatives had appealed to his faction during a break in vote-taking and the RC "accepted their considerations, particularly those relating to LDP demands in exchange for their support". Gaydar denied having engaged in any horse trading on the issue.
