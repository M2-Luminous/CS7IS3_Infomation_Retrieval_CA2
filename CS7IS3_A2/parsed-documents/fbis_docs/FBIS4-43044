That is what the next interviewee will say. SPD [Social Democratic Party] Chairman Rudolf Scharping live from Bonn: [Correspondent] You have presented yourself quite clearly as the leading figure of the SPD. My question is, what is your share of the blame for the election result? [Scharping] I say once again, we have not been able, in general, to convince workers that the European election is important since it is an election to the European Parliament. But we will succeed in that in the federal elections--I am firmly convinced of this. I am not downcast by the result; although on the other hand, it is clear that it is a setback. We lost the first round. [Correspondent] Half of the people said this had a strong national German accent, this European election. Can you, under these circumstances, with this result, stick with the strategy that you have pursued so far. Or should you not change something in order to win on 16 October? [Scharping] We will stick to the clear direction that unemployment in Germany has to be fought, that social justice has to be reestablished within the framework of a stable financial situation. I am quite sure that the turnout will show more than clearly that there is still a huge potential that we can win over. So we will stick to our clear direction. It would be silly to change the overall strategy of the party because of an election to the European Parliament. [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, Joschka Fischer from the Greens criticized the SPD earlier for demonstrating too little profile and too little opposition. He was perhaps also thinking about the possibility of forming a joint government in the autumn. How do you view this? [Scharping] I believe we have to make the SPD the strongest party; otherwise, nothing will change in Germany. We have to explain this in eastern Germany where, in my opinion, the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialist] is alarmingly strong, despite the considerable gains by the SPD in the local elections. We have a good opportunity in Saxony-Anhalt, but we have to convince the people in the East that every vote for the PDS cast in protest is perhaps understandable, but is indirectly useful for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] under the current conditions. [Correspondent] But you have been accused of copying Kohl. If that is the case, people would rather vote for the original. That is the accusation. [Scharping] Yes, but that is not true from any viewpoint. I do not think I have to explain that now. This will become more than clear over the next few weeks. The second thing that the SPD has to do is to mobilize its support among the employees and to bring actual issues to the foreground. We have quite evidently not succeeded in this in the way I wished us to, given several careless debates in the SPD. Third, we have to make it clear that reform- orientated policies will only be possible in Germany if the SPD becomes significantly stronger on 16 October than it is at present. [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, wasn't it perhaps after all a mistake not to try to push forward the ecological restructuring of our society? Instead, you cannot deny this, take a rather more conventional economic course? [Scharping] If you could explain to me what is conventional about pursuing a clear labor market policy when 420,000 more people are unemployed this year than they were last year, when more will be done for families with children, then the problem is perhaps that not enough support has yet been mobilized for an economic and social reform policy. Incidentally, the SPD has a clear view on the environment and has formulated a clear reform program in this area, too. Of course, we will have to work harder in a more united and resolute way. [Correspondent] Don't you think it is necessary to make a statement on your coalition intentions in favor of the Greens after all? [Scharping] I am not thinking of making a coalition statement with regard to smaller parties. I do not think it is a good idea to create conditions where the tail wags the dog and where one concedes exclusive rights to the smaller party. That has to be made clear to every voter in Germany, and so I will repeat it: Reform politics in Germany will only be possible when the SPD is stronger.
