According to the sources, Madani and Belhadj voiced a number of reservations about this meeting, including the presence of former President Ahmed Ben Bella, who made strong criticisms of the Salvation Front at different times, even though he is now strongly urging the regime to pursue a real and serious dialogue policy with all political parties, including the Salvation Front leadership. The independent national figures delegation comprised six members: Mohamed Saleh Yahiawi and Taher Zobiri (they represent the Algeria eastern region; they are two former military officials), Ahmed Ben Bella and Ben Ella (they represent the western region; the latter was chairman of the council at the beginning of independence and governor of one of the states during the revolution); and Ahmed Mehsas and Mohamed Said Mazouzi (they represent the center; they were both ministers in the days of Boumediene, but Mehsas, who is a well-known and respected national figure, later resigned from the government and lived in exile, joining opposition ranks, while Mazouzi remained minister after Boumediene's death, and was considered representative of the left wing in the regime. He is from the tribes region). Instead of the delegation's meeting with Madani and Belhadj, it met with Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdel Kader Boukhamkham, members of the Salvation leadership who were released from prison recently. The meeting atmosphere was positive, even though it did not produce any tangible results. Further meetings between the two sides are not ruled out. [passage omitted]
