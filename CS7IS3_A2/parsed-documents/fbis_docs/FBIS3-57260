A six-year war over mainly Christian Nagorno-Karabakh, which is seeking to break from Moslem Azerbaijan, has displaced hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis according to humanitarian [words indistinct] million. Many of those who have sought refuge in hospitals or holiday complexes here in Sumgait, 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the capital, spend their days in frustrating idleness. Uprooted, having no chance of finding work, their indignation deepens, particularly when they recall the day that Armenian troops entered their villages. "This war will only end when the Armenians get out of Nagorno- Karabakh," insists 28-year-old Ruslamov Rovjen, who said he fled his village of Lachin when it came under Armenian control on May 17, 1992. Lachin is part of a strategic Azerbaijani corridor linking Nagorno-Karabakh to the republic of Armenia. After their capture of the region in western Azerbaijan, Armenian forces expanded their operations to areas south and southwest of the enclave, leaving them in control of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory. "We can never again live with the Armenians," asserted Rovjen, a musician, who said he had been forced to leave everything behind -- including his favorite instrument, the accordion. Other refugees say Armenian troops set fire to their homes. Some accuse Russian units from 7th Army and the 366th Special Branch of backing Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. They say they cannot understand how Azerbaijan can be seen abroad as the aggressor in a conflict that has killed nearly 20,000 people in six years. [passage omitted]
