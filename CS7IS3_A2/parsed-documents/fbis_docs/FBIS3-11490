This was confirmed by more than 3,000 international observers who were at the polling sites throughout the country. They were there since the Voting Table Boards were installed up until the time the vote count was carried out by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in the Presidente Hotel. From Perquin, Morazan, Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst, who will be the new UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) chief, has told PRENSA GRAFICA "the patience with which the electoral process was carried out and the people's will and determination to vote made us realize a page has been turned in El Salvador's history, inaugurating a new, truly democratic and participative era." Onusal participated with 900 representatives from 52 countries. As did the rest of the delegates, the missions observed aspects such as voter registration, the supply of electoral equipment, the composition of the Voting Table Boards and any delays in their installation, and in ballot receipts. Reports will be officially presented during the week. The international observers were made up mostly of official missions, such as the U.S. Mission headed by Brian Atwood, the AID administrator who claimed to be "very satisfied at having thus reaffirmed U.S. support for the consolidation of the democratic process in El Salvador." The importance of these elections brought to our country observers who do not belong to established organizations. Many are members of churches and student groups, as is the case of the Moecen (Mission of Electoral Observers of U.S. Citizens), which had 500 delegates. Four of the delegates were U.S. congressmen. "Our commitment demonstrates support for the people's decision and wish to carry out an important role in securing peace," U.S. Democratic Congressman Dan Hamburg of California, said. Attending personalities included Ignacio Lozano (1976-77) and Edwin Corr (1985-88), former U.S. ambassadors to EL Salvador. "I can view the process positively. Now nobody can voice criticism there is any sector without a voice or without the right to participate in political activities in El Salvador," Corr stated. He witnessed the elections in Suchitoto, Cuscatlan. The international observation of elections is relatively new and was born from an initiative of the international community, after certain governments or parties engaged in the armed conflict decided to move toward a democratic development.
