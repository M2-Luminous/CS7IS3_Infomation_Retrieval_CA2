They are burning tires and logs, and they are chanting slogans against the government for increasing gas prices by 70 percent. On 10th of August Street and Carrion Avenue, where the Foreign Relations Ministry is located, there are some students accompanied by workers burning tires and logs. They have blocked traffic, and all vehicles have disappeared from this part of town. We can also report that only some stores in areas near the university are open.
