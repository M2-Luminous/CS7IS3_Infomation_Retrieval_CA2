In this work, a highly sensitive variant of immunoenzyme analysis based on column immunoadsorption chromatography (TIEAIC -- two-site immunoenzyme analysis by immunoadsorption chromatography) was developed for quantitative determination of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and _a_-2 BG (detection limit -- 0.35 ng/ml). The phenomenon of the presence of antibodies against the above-listed proteins was identified in extreme conditions caused by psychiatric diseases (36-42%), multiple sclerosis in the active phase (16-29%), injuries (14-43%), astrocytomal (14-33%) and oligodendrogliomal (18-40%) brain tumors, as well as influenza (13%), intestinal infections (6-9%), pneumonia (28%), and peritonitis and pancreatitis (25-33%). The authors proposed that TIEAIC analysis of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and _a_-2 BG may be used as an auxiliary test for diagnostics and monitoring during the treatment of several diseases whose pathogeneses involve a breach in the blood-brain barrier.
