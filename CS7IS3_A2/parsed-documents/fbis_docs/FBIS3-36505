The document was signed in Tbilisi February 3. According to the protocol, by July 1 it is planned to create three military bases in Vaziani (30 km to the south of Tbilisi), Akhalkalaki, (southern Georgia) and Batumi (Adjaria) on the basis of the Russian military contingent in the Transcaucasus. The general believes that besides providing security for Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region, the creation of the bases will help stabilize the situation in the region and protect the Russian-speaking population. Galkin said that the protocol on creating the bases will be in effect for 10 years. Afterwards the agreement may be extended or annuled if mutually desired. In February the expert group must take the final decision on maintaing military bases and decide on the quantity of the personnel and military technology. General Galkin who is the chief of the armored troops department, believes that about 100 Russian tanks will be deployed at the three bases. He has said that the training of officers of the Georgian army in Russian military schools and academies will possibly be made part of the payment for leasing the territory for the military bases. The general is sure that a similar document will be signed with Armenia, where Moscow intends to create one military base. Preliminary consultations on the issue have already been made. Russia also plans to create one military base in Azerbaijan, but the issue has not been coordinated yet, said Aleksandr Galkin.
