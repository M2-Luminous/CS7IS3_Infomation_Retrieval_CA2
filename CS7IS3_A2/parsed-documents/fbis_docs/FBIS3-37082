"Russia's recent statements make it clear that Moscow is attempting to effect a turnabout in its relations with Estonia," Laar said. "Already there's open talk about the insufficiency of diplomatic means to resolve the situation." The premier said, however, that there's no reason for particular anxiety. "Estonia will stick to the same steady and calm course as before," Laar said. "History teaches us this is the only way to make progress in relations with Russia. We intend also in the future to state our views to our eastern neighbor clearly and unambiguously. The government will not retreat from its policy." The premier affirmed Estonia doesn't intend to conclude with Russia any pact on the lines of the 1939 agreement on military bases. "Those forces in Russia that hope for it hope in vain," he said. Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today in a comment on Estonian- Russian relations that there's no reason for panic. "But Russia's leaders must be shown calmly, through clear foreign political moves, what the bounds of international behavior are," he stated. Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation for talks with Russia, told BNS Russia's stepping up the propaganda war is not conducive to an improvement in the relations between the two countries. "Estonian-Russian relations haven't improved," Reinart said. Commenting on the Latvian government's consent to give Russia the right to continue using the Skrunda radar base for four years, Laar said the basic issue is the status of the base. "If it becomes a demilitarized facility as proposed, it cannot be regarded as a Russian military base on Latvian territory," the Estonian premier said. "What is of primary importance is that Russia should withdraw its troops from Latvia by Aug. 31." The premier said the preservation of the Skrunda radar base in Latvia can have no consequences for Estonia. "What Russia has been aiming to do of late is to cause a rift in Baltic unity. We're up against clear tactics: by playing the Lithuanian card, Russia accuses Estonia and Latvia of human rights violations, then concentrates its attention on Latvia. Since all Russia's attempts to drive a wedge between the Baltic states have failed, it is again quoting all three Baltic states as a negative example," Laar said. The Estonian premier assumed that, after solving the Skrunda radar base problem, Russia will again focus on Lithuania that faces a major problem connected with the numerous Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region. Luik told BNS an agreement on the Skrunda radar base hasn't actually been concluded yet. "The term of its use is only one aspect of the agreement, which is connected with the Latvian authorities' access to the base, the sum to be paid for its use, and the number of military at the base," Luik said. The foreign minister claimed Russia wants to leave about 1,000 men at the Skrunda radar base, while Latvia wants to limit their number at 80.
