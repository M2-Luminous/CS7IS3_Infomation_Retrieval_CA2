Cabinet Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan was addressing the conference aimed at reviewing the implementation of the law on foreign investment. Now, there are about 3,000 Vietnamese entrepreneurs working in foreign-invested enterprises, especially in joint venture enterprises. According to SCCI, over the past six years the Vietnamese investors had done their best to overcome difficulties and accumulated much experience in investment management. Vietnamese investors drew many foreign partners with a volume of high investment capital aimed at promoting production and commerce, thus creating effective cooperation for mutual benefits, Xuan told the conference. Over the past six years, the foreign investment enterprises earned USD 780 million through their goods production and service, Xuan said. However, some of Vietnamese investors involved in management had poor knowledge of the investment law and business practices. Foreign partners, on the other hand, were very experienced and able to overcome difficulties as they arose. Up to March 1994, SCCI has granted licenses to 900 foreign- invested projects with a total registered capital of USD 8.5 million. Vietnamese investors said one of the greatest difficulties in executing foreign investment projects was the small contribution of the Vietnamese partner compared with the foreign party. On average, the Vietnam's contribution to the total capital usually amounts to no more than 30 per cent. SCCI made known that Vietnamese investors will be granted training courses covering basic knowledge of investment cooperation. In the future the joint venture enterprises expect to receive officially-educated cadres. SCCI will issue management policies, thus creating better conditions for the Vietnamese investors to become involved in running foreign-invested enterprises. It intends to set up a club for the Vietnamese investors. Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan said that in the past six years, Vietnam had established a foothold in foreign markets by drawing on the capital of the 500 foreign investor companies from 40 countries. The government is determined in 1994 to make investment procedures simple, clear-cut and strict so as to make the investment environment in Vietnam more attractive, Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan added.
