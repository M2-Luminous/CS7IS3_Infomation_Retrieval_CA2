He is the former agriculture and livestock minister. [passage omitted] After his election, our colleague, Celcius Nsengiyunva, asked the president about the meaning of the election and his priorities to get the country of its crisis. [Begin recording] [Ntaryamira] I am happy, just as all Burundians are happy at this moment. I am happy with the step we have attained in our efforts, which are still under way, to restore peace and security to our country. [passage omitted] [Nsengiyunva] Your Excellency, what will your priorities be? [Ntaryamira] The first job in the coming days will be to continue making peace among Burundians by continuing the work of restoring the peace and security that have been interrupted in our country. We must continue the work of restoring understanding between Burundian brothers. The next priority will be to return home those who have fled their homes internally and abroad. Then we will place emphasis on educating people about respect for human rights, which have been trampled on recently. Many people have died, so this is a very important job that we will stress. Other things to be done soon will be to rebuild what has been destroyed. This is a lot to do. You know well that many houses were demolished. [Words indistinct] bridges, and many other things were destroyed during the events. [passage omitted] [end recording]
