"We had a very good two-day visit here because we were given opportunities to call on Premier Vo Van Kiet and Party Secretary-General Do Muoi and the delegates, after talking with other Vietnamese high ranking officials, were now able to attain Vietnam's policies and govemment leaders' views so that they could plan their future investment in Vietnam," said Anan in an interview with THE NATION before leaving Hanoi Friday for Ho Chi Minh City, the second leg of his working visit to Vietnam. Anan led a delegation comprising 20 top Thai businessmen on a five-day working visit to Vietnam at the invitation of Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet. The visit was described by both the hosts and the guest as "a returning home." "For the Vietnamese, you have been our friend for years. You have been making every effort to establish good Thai-Vietnamese ties. Therefore in our view, your trip to Vietnam this time could be seen as a returning home," said Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment at a reception given shortly afer Anan's arrival. The respect given to Anan by the Vietnamese even sounds better when Vietnamese Premier praised his guest as Vietnam's good and trusted friend. "Your visit will surely usher in a new era, that of a multi-faceted cooperation between our two countries," Kiet said at a reception given to Anan last Wednesday [2 February]. "We should join our efforts on accelerating the Thai-Vietnamese ties regardless of whatever the past was," Kiet added. In turn, Anan said he shared the Vietnamese leaders' views. "I'll do everything I can to accelerate and cement Thai-Vietnamese ties," he added. Anan also said during his long talks with Kiet at a small private dinner given in his honour by the Vietnamese premier, the host and the guest had talked quite a bit about political and economic ties between Vietnam and Thailand. "We all expressed our satisfaction at the development of the ties between our two countries," said Anan, adding that he was quite satisfied with his trip. Asked if there was any contact signed during the trip, the former premier said three memorandums of understanding would be signed in Ho Chi Minh city. According to them, a zippers and buttons factory would be set up by Saha Union and there would be technical cooperation between Pranda Jewellery (of Thailand) and Saigon Jewellery. Asked to comment on the decision recently taken by the United States to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam the former premier said,"it's good for the United States. It's good for Vietnam. It's good for the region. The move helps everybody put the Vietnam War behind them. We all look forward to expanding ties between the countries, between the United States and Vietnam," he said.
