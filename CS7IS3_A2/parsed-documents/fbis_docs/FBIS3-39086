On Wednesday [9 February], at a conference of the seven neighboring states of ex-Yugoslavia, the participating foreign ministers decided to develop a security paper together with the Western European Union (WEU) and the CSCE. Foreign Minister Mock stated that this document is to point out the danger of an escalation of the conflict. Moreover, the foreign ministers of Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and Italy are planning a follow-up meeting to discuss the effects of the sanctions against the rest of Yugoslavia. The international UN expert commission for war crimes has documented 55,000 cases since 1992 and will present them later to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, according to Cherif Bassiouni, its head. Most of the victims are Bosnian Muslims.
