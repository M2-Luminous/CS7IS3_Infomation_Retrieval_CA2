Confirmation was not available from the Helsinki Embassy. The newspaper, Finland's biggest, said Kim Pyong-il left the country April 22 after serving as ambassador for about a month and the embassy had not announced when he would be back. He handed his credentials to President Martti Ahtisaari [as received] late in March, the newspaper said, adding that experts considered the absence odd. "He left the country just a day or two before President Ahtisaari's dinner for the diplomatic corps. The once yearly dinners are occasions not to be absent from. They are seen as particularly important for new ambassadors," the paper wrote.
