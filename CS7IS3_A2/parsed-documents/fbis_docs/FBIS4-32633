Minister Martino is leading a delegation of his government which is paying a visit to the Republic of Croatia. Tihomir Vinkovic has a report: [Vinkovic] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, had talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Zagreb this afternoon with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino. Following the talks Italian Minister Martino stated that their talks were cordial and informative and added: [Martino, in Italian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] "I had an opportunity to hear the Croatian Government's opinion on the situation in former Yugoslavia and the prospects for peace. This information is valuable to us ahead of the forthcoming meeting of the G-7 and Russia in Naples. As regards bilateral relations, I am extremely pleased with the constructive approach displayed by the Croatian side. I also hope that these talks will be put into practice." [Vinkovic] Following the talks Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic stated: [Granic] ``We had a friendly and useful meeting which focused on the situation in the region, on the situation in the occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia and prospects for peaceful reintegration, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the prospects for peace there, on forecasts regarding the proposal by the contact group, whether it will be accepted or not, and on prospects for peace or war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In every case Croatia supports the negotiated peaceful option, as this offers the chance to restore peace in the entire region. ``We also had talks about bilateral relations, the process of integration of the Republic of Croatia into Europe. We would like to thank Italy for its support to the Republic of Croatia in the process of its European integration. This primarily refers to an economic agreement with the European Union [EU] and its admission to some EU projects, such as PHARE [Aid to Poland and Hungary for Economic Reconstruction], the (TEMPUS) program, and finally, our goal is associate membership of the EU. "As regards our bilateral relations, i.e. protection of the Italian minority, Croatia will observe all their existing rights and the best European standards; we are also ready for a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Italy." [Vinkovic] The Italian foreign minister will also be received by Cardinal Kuharic. This evening he will be received by Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman.
