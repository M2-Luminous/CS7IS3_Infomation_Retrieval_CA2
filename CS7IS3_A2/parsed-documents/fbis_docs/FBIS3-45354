Speaking to reporters, Patten said he was "a little puzzled" by remarks last week by a senior Chinese official that Beijing thinks Hong Kong should spend more of its reserves on the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok project. "Sometimes they say we shouldn't put more money into the airport. Sometimes they say that we should. Sometimes they say both things in the same paragraph," he said. The best solution, he said, was for the airport committee of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group -- charged with hammering out the details of Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 -- to meet as soon as possible. "I'm very happy to try to resolve these matters sooner than later in the airport committee. That's what the people of Hong Kong would like to do, too," he said. Patten spoke as his administration said it was pressing ahead with a request to the Legislative Council for 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars (216 million U.S.) to keep the project going for another few months. Site preparation is nearing completion, but contracts have yet to be issued for the airport's futuristic terminal, as well as for the runway and maintenance facilities. In remarks Tuesday in Beijing, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned Hong Kong against going it alone with Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public works projects. He also said the thriving colony could "inject a certain amount" into the project, given its bulging reserves which he put at more than 100 billion dollars (12.9 billion U.S.). Yet when the project was first announced in 1989, China feared its mammoth scope would bankrupt Hong Kong. Under a 1991 agreement intended to allay that concern, Britain agreed to secure China's approval for debt financing for Chek Lap Kok, which also includes new roads and bridges, a commuter train line and seaport facilities. But negotiations on financing arrangements soon fell victim to a shrill bilateral row over Patten's efforts to reform Hong Kong's political system ahead of 1997. Sino-British talks on political reform broke down in November, prompting the governor to press ahead with the changes unilaterally. Speaking Monday, Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang said the government was dropping one of two options it put to legislators last week to keep the project going, pending an agreement with China. That option would have limited stop-gap funding to a one-off grant of 377 million dollars (48.77 million U.S.) to keep the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), set up to run the new airport, running for another year. Instead, Tsang said, it would press for the second, 1.67 billion dollar option that comprises the letting out of three upcoming contracts, plus the funding for the PAA. "We believe that there is a clear view in the community that we should press ahead with the airport project as speedily and efficiently as we can, while continuing to seek agreement with the Chinese side," Tsang said.
