With the repeal of the Air Corporation Act, 1953, the monopoly of Indian Airlines and Air India to operate scheduled flights has been ended. Simultaneously, the operations of private air taxis have been given the sanction of law. The Air Transport (Transfer and Repeal of Undertakings) Ordinance comes in place of a Bill with a similar title, which had been introduced in Parliament some 18 months ago. The ordinance was enacted owing to lack of time available to Parliament to pass the Bill. During the last session of Parliament, the Bill was listed for enactment, but again other commitments prevented its passage. Given the fact that the coming Budget Session, too, will be hectic, the Government, instead, chose to issue an ordinance. In 1990, the then V.P. Singh Government had allowed the operations of private air taxis in the country, but legal sanction eluded these "unscheduled airlines." In fact, there has been a general clamour from private air taxis operators that the Air Corporation Act, which give only Indian Airlines and Air India the right to operate scheduled air services, be repealed. With the promulgation of the ordinance, Indian Airlines and Air India, have been placed at par with private airlines as far as domestic operations go, though only these two companies can fly to destinations abroad. According to government sources, this is one of the first major steps taken to denationalise the public sector. Though there have been demands from the private industry to de-monopolise the aviation industry, the employees of these air corporations have been against such a move. With the repeal of the act, the age of "open skies" has dawned in the country. Private air lines, finally, have been conferred legal status. PTI reports from Bombay: A spokesman of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association said the measure was not going to be healthy. The Air Corporation Employees Union Regional Secretary, Mr R. Ramanathan, said "our campaign and struggle will further intensify."
