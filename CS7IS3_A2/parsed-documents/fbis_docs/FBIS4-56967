He said this at the headquarters of the Colorado Party during a celebration to recall the first anniversary of the general elections, which the party won. Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero thanked Colorado workers and peasants for not following "corrupt union leaders." The chief of state recalled that the Colorado Party won the 9 May 1993 general elections. He told party members that the party's current challenge as a government party is that of facing underdevelopment and the fight for health, education, and welfare. When asked later if he alluded to the recent strikes when, during his speech, he said that Paraguay must not be paralyzed, Wasmosy answered: "I refer to all those who wish to stop the machine." He indicated that every effort must be made to enable Paraguay to win in the formidable war against underdevelopment. He stated that he made this request as president of the Republic and as commander in chief of the Armed Forces. Wasmosy said: "I do not need and I do not want Wasmosistas or any type of istas. I need and demand upright men, capable citizens, loyal aides, and colleagues with whom I can work and who are willing to face challenges with intelligence, imagination, and courage." He called for an end to sectarian fanaticism that motivates intrigue, slander, and evil. He added: "We must overcome seditious interests and unite in carrying out the noble mission of serving the fatherland with talent, capability, and total devotion." The chief of state said: "Democratic institutionalization, the state of law, republicanism, and my profound dedication demand that I ask my fellow countrymen for the necessary sacrifice to win." "This democratic and Colorado government demands respect without subservience, discipline without obsequiousness, and support without conditions," he said. Wasmosy thanked his fellow party members for the support he received on 9 May 1993, adding that this support must increase considering the time the party will be responsible for governing. "A greater responsibility is needed because before the elections the focus was on the party, but today we carry the enormous task of being statesman for both the party and for all citizens," he stressed. He warned of the possibility of false prophets who may take up the republican principles and fly the Colorado banner. Sanabria Cantero expressed the Colorado Party's total support for Wasmosy's government task and he congratulated party workers and campesinos for not following "corrupt union leaders."
