Using an analogy which Hong Kong residents are familiar with, namely, the operational methods of a company boss dealing with Chris Patten, Lu Ping said that a boss who knew perfectly well that his company was to change hands in less than three years from today, but who was bent on making personnel arrangements for three years hence or even 30 years without consulting the new boss, was this not a joke? Of course, the new boss might refuse to accept this when he took over the company. Lu Ping indicated that Chris Patten knows perfectly well that there are only three years left of British rule in Hong Kong, but he wants to make arrangements for the Legislative Council and its major officials for three years later. In actual fact, he is attempting to make arrangements for their agents, so that their spirits would be left behind to continue to affect Hong Kong when they eventually leave the territory. Regarding Chris Patten's arguments in his speech delivered at the British Foreign Affairs Committee that the British Hong Kong Government wants to put glass in the windows, whereas the Chinese side wants to smash them, Lu Ping said that Chris Patten wanted to arbitrarily fix English-style stained glass in the windows without first asking the landlord's permission in an attempt to prevent the sun's rays from entering the house. That being the case, it was precisely Chris Patten who must make a clean breast of his ultimate motives to the world. After three years, when the landlord recovers the house, of course he had the right to remove those window panes and let the sun's rays shine all over Hong Kong. Here, the question of whether or not we have courage to do that does not exist. On Hong Kong's politics and economy, Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese Government has all along advocated the separation of politics and the economy. Reviewing the talks on Hong Kong's constitutional reforms, he said that the Chinese side had already made very great concessions economically. As for the new airport, Lu Ping stated that the responsibility did not rest with the Chinese side. He said that there were two principles in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport: First, low costs and high economic returns, without creating difficulties for the future special administrative region [SAR] government; and second, a minimum of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in financial reserves should be left to the SAR government, and debt left to the SAR government should not exceed HK$5 billion. At the same time, the Chinese side had expressed where it stood, namely, they supported building a new airport. So long as the airport was built on the basis of the Memorandum, there was nothing left for the Chinese and British side to say. Lu Ping described the British Hong Kong Government's policy on the airport issue as being the creation of side issues; now the debt left to the future SAR government would far exceed HK$5 billion, even exceeding the financial reserves of the SAR government. How could it deny that a financial burden would be left to the SAR government? Lu Ping believes that we do not wrong the British side by saying that it has violated the Memorandum of Understanding; it was also very clear on which side the responsibility lay regarding delays in the airport project. Lu Ping criticized Hamish Macleod's recent remarks that China had tried to use the airport projects to put pressure on the constitutional reform talks, indicating that the Chinese Government had never had such thinking. What was Mr. Hamish Macleod really after? It made people doubt whether the British side really wanted to talk. Therefore, it could be seen that those people who harped on the same old tune about the Chinese side wanting to link politics to the economy were precisely the group who want to turn the airport issue into a political one. Lu Ping said that the Preliminary Working Committee of the Pereparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR sincerely hoped that the British Hong Kong Government would send men to explain matters concerning the airport authority, proceeding from an active angle to promote a solution to the airport issue at the earliest possible date. Such sincerity could be found in the letter the leaders of the two economic ad hoc groups of the Preliminary Working Committee had addressed to Anson Chan Fang On-sang. However, the British side had flatly turned down this suggestion, whereas Anson Chan Fang On- sang had failed to reply to the letter in question up to this moment. Once again, politics and the economy were being linked. Recalling the fact that during the Sino-British talks over the constitutional reform issue, the Chinese side had agreed to the Central reclamation project, Lu Ping stated: We could have procrastinated, but why should we have given our consent? This is evidence to the fact that we do not link politics to the economy. Lu Ping said: We do not hope that the Sino-British political differences will affect Sino-British economic ties, but should the British side insist on linking politics to the economy, thus affecting Sino-British economic relations and Hong Kong's economy, the responsibility does not rest with the Chinese side. Lu Ping said frankly that the crux lay in the fact that there should be some common aspirations and an atmosphere of cooperation between the two sides. Only then, could a major issue become a minor one; otherwise, a tiny issue can change into a major one, and a simple matter may become complicated. Lu Ping said that the Chinese side wished for results should talks be resumed, but did not wish to see a repetition of the talks on the 1994/1995 electoral arrangements, which were a waste of time. It was a pity that the British side had not only refused to cooperate, but had even adopted a confrontational attitude. He could only express regrets and disappointment at that. Regarding the British side claim that it would leave a fortune behind in Hong Kong for the Chinese Government, Lu Ping said that Britain had no right to say this. This was the Hong Kong people's money, and the Chinese Government did not want a penny. We tried hard to squeeze every cent to leave HK$25 billion in the kitty during the airport negotiations. But we did not do that for Lu Ping, nor did we do it for the Chinese Government. It was for the people of Hong Kong in order to make preparations for a sound economic basis for the future SAR Government. Three years from now, Chris Patten would leave Hong Kong, but the Chinese side would have to bear responsibility for the Hong Kong people to ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. When this reporter asked Lu Ping about Chris Patten quoting Sir David Akers-Jones at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on TV this morning, attacking the Chinese side by saying that "the Chinese style is not to rig elections, but they do like to know the result before they are held," Lu Ping said: Regarding such a "cheap joke" by Chris Patten, I can only despise it; it was looking at a gentleman's vision from the viewpoint of a mean person. I do not believe that Chris Patten did not have any idea about the electoral outcome in his constituency during the last general election in Britain; it was a pity that Chris Patten did not know his own limitations. That was why he made an erroneous estimation. Here we can have some idea about his so-called "credibility." As for the fact that he asked a certain Mr. Sze to respond to his speech on behalf of the Hong Kong people at the hearing, this leaves much room for criticism; people wonder just how many people in Hong Kong would regard this "loyal" (Lu Ping said forgive me for quoting Chris Patten's own words) follower as one of themselves? The reporter hoped that Lu Ping would give an appraisal of Chris Patten. Lu Ping smiled and said: He is a politician, but not a good one, nor an honest one.
