In the interests of the investigation the results of the cross-examination are not being made public. Information about the arrested man passed on through TASS channels by the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Public Relations Center abounds in contradictions. Hence the case of Barkashov's gunmen, who played an active role in the events of October, has become clouded with improbable rumors. On Monday the law-enforcement organs publicly stated that "a detailed report on the RNU affair will follow" as early as Tuesday. However, at the promised time the power departments' press centers seemed to have decided to keep mum. What is more, they refused to comment on the report of the MVD Public Relations Center that the investigation into Barkashov on the prosecutor's directive had been...terminated one week after the suppression of the putsch. Vladimir Tskhay, chief of the team investigating the Barkashov affair, also refused to clarify anything on this question. It is known only that Barkashov is being "grilled" by investigators of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. Meanwhile the circumstances of the attempt on the fascist ringleader are becoming more and more mysterious. It is not even known where exactly it took place. Two versions exist: In Zelenograd, and in Moscow Oblast's Krasnogorsk. In the only hospital in Zelenograd where the wounded man could have been operated on -- the Third City Hospital -- the report carried by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI that Barkashov stayed there 22 through 30 December has been categorically denied. Chief doctor Leonid Shushelya said that "following the appearance of the false report many doctors are refusing to go on duty, fearing reprisals from Barkashov's gunmen." The "Krasnogorsk version" looks more authentic. Barkashov could have been operated on in three places in this city -- in the Krasnogorsk Machine Plant's Medical and Health Ward; in the 114th District military hospital; and in the Vishnevskiy Central Clinical Hospital. Most likely the wounded man was registered under an assumed name. How the attempt itself took place is also, to put it mildly, a cause of bewilderment. It is known for a fact that the fuehrer's bodyguard would never leave their leader's side. How did he come to be on the street in the hours before dawn, and completely alone? Why did the criminals not "finish off" their victim at that deserted hour? And finally, a strange coincidence: Where on earth did the car which took Barkashov to the operating table at 0400 hours come from...? A person close to Barkashov told me that it cannot be ruled out that the incident was staged: that Barkashov shot himself, or received the friendly "assistance" of his comrades-in-arms. Only to what end? Yet another riddle... Another riddle is the fact that the fuehrer is now being treated in the Russian Federation MVD Central Hospital, although, General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazanik said, he has been charged under a number of articles of the Criminal Code. The other day many mass media were faxed a "Russian National Unity statement" in defense of their leader and signed by "the RNU Council." Another riddle: It is known that on 28 September last year Viktor Krivov, chairman of the RNU Council, quarreled with Barkashov and took some of the gunmen with him from the White House. So that a united Russian National Unity Council simply does not exist. The Barkashov affair is turning into a web of unexplained circumstances. Some RNU members believe that it will never be untangled. Barkashov, thanks to influential friends in the power departments, will quickly find himself free, and ordinary members will take the rap for him on prison bunks.
