In early April, Jiangsu conducted a general inspection of the audio and video market in the whole province. Audio and video administrative departmeNts in all areas coordinated with departments in charge of industry and commerce, as well as public security departments, to repeatedly crack down on piracy reproduction of compact discs, thereby effectively dealing a blow to their illegal distribution and sales. An inspection team formed by relevant state departments praised Jiangsu's audio and video market, saying it maintained good order while enjoying brisk sales.
