The government thinks that international trade atmosphere has largely improved following the conclusion of the Uruguay round of trade talks. The APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit meeting was also marked by a friendly atmosphere. [Begin recording] [Aphisit] We must follow it closely to see whether the move will be applied in general. We must be prepared; it is the responsibility of the government that wants to see a relaxed atmosphere in international trade. [Unidentified correspondent] Is the U.S. measure meant as pressure on this region? [Aphisit] I think it concerns a particular problem. Anyway, we cannot remain indifferent but have to follow the developments and see whether there is a tendency toward unilateral retaliation. As I have said, I believe there will be a discussion on this matter at the preparations for the APEC meeting. [Correspondent] Will there be any discussion among ourselves to prepare for the U.S. move? [Aphisit] The Thai private sector and government are already cooperating on that. It's the responsibility of Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his capacity as head of the International Economic Policy Office. There is no problem about our preparations to cope with the consequences; we are already working together on that. [end recording]
