Parliamentary sources confirm the ANC wants to set up 26 select committees in the National Assembly -- one for each portfolio in the Cabinet. But National Party [NP] chief whip Fanus Schoeman says the NP believes 19 select committees will be sufficient as various portfolios can be grouped -- such as water affairs, forestry and agriculture. He says experience has shown that some portfolios produce only one or two Bills a year and do not justify a select committee of their own. Parliamentary officials confirm that the number of select committees has not yet been finalised. Some MPs say the ANC's move to increase the number of select committees is to ensure that all the members of its massive caucus belong to a committee to give them some work to do. The ANC has 252 National Assembly members and 60 senators. By comparison the NP, which has the next biggest caucus, has far fewer MPs -- meaning that they will be relatively busier with committee work. The NP has 82 MPs and 17 senators. The smaller parties will have their work cut out keeping up with committee work, with MPs having to sit on several committees. The Inkatha Freedom Party has 43 Assembly seats and five senators, the Democracy Party has seven Assembly members and three senators while the Pan Africanist Congress has just five Assembly MPs and the African Christian Democratic Party two MPs. Taking into account the growing backlash against the huge salaries being paid to politicians -- backbenchers are to earn R193,000 [rand] a year -- any sign that MPs are idle is bound to increase public anger. Since the abolition of the constituency system in favour of proportional representation, MPs are no longer directly responsible for a specific seat. This has created concern that many ANC backbenchers in particular are going to be grossly overpaid and underworked. However, both the Nats and the ANC are setting up structures to make MPs responsible for specific areas to increase their workload. Schoeman says Nat MPs will be even busier than in the past as the party structure will keep a watch on the amount of work they do, whereas in the past MPs could "bury themselves" in their constituencies without anyone really knowing how much work they did. There have been calls on Cabinet Ministers to use under-employed MPs more constructively instead of employing outsiders at taxpayers' expense. In one case, former CAPE TIMES editor Tony Heard is to be appointed senior adviser to Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal. An MP could to the job without further pay. DP Natal Senator Errol Moorcroft predicts that many backbenchers from the biggest parties will be "bored with life" as they will have little to do. On the other hand, MPs from smaller parties such as the DP will be inundated with work, he says. MPs now have to pay for their own expenses -- even stamps -- which will cut the effective pay of the busier MPs from the smaller parties, while those from the bigger parties with a smaller workload will increase their "profit" margins. Up-country MPs complain that their salaries are justified by the expense of running a second household in Cape Town. As long as Parliament remains in Cape Town, the best-off MPs will be the Cape ones who have no need for a second home. Should Parliament move to Pretoria, it will be the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] MPs who will coin it.
