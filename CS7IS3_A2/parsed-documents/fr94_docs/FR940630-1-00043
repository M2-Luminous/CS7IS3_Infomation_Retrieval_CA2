FR940630-1-00043 FR940630-1-00011 Reduced Need for Special Conditions The proposed rule includes five provisions that would replace the need for processing certain parts or materials as special conditions because they have been considered novel or unusual design features. The subjects of these provisions include composite propellers, fuel injection systems for reciprocating engines, induction filters on turbine engines, fuel shutoff controls other than mixture controls, and auxiliary power units. No costs are attributed to these provisions. Formalization of the equivalent safety standards and requirements for these subjects would obviate the need for special conditions actions and would simplify the certification process for manufacturers. Clarification Several unclear provisions of part 23 were revealed during the harmonization review. In response to this finding, the proposal includes a number of no-cost, editorial revisions that would clarify the existing requirements. These changes would benefit manufacturers by removing potential confusion about the specific standards and requirements necessary for product certification. In summary, the FAA holds that each of the provisions, as well as the entire proposal, would be cost beneficial. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. Based on implementing FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, the FAA has determined that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Trade Impact Assessment The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American airplanes to foreign countries and the import of foreign airplanes into the United States. Instead, the proposed powerplant airworthiness standards would be harmonized with those of foreign aviation authorities and would lessen current restraints on trade caused by differences in certification requirements. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion The FAA proposes to revise the airworthiness standards to provide propulsion standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes to harmonize them with the standards that will be proposed for the same category airplanes by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revisions would reduce the regulatory burden on the United States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them of the need to show compliance with different standards each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country. For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT .
