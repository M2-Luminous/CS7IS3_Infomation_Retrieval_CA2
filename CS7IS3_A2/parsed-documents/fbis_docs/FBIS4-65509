In the Bundestag Defense Committee, the minister announced in Bonn on Wednesday [18 May] that in the Bundeswehr, too, work is going to be done as much as possible along the line of business management. The goal is to "rationalize and, wherever useful, privatize" the entire operations through "internal optimization." By the end of the 1990's, the Defense Ministry is to be restructured and the staff is to be reduced by 38 percent, from 5,200 to 3,300 employees. Ruehe told DPA that he expects a "broad consensus" among the parties for his concept. Ruehe bases his plans on the investigations of the "Work Group for Limiting Expenditure in Operations" (AGAB), which was established in March 1993 and headed by General Lorenz Huber. In cooperation with civilian consulting companies, Huber showed possibilities to save up to 35 percent of personnel and 25 percent of costs. By optimizing operations over the next years, up to 2 billion German marks [DM] per year could be saved just in equipment maintenance and administration. Ruehe explained to the deputies that the storage of material and stock management must be made considerably more economical. According to Ruehe, depot organization must be centralized far more. The repair facilities of the Army, Air Force, and Navy will be newly organized. Considerable numbers of personnel are to be reduced. The transportation sector and the telecommunications system of the armed forces will be rationalized and modernized. The restructuring of logistics requires "a keener awareness for using the scarce resources efficiently" at all leadership echelons of the Bundeswehr," Ruehe stressed. Motivating the employees for the set targets is one of the keys to success. The military commanders must see "that saving in their sphere of responsibility pays off." The Defense Ministry is to "be brought back to its basic tasks." Its organization structure will be tightened to facilitate speedy processes of command and decisionmaking. The military command staffs, the civilian departments, and the Armament Main Department will be maintained "in a balanced degree." The assignment and responsibility of the inspector general and the inspectors of the units will not change. In the Command Staff of the armed forces, however, "the ministerial tasks of the military sector will be concentrated." The civilian part of the ministry will get a "largely new structure, which will be more functional." There will be a new Department for Personnel, Social, and Central Matters (PSZ). The Legal Department will also be reorganized. The Armament Main Department will be reduced to the ministry's basic tasks. According to Manfred Opel, defense expert of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SDP], a "rationalization potential is lying fallow" in the Bundeswehr, "which adds up to about DM4 billion." If, for instance, the "scrap" of the former National People's Army (NVA) of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] in 84 storage facilities, on which a lot of money is spent for guarding it, were to be immediately disposed of privately, at least DM300 million could be saved.
