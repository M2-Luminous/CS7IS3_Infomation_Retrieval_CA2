This is a brazen interference in the internal affairs of our country and an intolerable insult to the socialist system of our style centering on the popular masses. The DPRK Government, which regards it as its immovable policy to value man and respect his rights, substantially provides genuine freedom and rights to all citizens and creditably ensures their abundant and happy life. The United States came out with the fiction of "violation of human rights in North Korea", blatantly distorting the stark reality. This is a crafty ruse to impair the image of our republic and isolate us. This clearly proves that the United States is intensifying the propaganda offensive in every way to slander our republic, while laying artificial hurdles in the way of the DPRK-USA talks for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and rendering the situation extremely strained. If one wants to talk about the chief violator of human rights and the barren land of human rights, he must cite the United States and South Korea. If the United States, keeping silent about this, attempts to decry the advantages and invincible might of the socialist system of our style centering on the popular masses with a silly talk, it is a mistake. The United States must immediately stop its anti-DPRK and anti-socialist propaganda over the "human rights issue" of the DPRK, a disgusting product of its reactionary strategy.
