The vote was practically unanimous, a rare case in the Duma, even though it was preceded by a heated debate. Many speakers still remember too well the Soviet Civil Code adopted 30 years ago. Common sense prevailed eventually and the chamber approved the document after the Agrarian Faction insisted on a significant amendment. In preparing the document for second reading, the drafters were instructed to proceed from the assumption that the alienation and use of land and other natural resources is regulated by civil legislation in as much as land and other natural resources can be an object of civil turnover under land, agrarian and other legislation concerning natural resources.
