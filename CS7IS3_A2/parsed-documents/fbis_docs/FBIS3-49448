Tomorrow, [12 January] President Walesa is going to Prague, where he will take part in the Visegrad group summit. [Miecugow] Tomorrow you will meet President Clinton. What do you want to tell the president? [Walesa] Of course, what I have already said but in a different way. [Before], I spoke to the nation but not in a diplomatic language. I was counting on social pressure. One talks slightly differently to diplomats, but we talk about the same things. That is, in my opinion, I think that the leap should have been greater, that one should have moved further. I think that this has been a mistake. However, as I have said, one can reach the same aim at a different pace. Nevertheless, these talks will be difficult because I expect that this concept [Partnership for Peace], which in a way has been imposed on us, will be defended. [Miecugow] Do you still believe that Poland is one of the Central European states first in line to join NATO? [Walesa] As a practitioner, I think that these priorities are relative. If the situation becomes difficult and dangerous, Poland will certainly be the first. If the situation is different, if great compromises happen, if there is some sort of pulling out [jakies takie wydzieranie], the others and the more minor will have a greater chance to be withdrawn, or incorporated [in NATO]. This is a game involving interests and how large the country is. Poland, however, is a medium size country. Other countries, and especially Russia, focus particular attention on us.
