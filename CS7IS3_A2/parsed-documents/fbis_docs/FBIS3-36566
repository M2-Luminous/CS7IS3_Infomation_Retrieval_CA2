What consequences does all this have for Russia's stability? [Baturin] Unfortunately, people such as Gaydar and Finance Minister Fedorov have become the sole symbols of reform. Their departure is then promptly interpreted as signifying danger, as meaning that reforms will be halted. [DER SPIEGEL] Following this latest government reshuffle, the West is already preparing itself for a standstill and hyperinflation.... [Baturin] I know, but, under the new Constitution, only the president can set the basic directions of domestic and foreign policy. The government just implements his will. In the second half of February, when Boris Yeltsin presents his state of the nation report to parliament, we will see whether he is still serious about reform. [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin's closest allies are accusing Prime Minister Chernomyrdin of having already staged an "economic coup" and are predicting mass uprisings and chaos in the spring. [Baturin] I do not want to say that we are now on a certain course regarding economic policy. But I would be against seeing things in excessively dramatic terms. One has to let the new government start work before one tell whether it is promising more than it can accomplish. [DER SPIEGEL] What advice would you offer the president? [Baturin] As security adviser, it is my task to predict what kind of course of developments would spell danger for Russia. The population was positively disposed toward the reformers around Gaydar over a long period of time. In April, a majority voted in favor of their economic policies. However, shock therapy -- the lifting of controls on prices and the scarcity of money -- led to great dissatisfaction in the meantime. The result of the December parliamentary elections was the check. [DER SPIEGEL] There are about 70,000 unprofitable plants in Russia, but only eight filed for bankruptcy last year. What is the shock about? [Baturin] You may see things that way. For someone who is fit, it is not hard to jump out of a third story window -- he will just get up and carry on running. For someone who is not in shape, jumping off a chair can be fatal. Many plants have not paid their employees' wages for months now. Relatively few are well off. On the other hand, there are millions who are living below the poverty line -- is that not a shock? These are the very people who determine what happens at the ballot box. [DER SPIEGEL] So there will be no adjustments to the basic policy course? [Baturin] Policy must be adjusted by introducing social buffers. [DER SPIEGEL] New presents of loans for bankrupt enterprises will push up inflation dramatically. [Baturin] Inflation might go up, but that does not have to lead to catastrophe right away. The same thing might have happened with Gaydar and Fedorov, and who knows on what scale. Besides, if the government departs from the president's policy course too much, Boris Yeltsin will make adjustments -- I am certain that he is capable of that. [DER SPIEGEL] Who actually decides what is good for Russia's security: the president, who is equipped with totalitarian powers, the Security Council, or the new parliament? [Baturin] What do you mean by totalitarian? There is a clear distinction between the powers of the president and of parliament. The Security Commission at the federal council level and the Duma can make proposals and thus shape national security concepts. Decisions are made by the Security Council. If there are any doubts, the president has the last word. [DER SPIEGEL] The president has an enormous apparatus that shields him. [Baturin] Yeltsin's administration really is too big, and that hinders effective work. The team of advisers -- there are five of us -- is much smaller. [DER SPIEGEL] In Belarus, the ex-Communists have brought down the head of parliament and are advocating union with Moscow. In the Crimea, a Russian nationalist who has been give the title of president promises union with the old motherland. Will the old union be re-established? [Baturin] The Soviet Union collapsed overnight. However, the economic, cultural, and human ties that existed have not been broken. It is like an elastic band, it you stretch it too much, it suddenly contracts. For economic reasons alone, there had to be a turnaround in the republics. However, there will be no Soviet Union again. [DER SPIEGEL] But a new association led by Russia? [Baturin] Russia is the most powerful republic and is economically in a better position than the rest, which means that it acts like a magnet. As the situation in our country becomes more stable, the former republics will rally round us all the more. [DER SPIEGEL] The Russian president in Simferopol wants to hand over the entire Crimea immediately. [Baturin] We have to be very careful. Every rash act can revive political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. That is something that we should not promote. Of course, every people has the right to express its will. [DER SPIEGEL] Recently, Foreign Minister Kozyrev has been repeatedly calling for understanding to be shown for Russia's "special role" on the territory of the former USSR. What does this "special role" entail? [Baturin] In the former Soviet republics, there are a great many people who still feel that they are citizens of Russia.... [DER SPIEGEL] The figure that is cited is 25 million.... [Baturin] It's about that. There is no comparable situation in international relations. To tell these people now that history has caught them out, that they no longer belong to us, would be morally unacceptable. [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, the "special role" is a modest way of expressing great power politics? [Baturin] If Russia sees itself as a great power, then it must take care of the "Russians abroad." The United States already views Russia as a developing country. That might be true from the economic angle. However, in the past we were also never leaders in world markets, but were still considered a great power. Why was that? Because everyone was afraid of a country that was full of nuclear weapons and had an enormous army. Now the West is afraid that the collapse of the Union will produce an explosion that will make itself felt in Europe or in other parts of the world too. So, according to that criterion, we are still a great power. [DER SPIEGEL] Those sorts of views have turned the Baltic states, where you see the Russians as being discriminated against, against you. [Baturin] There must a tough reaction to tough action.... [DER SPIEGEL] You mean stopping the withdrawal of your troops? [Baturin] A great power cannot duck for cover every time, that is not the way for a great power to behave. [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin has welcomed the NATO "Partnership for Peace." Will that kind of cooperation not just boost support for nationalists such as Zhirinovskiy? [Baturin] One cannot exclude the possibility that they will get more wind in their sails as a result. Besides, Yeltsin did not "welcome" this kind of cooperation with NATO. He expressed himself in a rather more restrained manner. [DER SPIEGEL] In the Army, the number of votes cast for Zhirinovskiy was particularly high. How would you interpret that warning sign? [Baturin] It was a protest. If there had been reformers who could sell themselves as well as Zhirinovskiy, then the result would have been different. [DER SPIEGEL] Your tasks include the reform of the state security service. What is to remain of the old KGB? [Baturin] In the new Russia, there should be no more political persecution, no campaigns against those who think differently, and no ideological uniformity imposed by force. In reforming the Security Ministry, we have disbanded the departments that operated in those areas. We are now forming a civilized counterintelligence service. [DER SPIEGEL] But the security service generals have doubts about your competence. Are you not afraid that you will fail in the same way as Vadim Bakatin, whom Gorbachev charged with reforming the KGB? [Baturin] If I was not afraid, then that is precisely what would happen. I have to be more cautious than Bakatin. The new office of security adviser marks the beginning of civilian control over Russia's Army and security structures. [DER SPIEGEL] Zhirinovskiy talks of a clean bill of health that was apparently issued to him by the KGB. When will the Lubjanka archives be finally opened and the files made available to everyone? [Baturin] I hope that will happen. It is undoubtedly a very sensitive issue, one that affects the interests of a great many people. One must find mechanisms that will enable one to start on this kind of treatment of history in a relatively painless manner.
