This rejection was emphasized in last week's poll by InformEstado, which revealed that 82 percent of those polled want the next government to continue with the real plan. Only 6 percent want the plan discontinued, while 12 percent said they did not know what they want. Among those who support continuation of the plan, irrespective of who wins the presidential elections, the majority (65 percent) believe that the next president should respect the plan in its entirety, while only 17 percent said that the plan should be only partially continued. There is considerable support for the plan: 68 percent of those polled back the real. Support for the real increases among members of higher social classes, going from 50 percent for class D to 82 percent for class A. By age, the plan obtained its strongest support from people between 41 and 50. The lower the educational level, the higher the indifference and the higher the number of people claiming to be "neither against nor in favor." For 58 percent of those polled, the plan will succeed -- although partially -- as was noted by 32 percent of this group. Pessimistic answers were given by 26 percent, who said the plan will fail (16 percent do not know). Despite the optimism concerning the plan, the people polled were entirely distrustful when asked about price increases. The majority -- 72 percent -- believe that prices will continue to increase. Expectations over government-set prices are not better: 58 percent believe the government will also continue to increase prices.
