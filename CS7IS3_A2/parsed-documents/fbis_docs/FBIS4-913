Massacres are presently being committed in Gitarama, Butare, Gikongoro, and Kibuye prefectures. Calls for extermination are made unceasingly by those in power in Kigali, calls for the extermination of Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] supporters, or presumed RPF supporters, and members of opposition political parties. The national radio has increasingly become the propaganda tool for this cause. That's why Gitarama, Butare, Gikongoro and Kibuye prefectures have now fallen victim to the massacres as is the case for the capital, Kigali, and other regions like [word indistinct]. The horde of killers continues to hunt down their victims, even in places where the latter have taken refuge. The government Army today fired shells at (Amohoro) stadium of Kigali where more than 4,000 people who escaped the massacres have taken refuge. There are 20 dead and more than 50 wounded. The strong men of the tottering regime of Kigali are thus determined to exterminate sections of the population. [passage indistinct] They have been asking that RPF stop fighting while they continue to orchestrate the massacres. Before ending this news bulletin, we inform you that Mr. Marc Rugenera, finance minister of the decapitated government, has survived the massacre. He has been found by RPF combatants during their operations aimed at rescuing the victims of the Presidential Guards and of the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias]
