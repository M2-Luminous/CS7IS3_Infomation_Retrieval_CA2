To a question about the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in particular about Oleksandr Moroz's remarks that the Black Sea Fleet should be a joint one, the president of Ukraine noted: "The fleet can either be single or divided but a joint one would mean that there would never be peace here." According to Leonid Kravchuk, by law Ukraine has three types of forces: land, air, and sea forces. "As president I implement the Supreme Council law. If the Black Sea Fleet is a joint one, then the law of Ukraine needs to be changed," Leonid Kravchuk said. He also stressed that he is in favor of the main base being in Sevastopol, and he is convinced that this issue is not for the people of Sevastopol to decide in a referendum, but it is a matter for the states. Touching on the issue of treaty relations between Crimea and Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that he "is in favor of granting the broadest possible powers to the regions, including Crimea." Replying to a question about his attitude to Yevgeniy Saburov's opinion that "Ukraine does not need Central Committee ideologues now, but new politicians," Leonid Kravchuk said: "Entirely new politicians are needed now, who are not burdened with the Soviet Union's past." Regarding contradictions between the constitutions of Crimea and Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that Crimea's interests and new circumstances have been taken into account in the new Ukrainian constitution. Commenting on information that wheat would not be harvested on an area of over 180,000 hectares in Crimea, Leonid Kravchuk reported that it is planned to adopt a resolution on assistance to rural areas in certain regions on 27 June. "Assistance to these regions is the main purpose of my trip," the president said. Regarding the presidential election of 26 June, Leonid Kravchuk expressed the conviction that "people have practically determined their positions and one should not now expect an election struggle." Commenting on the preliminary results of the Belarusian presidential election, in accordance with which Lukashenka (45 percent) and Kebich (1.7 percent) [figure as received] have gone through to the second round, Leonid Kravchuk observed that "the people elect whoever is consistent in his policy."
