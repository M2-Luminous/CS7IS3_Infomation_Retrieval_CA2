But, because the rumor seems to be based on a firm foundation of truth, the first intrigues and maneuvers have already started. The path of "Jean-Luc who" to Jacques Delors's seat is still long and sown with many ambushes. [passage omitted] Formally the appointment of a new Commission president is the privilege of the council of heads of government and heads of state. However, there is no fixed procedure. Consequently the appointment is preceded by a long bout of shadowboxing, in which no one can get round France and Germany if they have made an agreement between themselves. The new president's profile is a broad one. A vision of Europe is less important than the candidate's geographical and, to a lesser degree, ideological origin. It is a little like the appointment of the Swiss president. Because the present Commission president is French and a socialist, his successor may not be the former and preferably not the latter either. This virtually rules out Denmark and Spain, where socialist governments are in power. There is little chance that they will put forward a candidate from their opposition. Italy has little chance, because every candidate there risks being in a prison cell at the time when the call comes from Brussels. With Gaston Thorn, Luxembourg provided the Commission president before Delors. Portugal has the ideal candidate in Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, who is actually a Christian Democrat, but whose party is simultaneously called "social democratic" and belongs to the European liberals. However, Lisbon did not put forward any claims. Ireland apparently gave up hope after former Commissioner Peter Sutherland went to the GATT. Campaign At present there are four known candidates to succeed Delors. Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who is to resign after the parliamentary elections of 12 May in his country; his Belgian colleague Jean-Luc Dehaene; his predecessor Wilfried Martens, now president of the European Christian Democrats, and the British EU Commissioner Leon Brittan, once a minister under Margaret Thatcher. [passage omitted] Martens is better known abroad than his successor, who was described by a journalist in THE TIMES last week as "Jean-Luc who?" But Dehaene could well be able to count on the support of Kohl and Mitterrand. In addition there are even more political complications on the agenda in Belgium. Belgium's representative at the Commission is one of the portfolios which are divided on the basis of a proportional system when a new government is formed. If current Commissioner Karel Van Miert [Flemish Socialist Party] has to make way for Martens or Dehaene, then compensation must be provided. Senate Chairman Frank Swaelen's future is once again uncertain. It is still early in the appointment race. It is presumably Helmut Kohl who is holding the finish flag. In addition it is unclear whether the agreement which he and Mitterrand made 10 years ago when Delors was appointed, first a Frenchman, then a German, still applies. It is even more intriguing that Kohl, in a year when the German electorate will get rid of many CDU [Christian Democratic Union] politicians, has not yet put forward his own candidate. Perhaps, because Germany has become so big and important in Europe, he will chose a non-German representative, which would explain why Kohl does not want Lubbers. Or has Dehaene been floated as a candidate to undercut Lubbers, the favorite? After which the latter flew Martens as a kite to trip up Dehaene? In any case, this story will continue.
