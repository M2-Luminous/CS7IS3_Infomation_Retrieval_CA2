In a statement to Obrenovac Radio, he said that the first reason is the fact that the Russian Embassy in Zagreb is too crammed, given that a delegation that would discuss possibilities of restoring economic relations should be relatively numerous since the subject of negotiations requires broader and more frequent meetings. The second reason is that there is a great deal of pressure from the Croatian media whose headlines are full of words such as "criminals from Knin," something that clearly characterizes the atmosphere and ambience surrounding the negotiations. Jarcevic also mentioned that representatives of the Russian Federation, some in Zagreb and some in Moscow, are openly advocating the recognition of Croatia within its AVNOJ [prewar] borders and stated that this is what Russian diplomacy will stick to. He said that the Krajina side has pointed out that this is a kind of pressure and demanded that representatives of Russia and the United States should refrain from such statements for at least as long as the negotiations are taking place. ``Because of all this we categorically demand that the negotiations should resume on neutral ground, in a Russian Embassy in a neighboring countries. This is what we told Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister for foreign affairs, and Kai Eide, deputy cochairman of the peace conference, who have nevertheless insisted on continuing the negotiations in Zagreb. Asked to what extent the continuation of negotiations would depend on what has been going on around Gorazde, Jarcevic said that this could decisively influence further negotiations. ``For, it is evident that the United Nations has taken the side of one party, something we were aware of even when NATO weaponry was far from our borders,'' he said. "However, we do not rule out negotiations and the mediation of Russia and the United States, although they cannot expect any concession from our side unless the Croatian side agrees to this too," Jarcevic said in conclusion.
