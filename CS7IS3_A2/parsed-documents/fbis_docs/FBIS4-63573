The talks were part of the current official visit to Russia by the head of the British Foreign Office. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from sources close to the Russian delegation that the British side was interested in Moscow's reaction to Ukraine's appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the situation in the Crimea. Russia has nothing against such an appeal and believes that a call for a political settlement coming from the UN Security Council would be of use to all sides. According to the same sources, during the talks the two sides discussed crises in various CIS countries in terms of a more active CSCE participation in their settlement. On the Bosnian issue, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to acting on the basis of common understanding of the aims and in the spirit of agreements reached at the Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, and five EC countries on 13 May. Discussing the issue of Russia joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program, participants in the meeting agreed that military- political cooperation should not be restricted by the provisions of the outline document. Russia is a nuclear state, and it cannot be put on a level with other countries. An agreement that would take its specific features into account has to be drawn up. The forthcoming visit to Brussels by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev will be the first step in this direction. The agreement concerned -- be it a protocol or a program -- has to answer the question of how Russia is to cooperate with NATO in such areas as peacekeeping, conversion, consultations, and contacts between the military.
