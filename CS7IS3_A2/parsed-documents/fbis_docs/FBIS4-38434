The main disadvantage of the 1991 code, i.e. the lack of the concept of "land ownership," has been eliminated in the draft of the law submitted today for debate by heads of administrations. For the first time a land law stipulates a procedure for acquiring land by juridical persons (by transferring land plots and parcels of land to enterprises' authorized capital or through purchase of land), V. Chernomyrdin said. The draft of the new land code also contains a description of procedures for land deals by physical persons (buying, selling, or mortgage operations), as well as giving or inheriting land. It stipulates that owners of inherited land plots can become owners if they wish. However, if a land plot is larger than the maximum size allowed for a transfer of land ownership free of charge, the remaining part may be kept as non-transferable inheritance or bought out in credit. In accordance with the current constitution, the draft of the land code transfers a larger proportion of land regulation rights to the constituent parts of the federation, unlike the present land law, the prime minister said.
