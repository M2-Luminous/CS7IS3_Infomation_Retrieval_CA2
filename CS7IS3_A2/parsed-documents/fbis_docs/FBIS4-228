A protest march by thousands of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters in Empangeni went ahead under the watchful eye of a strong security force contingent without any incidents of violence; but large sections of the crowd, which assembled at an open field before the march, refused to lay down their traditional weapons in defiance of the emergency regulations. This report from Veronica van der Westhuizen and cameraman Koen Marnewijk: [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] Bus loads of people arrived from all over Zululand to mourn the death of more than 50 Zulus who died in Johannesburg on Monday last week. They also turned out in force to show their support for King Goodwill Zwelithini. Security force members were present in large numbers at an open field where the group gathered before the march, but they proved to be no deterrent to the IFP supporters who alighted from busses openly displaying traditional weapons. [Police Legal Services spokesperson Major Margaret Kruger] As you can see they are trying to take them off as they come of the busses, and what I think they envisage doing is asking the organizers to please speak to the people and explain to them what has happened. We will then ask the organizers who have been cooperating with us all along to not allow ... [changes thought] to ask the people not to display and carry the weapons during the march. [Van der Westhuizen] An attempt by a couple of policemen to confiscate the weapons failed. The police then held a meeting with the local leadership in an effort to persuade their followers to leave their weapons behind while marching. IFP organizer Mr. Reginald Mkhize then asked the people to do so. [Mkhize] Due to the fact that the state of emergency came to us... [changes thought] Whilst in our hand we have the permit to hold this march, we could not get enough time to tell our people not to bring those so-called dangerous weapons. For that reason we are trying our best to take whatever is dangerous and keep it into our bakkie [pickup truck] so that our people are not seen carrying them. [Van der Westhuizen] The crowd expressed its dissatisfaction and only a few sharp objects were handed in. The march then proceeded through the heavily guarded streets of Empangeni. Police and the army were stationed outside properties along the route and barbed wire was put up in front of premises housing the local ANC branch. A memorandum was then handed over to representatives of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. In it the IFP strongly attacked the IEC, saying that it was a product of what it called the ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council. [IFP spokesman Muzi Gwala] If the IEC makes it possible to force the installation of the polling booths in our areas before our demands are met, I am afraid the people will use even their own teeth to tear them down. [Van der Westhuizen] The IFP's demands included the postponement of the election and a federal state. The IFP says if their demands are not met the IEC would find it difficult to maintain peace and stability that could lead to free and fair elections. The IFP also warned that they would ensure that the April election would not take place even if it meant losing their lives. [end recording]
