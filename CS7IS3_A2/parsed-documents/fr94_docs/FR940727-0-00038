FR940727-0-00038 FR940727-0-00018 Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 935 Ohio Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 67 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. Specifically, the amendment proposes to clearly identify postmining land use categories, to clarify the comparison of premining and postmining land uses, to clarify that ``undeveloped land'' may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land, to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses, and to eliminate redundant provisions more stringent than the Federal regulations for notice and approval of alternative postmining land uses by other reviewing agencies and for the design of postmining land use plans by an engineer. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard J. Seibel, Director, Columbus Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 4480 Refugee Road, Suite 201, Columbus, Ohio 43232. Telephone: (614) 866&hyph;0578. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Ohio Program. II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment. III. Director's Findings. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments. V. Director's Decision. VI. Procedural Determinations. I. Background on the Ohio Program On August 16, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Ohio program. Background information on the Ohio program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in the August 10, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 34688). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 935.11, 935.12, 935.15, and 935.16. II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposed to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17 to make the Ohio program as effective as corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. OSM announced receipt of proposed Program Amendment Number 67 in the May 26, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 27255), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on June 27, 1994. III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment to the Ohio program. Revisions not specifically addressed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. 1. OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(C) (1) through (11), Postmining land use categories. Ohio is revising paragraphs (C) (1) through (11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use categories. Since these are nonsubstantive changes, the Director finds that the revised State rules are no less effective than their Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 701.5. 2. OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B)(1), Mining prior to April 10, 1972. Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining. The State's proposed language is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817/133(b). The Director, therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart. 3. OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B)(2), Comparison of postmining and premining land uses. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as its use immediately before mining. There are no Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 816/817.133. However, the State rule at 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;04(I)(1)(a) requires information on historical land use in permit applications if the land use changed within five years before mining. This corresponds to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(1) and 784.15(a)(1). Since the State rule at OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B) states that ``[t]he premining uses of land to which the postmining land uses are compared shall be those which the land previously supported *␣*␣*'' this would include historical land uses if the land use changed within five years before mining. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of former paragraph (B)(2) will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations. 4. OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B)(2), Undeveloped land use. Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining. Ohio's proposed rule clarifies that undeveloped land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land. The Director finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(b) and 30 CFR 701.5.
