FR941122-0-00046 FR941122-0-00010 * * * * * (c) * * * (3) Demonstration that the total emissions reductions achieved under the substitution plan will be equal to or greater than the total emissions reductions that would have been achieved without the plan, as follows: (i) * * * (B) Each of the following: the unit's 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate; the unit's 1989 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the unit's 1990 actual SO 2 emissions rate; and, as of November 15, 1990, the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation covering the unit for 1995&hyph;1999. For purposes of determining the most stringent emissions limitation, applicable emissions limitations shall be converted to lbs/mmBtu in accordance with appendix B of this part. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year in 1995&hyph;1999, the most stringent emissions limitation shall be stated separately for each year. (C) The lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate; the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO 2 emissions rate; or, as of November 15, 1990, the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation covering the unit for 1995&hyph;99. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995&hyph;1999, the lesser of the emissions rates shall be determined separately for each year using the most stringent emissions limitation for that year. (D) The product of the baseline in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and the emissions rate in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, divided by 2000 lbs/ton. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995&hyph;1999, the product in the prior sentence shall be calculated separately for each year using the emissions rate determined for that year in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section. (ii)(A) The sum of the amounts in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section for all substitution units to be governed by the plan. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this sum is the total number of allowances available each year under the substitution plan. (B) Where the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995&hyph;1999, the sum in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall be calculated separately for each year using the amounts calculated for that year in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Each separate sum is the total number of allowances available for the respective year under the substitution plan. (iii) Where, as of November 15, 1990, a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation covers the unit for any year during 1995&hyph;1999, the designated representative shall state each such limitation and propose a method for applying the unit-specific and non-unit-specific emissions limitations under paragraph (d) of this section. (4) * * * * * * * * (ii) A list showing any annual distribution of the allowances in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section from a substitution unit to a unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that, under the plan, designates the substitution unit. * * * * * (d) * * * (2) In no event shall allowances be allocated to a substitution unit, under an approved substitution plan, for any year in excess of the sum calculated and applicable to that year under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, as adjusted by the Administrator in approving the plan. (3) Where, as of November 15, 1990, a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation covers the unit for any year during 1995&hyph;1999, the Administrator will specify on a case-by-case basis a method for using unit-specific and non-unit-specific emissions limitations in allocating allowances to the substitution unit. The specified method will not treat a non-unit-specific emissions limitation as a unit-specific emissions limitation and will not result in substitution units retaining allowances allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for emissions reductions necessary to meet a non-unit- specific emissions limitation. Such method may require an end-of-year review and the adjustment of the allowances allocated to the substitution unit and may require the designated representative of the substitution unit to surrender allowances by the allowance transfer deadline of the year that is subject to the review. Any surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances originally allocated for the year, and the designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, such allowances will be deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under ยง73.35(c)(2) of this chapter. (e) * * * (1) Emissions Limitations. (i) Each substitution unit governed by an approved substitution plan shall become a Phase I unit from January 1 of the year for which the plan takes effect until January 1 of the year for which the plan is no longer in effect or is terminated. The designated representative of a substitution unit shall surrender allowances, and the Administrator will deduct allowances, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section. * * * * * 3. Section 72.43 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(1) introductory text, (b)(1) introductory text, (b)(1)(ii)(A), (b)(3)(i), (c)(4)(i), (c)(4)(ii), (c)(4)(iv), (d), and (f)(1)(ii) and adding paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: ยง72.43 Phase I reduced utilization plans.
