FBIS4-22634 "jpusr042___94010" FBIS-USR-94-042 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 1 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS Editors Defend Publication of 'Version No. 1' Editors Defend Publication of 'Version No. 1' 944F0568C Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 13, 1 Apr 94 p 1 944F0568C Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Leonid Sharov: "They Are Threatening, But We Are Not Afraid," preceded by a "warning" from the Committee on the Press and followed by remarks from a legal expert] [Text] Warning OBSHCHAYA GAZETA No. 11 of March 1994 published material entitled "Kidneys Are Swelling. Is a Putsch Coming? Version No. 1," which contains information on a coup d'etat, aimed at discrediting leaders of the Federal Duma and the Russian Federation Government, which is allegedly being prepared. The Russian Federation Committee on the Press believes that by disseminating deliberately false and slanderous fabrications by an anonymous author aimed at undermining the constitutional order and destabilizing the situation in the society, the editorial staff of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has violated Articles 4 and 51 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media." In accordance with its powers, the Russian Fedration Committee on the Press issues an official warning to the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial staff. [Signed] First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on the Press V.V. VOLODIN * * * So OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has gotten its deserts. Next came a statement by the Russian Federation Committee on the Press devoted to glasnost. The questions asked in it were no laughing matter: --Who wants to turn the peoples of Russia into a biomass without a tongue? --In whose interest is it to sow the poisonous seed of hostility between the branches of government? --In whose interest is it to sow the same seed between the leadership and society? --Who is eager to undermine the constitutional order? --To whose advantage is it to keep Russia in an atmosphere of rumors, gossip, and slander--ultimately fear? And there is an answer. On the eve of "Laughter Day" (or as they still call it, "Fools' Day"), the deliberate criminal has been identified at last. It is OBSHCHAYA GAZETA! And something is not very laughable, even on 1 April. Although it is not very frightening, either. Rather, it is a little nasty. For example, what is the value of the first paragraph in the committee's statement to watch over the democratic achievements of our mass media: "Only unprincipled politicians who put their own ambitions above the fundamental interests of the state, the society, and the nation, can..." Such deep drilling should be envied by Iosif Stalin, Andrey Zhdanov, and Mikhail Suslov. Let us explain for those who have not been readers. A spark was lit because in two preceding issues, the editorial staff had published the so-called "Version No. 1," explaining in a commentary here that this was obviously a hoax aimed at discrediting a number of major political figures. Why is the newspaper publishing a document which it states itself is from a questionable source? Because the provocative writing, regardless of the view of any newspaper, is being disseminated and unfortunately has become a fact of sociopolitical life. Following our publication, numerous commentaries demonstrated once again how many had "Version No. 1" in hand, were reading it, and were pondering what would actually take place. Both before and after the warning, the editorial staff continues to be confident that an informed public is within its direct responsibility. Moreover, this is precisely the reason it exists. But the anger which has been directed at us is like an echo of those distant times when the first one to bring bad news had his head chopped off. Three weeks have passed since our publication. Neither the public prosecutor's office nor counterintelligence has been able to answer: who has been so assiduously disseminating slander on a coup, who has been circulating it, and who has been passing the anonymous document from hand to hand? the head of the FSK [expansion not given] states that they have managed to find the authors of the document. Though special efforts were not required for this: the first one--Gleb Pavlovskiy, came to our editorial office himself and told us about work on the document. As far as those who were interested in disseminating the false document and spared neither time nor effort for this are concerned, nothing is known about them. It is not hard to assume that they will not want to reveal their names. The simplest thing is to accuse OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of all the sins. Official reaction to the newspaper's statement is striking for its inadequacy. Every day in the newspapers and on television we read and see every possible kind of statement by all kinds of extremist political figures. All of them are simply taken into consideration, and it does not occur to anyone to make television or newspapers take responsibility for these statements: evceryone recognizes the right of the SMI [mass media] to reveal information. So what aroused the guardians of public tranquillity in our case? Let us examine the details. If the committee decides to repudiate "Version No. 1" after OG [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA], why all the fuss? There are simply no reasons to be worried about public stability and the constitutional system. But if a state department believes there are reasons for this anyway, then it consequently assumes that "Version No. 1" is not all a pack of lies; in this case, reproaching the newspaper for spreading slanderous misinformation is even more unfair. This is like accusing the doctor who gives an inoculation against rabies of deliberately spreading infection. What is the point of the warning given to us? This is what it is: "Next time do not take it into your head to inform the public about a provocation being prepared, but the main thing is not to interfere first and without permission--otherwise you will be burned for sure!" Alas, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA cannot accept these instructions for implementation. In the event that something like "Version No. 1" is undertaken, we will respond to it in accordance with our convictions and professional responsibility by warning the public (but not the bureaucracy) of impending dangers. Because only a putsch itself can confirm rumors about a putsch. This is enough, we have already "gone through it." In August 1991, three were buried by a million. In October 1993, at least 150 died... No one but the relatives knows where they are buried. The consequence has ended--forget it. But why are there so many extreme epithets threatening coups and exclamation points in those documents which made their appearance in the Committee on the Press 10 days after our publication? Because nothing else is left for them. They have to threaten when there is no legal basis to deal with those who do not want to be near you. You have been threatened badly, as I see. The Scheme for Accusation: Falsity-Previous Knowledge-Premeditation The excitement at the General Prosecutor's Office about the slander gave rise to conflicting opinions among the public and in the press. We asked Aleksandr Yakovlev, professor and doctor of juridical sciences, for a particularly professional assessment of the scheme, which is how this matter can be classified. As soon as a criminal case has been raised, it certainly involves the application of Article 130 of the UK [Criminal Code], or more precisely, its third part, which defines the punishment for slander, combined with the charge of a state or other heinous crime. It has to be kept in mind that slander is the dissemination of DELIBERATELY false fabrications which defame another person. This wording must be "combined" with the principle of the presumption of innocence which applies in criminal law. This means that the burden of proof lies with the prosecuting side. Three things must be proved in a slander case: the falsity of the information disseminated; the fact that the falsity was known beforehand to the accused; and the fact that they acted with premeditation. This is the chain that appears: falsity-previous knowledge-premeditation. But it also happens that a person who disseminates false, defamatory information has been honestly deluded. In this case, we can and should speak about libel, which is a subject for consideration in civil law. Here the burden of proof lies with the defendant. The defendant's intention has no significance. Slander and libel lead to different legal consequences. Slander (Article 130 of the Criminal Code, Part 3) leads to imprisonment for a period of up to 5 years. Libel leads to refutation, and in a number of cases to compensation for material damages, if the court comes to the conclusion that this took place. Most cases of slander and libel are linked with publication in the press. It is very difficlt to assess the role of the mass media in disseminating information that is incorrect. On one hand, real protection must be given to a citizen's honor and dignity. On the other hand, to encroach upon the prerogative of the press, which ensures the right of that same citizen to information--that is not to silence the newspapers and other mass media.
