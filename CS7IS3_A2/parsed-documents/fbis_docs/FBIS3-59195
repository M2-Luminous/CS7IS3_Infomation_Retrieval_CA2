He admitted this at an FDP [Free Democratic Party] function in Karlsruhe yesterday evening. He emphasized, however, that 32 countries have attempted "to resolve this terrible situation." One thing has been achieved after all: "There is no more starvation there." The Defense Ministry announced today that Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann will open a dam south of Beledweyne on Sunday [30 January]. This is the last large project implemented with German humanitarian aid provided by the support unit in Somalia. [passage omitted] The general will stay in Somalia until Tuesday. He is due to meet high-ranking UN officials in Mogadishu. [passage omitted] Kinkel defended UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali against recent criticism. Ghali is an "immensely committed man, but far too much is asked of him." After the end of the East-West conflict, the United Nations is no longer in a position financially, organizationally, and regarding the available manpower, to handle all problems of the modern world, ranging from environmental to population problems. "We should not criticize Butrus-Ghali, but support him," Kinkel said.
