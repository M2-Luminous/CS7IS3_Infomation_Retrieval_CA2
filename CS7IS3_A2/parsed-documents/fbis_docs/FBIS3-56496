In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yuriy Meshkov, in the lead in the presidential race, said he would have won the first round of elections had it not been for a split in the Russian movement blamed on Serhiy Shuvaynykov, who had refused to withdraw his candidacy. As for the probability of his victory in the second round of elections, the RPK-RDK [Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of the Republican Movement of the Crimea] leader did not deny rumors of a possible transfer in his favor of votes in support of Serhiy Shuvaynykov. In the elections Shuvaynykov had the backing of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], Zhirinovskiy, and those in favor of the communist Leonid Hrach. Meshkov did not rule that it was possible those in power would obstruct the holding of the second round of the elections. Also in an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on the eve of the elections, Yuriy Meshkov stated he was convinced that in the event of his election he would be able to avert a conflict with the Ukrainian leadership. At a meeting with representatives of political parties in December, in his words, Leonid Kravchuk did not oppose holding the elections of the Crimean president (UNIAN has it that Leonid Kravchuk only said it was unreasonable to counteract it). In Yuriy Meshkov's view, there is a legitimate basis for relations between Ukraine and the Crimea, as well as those between Russia and the Crimea, to be settled legally. He evaded a straight answer to the question on whether his victory would ensure the participation of Crimean districts in the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council in March, which are to be with elections to the Crimean Supreme Council. The RDK leader stated that all-Ukrainian elections could only be held on condition they would not contravene the interests of the Crimea and that he would not take a decision on that issue on his own. He did not, however, specify what these interests exactly were as seen by him. Yuriy Meshkov is 45 years old. He is Russian. He chairs the Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of the Republican Movement of the Crimea and is a people's deputy of the Crimea. He graduated from the law department at the Moscow State University, is married and has two children. The planks of his pre-election campaign were the full state independence of Crimea and a referendum on this issue; the accession of the Crimea to Russia; his negative attitude toward quotas for participation in the Crimea's elected bodies being granted to deported peoples; and on land being unavailable for private property. [passage omitted] Crimean Tartar Majlis Chairman Mustafa Dzemilev on his part stated in an interview with a UNIAN correspondent that if Yuriy Meshkov was to be elected to the post of the Crimean president, then "given his overt program of having the Crimea quit Ukraine, we shall regard him solely as a president of his voters but in no way as that of the Crimean Tartar people".
