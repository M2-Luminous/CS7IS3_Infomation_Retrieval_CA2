Our correspondent Fernando Fernandez has the report: [Begin recording] [Fernandez] Ernesto Perez Balladares, candidate of the United People alliance, toured several communities in the western part of Panama. He was greeted by a large group of supporters and persons vying for electoral posts in Capira District. Addressing the crowd, the presidential candidate said the country will return to a people-oriented government, with the support of all the country's productive forces, and based on the dynamic of private enterprise to find the solutions demanded by the people. [Perez Balladares] We will do so united, without hate, without revenge, without returning to the past, with a vision of the future, with a commitment to future generations; a free, independent, sovereign country, a country where all Panamanians, regardless of race, color, place of birth, or place of residence can have, as we say, an opportunity to progress with the support of a friendly government. [Fernandez] In his speech, Perez sent a message to all the presidential candidates. [Perez Balladares] I want to tell all those hatemongers, that they can still climb on the winning bandwagon, because with or without a cassette [reference to the 14 April video shown by President Endara on a national television network], with or without Mireya [Mireya Moscosa de Gruber, Arnulfist Party presidential candidate], with or without unity, with or without Eddy [Eduardo Vallarino Arjona, Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate], with or without Chinchorro [Ruben Dario Carles, MOLIRENA presidential candidate], the people will have their say. [applause] [Fernandez] The caravan then headed for Bejuco, where Perez Balladares was greeted by supporters of that community. The PRD presidential candidate said he will make every effort, if elected, to direct his government's attention to the agricultural sector and to the most pressing social problems of Panamanians. The tour, which was under tight security, included the towns of Chame, Cabuya, and San Carlos District. [end recording]
