FR941006-1-00148 FR941006-1-00016 B. Regulatory Options There are many possible regulatory alternatives available that may reduce the number of cases of pediatric poisonings from the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. The options include packaging, warning statements, product reformulation, and educational efforts. 1. Packaging One regulatory option available to FDA is to require that products containing iron be packaged in unit-dose containers. Because of the CPSC regulations, most iron-containing products currently must be packaged in CRC's. Therefore, the effect of this option would be to require child resistant unit-dose packaging for most of these products. FDA could require unit- dose packaging for all products or for only higher dosage products. For comparison, FDA will consider potencies of 30 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg as the minimum potencies per dosage unit of iron that would trigger unit-dosage packaging. a. Costs. There are four types of costs associated with a mandated packaging change: Equipment, materials, transportation, and administrative costs. If this option is selected, many packagers of iron-containing products will be required to purchase new packaging equipment. The cost of equipment used in packaging blisters, one common form of unit-dose packaging, is between $50,000 and $250,000, or on average $132,500. New equipment will not be purchased for each product sold because some manufacturers already possess unit-dose packaging equipment. The cost of child-resistant bottles, currently the most common form of packaging, is approximately $7 per 1,000 dosage units. Child-resistant blisters cost approximately $9 per 1,000 dosage units, a difference of $2 per 1,000 dosage units. FDA does not have information to estimate additional transportation costs caused by unit-dose packaging requirements and requests comments on increased transportation costs. Additionally, firms are expected to incur administrative costs of approximately $500 per product in the first year. Administrative costs are the dollar value of the incremental administrative effort expended in order to comply with a regulation. Administrative activities include, but are not limited to, identifying the underlying policy of the regulation, interpreting that policy relative to the firm's products, establishing a corporate position, formulating a method for compliance, and managing the compliance effort. If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for all iron- containing products irrespective of their potency per dosage unit, the cost of equipment would be $39 million (300 products × $132,500). The annual materials cost would be $24 million ((12 billion dosage units/1,000) × $2.00), or $260 million over the next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $150,000. Total costs associated with requiring unit- dose packaging for all iron-containing products would be $299 million over 20 years (discounted at seven percent). If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 30 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be $20 million (150 products × $132,500). The cost of materials would be $3 million per year or $32 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $75,000 (150 × $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging for products containing 30 mg or more per dosage unit would be $52 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 40 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be $13 million (100 products × $132,500). The cost of materials would be $2 million per year or $22 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $50,000 (100 × $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging for products containing 40 mg or more iron per dosage unit would be $35 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 60 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be $5 million (37 products × $132,500). The cost of materials would be $0.8 million per year or $8 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $19,000 (37 × $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging for products containing 60 mg or more iron per dosage unit would be $6 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent).
