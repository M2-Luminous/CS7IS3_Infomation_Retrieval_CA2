Following a third round of working-level contacts Monday, IAEA Operations Director Demetrius Pericos and Yun Ho-jin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy, met unofficially Tuesday and agreed to hold a fourth round on Wednesday, the sources said. The successive meetings could mean that the negotiations are making rapid progress, IAEA sources said, hinting that there could be early inspections. As a result, they said, the two sides could reach an agreement this week and the IAEA could start inspecting North Korean facilities by 24 January at the earliest. Or the two sides could work out some sort of agreement early next week so that an IAEA inspection team could enter North Korea by 31 January, the sources said. This optimistic view comes after an official IAEA evaluation that there was ``no green signal'' in the third round, but the sources described the atmosphere of the talks as good and said that the two sides managed to narrow their differences. One IAEA source, who like the others declined to be identified, said that both the IAEA and North Korea shared the opinion that an IAEA inspection, in whatever the form, has to be carried out before the IAEA holds its regular board of governors meeting on 21 February. In other words, an IAEA inspection team has to go into North Korea in late January or early February in order for the IAEA to submit a report to the Board of Governors for it will take at least two weeks to inspect facilities and another week to prepare the report, the source said. The IAEA Secretariat, which is giving ``political significance'' to the February board meeting because it is the start of a new fiscal year for the IAEA, wants to get tangible evidence to show in the negotiations with North Korea, which have been dragging along for more than a year now, the source said. The Secretariat also likes to reach a kind of interim point with North Korea on inspection ``in consideration'' of the United States, which has publicly announced its agreement with North Korea. As for North Korea, the IAEA could expect some sort of ``concession'' from Pyongyang because North Korea, too, has to demonstrate a positive attitude toward IAEA inspection in order to keep its negotiations with the United States going, the source said. Details of the perceived progress being made at IAEA-North Korean negotiations are not known. But what is known so far appears to be that the two sides have agreed in principle on the need for inspections on seven reported facilities, including the radiochemical laboratory and the 5-megawatt reactor, the source said. As for differences of opinion on thorny issues such as the IAEA request for the collection of materials from the facilities, the two sides could discuss them so that another inspection team could be dispatched to North Korea later, the source said.
