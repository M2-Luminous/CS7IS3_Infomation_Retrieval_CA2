FBIS4-61327 "drsov087_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Lithuania Security Head Says KGB Files Must Be Returned Security Head Says KGB Files Must Be Returned WS0405140694 Tallinn BNS in English 0207 GMT 4 May 94 WS0405140694 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, May 04, BNS -- Russia must return all KGB archives that were taken out of Lithuania after the August coup in 1991, says Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the Lithuanian Security Department. The Russian ambassador to Lithuania earlier said that Russia sees no legal basis for talks on the return of KGB archives. But in Jurgelis' view, "the law is not necessary to return what was stolen." In an interview with Lithuania's top daily LIETUVOS RYTAS, Jurgelis said Russia took out part of KGB files when Lithuania restored its independence and became a sovereign state. Russia also refuses to return any of the pre-war archives of Lithuanian security services. Jurgelis confirmed that around "11 or 12 sacks" of information were stolen from the foreign intelligence department of the KGB when the KGB building in Vilnius was taken over by Lithuanian authorities soon after the 1991 coup. "There is no doubt that the KGB files are in private hands," but the case was closed due to lack of evidence, as well as because witnesses changed their testimonies. Jurgelis confirmed that KGB documents were used for blackmail in several cases. The official said his department has information about activities of foreign secret services in Lithuania but declined to mention any details.
