Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is getting ready to call an extraordinary session of the parliament in order to include Turkish troops in the peace force envisaged to be sent to the region to find a peaceful solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The aim is to somewhat impede Russia's fast- growing influence in the region. [Unidentified reporter] According to a statement by the True Path Party, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller submitted her letter to the president of the parliament asking for a mandate from the Turkish Grand National Assembly to enable the Turkish troops to serve in Azerbaijan. For this purpose, the Prime Minister will call an extraordinary session of the parliament, which is formally going into recess tomorrow. Ciller is asking for the following mandate: 1. The presence of the Turkish troops in the CSCE peace force to be assigned to duty in the Azerbaijani lands occupied by Armenians. 2. Establishing a base in Turkey to provide logistical support to this peace force. It is expected that this base will most probably be located in Erzurum. Russia wants its military troops to serve as a peace force for the solution of the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. Its rationale is that it will take a long time for the CSCE troops to arrive in the region. Russia is claiming that it will take almost ten days for the CSCE peace force to arrive in the region if there is a cease-fire between the sides. To undercut this argument, a group of CSCE countries, including Turkey, wants to keep a force in Erzurum similar to the Hammer Force in Incirlik. Russia is favoring one-sided military intervention and the dispatching of troops to prevent the clashes in the Caucasus. It is attaining its goal step by step. For example, Russian troops are continuing to establish themselves in the region to ensure the continuation of the cease-fire between the separatist Abkhazian militants and Georgian troops. Russia has received no mandate from the UN or CSCE. Moscow is entering the region by direct agreements it concluded with Georgia and the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic.
