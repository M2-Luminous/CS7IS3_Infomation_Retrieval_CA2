Emile Boua Massirabo, one of the leading officials of this movement, was interviewed by telephone from Kampala. Dominique de Courcelles asked him why the RPF had refused to recognize the new government in Kigali and why it had broken the cease-fire. [Begin recording] [Massirabo] We did not sign any cease-fire, we did not negotiate any cease-fire with anyone. [Courcelles] You did not even begin? [Massirabo] No, never. This idea of a cease-fire was put forward by UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], we do not accept this, we did not negotiate any cease-fire, this is a lie. As soon as the massacres began in Kigali, the systematic massacres of political opponents and Tutsi people, the Arusha Agreement was violated and the RPF stood idly by while the whole civilian population in Kigali was being slaughtered. It was our duty -- and I believe no one can condemn us for that -- to intervene. [Courcelles] Was there any hope for an end to massacres with a new government? [Massirabo] I would also like to mention this government. Who is in this government? The government is made up of members of the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy], of the (?CDR), of the section supporting late President Habyarimana, of the MDR [Republican Democratic Movement], of the PL [Liberal Party], it is a product of this clique that organized these systematic killings in the capital. It is inconceivable for the RPF to consider this government as a valid partner. We would have expected the international community to denounce this government, as well as the Army and the Presidential Guard, which killed innocent, defenseless people. I do not believe anyone can condemn us for the resumption of the war. This government is not a partner for us. [Courcelles] Therefore, the only solution for you today is the resumption of war, you rule out any negotiation? [Massirabo] Negotiations are impossible since we are dealing with a wild horde systematically killing people. [Courcelles] Who are you fighting now? Are you fighting the Presidential Guard and the whole Army, or is part of the Army on your side? [Massirabo] You know that there is a part of the Army that is not with the murderers. Our main enemy now is the Presidential Guard, but it goes without saying that all the people who side with the Presidential Guard are enemies of the country, are enemies of democracy. [Courcelles] Do you believe that part of the Army will join you? [Massirabo] We called on the Rwandan Army. We called on all those who are outraged by what is happening in Rwanda to join us. We hope that part of the Army, as well as most of the Rwandan population and of the international community will join us. [end recording]
