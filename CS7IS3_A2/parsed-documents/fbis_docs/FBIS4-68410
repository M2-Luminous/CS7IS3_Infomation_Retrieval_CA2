We have been prompted to appeal to you and the deputies of the Russian State Duma by the recent visit by Lysenko and Pavlov, members of the State Duma, to Nagornyy Karabakh. They visited this region of Azerbaijan, bypassing Baku and meeting with no representatives of Azerbaijan. You know that an undeclared war imposed on us by Armenian extremist circles because of the so-called Karabakh issue has been under way for more than six years in Azerbaijan. Many states, Russia included, are exerting considerable efforts for a peaceful resolution of this conflict. At this time Lysenko and Pavlov, leaders of the National Republican Party of Russia, having visited only Armenia and having thence made for Nagornyy Karabakh, taking no account of the position of Azerbaijan and not having made an objective study of the entire history of the conflict that has arisen, appealed openly on 8 April 1994 on Radio Mayak's "The World" program for a new surge in the incitement of interethnic strife. They are manifestly proposing a recarving of the current borders and the allotment to Armenia of Nagornyy Karabakh, which is, in fact, occupied, promising the extremist forces that created the Karabakh problem the utmost support, and attempting by any methods to impose their position on the State Duma. This openly inflammatory performance of the deputies of the State Duma evoked the just anger of the Azerbaijani and all other peoples who live in the republic and is doing tremendous damage to the peacemaking activity of Russia, which has repeatedly declared its interest in a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict and the impossibility of a revision of the existing borders. As you know, Armenia has long been a mono-ethnic republic, and Azerbaijan is, as before, international. More than 500,000 Russian and Russian-speaking people, to whom also the fate of Azerbaijan, which has become their homeland, is not a matter of indifference, live here together with the Azerbaijani people. A peaceful solution of the current problem, which had emerged as of late, was once again recently disrupted by the Armenian side. Evidence of this is the large-scale offensive of Armenian armed formations the length of the front, which has once again caused numerous casualties on both sides. Unfortunately, all this is happening in a period when a meeting of the heads of state of the CIS had been scheduled in Moscow and agreements had been reached on a meeting of the speakers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Bishkek. We Azerbaijanis, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lezgin, Tatars, Jews, and representatives of other nations, nationalities, and ethnic groups have lived together on Azerbaijani soil for centuries. Our society was formed in the wake of "bloody January," when, at the call of their hearts, a group of Russian-speaking Baku inhabitants went to Moscow to tell the truth about the events of 20 January 1990, when the Soviet Army was committed to Baku and many totally innocent people died. It was necessary then, as it is now, to combat a news blockade and well-conceived disinformation concerning events occurring in Azerbaijan. We are counting on you, as the leader of the parliament of Russia, endeavoring to contribute to a peaceful settlement of interethnic conflicts. Nagornyy Karabakh, over which the undeclared war that has been foisted on us began, is primordial land of Azerbaijan, where the Armenian and Azerbaijani peoples had for several centuries lived in peace and harmony. The responsibility for the instigation of the war lies wholly with a small group of people in Armenia and outside, who have single-mindedly set the two peoples against each other for the purpose of annexing to Armenia primordially Azerbaijani land. This war has already borne away thousands of lives in both republics. More than 200,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia have been driven out of their native parts and have become refugees. Over 20 percent of the territory of the republic, far beyond Nagornyy Karabakh included, has now been captured. Many villages and towns, cultural monuments, and industrial and agricultural enterprises have been destroyed, and more than 1 million Azerbaijanis have become refugees. It is six years now that the war has been fought on the territory of our republic. The United Nations, the Security Council, and the CSCE Minsk Group have repeatedly adopted objective decisions pertaining to a peaceful settlement of the conflict, but the long-awaited peace has yet to ensue. On the contrary, combat operations on the part of the Armenian armed formations have been resumed time and again, blood has been shed once again, and increasingly new areas of Azerbaijan have been captured. G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, appealed recently on republic television to the people of Nagornyy Karabakh, the people of Armenia, and to the world community, calling for an end to the totally needless war, the liberation of the captured territories, and the return of the refugees to their homes, and asked Russia and other states to contribute to the establishment of peace. Addressing the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, we are firmly convinced that the highest authority of democratic Russia will analyze the situation in depth and study the roots of the conflict, aspiring to a wise and objective examination of the Karabakh problem, and prevent damage to the legitimate interests of the Azerbaijani people. Adopted at an enlarged session of the board of the Concord Republic Society for Solidarity With the Peoples of Azerbaijan Baku, 13 April 1994
