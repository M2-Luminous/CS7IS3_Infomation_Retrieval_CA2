In Egypt, the confrontation between the regime and the "Islamists," while not reaching the level of violence witnessed in Algeria, has assumed greater dimensions to include every level, including the cinema, television, and arts in general. In addition to the scenes of commotion and pandemonium in the streets surrounding the nine movie theaters that began screening the film a week ago, Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi has announced that new television serials will be screened soon in which "repentant" Islamists will denounce the "corruption of the extremist thought." Acting on a presidential decision, the Egyptian authorities have banned Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering sermons at Asad Ibn-Furat Mosque in al-Duqqi [a Cairo suburb]. The Egyptian authorities placed the mosque under the supervision of the Ministry of Awqaf and banned Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi from travelling. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi was behind the campaign to persuade movie and theater actresses to wear the veil. A secular campaign against him has increased his popularity such that thousands of people pray behind him every week. The security forces surrounded Asad Ibn-al-Furat on Friday [18 March]. The worshippers were surprised to see the director of al-Awqaf in al-Jizah ascending the pulpit to deliver the Friday sermon. A colonel from the State Security Intelligence Department went to the house of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi and informed him of the presidential decision to ban him from delivering sermons or giving religious classes at that mosque or any other. The day before yesterday Maj. Gen. al-Alfi declared: "Many of these Islamists have understood the false calls of the extremist terrorist elements and have returned to society to resume their life in a normal way." He promised to screen recorded television interviews with some of the "repenters." Egyptian state television has given Muslim religious men the chance to appear on its screen. A few weeks ago, it began screening a program criticizing the ideas and practices of the "extremist" Islamists. Hasan al-Hillawi, a former Islamist leader, issued a statement the day before yesterday calling on the extremist organizations to abandon terrorism. The film "The Terrorist" was written by well-known novelist Lenin al-Ramli and was directed by Nadir Jalal. The main role is played by popular comedian 'Adil Imam. The streets surrounding the nine Cairo movie theaters that began screening the film a week ago have witnessed scenes of commotion and congestion. These movie theaters have witnessed pandemonium among the audience. The security forces have imposed a tight guard on these movie houses in case they are targeted for attack by the Islamic groups. The film, its title, theme, and action, rejects Islamic group acts. Film analysts say the film earned $200,000 during the first three days of its screening, a record figure for the Egyptian film industry. The film is accompanied by a large adverstising campaign, which includes huge placards showing the "terrorist" 'Adil Imam bearded and carrying a pistol.
