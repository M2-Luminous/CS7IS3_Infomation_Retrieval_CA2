The group is authorized to check the methods of staffing because police often lack proper knowledge of the Latvian language. The lawfullness of non-service engagements of police with public structures and funds will be another field for inspection. Deputies will also examine whether the ministry uses budget resources reasonably and purposefully. The committee formed the group because it wants to help tidy up the ministry's structures, committee head Ivars Silars told BNS. The parliament must follow the observance of law in police units which employ many "chance people whose sense of stately responsibility is minimal," said Silars. Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis also welcomed the move, Silars noted. The group includes all members of the Defense and Interior Affairs' Committee but Kristovskis, Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis and Defense Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Andris Ligotnis.
