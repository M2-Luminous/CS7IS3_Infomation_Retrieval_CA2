[passage omitted] A reaction from Rabah Kebir, one of the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front in exile: He says these measures are insufficient: [Begin Kebir recording] I am very pleased about the release of some of our brothers who were imprisoned wrongly and without trial in concentration camps and who have been there for two years now. This is not enough, however, because thousands of our brothers are still in prison, such as our leaders, first of all. As for the national dialogue conference, as far as we are concerned, the junta in power is not to be taken seriously. That is why this conference has no chance of success. It is only a propaganda ploy to gain time. Should they ever want a negotiable solution, all they have to do is to look at the one condition we set during our news conference on 17 August 1993. It is no use giving us little presents to cheer us up. We are not children. [end recording]
