The newspaper AL-ITTIHAD, published here today, quoted the Lebanese minister as saying that the security situation in southern Lebanon, which is linked to regional considerations, will be discussed during the summit. This could reflect positively on the situation in southern Lebanon, and could consequently push for a solution to that issue, he noted. On the peace negotiations, the Lebanese minister said that no decision to resume the negotiations has thus far been made. As for Lebanon's position on participation in the next round of negotiations, it will be decided in light of the talks held in Washington by the head of the Lebanese negotiating delegation, and the outcome of the U.S.-Syrian summit, Buwayz maintained. Buwayz affirmed that nothing has changed about the U.S. assurances provided to Lebanon. He added that the U.S. Administration has not marked any departure from these assurances. He affirmed that there can be no solution or progress on the Lebanese track of negotiations unless Israel subscribes to complete withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories. The Lebanese foreign minister accused Israel of effecting a military and political escalation whenever a new chapter in the peace process is heralded.
