However, the lower house of the Russian parliament expressed its worry that the treaty would destabilize the Caucasian region. Yeltsin arrived in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Thursday [3 February] for a one-day visit which resulted in the signing of a treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation. Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia's armed forces by supplying them with military technology and equipment. Yeltsin told a news conference in Tbilisi that Russia and Georgia should establish not only "friendship" but also "a union which would favor the interests of both countries," adding that the treaty would legally support bilateral relations. But the treaty did not win support from the Russian lawmakers. The lower house of the parliament released a statement today in a news conference, saying that the treaty, especially the military aid item, would endanger the stability of the Caucasian region. Yeltsin explained that the military aid would be carried out "gradually" and depends on the developing situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are two autonomous regions of Georgia. They have been involved in bloody conflicts with Georgia after they declared independence from Tbilisi respectively in July 1992 and November 1991. Leaders of the two regions also expressed their opposition to the treaty, stressing that such an agreement should be signed only after the conflict between Georgia and the two regions are completely settled and the latter's political status determined. Yeltsin and his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze agreed in their meeting that the conflicts should, nevertheless, be settled peacefully. However, the lower house said that such a precondition might undermine the mediator status of Russia on the issue, arguing that Russia should consider its own interests first and protect itself from the threat of a wave of Caucasian refugees. Ties between Russia and Georgia were tense in recent years due to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia issue and improved only after the Russian armed forces were allowed to be stationed in Georgia last October.
