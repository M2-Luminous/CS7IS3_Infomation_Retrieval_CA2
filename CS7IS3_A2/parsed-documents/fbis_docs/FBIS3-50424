Oleksy, in the 26 December Poznan weekly WPROST, denied that the new Sejm has "Santa Claus" tendencies, asserting that the Sejm deputies have a "strong sense of realism" and that the Polish Left realizes it must play "a different role" from what left-wing parties play "in countries with a stabilized market economy." He maintained that the Polish Left knows it must "work out, together with the world of capital, a mutual concept of action that will lead to economic growth." He argued that it is a mistake to assume links between political parties and particular interest groups, noting that "the Polish political scene is just beginning to be formed" and that the links between parties and interest groups "are not completely established." Assessing the possibility of losing popular support, Oleksy acknowledged that the governing coalition of the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) faces a dilemma in formulating its economic policies: It cannot count on the patience of the voters, who elected it primarily because of their "anger" over the policies of the former government. What makes the coalition's predicament particularly difficult, Oleksy said, is that the people, while voting for a change in policy, "are unable to state precisely what their expectations are." Without a clear signal from the voters, Oleksy averred, the SLD will have to strike a balance between its campaign promises and "the rigors of economic realism." He observed that the local elections in June would be a barometer of the government's popular support, with a "clear" loss indicating that "hope in the coalition government is ebbing" and a victory strengthening the government's position.
