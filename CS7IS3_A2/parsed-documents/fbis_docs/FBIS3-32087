Foreign Minister Salaverria read a six-point official communique which cited the Vienna Convention that guarantees complete immunity from judicial punishment, which in this case favors the U.S. officer. According to the communique, Maj. Lopez is not subject to any sort of detention or arrest by Salvadoran authorities, and can be summoned to give testimony regarding this case. [sentence as heard] According to Salaverria, this same diplomatic immunity applies in similar cases involving diplomats in any country which has signed the Vienna Convention. Nevertheless, the foreign minister condemned the incident: [Begin Salaverria recording] This incident is condemnable from every angle, and it is regrettable because it involves a person's life. Whether the life of a Salvadoran or a foreigner, all life is priceless, and no monetary compensation that may eventually be paid to the family can offset this loss. One must consider other family aspects, such as the effect this man's absence will have on his children, as well as how this will affect them for the rest of their lives. These are just some of the considerations. I, however, can assure you that no one can be happy about this incident, and the one who feels most ashamed is the U.S. Government. This is one problem it does not need, and I am sure that the U.S. Government will prosecute this gentleman under the full force of the law. [end recording] From the very start, the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry has received the U.S. Embassy's assurances that Maj. Lopez will face a U.S. court martial. The foreign minister reported that Maj. Mike Lopez, a U.S. Embassy employee, on 21 January killed bodyguard Cresencio Diaz Alvarado in the Guadalupe neighborhood in Soyopango, on the outskirts of eastern San Salvador. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria reiterated that there has been no violation whatsoever of national sovereignty in the case of the death of this bodyguard.
