His party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD, social democrat), demands President Joaquin Balaguer "relinquish power." "We will not push the people to their death....we will fight with all peaceful means" the alleged victory of his party, Pena Gomez said. He also said that if the Central Electoral Board (JCE) continues to tally the votes and proclaims Balaguer the winner, the victory will not be valid. The PRD leader today challenged the impartiality of two of the judges who comprise the electoral tribunal as part of his efforts to have the JCE recount the votes and recognize that his party won the elections. Pena Gomez requested Leonardo Matos Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar be disqualified for their alleged acts of corruption, in which he also implicates the JCE and the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which supports President Balaguer. The two electoral judges, proposed by the ruling PRSC, must relinquish their posts to their substitutes until the other members decide whether the request for disqualification is valid. "The country has been robbed," Pena Gomez stated, justifying his charges that there were more ballots than voters in some towns. He explained that the JCE must again tally the null and "disputed" votes (subject to an embargo due to suspicions) to settle the situation. According to him, these votes include valid ones that would benefit the PRD. He said the tally of null and disputed votes must be directly supervised by OAS, International Electoral System Foundation (IFES), and Electoral Advice and Promotion Center (CAPEL) observers. Pena Gomez believes these same observers should participate in a revision of the tally sheets, which correspond to electoral tables whose annulment the PRD has requested because of a modification of the voters' lists. He reported that computer diskettes delivered to the JCE with the tally sheet information do not coincide with the information announced by the electoral organization. According to Pena Gomez, the situation occurs because the JCE's computer center is altering the tally sheet information to the detriment of his party. He claimed that JCE personnel added 38,000 votes that did not belong to the PRSC, and he also reported that the military seized four Municipal Electoral Boards and no one knows what happened to their tally sheets. Pena Gomez said the military still controls the boards in El Seibo, Moca, Samana, and Elias Pina. Police and military surveillance around PRD facilities located in downtown Santo Domingo increased considerably while Pena Gomez gave his statements. Although the presidential candidate asked hundreds of followers to remain calm, they demanded to go out and "fight for their victory." Nevertheless, Pena Gomez said that he wants no deaths and that he does not want "to disrupt the country's peace" with an uprising by his activists. PRD activists gathered in front of PRD facilities and shouted several slogans: "Get out, get out, Balaguer"; "We will repeat the April war"; and "If they do not relinquish (power) to us, there will be trouble."
