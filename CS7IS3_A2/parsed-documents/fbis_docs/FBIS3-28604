This system will focus on those small and medium companies that have technological potential but lack good business performance at this point. On the condition of accepting business administration guidance from the Small Business Finance Corporation [SBFC], each company may obtain loans up to 600 million yen [Y], of which up to Y40 million will be provided without collateral, which will be a special measure of this system. The total amount of loans in the first fiscal year may reach Y60 billion. The SMEA plans to support these ambitious companies by expanding loans without collateral. Normally, private financial organs are negative about providing such loans. The new system, which is called the "Loan System To Foster New Business" (tentative name), aims at providing loans to those small enterprises that offer unique services or have unique technology but have difficulties in raising funds from private financial organs due to lack of good business performance or sufficient collateral; such loans will be earmarked for starting new business. Under this system, the interest rate will be set at the current SBFC standard rate of 3.65 percent plus an additional 0.3 percent, and the maximum loan term can be set for 15 years. The committee on fostering new business, to be set up at the SBFC, will check such factors as the new business' potential and technology. MITI considers that if the SBFC can continue to provide management guidance after financing, dependability of new businesses may increase; and that this system may serve as "priming water" for expansion of loans by private financial organs. Originally, MITI studied the possibility of starting the new loan system in fiscal 1994. However, since small and medium companies seem to have lost their interest in starting new business due to such factors as the drop in the number of companies that have started new businesses due to the prolonged recession, MITI will start the system after the third supplementary budget is approved ahead of schedule. Private financial organs have restrained from providing loans to areas involved with high risk. Thus, MITI has decided that expansion of support from government-affiliated financial organs is indispensable to the fostering of new industries.
