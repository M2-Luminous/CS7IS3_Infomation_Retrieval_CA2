The servicemen are currently undergoing special training. The Ministry of Defense has drawn up a new training program for this. There are more than 1,200 Russian peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia. As for the tasks of the contingent for keeping the peace on the territory of the former Union, it was pointed out at the news conference that Russia is the sole power capable of separating warring sides. Russian servicemen are coping with this task successfully. For over a year there has been no bloodshed in the Dniester region and South Osetia. For the first time, representatives of the warring sides themselves are taking part in the work of the peacekeeping forces. That is, these are in part trilateral forces. One of the main problems of life today has also affected the peacekeeping contingent; namely, the problem of money. During 1993 over 26 billion rubles were spent from the Ministry of Defense's budget on financing operations to keep the peace on the territory of the former Union. It is hard to estimate what sum will be needed this year. The Defense Ministry hopes that this and other problems will be resolved by the law adopted by the State Duma on maintaining the Russian contingent to take part in operations designed to preserve or ensure international peace and security.
