The trade ministry has claimed that Korea would suffer more loss than benefit from its entry into the trade bloc in an analysis on strategies of world trading blocs. The ministry pinpointed four positive aspects if Korea joined the tripartite agreement but feared greater loss. First of all, the entry would promote competition among businesses as it is expected to accelerate the speed of market opening and internationalization of domestic companies, the analysis said. It forecast that exports to North America would increase as a result of the scrapping or reduction of tariffs and U.S. companies would be promoted to increase investments and technology transfer to Korea. Domestic manufacturers could also expect to increase exports of raw materials and parts, which are strictly applied to "origin of country" regulations, to the three nations, according to the ministry. On the other hand, negative effects would be more serious in the financial and foreign exchange industry, intellectual property rights protection, the farm market, labor and environmental sector. The ministry said that U.S. tariff rates will be cut to 4 percent non average in four years due to the Uruguay Round [UR] accord from current 6.2 percent. As a result, the merit from tariff cut will be meager, it said. It noted that several items, including garments and musical instruments, would benefit from the entry as they are competitive in the United States as U.S. duties will be zero to bloc members in 10 years. But the ministry analyzed that sluggish export to the United States has not resulted from high tariff rates but has derived from weakened competitiveness. The domestic agricultural market would be harder hit from the entry into NAFTA than from the Uruguay Round accord as the United States is expected to push ahead with the export of rice, beef, orange juice and dairy products to Korea. Now a third of Korea's farm imports comes from the three North American nations. Textile exports will grow sharply even if Korea gains NAFTA membership as trade of textile products subject to the multilateral fiber agreement (MFA) is to be liberalized in accordance with the UR accord. Exports of electronics goods and automobiles are expected to increase as the country of origin regulations will not be strictly applied to member nations. Korea will be obligated to open 77 services markets to U.S. firms completely. Financial, telecommunications and transportation markets are likely to become the ground of U.S. companies in case Korea joins the NAFTA, the ministry said. U.S. high-tech firms in telecommunications equipment, medium- and large-sized computers, power generation and the environment are expected to make inroads into Korea's government procurement sector. Korea will also have to remove restrictions on market access, foreign exchange dealings and investment. The United States is certain to mount pressure to protect its intellectual property rights through monitoring activities of a committee set up under the NAFTA pact. The analysis also pointed out that U.S. manufacturing companies would not be attracted here than expected as production costs are higher than those in Mexico and other Latin American nations in a move to join the body. [sentence as published] Based on the analysis, the trade ministry is very cautious about its entry into the NAFTA, saying that comprehensive measures would have to be drawn up such as formation of a special partnership to NAFTA and consolidation of cooperation with the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). But Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu insisted on two occasions early this year that Korea should tie up with NAFTA to avoid possible isolation from NAFTA and Southeast Asian economic blocs. At the foreign ministers talks, Han called on his Canadian counterpart to help Korea join the NAFTA in February. Mexico and Canada have expressed welcome to NAFTA.
