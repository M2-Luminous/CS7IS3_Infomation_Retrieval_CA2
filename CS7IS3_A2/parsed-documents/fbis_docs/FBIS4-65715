The Dutch Government has promised to raise the matter with the governments of the six Dutch Caribbean islands, but it had no idea how many Haitians, if any, could be received there. The U.S. request follows reports of increasing numbers of Haitians fleeing the country since the United States relaxed its asylum policy for Haitian refugees earlier this month.
