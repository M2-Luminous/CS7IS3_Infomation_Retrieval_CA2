The source noted that prices of weapons on the world market have gone up. The source said that Fatah official in Tyre Sultan Abu-al-'Aynayn, a supporter of Yasir 'Arafat, began collecting weapons in the camps of the region under his supervision. The source said the move is part of an effort to remove weapons from the camps to influence the Palestinian forces that oppose Gaza-Jericho agreement and paralyze their activity in resisting the Israeli occupation of the south. The source noted that representatives of factions opposing the PLO policy and opposition Fatah leaders led by Colonel Munir al-Maqdah have recently held a series of meetings to escalate military action against the Israeli occupation forces in the south, and even in northern Palestine (Upper Galilee). This was evident in the operation carried out jointly by the George Habash-led Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and al-Maqdah group in al-Khardali. Three fighters were killed in the operation. The source described the collection of weapons and their transfer to Gaza and Jericho as a new card that will be conceded in favor of 'Arafat's capitulatory policy. [passage omitted]
