FR940805-1-00026 FR940805-1-00004 While the Commission believes it is not the time to propose substantive rules about market power determinations, it concludes that it is appropriate to propose procedural rules to govern applications by oil pipelines for market-based rates. The Commission's analysis of the comments to the NOI indicates that a sufficient consensus exists about the issues that are germane to a market-based rate proceeding. It is in the public interest to establish by rule the information that must be filed by an oil pipeline seeking a determination that it lacks significant market power, enabling it to charge market-based rates. This should streamline the process of resolving market power issues and thereby minimize unnecessary regulatory costs and delays as contemplated by Section 1802(a) the Act of 1992. IV. The Proposed Rule_Summary The Commission is proposing to amend subchapter P of its regulations, Regulations Under the Interstate Commerce Act, by adding a new Part 348 to those regulations. In this new part, the Commission will establish the kind of information that an oil pipeline must include in its application for a market power determination, along with procedural requirements applicable to the filing of and responses to the application. In Parts V and VI below, the Commission will discuss the information requirements. In brief, an oil pipeline would be required to file a statement of position in support of its application for a market power determination, along with information that supports its statement of position, and additional information that will be desirable in a market power proceeding in order to minimize the need for discovery. In Part VII below, the Commission will discuss the procedural requirements applicable to applications for market power determinations. The Commission is not proposing at this time to implement generic proceedings or to make market determinations that would apply to pipelines other than the specific pipeline seeking such a determination. The necessity to examine both origin and destination markets in analyzing the market power of any given pipeline may make such generic determinations difficult. Also, some pipelines may lack market power in a specified market, whereas others may not. However, the Commission is still interested in ways it could more efficiently process market-power cases that may be filed. For example, should pipelines be able to join together to pursue market-power determinations in order to share the costs of such a proceeding? Should pipelines be able to unilaterally ``join'' a proceeding that is established by a competing pipeline in a given market? What would be the benefits and drawbacks to such joinder? Are there other ways in which the Commission could facilitate market power determinations in this regard? V. The Statement of Position Section 348.1(a) of the proposed regulations requires the oil pipeline seeking a market power determination to include with its application a statement of position as to its market power. Section 348.1(b) of the proposed regulations provides that the oil pipeline's statement of position must include a summary and a statement of material facts. The latter must include citation to the supporting statements, exhibits, affidavits, and prepared testimony. In its statement of position, the oil pipeline would be expected to present its arguments in favor of its position that it lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. VI. The Supporting Statements Section 348.1(a) of the proposed regulations requires the oil pipeline seeking a market power determination to include with its application the information required by proposed section 348.1(c). Under that proposed regulation, the oil pipeline must include certain designated information. The information required is mostly factual and is relevant to measuring the oil pipeline's ability to exercise market power in the relevant markets. That measurement will enable the Commission to determine whether the oil pipeline can exercise significant market power by profitably maintaining its prices significantly above competitive levels for a significant period. If a record has been established in an oil pipeline proceeding, another oil pipeline may make use of all or part of that record in satisfying its burden to present information to the extent the other record contains relevant public information which is not out-of-date. 17 The Commission is proposing the information to be provided in Statements A through I, which are discussed below. 17 See 18 CFR 385.508 (c).
