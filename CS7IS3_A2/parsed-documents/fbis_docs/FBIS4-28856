Eliminating the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula means, in essence, removing the U.S. nuclear threat and putting an end to the nuclear armament of Japan and the South Korean puppets, the article says, and continues: What should be done first of all for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to terminate the U.S. nuclear threat. The elimination of the U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal of its nuclear threat on the peninsula are the key to its denuclearization. It is also necessary for the denuclearization of the peninsula to put a period to Japan's nuclear armament. The nuclear armament of Japan poses a nuclear threat to the DPRK and obstructs the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Putting an end to Japan's nuclear armament is an urgent demand arising in the total removal of the nuclear threat in this region and the denuclearization of the peninsula. Checking the nuclear arms development by the South Korean puppets is also imperative. In actuality, the joint declaration on denuclearization has been reduced to a dead letter and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula made impossible by the traitor Kim Yong-sam. The nuclear threat by the United States, Japan and the South Korean puppets is contrary to the trend of the time. The nuclear threat must be totally removed and the Korean peninsula be turned nuclear free.
