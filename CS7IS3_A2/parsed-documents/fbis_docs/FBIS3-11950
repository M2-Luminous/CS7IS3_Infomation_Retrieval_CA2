The Galis Bay, a French humanitarian aid ship carrying 530 tons of food, arrived offshore on 25 March but could not dock, sources say, because National Port Administration [APN] officials refused to grant permission. Several people, notably members of the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, have been demonstrating in front of APN offices since 25 March to protest the arrival of this ship.
