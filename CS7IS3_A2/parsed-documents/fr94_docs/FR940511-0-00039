FR940511-0-00039 FR940511-0-00015 Comment: Clarify the rationale for establishing the western boundary of alternatives 4 and 5. Response: See response to previous comment. Modification of the Shoreline Boundary Comment: The shoreline boundary should be established at the lower low water mark to preclude interference with carefully crafted beach management plans regulating beach traffic, razor clam harvests and emergency aircraft landings. Response: The shoreline boundary of the Sanctuary is located at the higher high water line where adjacent to Federally-owned land (including the Olympic National Park and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife refuges) and the lower low line mark when adjacent to State-owned land. Thus, the boundary does not interfere with beach management plans. Razor clam harvests within the intertidal zone of the Sanctuary will be managed by existing authorities such as the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the Quinault Indian Tribe, and the National Park Service. Emergency aircraft landings are permissible in the Sanctuary. Comment: The shoreline boundary should cut across the mouths of all rivers, streams and estuaries because there are sufficient management plans in place providing protection of inland environments such as the Washington State Coastal Zone Management Program and the Grays Harbor Estuary Management Plan. Response: The shoreline boundary of the Sanctuary has been modified to cut across the mouths of all rivers, streams and estuaries. Comment: Clarify why the shoreward boundary distinguishes between adjacency to tribal and non-tribal lands. Response: The Tribes have jurisdiction to the mean lower low water line. Both the Tribes and the State have requested that the Sanctuary boundary not overlap with tribal and State lands. Therefore, the coastal boundary has been modified so that it is at mean lower low water when adjacent to tribal and State owned lands and at mean higher high water when adjacent to Federally owned lands. Comment: Existing National Park Service standards, regulations, and policies must not be diminished as a result of dual designation as a National Park and National Marine Sanctuary. The majority of the intertidal areas of the Olympic National Park are Federally designated Wilderness Area and must be managed accordingly. Response: The Sanctuary boundary overlaps with the boundary of the Olympic National Park. NOAA will not diminish the standards, regulations and policies currently applying to the intertidal areas of the Olympic National Park. The existing standards, regulations and policies of the intertidal areas will remain. NOAA will enhance the protection of these intertidal areas by working with the Coast Guard to ensure a safer vessel traffic environment, and the upland users of the watershed to monitor and minimize the impacts of non-point source pollution. Additionally, NOAA will support research and resource monitoring initiatives in the intertidal areas and may seek compensation for damages if an accident were to occur that injures Sanctuary resources. Inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca Comment: The northeastern boundary of the sanctuary should extend further into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to either: (1) The Lyre River; (2) the Clallam County Marine Sanctuary at Salt Creek; (3) Low Point; (4) Crescent Bay/Agate Beach; or (5) Pillar Point. Omission of the Strait of Juan de Fuca from the Sanctuary excludes the head of the Juan de Fuca Canyon from the boundary of the Sanctuary, and thus represents a boundary not based upon an ecological rationale. Response: NOAA has examined the resources of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the FEIS/MP has been revised accordingly. Sections III and IV (Alternatives, and Environmental Consequences) examine the benefits and consequences of various alternatives in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. NOAA believes that the existence of a functional biotic community characteristic of the marine environment extends into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Observatory Point. Eastward of Observatory Point, the ecosystem is more characteristic of an estuarine environment.
