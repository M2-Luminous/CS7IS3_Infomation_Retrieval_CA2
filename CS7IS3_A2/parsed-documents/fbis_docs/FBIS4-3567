Reforms had made initial progress, personnel vice-minister Zhang Zhijian told the first day of the International Symposium on Administrative Reform. But he called for serious attention to "such outstanding problems as strategies for administrative reforms, relations between central and local governments and reform of administrative legislation." Qian Qizhi, a bureau chief with the Central Organization and Establishment Committee (COAEC), said there was a "pressing need" for a solution to three problems. They were: -- How to make the transfer of government functions acceptable to everyone they affected. "Besides some fetters in people's minds, an important factor is some government departments' reluctance to relinquish their powers," he said. -- How to coordinate structural reforms with reforms in other fields. Structural reforms must advance in harmony with economic, political and personnel reforms, he said. -- And how to properly and effectively accommodate redundant officials who are removed from government offices. "The ultimate results of government reforms, in a certain sense, rest on a solution to this problem," he said. Gu Jiaqi, deputy director of the General Office of the COAEC, proposed a step-by-step approach to the country's administrative reforms and placed major emphasis on practical strategies. "Strategic plans will be of no avail in the absence of powerful executive bodies," he warned. The number of agencies directly under the State Council has already been cut from 86 to 59, and the staff of 37,000 reduced by 7,500 or 20 percent. With the first stage of reforms at ministry level coming to a conclusion, similar changes are spreading nationwide at local level. Streamlining of redundant personnel will remain an important part of administrative reforms in China, said Gu. And more than 2 million officials would leave government offices in this round of reforms. The three-day symposium is sponsored by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of its role in restructuring China's State agencies. It has attracted experts from UNDP, Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, the United States as well as Chinese officials and researchers.
