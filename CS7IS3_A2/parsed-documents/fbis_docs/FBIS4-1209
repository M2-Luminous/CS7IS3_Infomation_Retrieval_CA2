FBIS4-1209 "drafr079_c_94043" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AWB Rejects Accord AWB Rejects Accord MB2404204094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1829 GMT 24 Apr 94 MB2404204094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Ventersdorp April 24 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has rejected the accord on Afrikaner self-determination. "The AWB rejects the pathetic little sham masquerading as `a historic agreement' signed between the Freedom Front [FF], African National Congress and the National Party," the AWB's Executive Council said in Ventersdorp in the north-eastern Transvaal on Sunday [24 April]. The accord, signed in Pretoria on Saturday, makes provision for a 20-member volkstaat [homeland] council to constitutionally pursue the establishment of a white homeland. FF leader General Constand Viljoen had "reached new depths in political naivety and plain duplicity by announcing this agreement as a breakthrough and virtually regarding it as an acceptance of a volkstaat by the African National Congress," the AWB said. "The ANC leadership has said repeatedly a volkstaat is not acceptable, and Gen Viljoen himself has gone so far as to state there is no `instant volkstaat' and that in such a state `non-citizens' or non-Afrikaners would also be involved in governing and direction of the state. "How can this be the self-determination for which he says he stands?" The volkstaat meant nothing, the AWB said. "Gen Viljoen knows it. The FF is in the election for no other purpose than to try and cash in for their own financial benefit."
