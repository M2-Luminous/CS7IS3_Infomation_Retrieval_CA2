It will be addressed by Dr. Pallo Jordan, assisting him is Carl Niehaus and also Marcel Golding. Over to you, Pallo. [Jordan] We are going into a very big ANC victory, and though there are at this point very limited figures available, based on those figures we are projecting a majority of about 58 percent for the ANC. We expect that we will be able to see that reflected during the course of tonight in the figures produced by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. We are also expecting possible gains in Natal, the [Orange] Free State, the Eastern Cape, and the Western Cape which could result in that 58 percent figure, perhaps to 60 percent or more. At this point we are still very confident that the current ANC lead in the Northern Cape will hold, and based on our returns, which are running slightly ahead of those that are made available by the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], we think that lead is going to be maintained. We are particularly pleased about the strong showing of the Colored vote for the ANC, and we think this is in part due to the fact that in the Northern Cape Colored voters were evenly split in their support between the NP [National Party] and the ANC, in sharp contrasts to the trends that we have noted in the Western Cape. This is particularly true for Colored voters in the rural areas where our figures indicate that 4.5 percent rural vote went to the ANC and against 55 percent of the NP. The same was true of the urban areas such as Kimberley, and we think that this reflects a change in the rest of the country which differs very sharply from what occurred in the Western Cape. We see the same trend also in Uitenhage, in Eastern Cape, and other areas. At this point in time the figures for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] are exceedingly low because the counting started so late. At this moment in time we are showing a majority in excess of 64 percent, but we think that 60 percent is closer to the actual showing we'll make. So one can expect that 64 percent that we're seeing at present in the PWV might well drop to around 60 percent. There are African rural areas, many of whom were unfamiliar with the ANC at the beginning of this campaign, and where we have struggled very hard to familiarize people with the ANC and also to familiarize people even with the symbol of the ANC and its slogans, showing a particularly strong and high level of support for the ANC. In areas such as the Northern Transvaal it runs as high as 98 percent among Africans in the rural areas. In the Eastern Transvaal as high as 91 percent, and in the North West as high as about 97 percent. We think that this is extraordinary consolidation of the support of the ANC in the rural areas in particular. The other trend that we have noted in the election is that the Democratic Party [DP] campaign does not seem to have paid out. We read this in part as owing to the DP's concentration on an anti-ANC campaign which has resulted in may white voters voting for the NP at the expense of the DP. The DP in fact on current showing, and we admit that these are early days, and most of the huge urban areas have not yet reported back, but that showing at present, it looks like the DP is going to fall into something like forty, and will be replaced by the Freedom Front as the second largest party among white voters. The other trend which we have noted is that the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] doesn't seem to be faring as well as many had expected. There doesn't seem to be any identifiable area of the country where the PAC has been able to show visible support. This is true of areas where people expected it to make a good showing such as the Transkei, the Northern Transvaal and Eastern Cape. Early polling has showed that there are some gains we are going to make in various parts of the Cape including the Western Cape. We expect that by the time counting?closes in the Western Cape you will note that the ANC total will increase by about 4 or 5 points from the 24 percent that we're showing at present. We will now attend to questions, thank you. [Correspondent Callie Long] Dr. Jordan, four warrants have been issued in connection with ballot papers that were destined for the East Rand and Soweto. Do you regard this in a serious light? Is it going to affect the outcome? [Jordan] At this point in time one would not like to speculate about that particular disclosure. We did mention a few days ago that there were indications that there was mischief afoot in this election, and we pointed specifically to the non-arrivals of ballot papers especially in areas like the East Rand and Soweto. We would like that very much in the hands of the IEC to investigate, and we will defer (? some day). We wouldn't like to speculate about the significance of that at this point in time. [Correspondent Sefakunyaka] Dr. Jordan, it is quite clear that the National party and the African National Congress are guaranteed a place in Parliament. Would you be prepared to engage in the lottery of crystal ball gazing and tell us which other parties you think might also come in, and how will this affect a government of national unity? [Jordan] The ANC commitment to establishing a government of national unity remains unchanged and we will honor the terms of the interim constitution that any party that gains 5 percent of the ballot in the elections is entitled to sit in the government of national unity. At this point in time the parties that nationally will feature it would appear are the NP and the Freedom Front perhaps. One is uncertain of what status the DP will have at the end of counting, but as I say, we have not had returns from the huge urban areas as yet, which might of course change the picture very dramatically with respect to the DP. [Unidentified correspondent] The PAC has virtually disappeared from the political scene. Do you attach any specific importance to that and what have you got for the policies of the future? [Jordan] Well, I would say that it is premature to make a judgment about the significance of that. It is just something that one is noting, because there had been high expectations of the PAC's performance in certain parts of the country. I wouldn't like to speculate about its significance at this point in time. [Correspondent Angie Caplianos] What is your reaction to the slow flow of results coming in? [Jordan] The slow flow of results, I suppose, is as a result of some of the problems that the IEC has encountered. We are aware, for example, that in an urban area such as Durban, counting only started this morning. In the PWV, there seem to have been a lot of teetthing problems all of yesterday and counting started very late. In other urban areas, there were instances of sit-down strike and go-slow by counters and that, of course, has also [word indistinct] very negatively on the rate at which we are receiving the returns. When we started this conference, I don't think they had even reached the 20 percent mark yet, in terms of the votes that had been counted. It means that the nail-biting will continue longer, but I don't think we can help it. [Correspondent] Mac Maharaj was quoted today as saying that even if some parties didn't get 5 percent, they may be invited to join in a government of national unity to increase stability in the country. Is that an ANC position? [Jordan] Now, the ANC has always been very insistent that we want to make government as inclusive as possible and we want to enhance stability and I am sure that that is the viewpoint which could be looked at. Mac Maharaj at that point probably was expressing a personal opinion, but it is one personal opinion that runs counter to the thrust of ANC policy. [Correspondent] It looks like the Freedom Front was able to get a lot of support from the Afrikaner community. Now, you made a commitment that if the Freedom Front got substantial support, you would look again at the issue of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. Are you still looking at that? Secondly, does that change the attitude toward the Afrikaner community in a sense that now there is a substantial support for a party which actually does not want to be run or does not accept your governnment, in a sense that they want to have their own volkstaat. [Jordan] No, our attitude to the Afrikaner community remains unchanged. Afrikaners, like all other South Africans, are part of this country. They have a home in this country and, in the view of the ANC, they will always have a place in South Africa. As to the issue of a volkstaat, our commitment to discuss the issue of a volkstaat also remains unchanged. We have not said that we will ever entertain the notion of a volkstaat. What we have said is that we are prepared to discuss the idea of a volkstaat with those who support it, with a view to ensuring that those who want a volkstaat, and want to pursue a volkstaat do not engage in unconstitutional activities or in armed activity to attain their objectives. It doesn't mean that we will ever embrace the notion of a volkstaat ourselves. [Correspondent] I think one of the areas which is concerning a lot of people is Natal. There have been reports of a number of areas where ANC party officials were picked up, and I wonder what happened. How many objections have actually really been registered by the ANC? [Jordan] The issues you raised have been placed before the IEC and we have submitted quite a number of complaints with respect to that with the IEC. In addition to that, we have also placed a number of protests and brought to the notice of the IEC other irregularities which you have not mentioned. We are aware for example that there were a number of pirate voting stations in various points of Natal. We've brought those to the notice of the IEC. We've brought to the notice of the IEC other irregularities, but we are leaving those matters very much in the hands of the IEC because that is the machinery that was set in place to deal with them. [Correspondent] You seem to be conceding that you have no chance of reaching 67 percent. I know you are worried that the National Party will have a stranglehold on constitutional changes in the future. [Jordan] We are not conceding that we will not reach 67 percent. Every party goes into an election with a view to winning as large a majority as it can win. It's like going into a cricket match and saying, oh well, if you reach a century you we will be content. You don't go in like that. You go in there to knock the socks off the other team. If you make 2,000, good luck to you. If your entire team comes out scoring ducks, too bad; I mean, that's the way the game is played. [Correspondent Gregory Katz] How would you explain the party's relative lack of support in the Western Cape among the coloreds? [Jordan] I'm sure there are a whole number of reasons why we were not able to win as much support in the colored community as we had hoped for. One of those reasons I'm sure is a long past during which the Western Cape, during the days of apartheid, was regarded as the colored preference area which produced competition for jobs, for scarce resources between African and colored communities. I'm sure that is one explanation. But certainly there are others as well. [Correspondent] There is a very good showing of the Inkatha party in KwaZulu/Natal. Is there a possibility that there will be a national position for Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi (word indistinct) the ANC's position? [Jordan] The positions in the government of national unity will not be determined by your performance in any particular province. They will be determined by your performance in the country as a whole. But as I said, the crux of ANC policy is inclusivity; so we would not exclude the idea of the IFP being part of a government of national unity even if the performance does not measure up to the constitutional requirements. [Correspondent] A similar question with respect to the Freedom Front. They've made a reasonably -- at this point anyway. [sentence as heard] Is there any likelihood that they will be in a government of national unity? Related to that, how does the ANC and its government expect to ensure minority rights? [Jordan] To deal with the latter part of the question first, we have never thought in terms of minority rights. We have always thought in terms of individual rights. We've always said that a constitution that guarantees the right of every South African citizen, ipso facto protects the right of collectivity of South African citizens, whether they are a majority or a minority within the population. Secondly, the first part of your question. It will be up to the Freedom Front, if it makes that five percent ceiling threshold, whether or not it wants to participate in the government of national unity. There is no requirement that a party that scores that 5 percent threshold should participate in the government. What the constitution says is that it is eligible to participate. It's up to the party whether it wants to exercise that option or not. So that will be something you will have to put to the Freedom Front, whether it wants to participate in a government of national unity if it makes that 5 percent threshold. [Correspondent] Will it be advised to do so by the ANC government? [Jordan] The constitution requires us to do so even if we didn't want to do so, but we will invite it nonetheless. [Correspondent] Just to follow up on the question about what looks like the ANC did not achieve a two-thirds majority. Are you disappointed in that result and what impact will this have on the constitution-building and nation-building process down the road? [Jordan] Like I said, you go into a match to score the highest score. So you are not going to be happy if you don't score as highly as you would have liked to. It almost stands to reason -- we would have been happier to make a two-thirds. Now what impact that will have on the constitution-making process, I don't think is of great significance because we had always indicated quite clearly that whether or not we made a two-thirds majority, we were not going to try to use that majority to impose a constitution on the rest of the country. Even if we had made a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority, we would have striven to be as inclusive as possible. So that does not change the manner in which we are going to behave in the constitution-making body. [Correspondent Brandon Templeton] Taking into consideration the allegations of pirate voting stations and unavailability of IFP stickers in KwaZulu/Natal -- does this mean that the ANC and the IFP have come to some sort of agreement in the case of some areas being...? [changes thought] Will it be possible to tell whether a fair and free election was held in certain areas? [Jordan] As I indicated, irregularities that have occurred, that have come to our notice we have placed before the IEC. It's the IEC's responsibility to deal with those irregularities. We are not in the habit of making behind the scenes deals with anyone about irregularities. [break in transmission; news conference continues on CCV TV] That was true not only in Natal, but true in many parts of the country, especially on the first and second day of polling. So, that is something specific to the Natal Province. It is a problem, which I think is going to have to be resolved by the political parties, together with the IEC. The issue of reconciliation, I would think again, is something that has to be resolved by the political parties, together with IEC. [Correspondent] If we may return to the Western Cape for a moment. By your own estimation at the end of the day, the ANC may not get any more than 38 percent of the vote there. Can you just give us a peep in the long term as to what ANC's policy will be to, or strategy will be, to bring in more of the so-called colored vote into the fold of the ANC? [Jordan] The ANC will do what it has always done in the past. We fought this campaign on the issue of basic needs of South African people. Well, we will continue to do that -- to place the issues before the South African public. [Correspondent Michael Havlett] A slightly technical question: At what stage would you expect to make a claim that you have won this election and that the ANC will be taking part? [sentence as heard] [Jordan, laughing] I wish I knew. I think you are all aware that just last night we've been boogying on the second floor of this hotel, because we anticipated that we would be able to make that claim sometimes during the course of last night. Well, you were disappointed. Everyone was disappointed. We are going to boogie again tonight, but with far less expectation that we will be able to make the claim tonight, but, you know, we will boogie nonetheless, because we think it is about time we did. No, really, I can't answer that question. [Correspondent] Isn't there a point at which, you know, that number of votes which you have got, which will guarantee you 201 seats in the assembly, or something of that sort? [sentence as heard] [Jordan] I suppose when we reach that point, we will be able to do that, but when that will be, your guess is as good as mine at this point. [Correspondent] But that sets the trigger? [Jordan] Something like that. Something like that. [Correspondent] The ANC has emphasized non-racialism in its policies. How bothersome is it that the vote broke down so much along ethnic lines? [Jordan] No, those have not broken down along ethnic lines. There are certain parts of the country where that might be true, but it's not the National Party, and we think that's very significant. Even Northern Cape, for example -- most experts anticipated that the ANC would not be able to win the Northern Cape because of the large colored community there. Well, the reverse has proved to be true. [Correspondent] Do you consider the election as being free and fair? [Jordan] We would say on the whole free and fair, on the whole free and fair. [Correspondent] Would you give us some indication of what Mr. Mandela was doing today while he was watching the results? [Jordan] He will come and boogie later when the results are more firmly established. I don't think it will be proper to talk about what the president is doing in private. [laughter] He had some press engagements today.
