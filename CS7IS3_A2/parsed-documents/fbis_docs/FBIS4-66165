Accelerate Law-Making. The promulgation of the Company Law has been a powerful boost to the development of the shareholding system. The Company Law, however, does not cover the nation's entire shareholding system. Special laws and regulations are urgently needed to regulate the conduct of the principal players on the booming stock market, to tackle the rapid growth of shareholding cooperative enterprises in townships and rural areas, and to improve stock market information disclosure, etc. The top priority right now is to introduce a securities law without delay to meet a most pressing need and better facilitate the implementation of the Company Law. 2. Accelerate Pilot Projects. Compared to a decade ago, the shareholding system has developed significantly in the last two years. However, it still falls short of objective requirements. There is currently a strong demand among members of the public for the shareholding system to be broadened, something that must be given full attention by the pertinent agencies. Why was the contract system widely adopted (not just experimented with) almost overnight, while all broad-based pilot projects involving the shareholding system have run into considerable difficulties? If our exclusive preoccupation with stability causes us to let opportunities slip by, it will ultimately militate against the establishment of a socialist market economy in China. 3. Establishing a Regularized Shareholding Economy. The call for regularization is as old as the first pilot projects in the shareholding system. Yet the inertia of the planned economy has distorted the content of regularization. There are rules that say one cannot issue shares until after one has fulfilled the commitment of purchasing treasury bonds and that mandate examination and approval formalities level after level, not to mention specifying the value of shares to be issued. All this is typical of the way the planned economy operates and is most irregular. Any particular economic model must operate by its own rules and be supplemented by the corresponding management tools. If we do otherwise, regularization would be out of the question. And if we seek to correct the mistakes later, we will have to pay a high price. 4. Imbalance in Pilot Projects. There are proportionately more experiments in the shareholding system in the coastal provinces and economically developed provinces than in the border and remote provinces. Take, for instance, the ratio of companies whose shares are being traded on the stock market. Between them, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Fujian have something close to a monopoly, whereas southwest and northwest China are clearly falling behind. Balance, it should be realized, is the cornerstone of stability. If we locate every shareholding pilot project in special economic zones [SEZ's], leading to the large-scale movement of qualified personnel and funds helter-skelter, we will necessarily upset the balance and bring about social instability. 5. A Diversified Mix of Shares. No other nation has as diverse a mix of shares as China does, including state shares, legal-person shares, foreign-funded shares, personal shares, collective enterprise shares, internal shares, A shares, B shares, H shares, so on and so forth. Simply put, the mix is the product of both a historical reason (a plethora of state enterprises) and the planned economy (foreign exchange control). It would be unfair to blame a single factor exclusively. If this problem is not resolved soon, it will inevitably delay the regularization of the shareholding system, hurt the interests of every category of shareholders, and hinder the two-way circulation of funds. However, it will take technology and, even more important, time, to straighten out this problem. 6. Primary and Secondary Markets. The practice of issuing an unlimited number of share purchasing forms greatly reduces speculation and profiteering opportunities on the primary and secondary markets. Capacity expansion also renders the secondary market stable and orderly. Such a development, we must say, is normal. The past phenomenon of making a fortune overnight was precisely a sign of the peculiarity of the Chinese stock market. Accordingly, we should fully endorse the issue method on the primary market and capacity expansion on the secondary market and pin our hopes for the maturing of the stock market in the country on them. 7. Tighten the Regulation of Stockbrokers. The stockbroker plays a crucial role as a middleman. At present, however, some stockbrokers are inefficient in their work, charge arbitrary fees, and offer poor services, even lining their own pockets with ill-gotten gains by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by their line of work. Their practices have left the shareholders profoundly dissatisfied and there are frequent disputes between them. Thus it is most important to educate stockbrokers to make them comply with discipline and obey the law and improve the quality of their services. When a stockbroker breaks the law, he must be dealt with strictly. To protect shareholders' legitimate rights and interests, it is proposed that a special agency be created to monitor the stockbrokers and a telephone hot-line be set up on which a shareholder can make complaints about a stockbroker. 8. Step Up Prevention Of Stock Market Crime. Stock market crime has now become a new kind of crime in society. A typical analysis of stock market criminals shows that they include leaders equipped with the power to allocate funds, to review and approve shareholding pilot projects, and to issue shares. For this reason, tightening the authorization and control of funds, reinforcing ideological education, improving all sorts of systems, launching multiple-rights restraint, and even conducting stock market general inspections regularly (annually, for instance) are all effective ways to prevent stock market crime. 9. Share ownership should go hand in hand with rights, profits, risks, and responsibilities. The "five-tong" issue ("tong gu," "tong quan," "tong li," "tong xian," and "tong ze") has never been satisfactorily resolved. For instance, when an arbitrary decision is made not to match state shares, the right of the state as shareholder is lost. State shares and most legal-person shares cannot circulate, which translates into lost interests and heightened risks. The department in charge at the higher level wilfully intervenes in personnel appointments and dismissals, in the distribution of dividends, and in business decision-making. This infringes upon the shareholders' rights and constitutes irresponsibility. Every category of shareholders must learn to operate in accordance with the principles of the shareholding system. 10. It is undeniable that the stock market fever has much to do with the fact that some enterprises only see the advantages of raising funds by issuing shares. As long as money paid for shares is there, they could not care less how the shareholding mechanism works. In some cases, it has become a mere formality. The shareholders' meeting, for instance, is held perfunctorily. The selection of the board chairman and general manager is prearranged internally. The board of directors has become a dumping ground for cadres about to retire. Shareholders are not consulted on major decisions and changes. Information given out on the enterprise's performance is less than truthful. Fund-raising takes place in the guise of share allocation and shareholders are issued IOU's. If these practices continue, one fears one will hear slogans calling for the revitalization of shareholding enterprises very soon. It is proposed that the board of supervisors of the enterprise fully discharges its duties and responsibilities by promptly examining the company's financial data, monitoring the managerial conduct of the directors and manager, and correcting it regularly. The board of supervisors must be chosen democratically, comprising only shareholders with no leadership responsibilities. Furthermore, units at the higher level must support shareholding enterprises in transforming their mechanism and cannot wilfully or coercively dismiss a company leader or disrupt its decision-making and management. Departments in charge of staff functions (tax, finance) should operate in accordance with shareholding policies and not impose on shareholding enterprises the standards appropriate to other enterprises. With the enterprises and departments in charge working together, changing the mechanism of shareholding enterprises will not be a problem. 11. Regularize the Way in Which a Shareholding Enterprise Buys Up Another. The three incidents of shareholding enterprises buying up one another in 1993 were both a shock and a wake-up call to the agencies concerned, to companies whose shares are being traded on the stock market, and to shareholders. What the shareholding enterprises in the cases did was basically normal. Due to inexperience, the individual companies made some technical errors and were duly punished. It is normal market behavior for a company which has shares being traded on the stock market to purchase a particular stock through the stock market. This is an effective way to acquire or merge with another enterprise. But the purchasing process must be open. If an excess is acquired, it must be made public. Information disclosure must be prompt and the purpose must be constructive. Acquisition is inherently an act of property transfer. It is conducive to resource reallocation and reorganization and helps enterprises enhance their competitiveness. However, the existing policies, laws, and regulations governing enterprise acquisition are too general, which does nothing to facilitate the process of buying up an enterprise whose shares are traded on the stock market. Thus detailed, practical, and orderly rules are badly needed. 12. Crack down on bogus and inaccurate information. Both shareholders and the stock market were badly burned by the several incidents in 1993 involving bogus or inaccurate information. Preventing the dissemination of such information is essential to protecting shareholders and the stock market. Accordingly, media that disclose information must operate strictly in accordance with the "Implementation Regulations on the Disclosure of Information Relating to Companies With Publicly-Traded Shares." Violators should be sternly handled. (Already some publications were disciplined in 1993.) Detailed penal regulations must be formulated and people who fabricate information must be severely punished. Information consulting points should be set up everywhere to disseminate information regularly and squelch bogus information. 13. The issue and circulation of state shares and legal-person shares is inevitable. Whether you like it or not, state shares were traded on several occasions in 1993. This shows that it is only a matter of time before state shares are traded and circulate on the market. For now we must promptly decide who should be the agent for state properties to accelerate the personalization of the trading of state shares. No time should be wasted in formulating rules for the trading of state shares so that there is a law to go by. The trading of quasi-state shares, that is, legal-person shares, should also be handled as described above. Managing the issue and trading of these shares artificially by resorting to planned quotas would not work. If state shares and legal-person shares are not traded on the open market, rights and interests would remain stagnant at the existing level and the state would then be stuck with the risk. In the end, state properties would suffer. 14. Intensify Stock Market Risk-Consciousness. The shareholding system in China is still in its infancy, with many people having no basic knowledge of the system. They labor under the one-sided view that one makes a profit the moment one buys some shares and are hardly conscious of the risks involved. Consequently they are more likely to feel distraught when they lose money. Thus we must strengthen the shareholders' risk-awareness even as we organize all sorts of lectures showing people how to play it smart on the stock market and hire stock experts to tell us their experiences.
