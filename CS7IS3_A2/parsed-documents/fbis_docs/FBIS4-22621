Up to the present time, many of the candidates whose civic equality was infringed are attempting to defend their constitutional rights, legality, and justice with the help of the Procuracy in people's courts and the Constitutional Court. But the voters are supporting those who despaired, got tired, and understood the lack of promise of these efforts with sympathetic and stimulating telephone calls; they say, after all, we believed in you, and we participated in the elections only for your sake... Popular wisdom says that a drop of water grinds a stone. And, apparently, the people in their wisdom are always correct. Because a miracle almost happened: In the end, the people's court in one election district declared the elections invalid. This is a precedent, and it is worth discussing in greater detail. It seems that back on 9 March the Tyulkubas District commission for District No. 134 composed an act that declared the elections in the district invalid. It checked for two days the statement of candidate M. Mermankulov concerning a prejudiced attitude toward him on the part of precinct commissions in Kazgurtskiy Rayon and established that actually in their calculations the precinct commissions reduced the number of votes given to him in one case by 21, in another--by 39, and in a third--by 17, etc. This was verified in a spot check with the opening of a package of ballots of a total of six precincts, and in all six similar "reductions" were permitted; moreover, not only were Mermankulov's votes reduced, but also those of all the other candidates from the six who were running, except for the deputy chief of the Kazgurtskiy Rayon administration, A. Kubeyev. The district commission did not begin to confirm whether this was done intentionally or accidentally, considering this not to be in its jurisdiction. Therefore it limited itself only to the direct guidance of Article 65 of the Code on Elections, which concerns violations in vote counting--it declared the elections invalid. It must be assumed that this decision did not come easily to the district commission. From the information given by the district commission to the people's court: "In a spot check opening of packages of ballots, violations committed by precinct commissions in counting votes were disclosed. In six precincts the number of votes given to Mermankulov was artificially reduced almost by 180. Great doubt was also raised by the fact that almost one-third of the ballots were not folded in half before they were dropped into the ballot boxes. For this, it was necessary to conduct a special expert analysis. After discovering the indicated violations, the district commission approached the Central Election Commission for advice. A.I. Artamanov, secretary of the Central Election Commission, proposed displaying more independence. After this, the commission decided to declare the elections invalid and refused to sum up the voting in the entire district..." It is a great pity that such a clear indication of civic courage becomes the property of the public only now, a month after the peak of the events. Otherwise we would have long ago been able somehow to get and publish the decree of the Central Election Commission of 15 March. This decree has historical significance for our young sovereign state, because it lays out the "theory of partial pregnancy." The voter, after all, is a crowd, a primitive mass, a woman can be pregnant or not pregnant, and elections can be honest or falsified. But according to the theory of the Central Election Commission, the tally of votes can be not quite honest, with massive falsifications, but at the same time not have an effect on the election results. How is this? Here is a quotation from the decree of the Central Election Commission: "As the checkup showed, the precinct election commission committed technical errors in counting the votes with respect to all the candidates included on the voting ballot. However, they did not influence the outcome of the elections. "The Central Election Commission decrees: "1. To cancel the decree of the district election commission on the elections of deputies of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Tyulkubas Election District No. 134 'On Declaring the Elections Invalid.' "2. To declare the elections in the Tyulkubas Election District No. 134 of the South-Kazakhstan Oblast valid. "To instruct the district election commission to sum up the elections." This long quote from the decree is given here especially so that our reader can catch the iron character of the Central Election Commission from its tone and style and its absolutely firm will. Its decrees regarding the legally unregistered candidates did not at one time distinguish themselves with such firmness, and were only in the nature of a recommendation. But now once again from the report of the district commission to the people's court: "The district commission responded to all telephone instructions of the Central Election Commission to tally the votes with a refusal. Only after written instructions of the Central Election Commission of 15 March 1994, and under pressure from the supervisory workers of the oblast administration, did the district commission depart with its materials to Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where in fact the precinct commissions themselves were checking their own results of the voting, and it is very difficult to make a judgment about their objectivity. But it is on the basis of these results that the summing up was not conducted until 17 March 1994." Is it worth commenting on anything in this quotation? No. After all, to the editorial staff the reader is not a primitive mass at all. He will understand everything even without a commentary. And he will reach his own conclusions. We will only add a little information. The candidates whose rights were infringed upon have filed a complaint against the Central Election Commission with the soviet rayon people's court of the city of Almaty under the chairmanship of I. Baygesiyev, and the materials and circumstances of the elections in the 134th District have been examined. Many facts were revealed indicating the ingenuity of the administration when it becomes necessary to resolve problems in its own interests. For example, elders came from the village of Sharankhan of Kazgurtskiy Rayon and talked about the great "concern" shown for the villagers during the elections. Just before the elections, members of the precinct commission came to their village, went to all the homes, and asked all the adults to sign lists of voters. At the same time, they did not offer to fill out ballots. And they explained that it would not be necessary to go to any elections after this... I think that it was not easy for Judge I. Baygesiyev to reach a decision on the elections in the 134th Election District. However, could it have turned out any other way, given the aforementioned testimony of the elders? Even under the heaviest pressure? Probably not. Facts are a stubborn thing. M. Mermankulov, who succeeded in making the first breach in the blind wall of lies and illegality, is a former author of KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. He has written articles in the newspaper about the need to establish a single investigative committee, and he was and remains among those who are against corruption. I wanted to meet with him and congratulate him on his victory. But the meeting had to be postponed. After all, the decision of the court on the invalidity of the results of the elections in the 134th District was adopted back on 5 April, but the Central Election Commission has still not uttered even a sound in this regard: It has not made a decision, it has not commented on the case for the press, and it has not disclosed its own profound feelings with respect to the falsifications. Will the Central Election Commission suddenly ignore the whole Tyulkubas story as if it did not happen? As it has until now ignored many cases of violations of the law. We should obviously wait a little before congratulations.
