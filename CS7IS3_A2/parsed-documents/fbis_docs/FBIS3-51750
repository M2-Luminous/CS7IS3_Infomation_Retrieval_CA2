Ross said it is necessary to give a political tenor to the workers' assemblies initiated one week ago so that workers may discuss how to improve the nation's economic situation and put the country's domestic finances in order. The island's most important labor leader said that the country wants to overcome the current crisis in such a way that it will be able to continue defending the achievements of the people and of socialism, the daily GRANMA reports today. A similar position has been taken by Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban Parliament. He said that this phase of discussions about measures to put the country's domestic finances in order and other key matters of the economy also forms part of the political battle for island development. The country's authorities have promoted collective debates in search for a national consensus on the adoption of decisions capable of balancing a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.2 billion pesos (the peso is equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate) and decreasing the excess 10 billion pesos now circulating. In the assemblies that have been held the members of labor unions have spoken in favor of reducing subsidies on some state products and services, eliminating undue free services, increasing the prices of nonstaples, and offering social security only to people who really need it.
