The LDP forced the Hata cabinet to resign en masse by submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet, claiming the Hata cabinet was a minority government that did not represent the people's will. The LDP is taking the Hata cabinet's resignation as a matter of course. Asserting that it would like to form a stable coalition government with other political parties, the LDP intends to discuss ways to form a new coalition government with the other parties. Speaking with a group of reporters this morning, LDP Secretary General Mori said Prime Minister Hata had said he would leave the formation of the next government to the Diet, and being the largest party, the LDP will call on other parties to cooperate with it in doing so. While some LDP members would like to create an alliance with the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in forming the next government, former Foreign Minister Watanabe is asserting the framework of the next government must be based on policies, indicating his caution about the LDP forging an alliance with the SDPJ. The LDP is expected to be divided over how to construct the next government's framework.
