Some steady-state gravity (residual gravity) caused by air resistance and shifting from the gravitational center remains. There is also some vibration (g-jitter) caused by human activities and the operation of various machines. The residual microgravity is deemed to generate new flow or influence flow however minute it might be. To learn these effects, therefore, is very important in the field of fluid handling and material processing. The residual gravity is estimated to be 10-5 to 10-6 g and causes a slight flow in one direction. G-jitter is a vibration with various frequencies at levels of 10-3 to 10-4 g. Lower frequencies are expected to influence flow, and higher frequencies, to exert a strong influence on the dispersion. Computer-simulated flow in residual gravity and g-jitter is shown in Figure 1. In this case, the flow is disturbed by low frequency. Figure 3. Ground Simulation Test of Electrolytic Color In the experiment, an experiment vessel as shown in Figure 2 is used for actually observing and quantitatively measuring such phenomena. The rectangular solid vessel (7 by 8 by 2 centimeters) is filled with water, salt, and pigment (phenolphthalein). A temperature gradient is then induced in the liquid by heating (70ï¿½C) the upper surface of the vessel. The temperature gradient causes a flow when gravitational acceleration exists. The flow is observed by the electrolytic color development method. The solution of salt is electrolyzed by installing the anode (silver plate) and the cathode (palladium wire) in the vessel and turning on electricity. The pigment is discolored by the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) change near the cathode. The flow can be detected by the moving pattern of the discolored portion. Actual discoloration on the ground is shown in Figure 3. The transparent liquid becomes reddish purple. In electrolyzing the solution of salt, chlorine gas is generated at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode. In this experiment, those gases are absorbed by the silver and the palladium respectively and the generation of bubbles which hinder the experiment is prevented. Figure 1. Light Response of Goldfish A heater is embedded in the upper surface of the vessel and thermocouples for temperature measurement on the left and right faces. A bellows is attached on the left face of the vessel to allow sample solution expansion due to heating. As too much discoloration of the pigment hinders flow pattern observation, the cathode (palladium wire) is painted red in places to prevent discoloration of the pigment at these places. Figure 2. Change of Light Response of Goldfish In space, the Convection Diffusion Unit (CDU) with the above vessel installed will be housed in VIBES, and experiments will be conducted with isolation on and off to determine whether the Shuttle vibration is mitigated or not. The effects of the g-jitter will be better understood by comparing the results of the two cases.
