The main task of this meeting is to sum up the main experiences in statistical work since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his important talks during the inspection tour to the south and since the 14th party congress and to deeply study reform of the statistical system according to the requirements of establishing a socialist market economy, thus further enhancing the level of statistical work and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy. Statistics is an important part of the basic work of the state in exercising scientific policy-making and management. The party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core attaches great importance to statistical work and cares deeply about it. Recently, to mark the 10th anniversary of the promulgation and enforcement of the "PRC Statistics Law," Premier Li Peng wrote: "Keeping accurate and timely statistics according to the law." Practice shows that only by keeping statistics according to the law can we ensure that statistics are accurate and timely; and only by ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of statistics can we guarantee the effectiveness of the information, consulting, and supervisory functions of statistics and guarantees the correctness of policies and their effective implementation. Accuracy requires us to adhere to the principle of being realistic. That is, we must authentically record facts and must resolutely oppose any exaggeration and concealment. If we are not careful and rigorous in handling statistics or even practice fraud, then it is very likely that incorrect policies will be formulated and incalculable losses may be caused to economic construction. There have been extremely profound negative experiences in the past, and we should bear this in mind. The value of information lies in its timeliness. That is, the transmission of information must be speeded up, and the work of monitoring, forecasting, and anticipating trends in the operation of the national economy must be strengthened. We should strive to provide the necessary information before leaders make policy decisions so that problems can be solved as soon as they appear. Through reform and development in the past 10 or more years, the statistical work in our country has gradually moved onto a path specified by the legal system, and statistics organs have gradually expanded their functions from merely providing information to offering consulting services to the leading organs of the party and government and exercising effective supervision over economic operations. Under the current situation of speeding up the process of establishing the socialist market economic structure, our statistical work is also facing some new and stern challenges. On the one hand, due to changes in the economic base, changes have also occurred in those institutions subject to statistical investigation. Not only has the number of such institutions been increasing continuously, but they have become more and more complicated as a variety of economic elements, business organizational forms, and distribution patterns now coexist side by side. This will make it more difficult to conduct statistical investigations. On the other hand, due to changes in the pattern of interests, the phenomena of exaggeration, concealment, deliberately delaying reports, and refusing to submit reports have arisen in some localities and units, thus affecting the accuracy and timeliness of statistics. Therefore, it is necessary to positively advance reform of the statistical management system and statistical investigation methods, make great efforts to consolidate the legal system related to statistics, and ensure that statistics are actually handled, managed, and developed according to the law. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out: "The establishment and improvement of the socialist market economic structure must have standards and guarantees from a perfect legal system." This requirement is also applicable to statistical work. The Statistics Law in our country was formulated 10 years ago, and some provisions of the law may not be suited to the requirements of the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we should make revisions without delay and improve the law as soon as possible. Statistical legislation must give expression to the spirit of reform. It is necessary to seriously sum up practical domestic experience, boldly adopt successful foreign practices, and use the law to guide, promote, and guarantee the smooth development of reform in statistical work so that it will play a greater role in the state's scientific policy-making and macrocontrol. Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should firmly support the efforts of statistical organs to fulfill their task according to the law. It is necessary to further popularize legal knowledge related to statistics. All people related to the statistical work should study and understand the relevant law and should be conscious in abiding by the law and applying the law. All localities, institutions, and individuals must not impede statistical organs and personnel from collecting and reporting statistics to the upper authorities according to the law. Those who refuse to perform their statistical duty, deliberately evade or undermine the state's statistical supervision, practice fraud with statistics, or impede statistical organs and personnel from independently performing their duties specified by law must be investigated and punished according to the law. A small number of cases which have had a major impact should be exposed by the mass media. Thus, the handling of one case may educate a large number of people and may ensure the smooth conduct of statistical work.
