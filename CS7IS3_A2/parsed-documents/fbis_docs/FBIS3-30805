This confirmed that the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is the sole legitimate legislative authority of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and reaffirmed the principles for a political resolution of the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The correctness of the stances and activities of the legitimate representatives of the Croat people in the search for a solution to the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been reasserted at international peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the declaration says. Bearing in mind the present international order and reiterating their lasting political orientation for peace and a political solution to the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the principles proposed by the commission headed by Pero Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the Croatian Democratic Union for Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin Markovic recording] The preservation of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and internationally recognized state is only possible through the consent of all three constituent, equal, state-building peoples -- Croats, Serbs, and Muslims -- and all of them together, through a union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, the right of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina to self-determination and the realization of their statehood and independence will be guaranteed by the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna in the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina with respect for the right of the other two state-building peoples -- the Serbs and the Muslims -- to the same on an equal footing. Third, all the rights of the members of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the internal set-up of the state -- must be guaranteed on its entire territory through an agreement on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, achieved by the mediation of the international community. By ensuring the application of the highest international standards governing human and political rights, we will demand the same for the other two state-building nations -- the Serbs and the Muslims. We are in favor of cultural, religious, and national autonomy and local self-administration for every nation in each of the three republics. Fourth, the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be set up as a democratic, multiparty, parliamentary state which safeguards and guarantees all fundamental rights and freedoms of each of its state-building nations and citizens irrespective of their nationality, religion, political affiliation, sex, and social status. Five, we support sustained efforts and struggle by the entire legitimate political leadership of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the protection of all national, cultural, economic, and human rights of the Croats living outside the areas of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on the basis of reciprocity with the other two state-building nations. [end recording] In addition to these political principles, the declaration supports and accepts President Tudjman's peace initiatives and efforts aimed at halting the war and restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, and welcomes the signing of an agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Yugoslavia. Those who have not yet accepted President Tudjman's initiative are called on not to seek a solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina through continuing the war. The declaration urges observance of international humanitarian law, supports efforts for the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid, and condemns every violent act and barbarity toward historic and cultural heritage.
