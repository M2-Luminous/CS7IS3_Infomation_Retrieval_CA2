He says the miners stopped their strike yesterday. Tomorrow, at the Presidium of the Council of Ministers, the Russian State Budget for the current year is to be approved. Then it will be sent for ratification by the State Duma. These two events are linked together. The miners are waiting to see what the budget will do for them. State Duma Deputy Yegor Gaydar is interviewed by Svanidze. He speaks of the problem of non-payment of wages. He says that the higher the non-payments, the greater the expectation that the government will pay. Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin says one should not make promises one cannot keep, but promises that are now on a par with obligations should be kept. Gaydar says the workers are, after all, also suppliers -- suppliers of labor. They have fulfilled their obligations and they should be paid. The management of the enterprises have not fulfilled theirs. The miners are not people who are holding a knife at the throat of the government to press for an increase in pay. They are asking reasonable questions -- about the need to investigate the effectiveness of the use of funds for subsidizing the coal industry, they are asking to what extent these funds are going to maintain the commercial structures being set up in the corporations. "Are they sitting in high-interest accounts and the deposits of joint enterprises?" they are asking, Gaydar says. Svanidze asks how much is being stolen, and Gaydar says much is being stolen. Shokhin says the government should explain what policy it is pursuing and the limited resources of the budget should be targetted very accurately. He says that if we provide enough funds for the coal industry we should ensure continued work without the stoppages we have had of late. Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, interviewed in an office, says, leafing through a book: "Our proposals are very tough. This document is the draft budget, which is to be examined by the Government presidium tomorrow." "We must finance ourselves from a relatively safe point of view as regards inflation," Dubinin says. "We are convinced that the pursuance of such a budget will enable us to lower the inflation index to the level of, at any rate less that 10 percent a month at the end of the year." Asked whether 3 or 5 is out of the question, Dubinin says why not, if we can collect more taxes than we have been counting on -- we do not collect anything like 100 percent and America collects 80 percent -- then we will be able to lower the budget deficit and count on lowering inflation. If we were using shock therapy we could reduce inflation in two or three months, but it is a question of socioeconomic choice. We are not prepared to try the shock option. Finally, Dubinin says he can recommend the budget to the government. In this "Details" program dealing with the economy, the announcer Nikolay Svanidze, says: "Incidentally, about the budget -- `Details' has information that the military budget, which is being proposed, has been received at the Ministry of Defense as being below par. Grachev has stated that in order to stick to it he will have to dismiss about 400,000 servicemen. He, Grachev, can take that step but does not vouch for the consequences."
