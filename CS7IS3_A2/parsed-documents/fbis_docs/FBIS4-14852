[Yeltsin] The processes developing in Russia today cannot be considered as having been "defused." The changes are coming thick and fast, and in these conditions it is difficult to make any long- term predictions. Moreover, with the adoption of the new Constitution we have determined the basis and the main parameters for the development of the political system for the next 10 or 15 years. Despite the various and even contradictory points of view of the new parties and political blocks, we are seeing increasingly clearly the formation of a national consensus based around a strong power. This is a response as much to historical tradition arising out of the dimensions of the state itself and the complex national make-up of society as to the needs of the current stage of transition from totalitarianism to democracy. Naturally, a strong power does not mean unlimited power, a lack of control, or authoritarianism. Moreover, the arbiter and supreme guarantor of the free development of Russia will be the expression of popular will, in democratic elections. [Bonet] If you do not stand at the 1996 elections, what guarantees are there that a strong presidential power will not end up in the hands of a person with authoritarian or even neofascist tendencies? [Yeltsin] For me it is not a problem of whether I stay or go. The problem is leaving Russia in safe and democratic hands. These hands must be capable of holding Russia's helm steady in a stormy sea. I believe that one of my main accomplishments by 1996 will have been to create the guarantee that prevents the country from falling into totalitarianism. [Bonet] What are the conditions enabling the president and the new Russian parliament to maintain constructive relations? [Yeltsin] It is necessary, firstly, to have political maturity in the main state institutions. There is no cure for the lack of a political culture -- we need time. However, there are already good foundations for cooperation between the president and the parliament: the new Constitution stabilizes the principle of a clear division of powers. I also believe that we will learn our lesson from the dramatic outcome of the events of 3 and 4 October last year (the storming of the Russian parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note). For my part, I have already learned the lesson and am in favor of dialogue and cooperation. Our shared duty is to isolate the extremist forces in parliament. [Bonet] How do you intend to dissipate the growing fears in the countries of eastern Europe, including the former Soviet republics, faced with the dangers arising from the advancement of the radical nationalists in Russia? [Yeltsin] These fears are unfounded. Russia cannot be transformed into a flourishing and stable country if it is a threat to its neighbors. If we had other intentions or ulterior motives we would not have withdrawn our troops. We had sufficient possibilities for staying put. Unfortunately, the politicians in the various countries are artificially exaggerating their fears and have brought a rain of complaints down on the international organizations. In general, these fake concerns hide concrete economic and political calculations -- for example, obtaining rapid integration into NATO or using the scare tactics of the "Russian threat" in their internal struggles for power. Those who speculate on Russia's return to an imperialist doctrine are basing their fears merely on statements made by specific political extremists who are far from being able to formulate our country's foreign policy. [Bonet] What is the state of relations between Russia and Ukraine? [Yeltsin] Relations with Ukraine are complex. Its independence has posed many difficult problems. However, I am not going to dramatize the situation. We need to be less emotionally involved and take fewer hasty decisions. History cannot be undone: economic, social, demographic, and cultural needs will in time do the work that is impossible for politicians to do. I can see the prospect of a deep, multilateral integration, simply because there is no other solution. I am also convinced that we will manage to find a solution to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet based on the formula drawn up in Massandra at my meeting with President Kravchuk. [Bonet] Is the Atlantic Alliance the best-suited collective security system for Russia? If so, why has Moscow not asked for membership of the organization? If it is not, what is the best system? [Yeltsin] For decades, NATO has guaranteed security in West Europe at a time when there was a severe East-West confrontation between totalitarianism and democracy. However, at the same time, no one can ignore the radical changes that took place in Europe after the triumph of the democratic tendencies in Russia. It is uncomfortable to pretend that we are sitting in a chair that no longer exists. Today Russia does not threaten the world or Europe. In these conditions, it is counterproductive to retain intact a powerless system directed toward stiff opposition with the enemy. We must find new security formulae based, naturally, on the fact that NATO has useful experience and institutions that must be put to the best use. Russia must be able to participate in the same conditions and with the same security guarantees. We have ceased being rivals but we must learn how to be partners. The mechanical enlargement of the block with specific countries can only revive old fears and suspicions. [Bonet] How do you think the countries of the West can contribute to supporting democracy and benefiting the success of economic reform in Russia? [Yeltsin] We have gone through a phase of overoptimism. On the one hand, we ourselves overestimated the possibilities offered by the West, which today is experiencing difficult economic times and does not want to take any risks. Secondly, it is now clear that no one can really help Russia, given its economic contradictions and its specific characteristics inherited from the socialist regime. Our task today consists of creating normal economic and legal conditions for major investment. However, now is also the time that the West should stop feeling as a donator to Russia, and should start behaving like a clear-thinking businessman acting in his own interests. Russia must become one of the most profitable places in the world for capital investment. [Bonet] Why until now has the fight against corruption in Russia yielded no results? [Yeltsin] We must not look at things as if corruption were a specifically Russian phenomenon. Even in the most democratic country, there are those who profit from their positions as state employees, and wealthy people trying to profit from the greed of the civil servants for their own ends. We fight against this as we fight against any other type of crime or antisocial activity. However, in a number of cases the corruption has taken on threatening dimensions in Russia. We must not rely on the state being able to defeat them using solely repressive means. Just a short time ago, I signed a decree on state service that should serve to create an unfavorable social climate for corruption. We also need to create a system of social and material guarantees for state employees that give them a suitable standard of living and that then frees them from the need to look for other ways in. In short, we must try and create the conditions in which it will no longer be profitable for them to safely agree to corruption.
