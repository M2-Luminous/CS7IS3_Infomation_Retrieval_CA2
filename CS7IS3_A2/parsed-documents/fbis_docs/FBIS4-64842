In his opinion, the next president of the Republic will have to maintain the moratorium, for "France will not want to offend the world." Francois Mitterrand has an acute sense of provocation. Yesterday, in an unprecedented move, the head of state gathered in the banqueting hall of the Elysee [office of the president] 200 people directly concerned with the nuclear deterrent, including army commanders, industrialists, scientists, members of Parliament, and ministers. With the exception of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, all his former defense ministers were there, as well as current Defense Minister Francois Leotard. However, there was no Edouard Balladur, who was elsewhere, for obscure reasons regarding scheduling difficulties. [passage omitted] As the guardian of the Gaulliist doctrine of deterrence, Francois Mitterrand reaffirmed the pillars thereof: "The key aim of deterrence is to avoid war by safeguarding the integrity of national territory and ensuring the defense of our vital interests," he professed. As for the notion of the "final warning" which emerged in the sixties, it is a "terminal warning" which must not be led astray and become some kind of "nuclear artillery." Looking at Francois Leotard, the head of state proved menacing on the subject of the government's majority. "Mr. Defense Minister, you intend to tell the National Assembly that it should provide itself with the means of response or attack against the weak or crazy. Should we use nuclear weapons outside our territory or apart from our vital interests? Must we rally to the adherents of the surgical, or even decapitating, nuclear strike? And why not a nuclear gun? To me that would seem to be a major heresy. There is no way I will accept it. And if an amendment in this sense came to be adopted, it would lead to a major conflict which the French people would have to decide on." Clearly, he was threatening to dissolve the Assembly. The paradox is that this risk would appear to be infinitesmal. While Edouard Balladur remains very discreet on these issues, Francois Leotard will mark his opposition to any measure that would result in nuclear weapons becoming an everyday feature. And in the Assembly, the committed proponents of preventative nuclear strikes, led by RPR [Rally for the Republic] member Jacques Baumel, can be counted on the fingers of one hand. By stating his views ceremoniously, Francois Mitterrand reiterated that nothing concerning the policy of nuclear deterrence can be done without him. In passing, he will certainly trigger several skirmishes within the government's majority against the excessive lenience supposedly shown by Edouard Balladur toward the president. The provocative aspect of Francois Mitterrand's speech is not insignificant just before the parliamentary debate on defense issues. However, yesterday's exercise will go much further than the end of the upcoming parliamentary debate. "The movement calling for nuclear disarmament is healthy," said Francois Mitterrand, voicing his support for a renewal of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and a "universal, verifiable" treaty banning tests. And that will not necessarily be the vision of the next president of the Republic, especially if his name is Jacques Chirac.
