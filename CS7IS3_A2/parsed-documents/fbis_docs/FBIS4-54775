The parties also called for ensuring fairness in the elections. The statement issued by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party of the current governing coalition, emphasized that "The responsibility for Hungary's future is a burden to be shared by each of us, now, at the time of the elections, without any exceptions. In a democracy, this responsibility is also an opportunity for people outside politics to determine their country's future policy." "The coming elections are just as decisive in determining Hungary's future as were the 1990 general elections, when the majority of the population voted the socialist system out, to replace it with democracy and national ascendancy," the MDF document says. The MDF has asked everybody to notice the early signs of economic recovery, even in the midst of everyday worries, and cast their ballots in awareness of who are those responsible for the country's past, and which party can ensure a peaceful future, success and stability for Hungary. Whether there will be any remarkable change in Hungary will be the main issue in the elections, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), the biggest opposition party, says in its election appeal. The Free Democrats give priority to boosting economic growth, promoting prosperity in agriculture, reducing unemployment, and guaranteeing social security. "For Hungary, neither the road followed in the past four decades, nor the one covered in the past four years, is feasible," the SZDSZ states. The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) statement says, "Voters have become disappointed with the present cabinet, and obviously want to see a new parliament and a new cabinet...What is at stake is no longer a change in regime but a change in government. The country wants to have competent and honest leaders. This is what the MSZP offers for its voters." The Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), a member of the governing coalition, states, "It is easy to criticize the work done by others, but critics forget that the slow pace of progress was due not only to the inherited ideological, economic and political burdens, but also to persistent rebuke by the opposition." The party offers itself for the voters' attention as follows, "The Christian Democratic People's Party, which has increased its membership tenfold over the past four years, remains a consistent force for Christian national ideals." According to the appeal of the opposition Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), Hungarians are dissatisfied with the current government. "This government should go! We are aware that voters do not wish to continue the long downward march of the past four years, involving a decline in production, the tightening of belts, and a decrease in consumption and living standards. The Young Democrats say: no more of that! A better future can begin now, with the next four years," the Fidesz's states.
