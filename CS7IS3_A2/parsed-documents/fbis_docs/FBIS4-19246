Juliet asked her Romeo, and immediately advised him to give up his in order to end the conflict between the two families. Greece has demanded the same thing from its small neighbor Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] for over two years -- and with increasing brutality. The name of the country alone is a program, Athens laments, because this means that Skopje is claiming the part of Macedonia that was allocated to the Greeks after the 1912-1913 Balkans war. The Constitution and flag are also brimming with revisionism. The European Union [EU] yesterday waved the cane at the refractory Greeks. In response to the trade blockade that Athens imposed on Skopje on 16 February, the EU Commission dragged Greece before the European judge. The EU wants the European Court to issue a provisional injunction against Athens: The blockade is to be lifted immediately. A formal complaint will follow. In European terms, the EU has acted at breathtaking speed, with the blockade having been imposed less than two months ago. This gives one the feeling that a lot of irritation has accumulated in Brussels against welfare-recipient Greece. In fact, Greece has been making life difficult for the EU for quite some time now. It has systematically tried to counteract Brussels' policy directed against Serbia; again and again Greece is talked about for sanction-busting. The permanent conflict with NATO ally Turkey goes back to the times before the European Community was founded. The other 11 members are not very pleased with the Greeks for reasons specific to the EU. Be it in the Chancellor's Office in Bonn or in the corridors of Brussels: The Greeks are accused of "blackmail" behavior. Athens systematically delays EU decisions to derive financial profit from Brussels. Of course, Macedonia, once a republic at the edge of Yugoslavia, is not entirely innocent. Like everywhere else, there are nationalist phrase mongers there that Greece can use as proof of Macedonia's territorial claims. But Skopje has passed two amendments to its Constitution that reject desires for territorial claims or interference. In addition, Macedonia has offered Greece an agreement on the inviolability of its borders -- which was brusquely rejected by Athens. Meanwhile, Macedonia is sliding into economic ruin. Trade with Serbia has been disrupted because of the sanctions, and the Greek blockade has also cut off the southern border. The GNP declined by 15 percent last year. Can the EU punitive action against Greece produce any results? If Athens does not yield to the provisional injunction, a new proceeding will have to be initiated in Luxembourg to legitimize punitive action. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the Court of Justice has the right to impose financial sanctions on EU members, but the provisional injunction will take weeks. Yet, perhaps Athens will realize earlier that it is isolated within the EU.
