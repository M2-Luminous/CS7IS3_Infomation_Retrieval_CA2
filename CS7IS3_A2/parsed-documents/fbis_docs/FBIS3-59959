William Condori, finance secretary for the Special Federation of Tropical Region Peasant Workers [FETCTC], told PRESENCIA: ``We absolutely and energetically reject this proposal, and will not allow its implementation and the eradication of our coca plantations.'' He explained that the ``zero option'' the ``gringos'' are proposing calls not only for the eradication of the so-called excess coca plantations, but also plantations intended for the ``traditional'' use of the leaf. In other words, ``they want the to eliminate coca completely, so that not a single plant is left.'' According to Condori, the U.S. proposal allows 18 months for the total eradication of excess coca plantations and 48 months, or four years, ``to put an end to the coca myth.'' He added: ``To put an end to the coca myth is to end our culture, and that is out of the question; (the North Americans) will have to finish us off first.'' The peasant leader explained that this new ``offense'' directed at coca farmers has been fully analyzed, and it has been decided that it is just ``another approach'' aimed at provoking the peasants, fostering violence, and militarizing coca-producing areas in order to eradicate coca plantations by force. ``There is just no other way,'' he said. Condori recalled that in the past the North Americans had devised a ``low-intensity war'' which failed, adding that ``this onslaught will fail as well, because eradicating coca plantations means leaving thousands of Bolivian families without sustenance.'' He emphasized that the peasants are not against drug enforcement. ``Drug trafficking is a different issue. The repression is aimed at coca farmers, not against the drug traffickers, and less still against the big fish who walk in and out of the U.S. Embassy. The target of the repression are the Bolivian peasants who cultivate coca,'' Condori emphasized. He pointed out that coca farmers have declared U.S. Ambassador Richard C. Bowers ``persona non grata,'' and reaffirmed that the settlers in Chapare are organized to oppose ``not only the zero option, but any other kind of repression that will take away our sustenance.''
