The president's 14 June 1994 edict no. 1226 "on urgent measures to protect the population from banditry and other manifestations of organized crime" opens up a tragic new page in Russian history in that sense. The edict stipulates in particular that when there is "sufficient information" (who will determine this?) that a person belongs to a gang or other organized group, "by agreement with the prosecutor" (but without sanction) before criminal proceedings are instituted reviews and other investigatory actions can be undertaken with regard to the suspects, their relations, acquaintances, corporate bodies, and PUBLIC ASSOCIATIONS. An undertaking not to change address, personal surety, surety from public organizations, and bail are not applied with regard those suspects and accused of these crimes, they can be arrested without charge for a period of up to 30 days. Representatives of the internal affairs and counterintelligence organs have received the right to search at any time the premises of enterprises, organizations, and institutions and also transport facilities and their drivers and passengers and on any pretext and not only in connection with suspicion of having committed a crime. At first glance there is nothing frightening in the edict -- no prison, camps, or firing squad. But we should have no illusions: The edict is a heavy brick thrown in the window of legality and human rights. The window has been smashed to smithereens and it will not be long before the firing squad.... I shall not tiresomely enumerate the articles of the Constitution, Criminal Code, and Criminal Procedure Code violated by the president's edict -- the lawlessness lies "heavily, crudely, and visibly" on the surface and no one is trying to hide it. Something else is more important: The edict DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION. Any lawyer will tell you that in a situation where he has to choose between a law and an edict, a judge, prosecutor, or investigator must unfailingly FOLLOW THE LAW -- he is obliged to do so by his duty, by the law, and by the Constitution which, incidentally, no one has formally repealed. The president's edict gives a wonderful opportunity for playing cat and mouse with jurisprudence and speculating on the fact that "the evidence has been obtained by illegal means" and that the suspect is "the victim of tyranny and illegal repressions." This "loophole" will be used unfailingly by those against whom the edict is allegedly aimed -- inveterate, well prepared criminal elements with the opportunity for hiring a reliable attorney. In proclaiming the intensification of the struggle against crime the edict in fact weakens and disorganizes it. It is that which puts us on our guard: Why then was it published? I venture to suggest that in fact the edict has nothing to do with the struggle against crime, it is pursuing completely different -- political -- aims. First: dragging the Duma into a confrontation with the president. To someone who has lived through the defeat of the Supreme Soviet it is as clear as daylight. In just the same way a year ago the Supreme Soviet was drawn into confrontation by lawless edicts on privatization and was taunted with "decoy ducks" in the budget. And they achieved their end -- first the Supreme Soviet was discredited and then it was destroyed completely. A year later we can see that the Supreme Soviet was right in many waYS: The budget collapsed, privatization has discredited itself, but who remembers that the Supreme Soviet was right? For several months now a similar game has been under way against the State Duma. The first round was the amnesty (initiated by the president let me remind you) which ended in the Duma's favor. The deputies were not split and did not quarrel -- on the contrary, they adopted a decision which eased the pitch of political confrontation in society and compelled the president to invent the "social accord treaty" to capture the political initiative.... The second round -- the budget round -- is ending in a draw. Yes, it is the case that the Duma did not gain any political dividends from the budget but there are no grounds for discrediting it -- it simply took and without lengthy discussions approved the budget submitted by the government. If there is something wrong then it is all the complaints against the government and president. Next in line is the third and probably last round. Having violated the Constitution and the laws and cancelled out draft laws on the struggle against crime on which the Duma is working, the president has issued an edict which most grossly flouts human and civil rights. The aim is to provoke an outburst of anger among the deputies and the public and perhaps to retreat and then to put all the blame on the deputies for the collapse of the economy and the catastrophic increase in crime. A well known, cliched, and base trick which has been used many times: "The worse, the better, we shall find the culprits!" The second reason: To remove the "taboo" on the criminal and criminal procedure codes and to accustom people to the idea that they can be replaced by the president's edicts. To force workers in the law enforcement organs to transgress the oath which obliges them to serve the people and to obey the laws. How exactly do the organs protecting law and order differ from any armed gang? The use of violence? Both use violence. Technical equipping? The mafiosi and racketeers have perhaps a higher degree of technical equipment. There is one difference and it is the main one: the attitude toward the law. According to this indicator it has always been believed that they are on different sides of the barricades. The president's edict erodes that difference. Law enforcement organs which do not base their activity on the law are transformed from a tool in the struggle against crime into the largest mafioso gang backing up the power and interests of their "godfather." I would not be surprised if with time it emerges that the series of murders and acts of terrorism which swept the capital immediately after the edict was adopted were a "special order" from some high-ranking gentleman. After all it is so important that photographs of bloodstained, lacerated bodies should appear in newspapers and television reports next to items from the State Duma "which is preventing the president from struggling against crime." So why not push someone toward vigorous actions? We are used to the acts of provocation of our sovereigns and the moral standard of all the present authorities leaves us with no illusions. The third reason is the need for preemptive measures before the fall which promises to be "hot." Despite all the assurances and promises, the catastrophic decline in industry has not been overcome and stoppages of enterprises continue. Readiness for bringing in the harvest is 50 percent even compared with last year, which was far from a record-breaking one. However patient the Russian peasant is, betrayed and slandered by everyone, cut down by market "reforms," even his patience will finally break.... And it is here that the president's "storm detachments" will be needed, detachments which do not consider any laws. Nonetheless the edict is having no "triumphal progress." Of famous political leaders only two -- Zhirinovskiy and Travkin -- have openly supported it. The former because the edict fully complies with his own ideas of the struggle against crime (that is how he intends to act when he comes to power) and the latter most likely because he is burdened with the portfolios of a "minister without portfolio" in the present government cabinet. The edict has met with a sharply negative response even from pro-president groups of deputies and many lawyers, and former human rights champions who understand very well what kind of a hopeless quagmire the country can be led into by the president's "experiments" with the criminal code. Having sensed a smell of burning the "democratic press" has started to scurry about and become perturbed.... And it has reason: The first to come under the axe of illegal repressions are opponents, next are unreliable supporters, and then all the rest, without number and indiscriminately. After all, that is the "law of revolution...."
