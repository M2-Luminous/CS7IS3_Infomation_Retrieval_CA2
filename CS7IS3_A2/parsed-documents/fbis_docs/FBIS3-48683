President Clinton, in his State of the Union Address to Congress, devoted a large portion of it to domestic problems. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton made clear his administration's position that the foundation for "reconstructing the United States" will be built through domestic reform. The State of the Union Address entitled "On the Present Situation of the United States" is an annual report given by the President to the American people. President Clinton's State of the Union Address reflected very forthrightly the present situation of the United States, and gave us a good impression. The Clinton administration has met with many difficulties since its inauguration. Looking back on what his administration has done over the past year, we find some of its accomplishments worthy of receiving high marks. Among other things, we would like to point out that the U.S. economy has steadily recovered ahead of Japan and European nations. While the growth rate has gone up, the jobless rate has gone down, and the federal budget deficit is on the decline. Among other things, the entire American society appears to be regaining confidence and vitality with the restoration of its competitiveness. The U.S. economy began picking up in the closing months of the Bush administration. It is true, however, that the Clinton administration's economy policy, including the enactment of a fiscal coordination act aimed at cutting the federal budget deficit, has consolidated the foundation for economic recovery. The adoption of a national service system designed to encourage young Americans to participate in society, and the enactment of the Brady Act designed to keep guns under control can be cited as accomplishments by the Clinton administration that have promoted change in the United States. After praising those accomplishments, President Clinton focused his State of the Union Address on the present state of American society and sought the American people's awareness and cooperation, saying, "There are still a lot of things we have to do." What the President most emphatically stressed in the address is reform of the current medical insurance system on which Mrs. Hillary [as published] has worked. Tens of millions of Americans do not benefit from the system, and they are said to be unable to live free of everyday concerns. We cannot help but be surprised at the President's forthrightness regarding the present situation of the United States. During the era when the U.S. economic strength was dominant in the world and the pie shared by the American people, including immigrants from all parts of the world, continued to grow, the thorough individualism and self-help spirit were a source of the vitality and diversity of the United States, an ethnically diversified nation. However, even the encouragement of self-help has been unable to keep a growing number of Americans from being estranged from society since the United States entered an era when the pie's growth was sluggish or dropped at times. What the medical insurance issue raises is the inconsistency of politics that has failed to respond to changing times. In his address, the President also stressed the need to cope with crime and work to keep the family from collapsing. As for measures to prevent crime, the argument for gun control has so far been powerless against the insistence that individuals have the right and freedom to have guns in order to protect themselves or hunt. We hope the Clinton administration will use the Brady Act to take effective measures to strengthen gun control. Whether the United States, which as sole superpower has a great influence on the world, will succeed in domestic reform is a question to which we cannot be apathetic. We think so because a healthy American society will ultimately provide a basis for America's balanced foreign policy; not because the contradiction and evils of American society have spread to Japanese society in the past. The Clinton administration has often been criticized for failing to shape a comprehensive foreign policy. In his address, the President slightly touched on his foreign policy but did not put forth a U.S. vision of the post-Cold War world. We would like to see the Clinton administration present a clear outline of its foreign policy taking into account its bitter experiences of the past year, including the deadlocks in Somalia and Haiti.
