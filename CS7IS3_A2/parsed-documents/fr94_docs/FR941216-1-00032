FR941216-1-00032 FR941216-1-00010 Quotes for the substantially similar property right are readily available if they are readily available from brokers, traders, or dealers during specified time periods. Although price quotes for over-the-counter property rights often are not widely disseminated because the rights may be privately tailored for a particular transaction, quotes for over-the-counter property rights generally will be treated as readily available if customers could obtain quotes from brokers, traders, or dealers. Commentators have stated that any method requiring taxpayers to create payment schedules using expected values would be difficult to apply. They have said that there is too much variation in the expected values of the property rights embedded in contingent payment debt instruments to allow for the creation of payment schedules that are not susceptible to abuse or to challenge upon examination on the basis of hindsight. The noncontingent bond method, however, generally sets the projected amounts of market-based contingent payments by using forward prices for the embedded property rights rather than expected values. It is the understanding of the IRS and Treasury that forward prices are available for almost all of the market-based property rights embedded in contingent payment debt instruments. For example, these property rights generally may be obtained on a separate basis for hedging purposes. Moreover, the IRS and Treasury understand that dealers and certain information services provide daily quotations of the prices of contingent payment debt instruments held by regulated investment companies to allow the companies to determine their net asset values. To do this, the price of the separate elements of the contingent payment debt instruments, including the embedded property rights, must be determined. Thus, the IRS and Treasury believe that, in general, it will not be difficult for issuers of contingent payment debt instruments to obtain forward price quotes for the property rights embedded in the debt instruments. The proposed regulations include a number of provisions designed to address other concerns with the pricing requirement. First, the pricing requirement only applies if quotes are readily available. Therefore, when it is not feasible to obtain a quote, pricing is not required. Second, the IRS and Treasury understand that the price a broker or dealer develops for any property right embedded in a contingent payment debt instrument when pricing the debt instrument as a whole will not necessarily translate into a forward price for the property right determined on a separate basis. For example, the price of the property right embedded in a contingent payment debt instrument may include charges for financial intermediation that would not be imposed if the property right were purchased separately. Thus, the rules that apply to an issuer who must set a projected payment schedule allow substantial flexibility. Further, the IRS and Treasury recognize that quotes for thinly traded property rights may vary and that the bid-ask spread may be substantial. The proposed regulations, therefore, provide that a taxpayer may use any reasonable quote to determine the projected amount of a payment. The proposed regulations also provide that the taxpayer may use bid price, ask price, or midpoint price quotes to determine the projected amounts of quotable contingent payments. However, the taxpayer must make this determination on a consistent basis. For example, a taxpayer cannot use ask prices to determine the projected amounts for some contingent payments on a debt instrument and bid prices to determine the projected amounts for other contingent payments on the instrument. Finally, if a contingent payment is equivalent to more than one combination of property rights, taxpayers may use any reasonable combination. However, it is not reasonable to construct a combination of property rights that contains property rights for which forward price quotes are unavailable if there are other possible combinations that consist only of property rights for which forward price quotes are readily available. A nonquotable contingent payment is any contingent payment that is not a quotable contingent payment. For example, contingent payments based on oil production or the issuer's gross receipts are generally nonquotable contingent payments. The projected amount of a nonquotable contingent payment is generally based on the projected yield of the contingent payment debt instrument. The projected yield is a reasonable rate for the debt instrument that, as of the issue date, reflects general market conditions, the credit quality of the issuer, and the terms and conditions of the debt instrument. For this purpose, the proposed regulations provide that a reasonable rate is not less than the AFR or the yield on the debt instrument determined without regard to the nonquotable contingent payments. In many cases, a reasonable rate will substantially exceed the AFR. Once the projected yield is determined, the projected amount of each nonquotable contingent payment is determined so that the projected payment schedule reflects the projected yield. The projected amount of each payment, however, must reasonably reflect the relative expected values of the nonquotable contingent payments. The proposed regulations provide simplifying rules to determine the projected payment schedule of a contingent payment debt instrument that would be a variable rate debt instrument except that it provides for a single quotable contingent payment at maturity or does not guarantee a sufficient return of stated principal. Under the proposed regulations, the projected amounts of the variable interest payments are determined using the rules of ยง1.1275&hyph;5(e), rather than the general rules for quotable contingent payments. For example, if the contingent payment debt instrument provides for stated interest at a single qualified floating rate and a quotable contingent payment at maturity, the projected amounts of the interest payments are based on the value of the rate as of the instrument's issue date and the projected amount of the contingent payment is determined under the rules for quotable contingent payments. The proposed regulations require the issuer to construct the projected payment schedule. If an issuer fails to produce a projected payment schedule as required, the issuer will be treated as failing to meet the recordkeeping requirements under section 6001 necessary to support the deduction of interest. To avoid potential audit disputes about the projected amount of a contingent payment, the proposed regulations provide that the issuer's projected payment schedule will be respected unless the schedule is unreasonable. A projected payment schedule generally will be considered unreasonable if it is set with a purpose to accelerate or defer interest accruals. In determining whether a projected payment schedule is unreasonable, consideration will be given to whether the interest on a contingent payment debt instrument determined under the schedule has a significant effect on the issuer's or the holder's U.S. tax liability. For example, a projected payment schedule prepared by an issuer that is a non-U.S. taxpayer will be given special scrutiny because no schedule would have an effect on the issuer's U.S. tax liability.
