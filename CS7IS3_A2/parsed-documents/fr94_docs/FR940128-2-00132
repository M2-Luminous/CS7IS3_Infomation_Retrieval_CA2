Specifically, the issue before the Court was whether the 30-day period for filing a petition for EAJA fees begins immediately upon expiration of the time for appeal of a remand order issued by a court under sentence four of section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, or after the administrative proceedings on remand are complete. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joanne K. Castello, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1711.
