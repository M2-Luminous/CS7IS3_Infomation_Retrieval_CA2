Ciampi this morning began a series of consultations in view of the January 12 debate on no-confidence motions in the Senate and Lower House. He met with delegations from the Christian Democrat, Socialist, Social Democrat, and Liberal parties, all of which said they did not have any strong objections to holding general elections at the same time as European Parliament elections, already scheduled for June. Ciampi also met Marco Pannella, the Federalist Party leader who submitted the no-confidence motions. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Pannella reiterated his claim that Ciampi should resign immediately and that a second "political government," again led by Ciampi, should be formed and allowed to govern "with full powers" until early elections are held. But Christian Democrat Party leader Mino Martinazzoli at a press conference after meeting Ciampi said there was no need "to rush to elections" and did not rule out the possibility of linking general elections with those for the European parliament. Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco said he will ask those party members who signed the no-confidence motions to withdraw their signatures, adding that Ciampi can count on the full support of the Socialists in parliament. Del Turco, too, said that joining general and European Parliament elections would be "good fortune for the country." The Social Democrats said more or less the same things as the Socialists, adding that holding only one round of elections would save the state about one trillion lire (588 million dollars). Even Liberal Party Senate whip Luigi Compagna, who yesterday had denounced Ciampi for allegedly siding with the Left Democrats, today conceded that Ciampi was "not at all off-balance in favor of Achille Occhetto," the Left Democrat chief, and was instead "very concerned about maintaining his government's institutional standing." The Liberal Party Lower House whip, Savino Melillo, commented that the idea of putting together two elections in June "does not seem inappropriate." Most politicians officially agree that the cabinet led by Ciampi, a former central bank governor who does not belong to any party, and parliament have both fulfilled their main duties (approving an austerity budget and getting new election laws in place) and should now step aside. But the no-confidence motions were in fact signed by those members of traditional parties that have governed Italy for decades, that have been hit hardest by corruption scandals and that stand to lose the most if elections are held immediately. The no-confidence motions are therefore seen by opponents as a last-ditch attempt to delay general elections and give the old-style politicians the opportunity to save their careers.
