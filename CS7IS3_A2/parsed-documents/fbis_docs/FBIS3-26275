By the end of last year the province had over 740,000 privately owned firms, with a total of 1.303 million employees -- respectively 17.9 percent and 22.4 percent up over the previous year. The figure means that on average there were over 8,000 self-employed people and over 400 private firms emerging each month in the province last year. For a long time in the past the private economy had made slow progress in Liaoning. But with rapid social development in recent years, this northeast China province has given priority to boosting the private economy. The average registered capital of each self-employed person was over 6,300 yuan last year, 30 percent more than in the previous year. Increasing numbers of technological and export-oriented private firms have been founded in the province. In 1993 Liaoning had more than 2,600 self-employed and private technological firms, and over 160 foreign-funded firms. The private businesses have started to carry out joint-stock and leasing systems. Some have set up co-operation ties with collective or state enterprises not only locally but also in other areas of the country. Last year private businesses recorded a total production value of 11.8 billion yuan, 83.8 percent up over 1992, and handed over 1.5 billion yuan in taxes, six percent of the total tax revenue of the province. The development of the private economy has boosted local markets. It has also helped employ large numbers of surplus rural labor. The province has a nearly 20 million rural population, with average per capita cultivated land of about 0.08 ha, lower than the average level of the country. Now household businesses of farm product processing, fisheries, garment and shoe making, and knitwear have mushroomed in rural areas of Liaoning.
