FBIS4-39348 "drsov110_c_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Duma Groups' Voting Plans on Budget Described Duma Groups' Voting Plans on Budget Described LD0706204894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1613 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706204894 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] In the Russian State Duma the New Regional Policy group is going to vote for the federal budget in the second reading on condition the spending on defence is increased from 37 to 55 trillion rubles and subsidies to territories from 18 to 23 trillion. This was reported to Interfax on Monday by the head of the group Vladimir Medvedev. The group of 64 deputies is the second biggest in the lower house of parliament following Russia's Choice. Most members of New Regional Policy supported the federal budget during the first reading on May 11. Yabloko group does not support the draft budget submitted by the government on the whole because it does not reflect an economic policy the country would need today. This was told to Interfax by the head of the group Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. He said his group voted against the budget in the first reading and it would be strange, he said, if it changed its approach by the second reading. Still Yavlinskiy said his group would support certain amendments to the budget. The Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 will support the draft budget, if it does not exceed the deficit named during the first reading. The leader of the group, former finance minister Boris Fedorov told Interfax that his group would agree to increase spending on defence research by no more than 3.5 trillion rubles as the budget committee suggests. Russia's Choice did not meet on Tuesday and intends to define its attitude to the draft on Wednesday before the Duma session. The heads and experts of the Communist, Agrarian and Democratic factions intend to agree on a common stand during the budget debate planned for Wednesday. This was reported to Interfax by Yevgeniy Krasnitskiy (Communist). He said his group will also insist on increasing the revenue by improving tax-collecting as well as spending. It plans to support the proposal of parliamentary committees for defence to increase defence spending from 37 to 55 trillion. He denied claims that Communists would vote against the budget. "The budget proposed by the government is rotten, of course, but even a bad budget is better than none", he said. The leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and a considerable part of his faction will evidently be absent from the Wednesday session because on Tuesday they began a tour of Krasnodar region. However, on Monday Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that economists from the faction would take part in the discussion of amendments to the budget. The lower house is go [as received] discuss some 300 amendments. Yevgeniy Nikonov of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord expressed the opinion that his faction would support the idea of increasing budget spending.
