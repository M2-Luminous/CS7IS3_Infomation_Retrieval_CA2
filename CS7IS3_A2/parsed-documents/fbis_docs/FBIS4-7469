[Berisha] [passage omitted] I would say there were three main themes of the talks. First, we discussed bilateral relations between Albania and Great Britain. In the talks that I held there, I pointed out all the developments in Albania and, what pleased me the most, was the knowledge that my interlocutors had about Albania and their assessment about the great changes that Albania has achieved in two years on the democratic road. What seemed important to me, and it is extremely important, was the complete predisposition I found in top British officials to encourage further cooperation between both countries. For this, I got assurances from Prime Minister Major, her majesty the queen, and Secretary of State Douglas Hurd. I think that in this spirit, the signing of four agreements on the last day of my visit undoubtedly marks an important event in cooperation between Albania and Great Britain. I would like to stress that all the talks and meetings that I held were open, kind, and friendly. Another very important theme was the Albanian question, the crisis in the region, and the Albanian issue. [sentence as heard] In the talks, I stressed that the Albanian question is the main question in the Balkan crisis. It is true that war is being waged in Bosnia today and this constitutes a sharper phase of the Balkan crisis. However, the most fundamental question is the Albanian one, because Albanians are a nation divided in two -- half live in Albania, while the other half in several states. In this respect, there is no doubt that the most delicate point of this question is Kosova. In general, this constitutes a very serious issue. I expressed my view that the Albanians are not seeking a change of borders by force, but on the other hand Albanians will react as a single nation toward every massacre or practice of ethnic cleansing that anyone may undertake against them. I have my doubts that that is possible, because as has been shown by the developments of the two last years, Milosevic is practicing and putting into practice the memorandum of the Academy of Sciences of Serbia, according to whose map of Greater Serbia, 40 percent of non-Serbian peoples should be exterminated and cleansed. Here I expressed Albania's readiness to make its own contribution and assistance in resolving these problems through dialogue. I pointed out that it is indispensable that a direct dialogue between Chairman Rugova, a president elected through the free vote of the people of Kosova, and Belgrade in the presence of a third party is indispensable. I do not see this as unfruitful if there exists the will on both sides. I also stressed that it is necessary that the embargo be related to the situation and the solution of the problem of Kosova and that UN monitors be sent to Kosova, so as to monitor and directly inform the UN Security Council about all the progress, obstacles, and developments that are encountered on the road to resolving this question. I think that we achieved understanding in many directions. I can say that the British Government is seriously worried about the crisis in the region, and the situation and condition of the Albanians in Kosova, and is committed to paying more attention to them so as to resolve this problem gradually. [Vokshi] Mr. President, in Great Britain you held talks with many businessmen, the most famous in the British business world. Did you see any concrete result, any concrete interest on the part of British businessmen in these talks? [Berisha] You are right. I did regard as very important and I do consider very important the meetings that I held with businessmen. What encouraged and pleased me very much was that I found Prime Minister Major and Secretary of State Hurd very determined to encourage British investors. For this aim, I held a meeting at the Confederation of British Industry and presented the great possibilities that Albania offers. Though a small country to lokk at, in fact, at the investment level, Albania should not be considered as such, as it is a country of great possibilities, a country that achieves a 10-percent growth means that it has a strong turnover and earnings and it is a country where money is not lost. I think that the representatives of major British industry got this message in full. [passage omitted] We discussed petroleum, airport supplies on the basis of a contract signed with British Petroleum, tourism, chromium, fishing, constructions, and other multiple fields, such as the glass industry. I am convinced that British investors are increasing their interest in Albania. The reform in Albania is very encouraging for them. [passage omitted] The third theme that I discussed extensively with high-level British personalities was Albania's integration into European structures and Europe. I assured my interlocutors that Albania's great aim is its integration into Europe and that the Albanian Government considers this not as an immediate process, but as a process that will come, as an active process that comes through Albania's dignified efficiency to become a member of these institutions. Within this framework, we welcome the Partnership for Peace. We also insist that the time is coming to open negotiations for the association agreement into the European Community, as well as to sign an agreement with the Western European Union. I can say that I found complete understanding among my interlocutors and got their assurance that they will unreservedly support Albania's integration into European institutions. To conclude, I can say that this visit was extremely important and successful for us. I want to thank Prime Minister Major heartily, her majesty the queen, Secretary of State Douglas Hurd, and many other friends whom I met in Great Britain and who showed a great interest both in the development of relations between Albania and Great Britain and provided support to Albania's integration into Europe and a solution to the regional crisis.
