FR941028-2-00183 FR941028-2-00109 •Cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who have infectious TB should not be done in the patients' homes unless absolutely necessary. When medically necessary cough-inducing procedures (e.g., AFB sputum collection for evaluation of therapy) must be performed on patients who may have infectious TB, the procedures should be performed in a health-care facility in a room or booth that has the recommended ventilation for such procedures. If these procedures must be performed in a patient's home, they should be performed in a well-ventilated area away from other household members. If feasible, the HCW should consider opening a window to improve ventilation or collecting the specimen while outside the dwelling. The HCW collecting these specimens should wear respiratory protection during the procedure (Section II.G). •HCWs who provide medical services in their patients' homes should be included in comprehensive employer-sponsored TB training, education, counseling, and screening programs. These programs should include provisions for identifying HCWs who have active TB, baseline PPD skin testing, and follow-up PPD testing at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk. •Patients who are at risk for developing active TB and the HCWs who provide medical services in the homes of such patients should be reminded periodically of the importance of having pulmonary symptoms evaluated promptly to permit early detection of and treatment for TB. g. Medical offices. In general, the symptoms of active TB are symptoms for which patients are likely to seek treatment in a medical office. Furthermore, the populations served by some medical offices, or the HCWs in the office, may be at relatively high risk for TB. Thus, it is likely that infectious TB will be encountered in a medical office. Because of the potential for M. tuberculosis transmission, the following recommendations should be observed: •A risk assessment should be conducted periodically, and TB infection-control policies based on results of the risk assessment should be developed for the medical office. The policies should include provisions for identifying and managing patients who may have undiagnosed active TB; managing patients who have active TB; and educating, training, counseling, and screening HCWs. •While taking patients' initial medical histories and at periodic updates, HCWs who work in medical offices should routinely ask all patients whether they have a history of TB disease or have had symptoms suggestive of TB. •Patients with a medical history and symptoms suggestive of active TB should receive an appropriate diagnostic evaluation for TB and be evaluated promptly for possible infectiousness. Ideally, this evaluation should be done in a facility that has TB isolation capability. At a minimum, the patient should be provided with and asked to wear a surgical mask, instructed to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and separated as much as possible from other patients. •Medical offices that provide evaluation or treatment services for TB patients should follow the recommendations for managing patients in ambulatory-care settings (Section II.D). •If cough-inducing procedures are to be administered in a medical office to patients who may have active TB, appropriate precautions should be followed (Section II.H). •Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever) should be evaluated promptly for TB. HCWs with such signs or symptoms should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded or until they are on therapy and a determination has been made that they are noninfectious. •HCWs who work in medical offices in which there is a likelihood of exposure to patients who have infectious TB should be included in employer-sponsored education, training, counseling, and PPD testing programs appropriate to the level of risk in the office. •In medical offices that provide care to populations at relatively high risk for active TB, use of engineering controls as described in this document for general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) may be appropriate (Section II.F; Suppl. 3).
