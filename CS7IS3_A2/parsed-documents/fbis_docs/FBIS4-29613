In the panic, sparked by the shortage of domestic rice on shelves, many rice sellers were harassed by angry consumers and robbed of motivation to continue selling rice, the sources said. Of about 8,000 rice retailers in Tokyo, 78 failed to renew their licenses for rice sales in June, a procedure required every three years, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The number was up 34 percent from three years ago, when 58 sellers abandoned the business. But the sources said some rice retailers who did extend their licenses have handed them over to others and virtually quit. According to an association of rice retailers in Tokyo, many of its members were discouraged by commotion during the panicky rice hoarding earlier this year, which resulted from a scarcity of domestically grown rice on the market after last year's devastating harvests. When stocks were low and grains that were on the shelves were priced double and even triple normal costs, many consumers flooded rice retailers and demanded they sell rice they were hiding in stock, the association reported.
