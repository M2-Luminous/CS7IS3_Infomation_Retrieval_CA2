Liu Guoyu, member of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and commander of the provincial military district, attended and addressed the meeting. In his speech, Liu Guoyu said that the protection of military facilities involves military and civilian interests and requires better cooperation on both sides. All kinds of interests should be correctly handled. Leading groups in charge of military facilities should carry out their responsibility to protect military facilities. Regions without these leading groups should form such groups as soon as possible according to the relevant documents and should maintain relative stability among their personnel. Towns, townships, and villages where military facilities are situated, as well as enterprises, institutions, and mass organizations near military facilities should, coordinated by the local People's Armed Forces departments and public security departments, form backbone contingents with grass-roots-level cadres and militiamen as the main component and should mobilize and rely on the masses to form a defense network comprising soldiers, policemen, and civilians. They should form organizations, work out plans, and frequently supervise the implementation of these plans. The relevant military departments and People's Armed Forces departments should sign contracts with the protectors on protecting military facilities and clarifying their duties and responsibilities. Organizations in charge of military facilities should take the lead in studying and enforcing the law and should, according to legal standards and procedures, handle problems arising in the protection of military facilities so that the protection of military facilities can be carried out under the legal system. Vice Governor Su Xiaoyun presented a written speech to the meeting.
