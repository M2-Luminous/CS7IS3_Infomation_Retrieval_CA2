No one has ever questioned Walesa's visit to the summit in Prague. Poland will never seek any other defense unions, including bilateral ones. This information was conveyed to journalists by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski following the Cabinet of Ministers meeting on 10 January, attended by Walesa and legislators responsible for foreign policy issues. The president left the government building without making any comments to the press. The Council of Ministers instructed the prime minister to accept the "Partnership for Peace" initiative; however, the final decision will not be adopted until all relevant documents are made public. The ministers of defense and foreign affairs will conduct a thorough analysis of those documents. In the opinion of Andrzej Olechowski, the Polish Government described Clinton's recent statements, including the affirmation of U.S. presence in Europe, NATO openness for new members (as a result of evolution), "Partnership for Peace," and the definition of new relations between the West European Union and NATO, as too small a step in the right direction. Walesa said that "if you make too small a step over the creek, you might fall into it." Polish politicians believe that Western proposals for admitting new members to NATO lack a timetable and conditions for admission. At the same time, they emphasize that Poland's strategic goal is NATO membership. Minister Olechowski said that it is better to be in the waiting room than to wait outside. While the doors to NATO have been closed until recently, the minister thinks that we have now found ourselves in the waiting room. Meeting with journalists, Olechowski equated the situation to "engagement with a girl who agreed yesterday to marry us" but didn't say when. He also disagreed with journalists who said Poland stands no chance of being admitted to the bloc. Asked about the Visegrad Group summit beginning today in Prague, the minister stressed that the stance of its members on the NATO issue is almost identical. "The differences can be compared to those between synonymous words." The Polish minister is optimistic about the readiness of our country to participate in NATO: "In terms of democracy and the development of the military industry, Poland is by no means worse off than Greece was at the time of its admission to the bloc. We should be among the first countries to be admitted."
