Belarusian Prime Minister Bets on Russian Parliament"] [Text] Addressing the closed meeting of the Belarusian parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich explained the situation with regard to the unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary systems. In his view, talks between the two countries' expert groups have reached a stalemate after "Mr. Tulin, deputy Central Bank chairman, Mr. Kazmin, deputy finance minister, and some others revised the documents, a procedure that has entirely distorted the original draft treaty that was to be signed." The issue is, first of all, what the Minsk Government sees as unacceptable demands that the two countries' budgets be merged and that the Belarusian National Bank [BNB] be stripped of its independence. In Mr. Kebich's view, these demands have emerged under pressure from certain deputy factions both at the State Duma and the Federation Council. The general tone of Mr. Kebich's address was nonetheless optimistic. Citing a telephone conversation with his Russian colleague, Viktor Chernomyrdin, he said that "the Russian leaders have expressed their political will and unequivocal desire to sign the document, which discusses setting up a money union, as early as this month." Mr. Kebich said that "according to preliminary forecasts, most political factions and committees at the Russian State Duma support the idea of creating an economic and monetary union of the two Slavic states." On Friday, the Belarusian prime minister had a telephone conversation with Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Russian Federation Council's Financial Committee. According to Mr. Kebich, it was said during the conversation that "regarding the terms set by State Duma and Federation Council factions, all political demands have been withdrawn and will no longer be made." All who did make such political demands, the Belarusian prime minister said, were trying to thwart the signing of the agreement. On Monday, Nikolay Gonchar is expected to arrive in Minsk "to agree on all final stances." Any unification of the two countries' budgets or infringement on the BNB's rights will not be even mentioned in the talks. Inspired by the prospects, the Supreme Soviet has suspended the discussion on Belarus' monetary policy. A paragraph of the draft decree on the subject was planned to set forth that "the sole legal tender in the territory of the Republic" will be the BNB's banknote -- the ill-famed "hare" -- which is currently traded at around 0.15 Russian ruble. Pending news from Moscow, the Supreme Soviet has once again adjourned the session until 29 March.
