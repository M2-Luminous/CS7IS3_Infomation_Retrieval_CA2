In the vast country of Iran, the abundant potential in the industrial, agricultural, developmental, and cultural sectors provides very good conditions for investment in the petrochemical industry. In addition, the existence of vast raw material resources, a market for absorbing the products domestically and abroad, the prospects of the production of an extensive spectrum of products, and finally high technical and economic value are among the important incentives in the development of this industry. For this reason, the petrochemical industry is especially important to the overall economic, social, and cultural development of the country. In connection with the general policies for the development of this industry and related industries, and in harmony with the economic and social goals of the First Five-Year Plan, the Arak Petrochemical Complex is in the final stages of completion and becoming operational. The operation of this large complex will mark a new chapter in the industrial self-sufficiency and independence of the country. This complex will make possibile the production of a vast spectrum of petrochemical and chemical products, which are very critical technically, economically, and even strategically. The creation of this complex, which will convert raw petroleum materials into useful materials and is the main source for a great variety of petrochemical products, is a pivotal point in this industry. We congratulate the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, the honorable president, the committed Muslim employees of the Ministry of Petroleum, and the Muslim and martyr-nurturing people of Iran for the important victory of Islamic Iran in joining the ranks of those who possess the main segment of the petroleum industry. Brief History This project to create Arak Petrochemical has been discussed from 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] on the basis of plans by the National Petrochemical Industries Company to make suitable use of the existing raw materials in Iran, achieve self-sufficiency, meet the increasing demands of the domestic market, and ultimately replace the export of crude oil with the export of petrochemical products. It was placed at the top of the programs of the National Petrochemical Industries Company. Initial studies concerning this project began in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984], and it was ratified by the Supreme Economic Council in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]. After a great deal of effort, in Azar 1364 [22 November-21 December 1985], the first line of credit was opened for the design and engineering of the Alfin Unit, which is the heart of the complex. Subsequently, agreements were signed for the design, engineering, and purchasing of machinery for other units. The task of industrial construction and installation began in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990]. In order to strengthen the financial sources for the project and encourage the people to participate as much as possible in investment in production, while the designing and engineering of the processing units were under way, on 19/01/1366 [8 April 1987], the Arak Petrochemical Company was established, with the participation of the National Petrochemical Industries Company, with 51 percent of the shares, and the Melli Bank of Iran, with 49 percent of the shares. The administration of the project through its final stages and up to full operation was conferred on this company. With the efforts and joint support of the National Petrochemical Industries Company and the Melli Bank of Iran, and the round-the-clock efforts of the employees, by the grace of God, in the second half of 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], operation of the water, electricity, and steam units of the complex began and, subsequently, other service units and the olefin and polyolefin production units reached operation, and we are now witnessing its official inauguration. Geographical Situation The Arak Petrochemical Complex is located next to the Seventh Refinery, at Km 22 on the Arak-Borujerd road, at an elevation of 1,888 [meters] above sea level. Initially, 523 hectares [ha] of land were obtained to create the processing units, the service units, and the general and primary facilities. For the developmental projects and for facilitating access to the road for the loading and unloading of the raw materials and products of the complex, 215 ha west of the complex are being acquired. The main factor in the choice of location is its proximity to the refinery (the main supplier of the complex); access to the network of roads, railroads, and the main natural gas pipeline; and its nearness to the consumer centers for [distribution of] the products. The Units of the Complex The Arak Petrochemical Complex consists of 14 processing units, six secondary service units, 14 general facilities, and integral and general building sections, as described in Chart No. 1.

Auxiliary Service Units These units provide for the operational needs of the complex in terms of water, electricity, steam, compressed air, precision instruments, oxygen, and nitrogen. C. General and Joint Facilities These facilities are designed for the establishment of contact between the processing units and the auxiliary services and for providing the common needs of the units of the entire complex, which include 14 untreated water and supply systems of the complex, a fire department, natural gas fuel, liquid fuel, the collection of excess water and refining of waste water, electricity distribution, a communications network with 1,600 telephones, 140 km of pipelines between units, areas for chemical storage, areas for hydrogen storage, a system for the collection of water from condensation, and the torch system [as published] of the complex. D. General Buildings and Ground Work Since the start of the implementation operations of the complex, ground work and the construction of general buildings have been carried out in the form of dozens of large and small projects by Iranian contractors or in the form of direct government management. The designing and engineering of these projects have been carried out by or under the supervision of the Engineering Affairs of the Arak Petrochemical Company. Their implementation has come under the supervision of the Unit for Overseeing Civic and Ground Work and involves a central workshop, with full equipment for the technical service buildings; a central laboratory; a central office; a restaurant; a prayer hall; four product unit warehouses, which consist of 52,000 square meters; 10 covered warehouses, with 38,000 square meters under construction; a fire department; a plastic bag production unit; a 58-unit guest house inside the complex; 57 three-bedroom residential units; an industrial treatment center; a Melli Bank building; a gasoline station; 40 km of roads inside the complex; the widening of the Arak-Shahr-e Mohajeran road; and putting up a 10-km-long fence around the complex. Raw Materials for the Complex The main supply for the complex is light and heavy naphtha, which will be delivered from the Esfahan and Arak refineries via pipelines to the complex. At the present time, the major portion of the naphtha supply is transported to the complex in tankers from Esfahan. Natural gas is needed in the complex, both as a raw material in the processing units and as a fuel, and is received via the main natural gas pipeline that passes near the complex and is sent through the distribution system to various consumer points. Untreated water needed in the complex is provided from underground reservoirs and from nine wells. Ammonia needed in the complex is procured at the level of 6,000 tons annually from the Shiraz Petrochemical Complex. General Characteristics of the Project In addition to the fact that the most advanced technologies and processing methods will be used in the Arak Petrochemical Complex and the highest standards of design have been used in it, this project has distinct characteristics, which are the result of the latest scientific, technical, and safety innovations and experiences and make the Arak Petrochemical Complex a unique and advanced complex compared to similar complexes in the most advanced countries in the world. The General Characteristics of the Complex Are as Follows Most of the units of the complex use very advanced precision control systems and instruments, called DCS (Distributed Control System), which are computerized, and every unit has an independent control room and a separate computerized control system. Also, in this complex, there are 59 PLCs (Programable Logic Controls). In other words, in terms of control, it is one of the most advanced systems. Very strong, resistant reinforced concrete is used for the passive defense of the whole complex. This concrete is more complicated, both in terms of design and construction, than that used in mixed metal and concrete structures. Connecting the units is a system of underground concrete canals, which in terms of passive defense and also in terms of repairs and aesthetics are very efficient. In terms of the complexity of the work in the complex, the changes in temperature can be considered significant. In the Arak Petrochemical Complex, the temperature changes from -190 degrees C. to 1,650 degrees C. For this reason, it requires various materials with various properties and also requires a very precise control system. The pressure changes in the complex range from 120 times to vacuum [as published]. In terms of the general layout, the complex is very aesthetically designed. The access and main roads are of very modern design and are arranged in the form of boulevards. The very advanced industrial waste water refinery will generate a minimal amount of pollution. The processed water is returned to the cooling towers, and some of it is used for the irrigation of the green areas. In regards to the green areas, in the northern section of the complex, a large number of trees have been planted and are growing well. The complex has one of the most well-equipped stationary and mobile fire extinguishing systems. Method for the Implementation of the Project After the completion of comprehensive marketing studies, in order to determine the spectrum and capacity of needed products and complete the technical and economic feasibility studies for the plan, the need for the clarification of an implementation plan for various stages of the project suitable to the mottos and gains of the magnificent Islamic revolution was noted. In this connection, minimum dependence on foreign countries and maximum use of committed Iranian experts and the implementation of the task at high quality and low cost were given the most prominence. The choice of licenses, the basic engineering and detail work, and the purchasing of goods from abroad under the supervision of petrochemical experts was carried out so that 14 advanced technical licenses and six first-rate technological licenses were obtained for the processing and auxiliary service units, respectively. Agreements were signed with about 15 reputable international companies to obtain licenses, develop designs, provide engineers, and purchase machinery. In all agreements, the preservation of the maximum interests of the company and the maximum transfer of technology have been included. Iranian experts have been overseeing all design, engineering, and purchasing phases. In this regard, these experts have gained valuable experience. The right of arbitration is given to Iranian courts. The right for Iran to create similar units has been safeguarded. The guarantee to provide spare parts for a period of 10 years is conferred on the contractor. The training of Iranian personnel in similar units of the contractors has been included in order to ensure readiness for operation. To guarantee the design and quality of manufacture and the dependable operation of the equipment sold, the design contractors and manufacturing companies or sellers of the equipment are responsible to supervise the installation and start of operations. The standards and technical specifications needed have been drawn up, and the contractor is obliged to observe them for purposes of coordination. All the purchased equipment weighs 150,000 tons. The technical inspection of the equipment during manufacturing and delivery was carried out by Iranian experts. In special cases, the guarantee for long-term procurement catalysts were obtained. Access to advanced technology by those who offer it is included for the long term. Installation and Construction To complete the installation and construction of the complex, it was decided to grant the construction of six production units and all the auxiliary service units in addition to the general and common facilities to foreign contractors. To implement this decision, after a study was made of reputable international companies, a short list of those companies that were able to do this work was prepared, and the bid of the Italian company, Filippo Fuki, was accepted, and an agreement was signed. This company was required to use 70 percent of its labor force from the domestic work force, but in practice, 85 percent of its work force has been comprised of domestic workers. In this regard, fortunately, beneficial practical training was carried out. In terms of acquiring skill and technology transfer, Iranians have benefitted significantly in various phases of the installation. In addition to those individuals employed directly by the Fuki Company, a large number of domestic contractors also signed contracts with the above-mentioned company and have been active in the construction of the complex. A list of the contractors is included in Chart No. 2. In addition to the plans to make maximum use of the Iranian work force, the decision was made to make use of the resources of large contracting companies in Iran, to which end the installation of five production units and some of the work of auxiliary service units and general and common facilities also were conferred on domestic contractors. In this connection, the Tehran Jonub, Namgan, and Ramsaz Companies have had the greatest share. As the work progressed, the contract with the Tehran Jonub Company was terminated; other companies replaced it; and work continued under the direct management of the Arak Petrochemical Company. All the general work and construction has been conferred on domestic contractors or carried out by the government under the direct supervision of the Arak Petrochemical Company. In this regard, about 350 large and small Iranian companies have been used. The designing of all offices and auxiliary buildings of the complex, such the central workshop, the central laboratory, the warehouses, the technical service buildings, and so on, has been done by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company. In order to reduce foreign currency expenditures, in the course of the project, some of the work with foreign contractors has been cancelled and conferred on Iranian contractors. In total, at the height of the work on this complex, the work force consisted of 13,000 persons, 1,000 of them foreigners and 12,000 Iranians. Start-Up and Operation The start-up and operation of this complex has been handled totally by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company. The presence of a minimum number of representatives of the owner of the license and the designing contractor alongside the operating personnel has been projected to carry out the guarantee of the operators, as reflected in the contract. In keeping with the progress of the installation work, operation personnel were hired, and the related organization was prepared. The safe and uneventful start-up of the processing and service units of this large complex, including the very sensitive olefin unit, at the hands of domestic forces who have had no experience in this area is a proud golden leaf in the petrochemical industry and the entire country. The operational personnel have acquired the necessary training in several phases. The Financial Status of the Project A. Investment Investments in this project are as follows: - Cash investments, 300 billion rials [R] - Funds from the Melli Bank, R200 billion - International funds from the National Petrochemical Industries Company, R740 billion - Needed through banking funds or the sale of material, R260 billion - Total, R1500 billion - Of this amount, about $2 billion has been in foreign currency and the remainder in rials B. Economic Return On the whole, investments in petrochemical industries have a high rate of return. In this complex, as well, calculating the price of the import sales in recent years and the actual foreign currency rate, calculating the international price for supplies and consumption, the economic indicators are summarized as follows: - Level of sales (with 100 percent production), R554 billion - Level of profit, R186 billion - Ratio of profit to cash investment, 66 percent - Ratio of profit to total investment, 13 percent - Rate of domestic return, 32 percent C. Important Gains of the Implementation of the Project Foreign currency conservation. The creation of jobs. The training and transfer of technology, self-sufficiency, and economic independence. The added value and growth of national revenues. Training During Design and Engineering - Specialized training and active participation in the supervision, engineering, and basic and detailed design of the units, 136 persons (1,354 persons [per] month) abroad [as published]. - Training of personnel in engineering, estimating, planning, managing, and provisional work, 75 persons [per] month abroad. - Training of more than 2,355 engineers, senior technicians, and skilled workers during construction and installation and the use of their expertise during the implementation of the project. Training has been generally on-the-job, and ultimately the skill of the individual has been emphasized, which in practice has resulted in the reduction of foreign manpower. Also, training in welding, especially practical and theoretical training, has been provided, and ultimately the trainees have received certificates to perform the work according to international standards. Training of Employees for the Operational Period - On-the-job training in the complex, 522 persons [per] month. - Training of engineers, senior technicians, and technicians in the complex and other training centers, such as the petrochemical complexes, refineries, power plants, universities, and other research centers, for the operational units of the complex. - Training abroad for the employees of the operational units to familiarize them with the units that have been installed in the complex, 182 persons and 490 persons [per] month [as published]. Housing Manufacturing Projects The Arak Petrochemical Company, in conformity with the policy of the Ministry of Petroleum and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in order to reduce the pressures of housing demands and also to provide relative comfort and absorption of expert forces, is preparing a large employee housing construction project. In this connection, 18 apartment units and a complex of 120 unfinished apartments were purchased from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development in the city of Arak and are now being used. For the residences of foreign and domestic experts, 57 housing units have been built in the complex and are being used. The next phase is the Gerdu Township Project, which is for company experts in the city of Arak. The land has been acquired through the Urban Developmental Organization, and 104 apartment units have been built on it. But the company's main plan in the area of providing housing for the employees is the large housing manufacturing project in the city of Mohajeran, which is located on Km 28 of the Arak-Borujerd road. This large project includes 984 apartment units, 1,531 residential units (a total of 2,515 units), and a large number of secondary buildings, such as mosques, schools, educational space, commercial centers, motels, clubs, athletic and recreational facilities, a covered pool, clinics, and water treatment plants. Of the residential units, so far 500 units have been completed, occasionally by employees, and the rest are about to be completed. Auxiliary construction in the city of Mohajeran includes: - Two motels, which are operating - A mosque, an athletic hall, stores, a market, and a treatment center - Seven educational units, of which an elementary and a junior high school are operating - Water, electricity, sewage networks, construction of open areas, streets, etc. - The total area under construction for residential units and auxiliary construction of the city of Mohajeran: 520,000 square meters. - Products of the complex going to the major consumer markets are specified in Charts No. 2 and 3.
