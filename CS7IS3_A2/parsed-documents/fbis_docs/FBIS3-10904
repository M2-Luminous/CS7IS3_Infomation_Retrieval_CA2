Some people believe Cuba's isolation has hurt the Cuban people. What chances are there of resuming diplomatic relations with Bolivia and of establishing relations, at an ambassadorial level, with Cuba? [Figueroa] I believe the first consideration in diplomatic relations are Chilean interests. Chile maintains relations with those countries that can help us to attain the political-economic objectives we seek. This must be considered when thinking about resuming relations. In the case of Bolivia, they broke relations with Chile, therefore, it is up to them to resume relations. In the case of Bolivia there is a climate of confidence, friendship, and even an economic cooperation agreement with that country. There are physical integration projects involving highways, port facilities, etc., that reveal the existence of a very good relationship between Chile and Bolivia at this moment. Let us hope it will lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations. We maintain relations at a consular level with Cuba. We maintain commercial relations. Chilean businessmen are investing in Cuba and this must be considered when deciding to step up relations to an ambassadorial level, because a relationship does exist, as I have pointed out, at a consular level.
