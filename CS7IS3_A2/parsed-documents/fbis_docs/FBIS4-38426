In addition the government is preparing some 20 programs to resolve several key problems in industry. This was reported to Interfax by the head of the presidential staff Sergey Filatov. According to him, presidential programs concern primarily health and environmental protection. The medical industry must be promoted, in particular the production of insulin and protein for the food industry. Another program provides for the transition to energy-consuming technologies in different branches of the economy, including the auto industry. Filatov stressed that the implementation of this important program will give a new impetus to Russian engineering. He said things have gone to a point when Russian vehicles are not permitted to Europe because they do not meet international environmental safety norms. Filatov also hopes that the planned reduction of the consumption of gasoline and gas will considerably improve transport energy supplies. A public telephone program, Filatov said, will help radically improve communications in rural areas as well as cities. Some of the new programs provide for the development of natural resources, in particular new deposits in Tyumen and the Barents sea, the expansion of the transport network and others.
