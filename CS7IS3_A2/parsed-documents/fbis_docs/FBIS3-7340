Each time, however, they suffered a stern punishment. They, failing to draw a lesson from the sinking of their pirate ship "General Sherman" in the river Taedong in 1866, started a surprise attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25, 1950 after watching for a chance. In an attempt to gratify their sinister ambition for aggression at any cost, they hurled into the Korean war one third of their Army armed with latest-type equipment, one fifth of their Air Force, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet, soldiers of their 15 satellite states and the South Korean puppet army, more than two million strong, huge combat technical equipment and 73 million tons of war supplies. The aggressors, however, met head-on hammer blows of the Korean people. In the Korean war they lost 1,567,000 effectives including 405,000 GIs, 12,200 planes, 3,250 tanks and armoured vehicles, 560 warships and many other combat technical equipment. On July 27, 1953, the U.S. imperialist aggressors signed the armistice agreement before the flag of the DPRK, surrendering to the Korean people. This was their first ignominious defeat in their 100-year-long history of wars of aggression. The case of the spy ship "Pueblo" in January, 1968, was another provocation committed by the U.S. imperialists, forgetting the lesson of their defeat. When the armed spy ship was apprehended by the DPRK after intruding into its territorial waters to infringe upon its sovereignty, they drove the situation to the brink of war, threatening that they would "bombard" and "blockade" ports of the DPRK as "retaliatory steps." At that moment, all the Korean people and People's Army manifested their unswerving will to answer a "retaliation" with a retaliation, a "total war" with a total war. To meet the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the People's Army soldiers took their positions and the entire working people wrought miracles in production and construction with a rifle in one hand and a sickle or a hammer in the other, demonstrating the mettle of the Korean people. The U.S. imperialists who were threatening an immediate war succumbed to the Korean people, who rose up like a mountain. On December 23, they came out with a white flag to the conference room in Panmunjom where they had signed the armistice agreement, admitted their criminal act concerning the ship "Pueblo" case and apologized to the Korean people for it and signed the surrender document promising not to commit such provocation again. They, however, infiltrated an EC-121 large reconnaissance plane into the air space of the DPRK on April 15, 1969 only to suffer a serious defeat under the eyes of the world. The Korean people are an indomitable people who have never pardoned the provokers. The provokers must draw a lesson from their defeat.
