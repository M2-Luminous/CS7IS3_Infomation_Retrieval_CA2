FR940912-0-00003 FR940912-0-00002 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 945 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;945&hyph;2FR] Irish Potatoes Grown in Certain Designated Counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and Imported Irish Potatoes; Modification of Minimum Size Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule modifies the minimum size requirements for all varieties of potatoes, except round reds, grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and for imported long type potatoes. Currently, the minimum size requirement for all varieties, except round reds, is 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. This rule specifies that, in addition, at least 40 percent of the potatoes in each lot, by weight, must be 5 ounces or heavier. Requiring handlers to ship heavier potatoes should correct a marketing problem by providing the heavier potatoes demanded by the market and increase returns to producers and handlers. As provided under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the changes will also apply to imported potatoes. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary D. Olson, Northwest Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1220 SW Third Avenue, Room 369, Portland, OR 97204; telephone: (503) 326&hyph;2724 or Fax (503) 326&hyph;7440; or Valerie L. Emmer, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 205&hyph;2829 or Fax (202) 720&hyph;5698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945 [7 CFR part 945], as amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``order,'' regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' This final rule, which also affects the import requirements for long type Irish potatoes, is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act. The provisions of section 8e and the potato import regulation are discussed later in this final rule. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is not filed later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.
