Specifically, it is proposed to transfer the FCS Counterintelligence Operations Directorate to the Ministry of Justice, transforming it into a Federal Bureau of Investigations. The Economic Counterintelligence Directorate and the Directorate for Guaranteeing Security at Strategically Important Industrial Facilities would be rendered subordinate to the Ministry of the Economy, while military counterintelligence would be placed under the wings of the General Staff as an autonomous directorate. The fight against terrorism will switch to the competence of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The author of the plan for eliminating the FCS is a member of the Security Council. Our correspondent met with new FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin and asked him to explain his future plans at this post. The FCS chief reported that very soon he will hold a meeting with the Russian president. He did not deny reports that Boris Yeltsin has been in receipt of suggestions for reorganizing this service, including transferring its powers to other departments. "If these suggestions are implemented, the security organs will be dealt a major blow. I am categorically against this, and I am against anybody who puts such suggestions forward. It is necessary to ponder why they are doing this. I am deeply convinced that Russia and the president need strong secret services. And it is this stance which I will be defending at the meeting with Yelstin," Stepashin declared.
