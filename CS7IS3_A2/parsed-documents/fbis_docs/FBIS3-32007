Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Santillo and Cuban Health Vice Minister Jose Ignacio Goicoechea on 26 January signed a contract for the supply of 40 different types of medicines during the next four months. The operation is worth $30 million and will include diverse medicines -- antibiotics, pain relievers, collyriums, anesthetics, and blood pressure regulators -- that will be supplied to the public system for three months. A clause in the contract says the Brazilian Government is authorized to retain a sum of money -- the amount has not been specified yet -- to serve as compensation for part of the total Cuban debt. The sources said the amount to be withheld will depend on a Brazilian Planning Ministry evaluation of the rules on foreign credit. Brazil [as received] committed itself to pay the rest of the money in two installments. According to official sources, Cuba owes Brazil about $10 million, although in August 1993 it reached $6.5 million. Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila, who is responsible for his country's economic policies, will make an official visit to Brazil between 2 and 7 February. During his visit, Lage will meet President Itamar Franco. The Cuban vice president will meet government officials and representatives of the Brazilian private sector to promote the strengthening of economic and commercial relations between the two countries.
