Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that the premier told cabinet members he had compared notes on the nuclear threat from North Korea with visiting South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. He also said Tokyo has been discussing the issue with Washington, the top government spokesman said. But Hosokawa said it will take time before the government decides on its own policy to help resolve the North Korea issue. Meanwhile, Takemura welcomed Russia's proposal to hold an international conference on Pyongyang's nuclear program, adding that Tokyo will seek further information about the proposal from Moscow. Russia on Thursday proposed the holding of an international parley on the issue, saying it should be attended by Russia, China, the U.S., Japan, and North and South Korea, as well as representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations secretary general.
