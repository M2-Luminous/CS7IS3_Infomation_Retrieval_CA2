He delivered Kim's remarks in his talks with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu after his arrival from Pyongyang, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Han was quoted as telling him that the North Korea-U.S. talks should be consulted between Seoul and Washington after the two countries confirm North Korea's true intentions. Carter explained that reports about him telling Kim Il-song that the United States stopped discussing sanctions against North Korea was a result of misinterpretation, saying he meant the sanctions will be temporarily suspended on condition that the nuclear suspicion is resolved. The ex-president and his wife returned to Seoul after a four-day visit to North Korea where he met twice with the senior Kim for extensive talks on the nuclear problem. He came back with a message that Kim wants to directly meet South Korean President Kim Yong-sam "without any delay." Meanwhile, Carter said he tried to meet also with Kim Il-song's heir-apparent son Kim Chong-il during his trip but was denied. A South Korean official said Carter asked several times that he be able to meet junior Kim through North Korean officials but was refused, being told that Kim Chong-il did not have time.
