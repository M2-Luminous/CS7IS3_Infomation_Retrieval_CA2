FBIS3-49354 "dreeu006__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-006-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Press Reaction Reported AU0801211094 Sofia BTA in English 1731 GMT 8 Jan 94 AU0801211094 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [From BTA press review] [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- The dailies frontpage comments on the reaction of different officials and institutions to yesterday's reports in some newspapers, according to which President Zhelyu Zhelev issued an express decree and a letter, allegedly intending to take over direct command of the Bulgarian Army. The Socialists' DUMA writes that Chief of General Staff Army General Lyuben Petrov took a "sharp and firm" stand against the powers vested under the letter to the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff in the chief of the president's military office and his advisors to supervise the General Staff and have access to operational information even over the head of the General Staff. According to unnamed former military, the document suggested an attempt to shape the military office as a supervisory body with respect to the Defence Ministry, the General Staff and the Army as a whole, the newspaper adds. , OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes a "well-informed source in the office of the president" as alleging that the media attack against Dr. Zhelev is the latest in a series of machinations by General Stoyan Andreev, Dr. Zhelev's former national security advisor. The fuss may have originated from the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] headquarters and was intended as a blow at the president, according to "knowledgeable" sources quoted in the trade union daily PODKREPA. "Socialists, Zhelev conspired in gaffe of president-requested powers for military office. General Lyuben Petrov knew about bid to parallel General Staff, but denies it. Presidential advisors expected to resign," reads the heading of the story in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). 24 CHASA headlines its coverage "Parliament at War With Zhelev." "The (anti- communist) SDS will probably side with the (ex-communist) Bulgarian Socialist Party against Zhelev," the daily writes editorially. The president's decree and letter occasioned the meeting between SDS leader Filip Dimitrov and BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov a couple of days ago, Mr. Videnov admits in an interview for KONTINENT. "Politicians, experts say documents on president's military office are unconstitutional," runs the headline of another story in the same daily. "This is the latest attempt to destabilize the situation in the country," says the chief of the president's military office General Stefan Dimitrov, interviewed for 24 CHASA. He denied that the military office is assigned directive functions with respect to the Army. "The legislative vacuum in the laws on the Armed Forces gives rise to a confusion as to who is subordinated to whom," STANDART NEWS observes. "I admit that I was over- credulous and, together with General Petrov, I signed a directive to the commanders to assist the implementation of the president's letter," Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov is quoted as saying in TRUD. "How will the president of the republic get out of the mess in which he was involved by his military advisors?" asks TRUD in an editorial commentary.
