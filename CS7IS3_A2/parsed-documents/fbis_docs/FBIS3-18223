Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said at the federal news conference in Bonn on Monday [28 February] that the Federal Government is confident "that it will really not be stopped." The four aircraft downed by NATO F-16 planes had clearly violated the flight ban imposed by the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Vogel stressed that the invading aircraft had been warned twice. They ignored the warnings. Only then was were they fired on. According to all facts that have become known so far, NATO adhered to the instructions and rules that are laid down in UN Resolution 816. According to it, all necessary means to implement the flight ban are permitted. In this respect, NATO's course of action is a "bitter, but necessary and resolute conclusion of the behavior of the pilots who were subsequently downed," he said. A Defense Ministry spokesman reported that German officers had, as usual, been in the AWACS reconnaissance aircraft that guided the NATO planes to their operational positions. The operation is legally permitted by the Constitutional Court ruling of 8 April last year. The ruling covers both reconnaissance and the control of the fighter aircraft, it was stated.
