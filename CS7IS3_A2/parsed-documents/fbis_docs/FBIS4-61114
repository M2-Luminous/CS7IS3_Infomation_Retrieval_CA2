Deputies Hasten To Take President Under Control"] [Text] Further work on the draft law "On the State of Emergency" started yesterday in two State Duma committees -- on security and on legislation. The final version of the draft law should be ready and put before the lower chamber of parliament before 15 May. At the moment, there are two variants of the law "On the State of Emergency." Distinctions between the two (the first one was proposed by Deputy Viktor Mironov and dubbed the "Internal Affairs Ministry variant;" the second one is known as the "committees' variant) are not so great, neither do they differ much from the RSFSR law "On the State of Emergency" signed by Boris Yeltsin on 17 May 1991. There is, however, one important distinction, but it is provided for in the Russian Constitution: Whereas in the past a state of emergency could be imposed both by an edict of the president of Russia (with consent from the Supreme Soviet) and by an edict of the Supreme Soviet presidium (with an immediate notification of the president), now, in line with the Constitution, a state of emergency shall be imposed only by the president's edict. This edict shall subsequently be approved by the Federation Council. The "Internal Affairs Ministry variant" defines in more clear terms the forces and means brought into play to make a state of emergency hold. First and foremost these are territorial internal affairs organs and armed forces stationed on that territory. It is also supposed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Counterintelligence Service shall, on the president's decision, be in charge of bringing in additional forces without having to agree this with the federation components' organs of power. Army units from other regions can be introduced in exceptional cases and on the president's decision alone. In the parliamentary committees they are more worried over how to monitor the observance of laws during a state of emergency. Article 37 of the draft law says that the Federation Council and the commission to be formed by it shall, throughout the period the state of emergency is in effect, monitor the observance of laws and conduct inspections of corresponding territories. As regards the circumstances and the list of measures to be applied under a state of emergency, they are virtually the same as in the 1991 law. The grounds for imposing a state of emergency are divided into two groups. The first includes attempts to change the constitutional system, mass disturbances accompanied by violence, and interethnic conflicts. The second one includes natural disasters, epidemics, and major accidents. Like in the previous law, a state of emergency cannot be in effect for more than 30 days if it is imposed over the entire territory of Russia, and more than 60 days if imposed over part of the country's territory. There are no serious differences in the drafts. Why such a hurry to pass the new law? Members of the committees must fear that now that the former law is only partially effective, there may arise a situation where a state of emergency is imposed without sufficient legal grounds and parliament would be able neither to prevent its imposition nor exercise control over the observance of law on the territory affected by the state of emergency.
