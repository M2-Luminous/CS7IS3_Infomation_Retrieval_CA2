He will deliver a lecture at the French International Relations Institute. He discusses here the misunderstandings that have disrupted Franco-German relations in recent weeks. [Debove] What is the state of relations between Bonn and Paris following the misunderstandings of recent weeks? Are there still problems? [Kinkel] Things must be put into perspective. I dispute the fact that there have been serious disagreements between Bonn and Paris. The French ambassador in Bonn had an unofficial meeting with the press. That prompted some irritation in Germany but this has meanwhile been cleared up. I had a detailed discussion with Alain Juppe, my counterpart, who is a friend; we both published communiques; the French ambassador amended his remarks; and I am now pleased to be going to Paris on Thursday for a visit agreed upon a long time ago. Contacts between the two countries are so diverse, close, and natural that even differing opinions on some questions -- such things happen to the best couples -- could not undermine the excellent bases of our relationship. [Debove] However, there are minor tensions, for instance with regard to the commemoration of the 6 June landing.... [Kinkel] Yes, this subject is playing a role, at least in the press in the two countries. But since 1945, France and Germany have always managed to commemorate with dignity the important dates of their common history. I will mention the meeting between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in Reims cathedral in 1963 and the joint commemoration which was attended by President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl at the Verdun cemetery in September 1984. There is no doubt in my mind that the French and Germans will also be able to celebrate in an appropriate way the end of World War II and Germany's return to the community of democratic states. [Debove] There sometimes seem to be disagreements between Paris and Bonn on the question of the expansion and deepening of the European Union. [Kinkel] I do not see things in that way. We think that expansion and deepening are necessary. Indeed, there are different concepts on this subject within the European Union -- but not between France and Germany. [Debove] Is the Franco-German couple still the driving force of European building? [Kinkel] After extremely difficult years, Germany and France have managed to establish preferential friendly relations and have been and will remain the driving force of European unification. As I have already said in the past, when France and Germany cooperate closely in Europe many things work; if France and Germany do not agree, many things do not work. Franco-German relations have an essential importance for Europe and that must continue. I am deeply convinced of that and, since I have been foreign minister, I have personally contributed to realizing that objective by working for it in a practical way. The good relations with my French counterparts, first Roland Dumas and now Alain Juppe, have also had very positive effects in that way. We must ensure that there is not the slightest cloud over Franco- German relations. [Debove] Do you think that expansion has not changed that at all? [Kinkel] No. The expansion to four EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries was decided jointly by the Twelve. I observed that, throughout the negotiations, France and Germany were always on the same side. There were therefore no problems between France and Germany in the negotiations on expansion, and we should not allow anybody to make us doubt that. [Debove] Does that mean that we do not talk with each other enough? [Kinkel] No. With regard to contacts between ministers, we have very close relations. That was the case between Roland Dumas and me. It is also true of the federal chancellor and other colleagues. We have jointly launched many common actions. I am thinking, for instance, of the Juppe-Kinkel initiative on Yugoslavia and our trilateral talks with Poland. I am thinking of what Alain Juppe and I have acheived together with regard to an association between the Central and East European countries and the WEU [Western European Union]. At the level of experts, we have set up a joint working group on European questions, which has already met nine times. We must not allow people to make us believe that there is irritation which does not really exist in Franco- German relations. When we had differences of opinion on the subject of the Uruguay Round in the GATT framework or on the subject of the EMS [European Monetary System], I constantly pointed out that even good friends can sometimes face problems and have differing views on some subjects. That is not worrying in the least; you just have to discuss the matter calmly, and that is what we did. France was able to rely fully on Germany's solidarity, especially on the difficult issues of recent times. And vice versa. From our viewpoint, for instance, France's attitude with regard to the question of Germany's seat on the (UN) Security Council and the support it gave us on the question of the European Central Bank played an important role. [Debove] What will the next joint approaches be? [Kinkel] One of the most difficult questions that Europe will have to settle will be that of the Central and East European countries' rapprochement with the European Union. As in the past, Franco-German relations will play an absolutely decisive role in the success of this process. And I will suggest to Alain Juppe, my counterpart, that we cooperate particularly closely in this sphere. The French side has the greatest interest in the situation in the Maghreb. I will suggest mobilizing to clearly show that we are making a special commitment with regard to that region. On the continuation of the resolution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, France and Germany will in the future have to continue to cooperate closely as they have done so far, and I am sure that this will happen. [Debove] Following the Juppe-Kinkel initiative, should we not fear the establishment of a pax americana? [Kinkel] I think that Alain Juppe, like me, was grateful to the Americans for becoming more involved in the Yugoslav question. France has shown an absolutely remarkable involvement in the former Yugoslavia. It has deployed more than 6,000 soldiers there and has taken a very courageous attitude, with the president at its head. The Washington agreement really cannot be described as a pax americana. It is clear that in drawing up this agreement, the European action plan based on the Juppe-Kinkel initiative played an absolutely decisive role, and tribute was expressly paid to it during the signing in Washington. [Debove] Will the transfer of the seat of government to Berlin be the sign of a change in Germany's foreign policy? [Kinkel] The revolutionary upheavals in Central and East Europe and in the former Soviet Union, from which Germany benefited most through reunification, have led to changes in Europe which have naturally also led to changes in German policy. But I think that we have succeeded in not giving the impression that we have even the slightest intention of leaving the European Community's framework of interests in any way at all or abandoning the preferential relations between Germany and France. Quite the reverse. We still want to show restraint in our foreign policy, especially after reunification, which was only possible thanks to France and our European partners. Our aim is not to secure any prerogative or any predominant position, but we want to remain integrated in the European Community of interests, in which Franco-German relations are and remain of special importance.
