The purpose of the 45-minute meeting was to brief Kliridhis on the Vienna talks at which the United Nations gave clarifications to the Turkish side. Answering questions afterward, Feissel said he had prepared his report to the secretary general but avoided saying whether he had already submitted it. Asked if the report contains any ambiguities, Feissel said he does not usually repeat himself. He added, however, that the content of the report to be submitted to the Security Council is up to the secretary general, just as the decision is up to the Security Council. Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said after the meeting that from the briefing it followed that there is no prospect for a change in the Turkish stance and that the UN efforts for the confidence-building measures have failed.
