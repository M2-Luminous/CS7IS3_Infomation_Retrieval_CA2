At the same time, Russia's chief diplomat continued, it is impossible to agree with the logic of increasing NATO air strikes in so far as this would run the risk of an escalation. It would be a mistake on the part of NATO and the Western states to make a decision on the possibility of further military escalation without at least simultaneously having a coordinated political approach. Now, more than ever before, Kozyrev emphasized, the time has come for Russia, the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union to work out a joint political stance before the conflicting sides, so that they are left with no doubts reagarding the need to come to an agreement instead of going from one crisis to another. At the same time, the Serbian side must understand that each step along the path of a comprehensive cessation of hostilities will be accompanied by a corresponding lifting of sanctions.
