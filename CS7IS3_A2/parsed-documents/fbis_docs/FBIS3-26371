In the report, the mayor expounded the guiding ideology for the Shanghai government's legislation work in the next few years, its work target, and main tasks. Huang Ju said: Our basic principle for doing various fields of work in Shanghai is to take reform as the motive force, development as the target, make stability the foundation, and legislation serve as the guarantee. He said: With the further deepening of reform, economic construction in Shanghai has been upgraded to a new level. As laws are the guarantee for the operation of a modern market economy, we should begin from a high starting point to undertake a project for securing Shanghai's socialist market economic structure. Huang Ju stressed: To carry out this "guarantee project," we must concentrate on three tasks. This means we must draw up a plan, establish standards for 10 areas of work, and fulfill the tasks of drafting approximately 100 laws and regulations, enacting them, and revising them each year. This year, Shanghai will draw up a fairly scientific and feasible government economic legislation plan suitable to the establishment of a socialist economic market structure, and strengthen overall guidance and coordination in connection with this plan. The standards for the 10 areas of work are: 1) The establishment of a modern enterprise system and adjustment of the relationship among the main bodies in the market; 2) the administration and management of state-owned assets; 3) cultivating and developing all types of commodity markets and markets for production elements; 4) improving and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, and promoting coordinated development of the economy; 5) establishing a rational individual income distribution system and improving the social security system; 6) opening wider to the outside world and utilizing foreign capital; 7) accelerating the opening up and development of the Pudong New District; 8) developing and administering the markets intermediate organizations; 9) accelerating urban construction and strengthening urban administration; and 10) developing and administering such social undertakings as science, technology, education, culture, and public health. Huang Ju pointed out: To strengthen the building of a legal system by the government, we must handle the following four relationships well: First, we must handle the relationship between legislation and administrative law-enforcement well. Legislation and law enforcement must not be separated because they form an entity. While stepping up legislation work, the government must concentrate on administrative law enforcement and overcome the failure to abide by the law, lax law enforcement, and letting law-breakers go free. Second, we must handle the relationship between transforming government functions and strengthening government law institutions well. Third, we must handle the relationship between government law administrative work and the launching of theoretical research on the government's legal system. We should take advantage of Shanghai's superiority in professional personnel to conduct a study and exploration with the help of experts and scholars to determine what problems need urgent solution in the course of Shanghai's reform and opening to the outside world. Fourth, we must handle the relationship between legal work and other government work well. In carrying out government legal work, it is necessary to listen to opinions from all quarters, and to fully embody and reflect the will of the people to find a new way of conducting government-level work by relying on social forces. Huang Ju said: In carrying out government legal work, such as the drawing of legislation plans, studying of problems, and exposition of laws and regulations, it is necessary to give full play to the role of experts. He said he welcomes more experts to participate in government legislation work. The conference was presided over by Vice Mayor Xu Kuangdi. He set some requirements for implementing the guidelines of the conference and for further strengthening government legislation work. Xie Tianfang, director of the Office of Legal System under the municipal government, delivered a speech on the government's legislation tasks and legislation plans for 1994. Shi Zhusan, vice chairman of of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the conference.
