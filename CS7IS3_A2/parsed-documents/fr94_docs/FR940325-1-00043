FR940325-1-00043 FR940325-1-00008 In addition to this proposed rule, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as a cooperating agency, have prepared a draft EIS. The draft EIS is currently being printed and prepared for distribution, but advance copies are available for public review at the Department of the Interior Library, First Floor, 18th and C Streets NW, Washington, DC. Notice of availability of the draft EIS will be made through a separate publication in the Federal Register . The draft EIS analyzes in detail the proposed action and alternatives for improving the management of the Nation's public rangelands, including regulatory changes proposed in this rule. The draft EIS also invites public comment. Rangeland Reform '94 Rangeland Reform '94 is a proposal developed by the Department of the Interior through BLM, in close cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service, for effecting fundamental policy changes, including adjustment of the Federal grazing fee, in its rangeland management program. The purpose of the proposed changes is to make the BLM's rangeland management program more consistent with ecosystem management, to accelerate restoration and improvement of the public rangelands, to obtain for the public fair and reasonable compensation for the grazing of livestock on public lands, and to streamline certain administrative functions. As a result of public input on the initial proposal, and as a result of the BLM's preliminary analysis of rangeland reform, two additional goals have been included: to provide a mechanism for effective public participation in decisionmaking, and to focus Federal and non-Federal management efforts where they will result in the greatest benefit. In achieving these goals the Department also intends to make BLM's administration of livestock grazing more consistent with that of the Forest Service. There are five major categories of proposed management actions addressed in Rangeland Reform '94. These categories are (1) The Federal grazing fee and associated incentives, (2) effective public participation in rangeland management, (3) administrative practices, (4) range improvements and water rights, and (5) resource management requirements, including standards and guidelines. Proposed actions within each of these categories are discussed in detail elsewhere in this proposed rule. Public Comment on the Initial Proposal A total of about 12,600 letters were received from about 8,000 persons on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, notice of intent to prepare an EIS, and the Rangeland Reform '94 summary booklet. These letters included over 56,000 individual comments. The specific aspects of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking generating the most comments were the grazing fee and water rights associated with range improvement projects. Initial proposals related to affected interests, grazing advisory boards, grazing permit and lease tenure, unauthorized subleasing, standards and guidelines and full force and effect also generated a great number of comments. Many letters expressed opinions that the overall rangeland reform proposal was a disincentive for good stewardship, would have major economic impacts on rural western communities, and would result in the ``taking'' of private property rights. A great number of comments supported the identified need for consistency between regulations of the BLM and the Forest Service. At the invitation of Colorado's Governor Roy Romer, Secretary Babbitt met on nine separate occasions with a group of State and local officials, ranchers, conservationists and other land users in Denver and Gunnison, Colorado, for discussions regarding a process for building a consensus-driven local approach to rangeland management. The Colorado Working Group also made suggestions to change or improve the advance Rangeland Reform '94 proposal introduced in August, 1993. Similar meetings and follow-up discussions were held in Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada, in addition to meetings in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. These meetings with the Secretary involved hundreds of hours of discussion. Input from these meetings resulted in many of the changes and clarifications made in this proposed rule. As a result of public comment the Department has made a number of changes in the initial proposal. An attempt has been made to identify the most substantial changes in the section-by-section analysis provided in this proposed rule.
