This was made possible only after the Russian Central Electoral Commission provided an explanation of the elections, according to which the ballot is deemed valid if no fewer than 25 percent of voters turn out. Irkutsk used to have an electoral statute, according to which the figure -- set by the Siberians themselves -- was 35 percent. If that had been the case, the 27 March elections would have had to be declared invalid in several constituencies.
