Filimonov from the Tyumen affiliate of RASI; date not given: "Will the Law on Northerners Work?"] [Text] The commonly used name for the Law On Northerners is obviously an abbreviated title. The full title of the law is "On State Guarantees and Compensatory Benefits for Individuals Working and Living in Regions of the Far North and Locations of Equivalent Status." This law, which was passed at the insistence of trade unions a year ago, just last April, and which went into force on 1 June 1993, is still not working. The government immediately suspended almost 20 of its main sections because of insufficient funds. The funds are still lacking.... The Northerners are understandably upset. So are the trade unions. Another regional trade-union conference on the social and economic problems of the North, the fourth of these conferences, was held in Moscow at the end of March. The topic of discussion is always the same--the non-existent guarantees and compensatory benefits. Here is what one conference speaker, Chairman Vladimir Babkin of the oblast trade-union council, had to say. [Filimonov] I know that the law began to be discussed more than three years ago, at the first conference in Murmansk. Later the whole draft law was "composed" in Surgut, at the third conference, in the presence of high-level government officials. Now there has been another conference, but this one was held in Moscow instead of in the North.... Why? [Babkin] At first they wanted to hold the conference in Norilsk, but then they learned that hearings on the northern regions were scheduled for the end of March in the State Duma and make a quick decision to meet in the capital at the time of the hearings. This was done for the purpose of interaction with Duma deputies, but there was also the hope that representatives of the executive branch could also be urged to attend the conference. [Filimonov] Did they? [Babkin] They did not indulge us. Only Deputy Minister V. Kuramin attended. State Duma deputies and members of the Federation Council were present, however, and supported the conference resolutions, which they subsequently used in their work in their own committees and in the Duma hearings. [Filimonov] I would imagine that the deputies who did attend are Northerners themselves. [Babkin] Most of them are. One of them, for example, was Vladimir Gomon, the former mayor of Nadym who is now the deputy chairman of a committee. He has first-hand knowledge of the problems of Northerners and is now solving them in a new capacity. [Filimonov] How was the situation in the North described at the conference? [Babkin] It was called extremely critical, both in the economic and in the social sense. Oil production decreased by one-sixth and capital investments decreased by one-third in just the past year. Production cuts have extended to virtually all of the main fields of production. One out of every three enterprises is operating at a loss. In addition to all of this, there is the problem of non-payments and, consequently, the absence of money for the payment of wages. The personal savings of Northerners have depreciated, and the Northern privileges and compensatory payments are meaningless, because the cost of living in the North is rising each day.... [Filimonov] Especially when this compensation exists only in the form of a written promise.... [Babkin] Yes, especially in view of the fact that it is unavailable. The North is becoming more and more isolated. It is difficult, and just too expensive, for Northerners to travel anywhere else for medical treatment and vacations. The quality of health care and consumer services has declined perceptibly. The diet of Northerners has deteriorated. People are tormented by feelings of insecurity. According to surveys conducted by the Federation of Independent Russian Trade Unions, almost 30 percent of the inhabitants of Northern cities would like to leave them as soon as possible. If it were only that simple.... In short, signs of crisis are present in all spheres of the national economy in the northern regions, they spread more quickly here, and they frequently take the most extreme forms. [Filimonov] In other words, people have no legal protection. That is why you are fighting for this law.... [Babkin] For this law and others, and for many administrative ordinances. The law on guarantees for Northerners requires funding for its enforcement. Last year's allocations amounted to only 158 billion of the 560 billion rubles needed for its implementation. This year the Ministry of Finance calculated that the law would cost the budget 34 trillion rubles. Then it added up the figures again and came up with 80 trillion. The upshot was that since the budget could not afford either amount, the Northerners could not expect any help.... The Ministry of Justice, instead of overseeing unconditional compliance with the law, has taken the liberty of amending the nine main sections. [Filimonov] The law does call for colossal expenditures. I do not think the government will agree to 100-percent financing--at least, not this government, which has to deal with the present budget deficit.... [Babkin] We propose the sequential enactment of the law. The mechanism for implementing the law has to be set in motion. Under no circumstances should the main provisions be watered down. If we yield on any one point, we might lose everything. I discussed this, as well as the problem of non-payments in the oil and gas complex and the need to review the tax laws, in my speech at the conference. I am quite familiar with the problems of the North, because I worked there for 15 years. [Filimonov] What would you do about the Ukrainians, the Moldavians and, in general, all of those who worked here and are now foreigners? [Babkin] We want the governments of the CIS states to conclude agreements on mutual commitments to extend social benefits and guarantees to the foreigners in the North today and those who worked there in the past. The State Duma deputies agreed with us. While our conference was still in session, they arranged for a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who promised to take the initiative in this sphere. [Filimonov] I read the conference resolutions carefully. It is impossible to summarize all of the demands it addressed to the government in just a few words. Most of them seemed to pertain to sections of the Law on Northerners. Is that right? [Babkin] Yes, it is. We are demanding funds from the federal budget for the implementation of the law and measures to solve the problem of mutual non-payments. We insist on higher compensatory payments for the rental of housing in the North and on cost-of-living adjustments in the personal savings of citizens. We also have other demands. [Filimonov] How will you get the government to react? [Babkin] Through the Federal Assembly, the press, and the Northerners' own labor collectives. The latter certainly will not have to be talked into it, because you can see how agitated they are.
