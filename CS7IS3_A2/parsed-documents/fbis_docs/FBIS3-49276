We asked the spokesman of Romania's Presidency, Mr. Traian Chebeleu, to comment on that statement. Chebeleu said, "we learned with interest and satisfaction about the statement made by Mr. Al Gore, vice president of the United States of America. We consider that statement to be a clear expression of the U.S. stance, having the value of a pledge, in the sense of which, Romania's security, as well as the security of all other countries in this part of Europe, is not indifferent to the United States. We consider that statement as a major support for the efforts we are making to strengthen the stability and security of our country in the context of the convulsions taking place in our vicinity and, on a broader plane, to strengthen Romania's democratic society." The statement made by the presidential spokesman to our radio also points out that the position expressed by the U.S. vice president responds to our preoccupations and was made in the spirit of the recent message addressed by Romania's president to the President of the United States and the other heads of states that are members of NATO.
