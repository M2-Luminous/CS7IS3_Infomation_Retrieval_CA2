This came in a final statement issued by the committee after an extraordinary meeting held to discuss the deteriorating situation experienced by our people in the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan. The statement said: Our Kurdish people in the Autonomous Region of Iraqi Kurdistan are currently experiencing a catastrophic and miserable situation brought about by a malicious U.S.-British-Zionist scheme, the implementation of which was assigned to many parties whose common interests lie in fueling an inter-Kurdish war. The statement added: This malicious Western scheme is meant to take revenge on great Iraq, its lofty people, and its wise leadership, particularly since the West has failed to achieve its evil objective of bringing Iraq to its knees in the 30-state aggression and successive chapters of aggression. The statement went on to say: The parties that have exploited the tragic situation in the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan, which is living under the control of the agent cliques, harbor rancor toward the Kurdish people in particular, and Iraq in general. [passage omitted] The statement affirmed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party is certain that our people, who have experienced hard times, as well as good times, cannot remain passive toward what is taking place in Turkey, nor can they remain silent over the ordeal our people are experiencing. For, they are bound to make a strong effort to return things to normal. The first thing they have to do, the statement noted, is to kick these agents off their land in order to bring about their humiliation and defeat, as well as the curse of both history and future generations.
