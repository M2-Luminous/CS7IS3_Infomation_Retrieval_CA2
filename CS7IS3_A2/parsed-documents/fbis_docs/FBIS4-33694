The APN says the Army and the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH] have been leading a (?knocking) operation against members of people's organizations nationwide since the end of April. The APN reports that this (?knocking) operation continues in Borgne. On 2 June, the unscrupulous Army and the wild animals [lame sanmanman an avek tout kolonn bet sovaj] who are part of FRAPH burned peasants' houses and gardens. They plundered and stole oxen and food and staged a slaughter that prompted peasants to flee the area. [passage omitted] The APN adds that this (?knocking) operation is leading up to a military intervention, which will allow the U.S. imperialists to occupy the country for a certain time, the only way to come and protect the macoutes from the people who are asking for justice. The APN warns the people against the [word indistinct] policy that the bourgeoisie and the little avalanche bourgeoisie have been carrying out for three years, a policy that has kept the people waiting. It is a way to demobilize them and make them believe that U.S. military forces will come to save (?them) from the terror of the macoutes. The APN says this in light of the U.S. military intervention hanging over Charlemagne Peralte's country. The APN asks President Aristide to stop (?changing his words) and to be courageous enough to take a clear stand on the intervention issue if he does not want history to regard him as a Haitian trading Charlemagne for Uncle Sam. The APN says President Aristide should take a clear stand on the intervention issue. The APN again says that it opposes any foreign military intervention into the country of Dessalines and Charlemagne. The APN concludes: Down with military intervention! Down with reconciliation with macoutes! Up with the struggle resting on the arms' strength of the people!
