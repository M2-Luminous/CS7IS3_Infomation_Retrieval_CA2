This information has been confirmed. According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of approximately 2,500 meters. The exploration activity is being carried out under the terms of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm, which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains risk contracts with several foreign firms. The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to evaluate the magnitude of the deposit. According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10 and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore, it will be less difficult to refine. Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11 of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in February 1993. Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters. Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon quota of crude oil. In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the country at international market prices if they so decide. Also, no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to sell the product overseas. According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and technical means for oil exploration in an established area and agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered. According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry, seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus operates. Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological terms have been found in this area. These structures are considered very favorable for petroleum deposits. Information available in the foreign companies' zone of operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at present), but also light crude. Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons. Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons. This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.
