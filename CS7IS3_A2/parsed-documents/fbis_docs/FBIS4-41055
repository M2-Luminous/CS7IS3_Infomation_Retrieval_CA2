He sees one of the main reasons for the current situation in the fact that transferring payments between Tajikistan and Russia in either direction is still a major problem. Samadov believes it would be necessary to draft a plan for a CIS payment union at the heads of government level in the near future and submit it to the CIS heads of state conference in September. "The current situation is unbearable," Samadov said. "True, it would be impossible to count on the restoration of ties at the previous level, but putting financial and monetary affairs of the CIS in order is an urgent need," the Tajik Prime Minister said. In his opinion, at the first stage there should be simpler rules of transferring payments from country to country, which would help stop the decline of economic indices in all CIS member-states. Businessmen in both Russia and Tajikistan have been trying to handle the problem at their level, Samadov said. For instance, the recent visit of a Russian delegation under the President of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy to Tajikistan was a good start. "Russian experts are working in Tajikistan and ice has been broken," the Tajik Prime Minister said. Samadov said that effective political reform in Tajikistan -- the adoption of a new constitution and elections of a President and parliament -- was another major condition for overcoming the crisis. About the situation in agriculture the Prime Minister said that the first phase of field work had been completed and the immediate targets formulated by the Council of Ministers early this year met. Tajikistan is now faced with another big problem, that of acquiring and using mineral fertilizes to achieve high crop yields, in the first place, those of cotton, Prime Minister Samadov said. He added that Tajikistan's own resources for that were not enough. To import mineral fertilizers Tajikistan urgently needs a Russian technical credit. Prime Minister Samadov said the agreement on the credit was signed by his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin as early as last March, however, the question has not been finally settled yet. According to conservative estimates the use of mineral fertilizers would help increase this year's cotton crop 30-40 percent against last year's and improve to a certain extent Tajikistan's financial and economic position. Prime Minister Samadov said that a great deal more had been achieved in agriculture than in industry or construction this year.
