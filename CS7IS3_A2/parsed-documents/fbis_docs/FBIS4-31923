Good morning to you, Sir. [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] What is your assessment of the first nine months of your term as prime minister? Are you satisfied, happy, or tired? [Pawlak] The first months were spent working on the budget, and, as everybody knows, the budget solves a whole range of issues but not all of them. So now, after this period, now that we have reached midyear, we are presenting the "Strategy for Poland" program, which is oriented toward the future, primarily the next three years, but, on many issues, the program stretches out much further into the future. I think that demonstrates the entire dynamics of the government's proceedings. If we take some specific issues--I mean issues that especially affect those people whose lots were the most difficult in the recent time period--one must say that, effective 1 January, there was a valorization and an increase in the minimum retirement pensions and other kinds of pensions, whereas, effective 1 June, a second valorization was carried out, which was quite substantial. The same applies to salary increases in the budget sector and in the production and industrial area. We have been witnessing a very positive phenomenon of an increase in production, which this time around is a result of our work and our capital potential, as well as of foreign investments. The increase is definitely not the result of governmental credits or of administrative involvement in the economy. This is great cause for joy because it creates a stable basis for optimism. [Woyciechowski] But what about you personally, Mr. Prime Minister? Are you happy, are you satisfied? I mean you yourself, personally. Or, maybe, is the situation not quite what it was supposed to be? [Pawlak] Personally, I am a bit tired because the tempo has really been very fast, and one must watch oneself the whole time so as not to lose pace and [hesitating] to keep up with the rate of events we have to solve. I think that, apart from long-term issues, there is a whole list of issues that are of an immediate nature, there are obstacles and problems--these constitute a permanent aspect of operating on this level. This applies to a wide variety of issues, and I think that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When you say immediate problems, you must certainly also mean the strikes in the metallurgy industry that are now taking place. Yesterday and the day before that, you said something that caused some big excitement, especially among the Western press--namely, you said that, in your view, the strikes are caused by foreign factors. What did you mean? Did you mean that.... [Pawlak] You know, this is exactly the difference between information and interpretation. I did not talk about such foreign connections. All I said was that it is an extraordinarily amazing coincidence, and, if reporters could only prove that I really meant something more than that, I think it would be very interesting. But such interpretations are a little too farfetched. It is beyond dispute that, as far as the world market goes, and especially the European market, there are big surpluses in steel production.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, it may be in the interest of somebody out there for Poland to be going through these strikes? [Pawlak] I would put it in different terms: Others are very happy to see the strikes in our country because thanks to them they can sell their products with greater peace of mind, they have jobs, employment, salaries, and incomes guaranteed for them--for both employees and owners of steelworks. [Woyciechowski] So, if my understanding is correct, what you did is appeal to the sense of patriotism rather than accuse imperialism of conducting strikes in Poland? [Pawlak] You know, I can see you are going back to some notions from the previous era in Poland, and that is amazing to me. But, first of all, one must keep in mind that, in any game, it is mighty important not to score in your own goal, and, when it comes to the issue of the strikes, we are scoring quite effectively not once but several times in our own goal, and we thus give up on the rest of the game. As far as the resolution of such disputes or conflicts is concerned, it is definitely easier to solve those disputes when there is a lot of emotion involved, rather than with tough and concrete negotiations. Such an agreement was indeed concluded at the Katowice Steelworks. It also included salary raises, and it was signed by all of the trade unions except the one that initiated the strike in the first place, but it had relatively few members in the steelworks.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean the August '80 trade union? [Pawlak] Exactly. What is also interesting is that, a few weeks before that, the steelworks obtained guarantees for a major modernization investment concerning a continuous steel production unit and.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But it can almost be concluded from what you are saying that this is indeed a political strike and that somebody wanted to spite the government and the coalition. [Pawlak] You know, the situation there was very weird because, apart from all the seriousness and....[pauses] What is a difficult situation down there, there are some aspects that are quite amusing: In the steelworks, which is an enterprise for which these people have been working for many long years, there is this very amazing situation where the steelworks' management is in one building, there is a protest committee in another building, and there is Sejm Deputy Zajac of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] shuttling as an envoy between these two serious institutions. This looks quite amusing. It is as if the parties involved could not find a way of communicating with one another. After all, given that they fail to come to an agreement at the level of the steelwork, what could be the use of an outside observer or mediator? After all, these are issues related to the metallurgic industry and of the particular enterprise in question. The point on the one hand is not to lead the steelworks into ruin, and, on the other, to secure the possibilities of obtaining higher incomes for the people. Last year, the steelworks achieved an overall positive financial outcome, which is very important and very positive after a few years of quite difficult times. But now the steelworks are getting in trouble on their own request. [Woyciechowski] How will this all end? Will you decide to close down the Katowice Steelworks if they continue to lead themselves into bankruptcy? [Pawlak] Remember that there is no central management anymore.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It is not up to you to close the steelworks down? [Pawlak] The people down there are really building a future for them on their own, and they themselves are creating the conditions for the enterprise to either score success or to lose on the market and drop out of the race. [Woyciechowski] Concerning Kolodko's "Strategy": Do you already know at this stage, or do you understand why the opposition walked out of the Sejm hall? [Pawlak] Well, I cannot possibly imagine what the reasons could have been because, as I recall my parliamentary experiences, there were different types of times. There were times when we were up against the wall, or even high up the wall, but we never tried to leave the Sejm hall altogether. Well, that is.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean SLD members walked out, but members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have never walked out? Or has it happened at any time in the past? [Pawlak] No, PSL members have never walked out of the Sejm hall. Perhaps our situation was a bit more fortunate because there have not been speeches that would be so sharp and addressed to us. But that....[Pawlak pauses] As far as issues such as governmental programs, budget laws, and other similar debates are concerned, even though they were hard for us at times, we tried to participate to the best of our ability and to influence either modification or changes, or we voted against when we could not have counted on changes, but this is tough work that must be done, and the absent simply do not count. It is important for us to be able to concentrate on issues we have to face. Regardless of these different maneuvers in the Sejm hall, the issues remain to be resolved, anyway, and one must simply address them eventually. [Woyciechowski] Was there a small element of an election campaign in the decision to present the "Strategy for Poland," which was made right before the elections? Or was it just a coincidence? [Pawlak] Partially it was a coincidence; if my memory serves me well, the elections were supposed to be held on about 29 May. However, the Sejm obliged us in the budget law....[Pawlak pauses] The resolution adopted when the budget was passed obliged us to present a long-term strategy in June. Thus, we simply followed the Sejm's order; we wanted to present a prospect for several years; primarily, we wanted to put the coalition's decisions and agreements in a compact form, which would deal with the main issues, the main problems that the state and the society are facing. The activities of the government or of several high-ranking state officials are not enough to put this strategy into effect; what is needed is the work and activity of many different milieus. Therefore, we are counting on a good substantive discussion in this area, as well as on activeness in the practical implementation of this strategy. [Woyciechowski] What do you think of the statement by Primate Jozef Glemp? When he was commenting on the decision by the Sejm concerning abortion, he said that the Sejm was born at a time of the state's sickness, and today such a fetus within the state is not healthy. You never commented on this in public. [Pawlak] And I do not intend to. This happens to be an area where you journalists can show off, and I am not going to do the journalists'job here. [Woyciechowski] Sejm Speaker Oleksy protested because he interpreted the primate's comment as a statement referring to himself and the SLD. Do you think the cardinal also meant the PSL, and is that why you have not commented on that? [Pawlak] Well, you know, let us allow those to whom statements are addressed to deal with them. Every person who listens to such statements, who analyzes such situations, should evaluate this issue himself. I am not going to comment on statements made by others; everyone has his own opinion, and I think the listeners can form their own opinions also. Such issues are often decided in the people's own conscience and in the behavior of each of us. There are great differences, depending on people's individual value systems. Let us leave this to the people. Let us allow everyone to evaluate this situation... [Pawlak pauses] Because I think it all concerns the situation that developed in the Sejm, and not just this particular statement. Let us allow everyone to evaluate whether the issue is so important that the Criminal Code should be applied or that we should rather speak about education and schools because this is where the key to resolving this issue lies, not in the Criminal Code. [Woyciechowski] Do you think the problem of abortion may have political consequences? Can it, as some people say, result in the weakening of the coalition and in its disintegration? [Pawlak] I do not think so. It is stated clearly in the PSL regulations that issues concerning conscience and belief cannot be a subject of political discipline.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that every Sejm deputy will vote just as he thinks? [Pawlak] Just as his conscience tells him to vote. [Woyciechowski] Now, what about the concordat? Is the concordat an issue that may weaken the coalition? Can this bring about any negative effects? [Pawlak] I do not think so. However, this issue is entirely different. It is not a problem of detailed legal solutions concerning the internal law. It is an international treaty. I can only say that recently we have had far more treaties that entailed much more serious consequences, especially economic consequences, than the concordat. Now, if the issue of the concordat is approached in a very substantive and precise way, many doubts can be dispelled. The discussion that has been held within the government has allowed us to submit it to the Sejm for ratification--with no objections. I hope that the debate we will witness in the Sejm will be based on a serious and substantive analysis; there is no room for emotions or for simple political gamesmanship. Now, from the viewpoint of broader and long-term interests, I think we must correct all of the mistakes resulting from a certain haste when the concordat was being signed. However, this can be done in an atmosphere of peace and responsibility. [Woyciechowski] Mistakes were made by the Suchocka Cabinet, if I understood you correctly. In other words, the coalition is doing fine. You do not fear a conflict within the coalition. [Pawlak] Well, I do not fear a conflict; however, I do not deny that there will be various issues that will give rise to heated and serious discussions in the coalition. This is because we are not going to sacrifice our views simply not to step out of line or to achieve unanimity. We will have serious discussions concerning which solutions are best. I believe this will help us avoid making mistakes. In this respect, the coalition is rather dynamic. There are various issues: In some, our views are quite similar; however, there are also issues in which we must try to work out a compromise; there are also issues where we respect each other's uniqueness and independence, and we are not going to change each other in this area. We believe that, in those issues, both parties have the right to maintain their subjectivity and identity. [Woyciechowski] Is there now any conflict with Kwasniewski? The press was full of articles about it some time ago. [Pawlak] I do not really know. That is, you know, if a topic must be supplied, we can have a quarrel with Kwasniewski about some important issue to make.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] To help newspapers increase their circulation? [Pawlak] To make it credible. We can do something like that; I believe that Mr. Kwasniewski will agree on such a solution. However, as I have said, there are issues where we differ, but there are also areas where our views are similar. If we take a look at the coalition agreement, it includes various issues that have been agreed upon. I believe that this is the foundation for the coalition's activities. [Woyciechowski] You are speaking about it with great self-assurance. This must mean that you are certain this coalition will survive at least three years. [Pawlak] I have....[Pawlak pauses] I hope we will be able to consistently implement the tasks we have taken on; time is an important factor here that allows us to stabilize the situation and to resolve a number of problems. [Woyciechowski] What is going to happen in a year and a half, when the presidential elections are held? It is already known that the list of candidates for president will include Lech Walesa. There will also be either Kwasniewski or Oleksy. Will the name of Pawlak be on the list? [Pawlak] I think we have many good candidates in the PSL. Therefore, a slightly different solution will be implemented. My colleagues will be able to prove themselves. [Woyciechowski] That means that the PSL will field a candidate? [Pawlak] It certainly will. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Pawlak] Thank you.
