Officials said the 3,000-hectare farm was intended for more than 30 landless peasant families. Instead, the five-year lease was granted to the former Agriculture Minister Witness Mangwende who is now the education minister. The white dominated Commercial Farmers Union has criticized the allocation of a farm to a minister, saying it is an abuse of the land reform program. The Agriculture Ministry has defended the deal, saying it was covered by the Tenant Resettlement Scheme for the rental of commercial property.
