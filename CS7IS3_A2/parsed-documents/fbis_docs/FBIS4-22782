Mushtuk, head of the Political Sociology Department of the Moscow Institute of Economic Statistics and director of the Institute of Political Management of the the Moscow International University of Business and Information Technologies: "Business: A Group Portrait Against the Background of Politics"] [Text] Among the mysterious strangers who have suddenly appeared in society as a result of Russia's movement toward the market, perhaps the most unfamiliar and mysterious is the class of Russian entrepreneurs. Because of the almost complete absence of reliable information on the entire range of "specific" characteristics of this class, it is more likely to be perceived by many Russians with a "minus" sign rather than a "plus": if one is not a "highway robber," then he is not "one involved in hard work." This perception is far from wrong all the time. However, it can hardly be considered a mirror image, that is, an objective reflection of reality. It should be taken into account that in the exceptionally complex and agonizing processes of "class formation" and "class creation," it is not always what comes to the surface and is apparent to the naked eye that represents the deep-seated essence of a phenomenon. In order to establish a really true picture of what is taking place, painstaking work with "reality"--that is, serious scientific research work by sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists who are engaged in applied science in the very midst of the entrepreneurial class--is required. The Center for Political Research attached to the Institute of Political Management of the Moscow International University of Business and Information Sciences [MMUBiIT] conducted a survey of students in a special department of the institute in February. These are young Moscow entrepreneurs (average age 30 to 35) who work in the finance field and are studying the "subtleties" of market economics in time "outside their principal employment"; they are clearly aware that their future (and the future of Russia's entire entrepreneurial class, incidentally) depends primarily on knowledge. The 33 respondents were given a questionnaire with testing elements in the questions integrated with the problem of relationships between business and politics. Question: Which of the three definitions of politics is closest to reality in Russia? (A. Politics is a method of producing legal orders and directions for society; B. Politics is the struggle for power and competition among individuals and groups in the distribution of rewards and benefits within society; C. Politics is the art of living together, the art of unifying a large number of people.) Results of the answers (A-0, B-30, C-3) speak for themselves: the overwhelming majority of respondents perceive politics not as socially useful management, but solely as an arena of struggle for power and access to "the state feeding trough." There is no need to demonstrate that in Russia, where property and power continue to be intertwined with each other, this is really the predominant aspect of politics. Question: Which of the three statements impresses you the most? (A. When the authorities become involved in economics, it is bad; B. Any state intervention in economic life is useful to the extent that its harm is recognized; C. The state's regulatory intervention in the economy is a necessary condition for its balanced development.) Results of the answers (A-4, B-7, C-22) reflect the realization that a market economy cannot exist in Russia without the appropriate state support. Removal of the state from this sphere entirely is no more than social utopia. Question: Is the solution of most of the problems related to the public's survival a priority function of the state? (A. Unquestionably; B. To a certain extent; C. No.) Results of the answers (A-6, B-23, C-3, and undecided-1) indicate the predominance of those who advocate a socially oriented model for the market, within the framework of which the state provides for a certain guaranteed level at which the public's needs are met for the services of public health, education, housing, and so forth and provides for social protection of the poor and unfortunate. Question: What obligations with respect to business should be assumed by the Russian State, in your opinion? The answers received make it possible to establish three basic groups of such commitments: --provision for the personal safety of entrepreneurs and protection from mafia structures, racketeering, and extortion by officials; --reasonable taxation which stimulates entrepreneurial activity; and --legal support for entrepreneurial activity and improvement and strict observance of the laws. Question: Do you agree with the statement "A free market has many advantages, but they do not include fairness" (AFL-CIO President L. Kirkland)? (A.I fully agree; B. I agree in part; C. I do not agree.) Results of the answers (A-9, B-19, C-4, and undecided-1) indicate that the majority of respondents are not afflicted with the "market romanticism" syndrome (such as:"give complete freedom to business, and order and fairness will be established automatically in society"). Most of the respondents realize that entreprenuerial activity needs a definite system of checks and restrictions (primarily legal), so that those with economic power do not cross over the line beyond which private interest conflicts with the public interest. Question: Define the ideological orientation of the author of the following quotation: "The task of an enterprise is to produce for consumption, not for easy profit or speculation. Speculation with finished products has nothing in common with business--it is mo more and no less than an acceptable form of stealing" (H. Ford, Sr.) (This was stated by A. a communist; B. a social-democrat; C. a liberal-conservative.) Results of the answers (A-21, B-5, C-6, and undecided-1) show that most of the respondents have a hazy idea of the functional role of business (production and the supply of socially useful goods and services) and its moral and value principles and imperatives. Question: Name the principal difficulties you are encountering in your entrepreneurial activity. The spectrum of problems identified (aside from those indicated in the answers to Question No. 4) is as follows: --nonfulfillment of contract commitments and dishonorable conduct by partners; --lack of support in the organs of executive authority and their corruption; --bureaucratism and amateurishness of officials; --poor information support (especially with respect to demand and competition); --political instability and the unpredictability of politics and the absence of a clearly defined government policy; --inflation and the instability of the dollar; --the lack of funds and essential contacts; --the lack of practical skills and the ability to work with people; and --the lack of knowledge and other factors. Question: Which one of the following 10 political figures would you give preference to: (B. Yeltsin, V. Zhirinovskiy, V. Chernomyrdin, N. Travkin, Ye. Gaydar, K. Borovoy, S. Shakhray, A. Sobchak, G. Yavlinskiy, G. Zyuganov)? Results of the answers (9 for G. Yavlinskiy, 4 each for Ye. Gaydar and B. Yeltsin, 2 each for S. Shakray and A. Sobchak, 1 each for K. Borovoy, V. Chernomyrdin, and N. Travkin, and 9 undecided) enable us to conclude that leading Russian politicians, with the possible exception of G. Yavlinskiy, do not inspire particular confidence from the respondents. This distribution reflects the need for new faces to make their appearance on the Russian political scene. Question: Who holds the real power in Russia at present, in your opinion? Results of the answers enable us to conclude unequivocally that the overwhelming majority consider two forces to be the holders of real power--the shadowy mafia structures (25 "for") and the bureaucratic machinery (21 "for"). Further, to a lesser degree: the VPK [military-production complex] (5 "for"), the president and major financial-commercial corporations (4 each), the government (3), and the SMI [mass information media] (2). If it is taken into account that nine-tenths of the private enterprises in Russia today are under the influence of organized crime to one degree or another, it is apparent that the respondents are not so far from the truth. Question: Which of the following personality types best describes your attitude toward politics? A. an apolitical citizen; (B. a passive citizen; C. a competent critic; D. a competent observer; E. an activist.) Results of the answers (A-5, B-9, C-8, D-11, E-1) lead to the conclusion that practically all the respondents dissociate themselves from politics. Meanwhile, the position "I do not want to be involved in politics, I want to engage only in business" is inadequate in the current situation in Russia, when the formation of a market economy depends mainly and fundamentally on policy and who is directing this policy. The right "to be outside of politics" has really been earned and provided for only by the developed market democracies. But for us, in light of what has been stated above, this is an impermissible luxury, especially for those who seek to become the masters of their destiny and do not want to depend on the "mercies" of the state. Question: What is the principal reason for Russia's current problems, in your opinion? (A. those in power are not professionals; B. professionals are in power, but they are constantly interfered with; C. both.) Results of the answers (A-2, B-2, C-26, undecided-3) enable us to draw this conclusion: at the level of the structural and functional organization of state authority, the overwhelming majority of respondents adequately reflect the subjective reasons for the processes of crisis in Russia. On one hand, the country is really suffering from the lack of professionalism and incompetence, a lack of responsibility and actions "on the off-chance" peculiar to many "new" politicians who came to power on the wave of democratization and who are learning the art of state administration "on the job." On the other hand, the intense opposition to changes from the numerous "holders" and "managers" of state property, those who have "privatized" the state authority of the nomenklatura and bureaucratic circles, the mafia structures, and others is having an effect. Question: If new elections to the State Duma were held today, which parties and voting blocs would you vote for? Results of the answers: 6 each for "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko," 4 for the RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms], 2 for the PES [Economic Freedom Party], 1 each for the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], and "Women of Russia," and 12 undecided. We may speak of the "lack of party affiliation" in the political consciousness of most of the respondents and their "vote of no confidence" in the parties and blocs which are actually taking part in the exercise of political power in Russia today. General Conclusions We are dealing with representatives of the class of Russian entrepreneurs which is being "born in torment" (taking into account that this is not a very favorable environment, and, in places, one that is even openly hostile), and one that has been formed only as "a class in itself" at present. The overwhelming majority of respondents are "standing firmly on their own feet," that is, they view life quite realistically (without romanticism and illusions) and perceive it most often as it actually exists. The majority distinctly acknowledge their own special interests and the numerous problems facing private enterprise activity in Russia. The obligations which the state should assume toward business are also expressed very specifically. However, as far as the public obligations and value imperatives of business itself are concerned, there is a certain "flabbiness" and "haziness" here. The respondents' perception of the state as an institution which "has an obligation to business because of its position" (as well as of such specific holders of political power as parties and their leaders) is more negative than positive. Social criticism and skepticism predominate. At the same time, we do not see a sufficient amount of awareness that a state "obligated to business because of its position" (with the present distribution of political forces) will turn to this by itself, and that it must be constantly pushed in this direction, and even "forced" to do so. The economic power concentrated in entrepreneurial circles should be turned into a political resource for "power" pressure on the state and its structures and "incentive" for them to take part in a business partnership with equal rights. Both from without (through a developed political infrastructure of parties, public associations, and so forth) and from within (through direct "assumption of authority by individual entrepreneurs" and by putting "their own people" in parliament and other representative organs, and so forth). And this in turn assumes a target-oriented investment of capital and development of the special field of free enterprise and political business, with broad participation by specialist professionals (economists, sociologists, political scientists, jurists, and so forth).
