"It's important for Japan to show its political and economic policies to President (Bill) Clinton in the sense of Japan-U.S. friendship," Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. "That includes economic problems," he stressed, indicating that Japan would compile a stimulus package by the time the summit is held. But he noted that a timetable for both the package and budget is "still not decided." Fujii reiterated that he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen agreed at a meeting Sunday that a recovery of the Japanese economy is "extremely important" especially in view of contributions to world growth [sentence as received]. He said he told Bentsen to "trust us" and leave the details of measures to Japan. As six ministers responsible for economic affairs, including Fujii, agreed on Monday, he said the government is to focus on reviving the political reform bills rejected by the House of Councillors last Friday, and the enactment of those bills would be the best help now for the economy. He said his ministry is not considering any measures for the stock market. Tokyo stock prices recovered slightly Tuesday morning after a key market index, the Nikkei stock average, plummeted 954 points Monday, its biggest in two years. Meanwhile, Fujii rejected Tuesday's comments by Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota calling for an income tax cut separately from an increase in the consumption tax. "That's her personal opinion," Fujii said, adding that a decision on the tax issue is being left to a joint economic forum of the government and the coalition parties. The ministry has been maintaining that the income tax cut and consumption tax hike must be included in the same package of tax reform bills to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds issued to cover the period until the tax hike. Concerning reported plans to stimulate the real estate market and facilitate liquidation of banks' bad loans on which interest has been reduced, Fujii said the ministry is now studying various measures including "securitization" of loans and is in "the final stage" of mapping out its plan.
