Russian President Boris Yeltsin participated in the festivities. This was the second visit to the combined unit in the past year by the supreme commander in chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. It is not hard to notice that at critical moments the country's leadership turns precisely to this division. This time, too, the president's itinerary had evidently not been chosen by chance. The country has been overwhelmed by crime whose scale is frightening people, but at all stages of its existence the elite combined unit of internal troops has been a stabilizing factor in Russian reality and a weighty guarantor of citizens' safety. According to Boris Yeltsin, crime in the country has reached a dangerous level and is reducing to naught the results of many transformations, and effective protection against the criminal onslaught is needed. The country's leadership sees just this as the main task of the combined unit and of the internal troops as a whole. It should be pointed out that the division has already repeatedly justified its purpose not only in Moscow but also far outside it. Since 1988 the combined unit's servicemen have been involved in ensuring the state of emergency regime in various parts of the former Union and of the present Russia. Sumgait, Stepanakert, Kubatly, Fergana, Sukhumi -- this is a far from complete list of the "hot spots" where the soldiers of law and order have had to operate. Today the North Caucasus, where territorial disputes between Ossetians and Ingush are persisting, has become the division's second stationing location. State awards have been conferred upon almost every second serviceman for courage displayed in the fulfillment of peacemaking tasks. Seven people have been awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation. The president was pleased with the professional training of ODON servicemen. But he pointed out that the question of enhancing the mobility of special subunits remains acute today. The crime growth rate has prompted the country's leadership to resolve the question of increasing the strength of internal troop operational units by 52,000 men. Army General Viktor Yerin awarded the ODON the pennant of the Russian Federation minister of internal affairs. "An excellent division!" -- this was how Boris Yeltsin voiced his attitude toward the combined unit.
