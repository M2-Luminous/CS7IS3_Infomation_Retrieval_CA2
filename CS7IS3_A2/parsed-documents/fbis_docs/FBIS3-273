Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to Lesotho, Dr. Salim said stability was important not only for Lesotho, but for the rest of the continent. He said he had studied a report by the special envoy of the OAU secretary general to South Africa, Ambassador Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana, whom he sent to Lesotho after the crisis to assess the situation. The government had embarked on a consultation process which was continuing to bring the two former rival groups in the army together. The demands of the army were being formulated by a 20-man strong unit and discussed by a committee of four principal secretaries, namely of foreign affairs, defense, finance and home affairs. [Lesotho Foreign Affairs Minister] Mr. Qhobela said the army demands would be sifted by the committee and submitted in a final report to the minister of defense. Dr. Salim and his entourage left Lesotho yesterday.
