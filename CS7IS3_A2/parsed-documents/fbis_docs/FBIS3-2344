Official statistics show that the province approved some 4,487 foreign-funded firms last year, involving a total investment of more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. The figure exceeded the total number for the previous 14 years. Moreover, total value of foreign trade reached more than 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in the province last year, according to the statistics. To date, Zhejiang has set up eight state-level development zone and some 37 zones listed at the provincial and city levels. Their combined area accounts for nearly 50 percent of the total area of the province. Official sources said that nearly one third of the total foreign funds invested in the province has flowed in those development zones. As part of the measures to open wider to the outside world as well as to adopt the international practice, the province has implemented the share-holding system in most of its state-owned foreign trade companies. In addition, more management powers have been relegated to foreign trade firms as well as manufacturers at all levels, which has greatly promoted the development of the foreign trade business. At the same time, the provincial government encouraged its large and medium-sized enterprises to open and expand overseas businesses. According to official statistics, more than 180 companies of the province have invested or set up branches in nearly 40 countries and regions in the world. Most of those firms set up abroad are engaged in such industries as tourism, processing and building industries, fishery and agriculture, official sources said.
