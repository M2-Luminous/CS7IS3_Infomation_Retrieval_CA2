In his speech, Secretary Mao Zhiyong first and foremost made a comprehensive analysis of the excellent situation in Jiangxi at the moment and called for sumbitting to and serving such overall interests as grasping each and every excellent opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. To this end, Mao Zhiyong noted, it is imperative to correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability. Given the actual conditions of Jiangxi, first, we should make continued efforts to promote development with an eye on boosting the province's national economic growth; second, we should cultivate a new train of thought and adopt new measures to improve labor quality and push ahead with economic and educational development by dint of scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment; third, we should strive for faster growth and rapidly build a socialist market economic structure and a socialist market economic operative mechanism in the course of the on-going in-depth reform; fourth, we should strive for faster growth while maintaining overall stability. To this end, we should actively, cautiously, and appropriately implement each and every reform measure to avoid drastic unheavals or turmoil and secure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth. Secretary Mao Zhiyong stressed: We should make unreserved efforts to step up agricultural and rural work. Agriculture, rural areas, and peasants have always been fundamental issues with an important bearing on the country's overall development. In order to maintain social stability, we should first maintain stability in rural areas where over 80 percent of China's population reside. Without agricultural development, it would be impossible to successfully further and speed up overall development, nor will it be possible to deepen reform and maintain stability. Only when agriculture is developed will we be able to make a success of other types of work. Secretary Mao Zhiyong pointed out: Given Guangxi's situation at the moment, we should strive to make a success of this year's agricultural and rural work by focusing on the following six aspects: 1. Maintaining stable grain output. To this end, we should strive to maintain the total provincial grain output at or above 30 billion jin and the total provincial cotton output at or above 200 million kilograms. 2. Increasing income on the part of peasants. To this end, we should strive to raise per capita net income on the part of peasants by 150 yuan on the basis of last year. 3. Further developing township and town enterprises. To this end, we should strive to raise the total provincial township and town enterprises output value to or above 80 billion yuan. 4. Taking firm measures to reduce the natural population growth rate. 5. Popularizing advanced science and technology; implementing the joint-stock system on a large scale; and establishing and perfecting all types of socialized service systems; 6. Building more infrastructure facilities. Secretary Mao Zhiyong stated: Now that we have clear-cut principles to follow and specific policies and measures to go by in agricultural and rural work, we should implement these principles, policies, and measures to the letter. The provincial party committee and government hope that all areas and departments in the province will display a strong sense of political responsibility, resolutely implement to the letter the central rural work principles, and successfully carry out 10 aspects of work while making continued efforts to stabilize and perfect the basic operating system. Now the province's spring plowing production has been unfolded on a large scale, all areas should make overall arrangements for and strive to accelerate grain, cotton, oil crops, vegetables, aquatic products, fruit, forest, and other types of production as well as township and town enterprises development. Secretary Mao Zhiyong also called for taking overall interests into account and successfully carrying out reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability in a down-to-earth manner. To this end, first, it is imperative to successfully develop industrial production; second, it is imperative to maintain social and political stability; third, it is imperative to persistently and incessantly further the on-going anti-corruption struggle; and fourth, it is imperative to conscientiously intensify comprehensive social order management. In the end, Secretary Mao Zhiyong called on all areas and departments across the province to practically strengthen leadership, conscientiously carry out study, take overall interests into account, improve work style, and implement to the letter a series of policies, decisions, and measures formulated by the CPC Central Committee as well as the Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government. At the conference, Governor Wu Guanzheng also delivered a speech in which he spelled out the following specific requirements for how to implement the spirit of the above mentioned national rural work conference and national family planning symposium: 1. Increasing agricultural input. This year, Wu Guangzheng noted, all levels in the province have attached more importance to increasing agricultural input. The province's estimated financial expenditure on agricultural production has reached 410 million yuan, up by 12.4 percent over last year. Prefectures, cities, and counties should abide by this estimated financial expenditure. 2. Making a success of production, importation, transportation, allocation, and supply of agriculture-oriented production means. Departments concerned across the province should make every possible endeavor to guarantee production and supply of agriculture-oriented means of production with an eye on ensuring smooth agricultural production. They should also provide agricultural production with sufficient funds, raw and processed materials, energy, and transportation, and see to it that all chemical fertilizer factories operate at full capacity. 3. Deepening grain purchase and marketing system reform and setting up a grain risk fund aimed at pushing ahead with grain purchase and marketing system reform. To this end, it is imperative to strengthen state macroeconomic regulation and control over grain production, further improve grain purchase measures, and raise grain purchase prices. 4. Strictly controlling price hikes. To this end, it is imperative to keep this year's price index at or below 10 percent. Prefectures and cities across the province should strive to stabilize grain and vegetables prices. Governments at all levels across the province should assume full responsibility for vegetable supplies. It is imperative to institute a system under which city mayors assume full responsibility for vegetable supplies in cities. At present, it is imperative to strengthen control of prices of agriculture-oriented means of production and to formulate strict rules governing competitive prices listed by different grain enterprises. 5. Banning the practice of indiscriminately paying wages and bonuses to staff and workers. To this end, all areas and departments in the province should strictly implement the current wages system and ban the above mentioned malpractice. 6. Strictly control the total number of new projects under construction, make continued efforts to screen, suspend, or cancel a batch of duplicate and non-profitable projects being built in violation of the state industrial policies, and stop building capital construction projects or technological transformation projects short of construction funds. 7. Successfully fulfilling social stability maintenance tasks and adopting effective measures to tackle each and every major problem that has given rise to strong resentment among the masses.
