Cetin, who is in New Zealand, assessed the latest developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina for Turkish Radio and Television. [Begin Cetin recording] From the beginning, we supported all the resolutions made for a lasting and just peace, and we believed that these resolutions must be implemented effectively. There were reports at a certain stage that not all the heavy weapons which were supposed to withdraw 20 kms in line with the NATO resolution were under UN control. At the time we warned the United Nations and NATO that if these weapons were not placed under full UN control they could be used in other places. It is now understood that the cease-fire achieved around Sarajevo can be violated, and the weapons, unless placed under UN control, can be taken to other places. Consequently, in order to achieve lasting peace, NATO and the UN Security Council must continue with their actions in a determined way. [end recording]
