Stalling maneuvers and deceptive promises can only ruin the credibility of those involved in this crisis, stated the president-in-exile, who asserted that the international community cannot be neutral and that it is necessary for the Army and Police hierarchy to step down without delay -- immediately and at once, he said. Father Aristide did not refer directly to the latest discussions held in the UN Security Council to try to impose implementation of the Governors Island agreement through sanctions against the military regime in Haiti. According to Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, current Security Council president, a draft resolution in this connection should be sent to the Council by the end of the week. Observers think President Aristide's statements before the commission constitute indirect and harsh criticism of the new plan supported by Washington, a plan which does not propose a date for the return of the president-in-exile to his country. During a speech before the commission, Father Aristide pointed out the bloodthirsty, ferocious, barbarous nature of the current dictatorship in Haiti, enumerating a long list of violations committed by General Raoul Cedras' regime. Aristide said: Today, the genocide continues in the presence of the international community. What about the primacy of the law? -- he asked commission member-countries, while affirming that everyone should shoulder his responsibilities.
