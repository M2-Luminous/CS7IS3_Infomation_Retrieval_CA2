FR940419-2-00120 FR940419-2-00069 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33900; File No. SR&hyph;Amex-94-10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Minimum Fractional Change for Trading in Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts April 12, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposed to amend Rule 127, Commentary .01 to provide that the minimum fractional change applicable to trading of Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs'') shall be 1/64 of $1.00. 1 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. 1 The Commission notes that, although SPDRs currently are listed and traded on the Amex, it is conceivable that other national securities exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. could apply for authority to list and trade SPDRs. At the present time, however, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') is not capable of accommodating quotes in 1/64's. Telephone conversation between Thomas Demchek, SIAC, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on April 12, 1994. Accordingly, if other securities exchanges and/or national securities associations file for permission to list and trade SPDRs, the Commission would at that time be required to re-evaluate the adequacy and sufficiency of ITS in conjunction with section 11A's statutory mandate to assure fair competition between the exchanges. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Amex Rule 127 provides parameters for the minimum fractional change for dealings in securities on the Exchange. Commentary .01 to Rule 127 provides that for securities listed under Amex Rule 1000 et seq., Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs''), the minimum fractional change shall be 1/32 of $1.00. One issuance of PDRs, SPDRs, is currently trading on the Exchange. The Exchange now proposes to reduce the minimum fractional change applicable to SPDRs to 1/64. In approving trading of PDRs in 1/32's, the Commission stated that such trading would enhance market liquidity and should promote more accurate pricing, tighter quotations and reduced price fluctuations. The Commission also noted that such trading should allow customers to receive the best possible execution of their transactions in these securities. 2 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31794 (January 29, 1993), 58 FR 7272 (February 5, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex-92&hyph;45). The Exchange believes the benefits identified by the Commission in connection with trading PDRs in 1/32's will be further enhanced by trading SPDRs in 1/64's. Such trading should further reduce price fluctuations based on the underlying index for the particular issuance (i.e., S&P 500 Index). Such trading parameters should benefit retail customers, institutions, and other market participants that invest in or trade SPDRs. In addition, a narrower quotation spread should make such securities more useful professionals who may hedge their positions in futures or other derivative markets. The Exchange will issue an Information Circular to members and member organizations relating to trading SPDRs in 1/64's prior to commencement of such trading. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is intended to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to facilitate transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.
