Heavy rain and fog over the city may also have contributed to a grounding of aircraft and the silencing of rival artillery fire. With the peace depending on the cooperation of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and his response still unknown, thousands of local residents took advantage of the first lull in fighting in almost a week to flee with all their belongings. Scores were reported dead and more than 3,000 people wounded in the six days of clashes tied to a power struggle in which Hekmatyar and his ally, Uzbek warlord 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, have been attempting to oust Rabbani. Sources inside the Dostam camp, which has been most active in Kabul and backed by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] faction, said he would also accept international calls for a brief ceasefire. Pakistan, in a "fervent appeal" Thursday, urged all warring Afghan factions in Kabul to agree to a 24-hour truce starting at 1100 GMT Friday so that all diplomatic and UN personnel living in Kabul and civilians wounded since the New Year's day coup attempt could be "evacuated on an emergency basis." "There is no problem from our side," Hekmatyar said. In a radio message conveyed to the foreign office from his Charasyab base east of Kabul, Hekmatyar said "we can stop fighting (from late Friday) to enable UN personnel and foreign nationals to leave Kabul" and evacuate casualties. Moreover, hundreds of Afghanis are still trapped in their shattered homes awaiting medical asistance. Many who did leave were travelling to Kabul's most northerly district, Khairkhana, which has been free of shelling. "I don't know where to go but they told me that it is safe in Khairkhana," said one man leaving the city, Agha Mohammed. "I have no relatives there and I have no money to hire even a small room, but living in the open is better than getting hit by rockets." Mengal Hoseyn, the Afghan premier's representative in Islamabad, said Hekmatyar "responded positively" to the ceasefire proposal on humanitarian grounds. Asked if Dostam, whose forces are engaged in the battle, would also be ready, Hussain said "all forces fighting to oust Rabbani will be ready" for a temporary ceasefire, "including Dostam."[passage omitted]
