The giant network will be a big step in the modernisation of China's banking system, which will see sweeping changes this year, featuring the transformation of state-owned banks into commercial banks and the establishment of policy-oriented banks. The first phase of the modernisation has received a loan from the World Bank and the bidding documents for the system are expected to be released in about three weeks. About 30 major international computer manufacturers are expected to take part in the bidding, which will open opportunities for more business in China's financial sector. The selection will be held in two stages, with the winning bid picked at the end of this year. The winner of the contract will be responsible for supplying the equipment, developing a software system and building a communications network. Colin Shun, deputy general manager of Beijing Chibo Information Engineering, a joint venture between CL Computers China/Hong Kong, the People's Bank and five other Chinese banks, said a lot of inquiries had been received in the past six months. "We believe all major international computer manufacturers will bid for the contract," he said. The joint venture was set up to develop a modern financial system for banks in China, and is charged with the responsibility of compiling the bidding documents of the first phase of the payment system. Mr Shun said the World Bank loan was sufficient for the pilot project, and the Government had committed to cover the additional expenses incurred. The whole project involves the design, development and installation of a nationwide computer-cum-communications system to process the bulk of funds transfers in China. This will upgrade the country's payment system to the standard of the Fedwire and ACH systems in the United States and CHAPS in Britain. "Such a system is indispensable in the current drive for economic reforms in China. It would allow transfer of funds within the country to be done in the shortest possible time," Mr Shun said. "Before an automatic payment system is introduced into the banking sector for the transfer of funds, the flow of money has to be made using telegraph, mail or telephone. This is not reliable nor efficient," he said. "The Chinese payment system, to be called the Chinese National Financial Network, is a huge undertaking in the eyes of both the Chinese and foreign financial sectors," he added. China believes it will take 10 more years to link up all 2,500 branches of the People's Bank in the country. Although the current organisation of the bank might be revamped as it transforms into a true central bank, the proposed network is based on the existing structure of the bank. "The objective is to put all the PBOC branches under the umbrella of the payment system as soon as possible," said Mr Shun. Other mainland banks might link up with the PBOC network, but that is outside the scope of the current project. He said it was unlikely that China's payment system could simply copy the existing systems in the West and Japan. "China's banking system is different, so the Chinese network has to be established from scratch." he said. It is still not known how China will finance the rest of the project after the first phase is completed in two to three years. CL Computers, as adviser in the project, is not allowed to bid for the contract to avoid conflict of interest. Alphonso Fung, executive director of CL Computers, said the company took a long-term view of the China market. "By playing an important role in the computerisation of the banking sector in China, it will help sell our products in future. This is a long-term investment," he said.
