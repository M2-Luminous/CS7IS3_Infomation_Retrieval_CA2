He also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted] Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa, President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the fragile economies of two states in the subregion. [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end recording] The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen to the president again: [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time, and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems, but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development.
