Lomonosov; PACS 42.79Qx; 42.68.Wt] [Abstract] Construction of a Doppler wind lidar using a TEA (transverse excitation atmospheric pressure) pulsed single-frequency CO[.sub]2[/] injection laser for coherent reception and processing of data on winds in the lower atmospheric layers at altitudes up to 15 km. The design of such a lidar is based on the fundamental equation relating the signal-to-noise ratio to parameters of the sounding radiation pulses and of the atmospheric medium, the solution to this equation indicating the amount of energy needed for a sounding radiation pulse to reach the desired altitude. A laser set of this type with automatic ultraviolet preionization features both simplicity and reliability. Its one drawback is the sweeping of the emission frequency caused by presence of discharge electrons in the active medium, resonance polarization of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules, and acoustic expansion of heated gas. This sweep is best measured by optical heterodyning with radiation of a continuous-wave single-frequency reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and subsequent mixing the two signals in a HgCdTe photodetector for processing with the aid of an analog-to-digital converter. The results of these measurements were used for optimizing the composition of the active medium so as to ensure both minimum width of the emission band and maximum emission energy. The active medium, a CO[.sub]2[/]:N[.sub]2[/]:He = 1.5:2.5:6 mixture is confined inside a typically 5 m long linear resonator cavity, this cavity being formed by a spherical mirror with a typically 18 m radius and a germanium wedge. The cavity contains also a NaCl wedge through which an external signal is injected into the active medium and through which some laser radiation is extracted for mode locking. Mode locking is achieved by noting the instant of time at which the frequency of the injected signal coincides with the frequency of the natural cavity mode and at that instant initiating a discharge in the TEA compartment. This instant can be recorded by a signal peak detector as corresponding to the maximum intensity on the interference pattern, with the cavity mirror oscillating harmonically at a frequency of typically 180 Hz. Such a TEA CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a telescope were included in the prototype of a Doppler wind lidar, also a continuous-wave reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a HgCdTe photodetector with an output amplifier, a DVK-2 computer, and a CAMAC crate. A model needed for determination of the signal scattering in the atmosphere is based on the following premises: 1. scattering is done by a large number of arbitrarily located identical aerosol particles moving at the wind velocity, 2. atmospheric turbulence influences only the wavefront of backscattered radiation, 3. signal attenuation in the atmosphere obeys Bouger's law. With this lidar were measured wind velocities along horizontal and vertical paths, whereupon he data were used for calculating wind velocity profiles and their dispersions.
