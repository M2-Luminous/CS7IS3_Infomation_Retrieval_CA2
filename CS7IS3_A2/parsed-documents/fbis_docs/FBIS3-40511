Mitsubishi Electric and NEC will team up with Martin Marietta, whereas Toshiba will join Space Systems/Loral's (SSL) team. Since the Japanese manufacturers are not competitive with the American manufacturers in terms of cost and delivery, there is no other choice for them but to join the American teams as subcontractors; as yen keeps going up, so does the hurdle for the Japanese manufacturers. It was 1990 when the United States signed the Satellite Procurement Agreement with Japan under the leverage of the Comprehensive Trade Act Super 301. The agreement stipulates open international bidding when the government or government-related institutions such as NHK and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) are procuring a satellite for practical uses. BS4 is going to be the third satellite to be procured under the agreement. The order for the communication satellite N-STAR, procured by NTT in 1991, went to SSL, whereas General Electric got the contract when NHK put the job of building its auxiliary broadcasting satellite BS3N up for bidding in September 1992. In both cases, none of the Japanese companies was able to bid as a principal contractor; instead, they remained as subcontractors, as in the present case. It is essentially impossible for the Japanese manufacturers to compete against the American manufacturers in the same ring, because the Americans have the cost advantage of volume production as a result of their defense contracts. Moreover, with the recent reduction in defense contracts, the American manufacturers are desperate for civilian contracts and are ready to offer cut-throat prices, lower by $100 million per satellite in some cases; as a result, there is no place for the Japanese manufacturers in the business. One could understand Japanese manufacturers wanting to give the glory of the main contractor to American companies and being content with the role of subcontractors, as long as they got enough work. A top executive of a Japanese manufacturer, however, lamented that ``even if our team wins, it would be difficult for us to get a decent share of the work.'' The main reason is the steep yen appreciation. If a team gives a major chunk of the work to a Japanese partner, the total price will go up automatically, and the team won't get the job. Martin Marietta, which is teamed up with Mitsubishi Electric and NEC, bought the aerospace division of General Electric this spring. So far, all Japanese broadcasting satellites have been built either by GE or by someone under GE's license. The BS3N contract was given to the GE/Mitsubishi Electric/NEC team, and the same team is expected to be the winning candidate. If they win the contract, Mitsubishi Electric will be responsible for equipment such as the heat-pipe panel of the heat exchanger and for total reliability management, whereas NEC will be responsible for onboard equipment such as the antenna and radiowave transmitter. All in all, however, a person in charge confides that ``it is inevitable that the Japanese portions will be less this time than in the case of the BS3N.'' Toshiba's responsibility on the SSL team will be, as it stands now, reliability management and after-launch operational support. It has not given up on the manufacture of satellite hardware, but the chance of getting that is bleak because the adverse yen-dollar exchange rate makes its price uncompetitive. Toshiba is also hurting because of a delay in the H2 launch vehicle. As a result of the delay in the development of the H2, the launch of NASDA's Engineering Test Satellite ETS-VI, which was built under the leadership of Toshiba, is also delayed until next summer. Thus, Toshiba has lost a golden opportunity to appeal its technical expertise to SSL to negotiate a higher production share in the present project. In addition to Martin Marietta and SSL, Hughes is expected to participate in the upcoming bid. The Broadcasting Satellite Company, a procurement company that was set up by NHK and in which NHK is the principal shareholder, is going to select the company in charge of the manufacture by the end of the year. Even if a team including one or more Japanese firms wins the contract, it is still uncertain how much work the Japanese firms can get.
