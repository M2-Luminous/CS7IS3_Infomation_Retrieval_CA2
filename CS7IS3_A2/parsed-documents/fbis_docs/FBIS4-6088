The amendment aims at preventing a recurrence of financial scandals involving general contractors by extending the disqualification period from two to five years, during which licenses are not issued to construction firms whose licenses have been revoked for involvement in bid-riggings, and by strengthening punitive provisions in the law. In response to a series of financial scandals involving general contractors who have been accused of rigging bids for public works projects, last December the Central Council on Construction Contracting Business (an advisory body for the construction minister) compiled an agenda of proposals calling for adoption of an open competitive tender system. The agenda also calls for the "exclusion of disqualified construction companies from participating in biddings under the new tender system" and the "strengthening of penalties." The government has decided to amend the Construction Business Law in line with the proposals. The Construction Business Law stipulates that if representatives or local managers of construction companies are sentenced to more than one year in prison, the license of that construction company shall be revoked. If revised in accordance with the amendment, the Construction Business Law will stipulate that if representatives or local managers of construction companies are sentenced to imprisonment for any length of time, their licenses shall be revoked. Under the Construction Business Law to be revised in accordance with the amendment, the representatives or local managers of construction firms, if found to have falsely stated in their applications for licenses, will face less than six months of imprisonment and they will pay 1-3 million yen in fines if they are found to have continued to do their businesses in violation of administrative measures that suspend their businesses. The amendment makes it mandatory for construction firms to keep construction records of their subcontractors. The amendment also calls on construction firms to strengthen their guidance systems and to position supervisory engineers on construction sites in order for public works projects to be implemented properly and fairly. In a bid to develop blue-chip construction companies, the amendment calls for extending the effective period of licenses from three to five years.
