In the newscast we will show the part that refers to the massacre in Sarajevo [5 February] and Russia's interpretation of NATO's decision. The interview will be shown in full in the Svet Danas program today. [Begin Churkin recording, in Russian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that it is almost certain that this was not done by the Serbs, because, as a rule, if this were the Serbs, the experts who were investigating this case would have quickly come up with such conclusions. It is necessary to demilitarize the area around Sarajevo. We envisage this as a two-way operation that does not apply to the Serbs alone, but also to the Muslims. Therefore, I think the international community will understand that not only this bloody wound of Sarajevo would begin to heal, but, in our view, better conditions would be created for a better political solution. Therefore, the events that should happen in Sarajevo, its demilitarization, are in the interest of both the Serbs themselves and those who favor a political solution.
