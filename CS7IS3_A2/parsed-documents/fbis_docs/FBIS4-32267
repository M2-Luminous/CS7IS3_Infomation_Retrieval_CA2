The source said that Klaus, who is chairman of the strongest government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), evidently believed it would be useful to postpone the issue of creation of higher self-governing units until a later date. According to the timetable of legislative steps aimed at implementing a local government reform, which the government had submitted to parliament, the government is to present by June 30 a bill on higher self-administrative units. According to the source, Klaus apparently believes that it would be useful if the bill was not submitted by this date and the parliament enabled the government to submit it later, "preferably never." The source said that Klaus's efforts were motivated by a fundamental controversy between the latest decision of the ODS Executive Council and the coalition agreement from autumn 1992. However, if the bill is not submitted to parliament before elections there exists clear danger that the government is incapable of implementing its programme and the constitution, the source said. He allowed for the possibility that separate contacts between the coalition party chairmen would continue also in the future. Asked whether a joint meeting of the so-called "Coalition Four" - the chairmen of all the coalition parties - is expected the source said that the meeting would not take place on Wednesday.
