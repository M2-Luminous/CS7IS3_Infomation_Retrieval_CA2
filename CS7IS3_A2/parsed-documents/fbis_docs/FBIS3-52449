"It was his birthday yesterday," Levi's executive secretary said, "I also ordered a cake for lunch as his friends will be coming to issue congratulations." Friends indeed showed up at the Tel Aviv offices of the voluntary society for the election of David Levi, which are situated in a ground floor apartment in an old building, rented for three years and recently renovated, on Balfour Street. Rubi Rivlin, Mikha'el Kleiner [former Likud MK's], Moti Mis'ani, David 'Amar from Nesher, Gabi Lalush from Dimona, Yehuda Bros from Yavne, Ya'aqov Bardugo from the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, Aharon Abu-Hatzera [former Likud MK], Levi's sons, Shim'on and Jackie, and his brother Armond. David Levi has apparently not dropped out of the political arena, he has just purposely adopted a lower profile. At the entrance to the apartment there are shelves with files. Yehudit has glued a picture of Levi on each file. There is a ficus plant, artificial flowers, and potted plants on the small desks. A modern print adorns the wall, and gray carpets blend nicely with the black furniture. David Levi, 54, has organized his network of contacts and political activities from this apartment ever since the last Likud convention. This is where one can find his friends from all over Israel, every Thursday, which is "Tel Aviv Day" for most of the political system. It has recently become apparent that this apartment may also conceal a steadily ticking time bomb, aimed at Binyamin Netanyahu. This is because Levi, despite his self-enforced temporary abstinence from power struggles inside the Likud, will soon face decisions whose implementation may threaten Netanyahu's chances to be elected prime minister. The very fact that Levi has confronted Netanyahu and refused to accept his leadership are already causing a steady erosion in the latter's standing. Netanyahu's supporters claim that Levi's silence is no silence at all, but rather a cleverly muted struggle, which allows the members of Levi's camp to act against the Likud chairman and thus harm him. Levi: "I want you to know I do not sit around planning. I do not deal with this." David Levi holds his cards very close to his chest. It has always been his custom to keep his moves secret until the very last minute. Like many politicians, his assessment is that the political situation will only be clear after the results of the implementation of the Oslo agreement are known. A source close to Levi says: "the assumption is that next January will be the decisive month. It is clear that Rabin has invited the Americans to pressure him on the Syrian track." Another assessment is that Rabin will issue a call for national unity, after implementing the first stage of the Oslo agreement, the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Then the Likud will face a real problem. Speaking off the record, people in Levi's camp reveal their uncertainties: Is it a good idea to initiate a move to hold another round of primaries to choose the Likud candidate for prime minister? Perhaps it would be better to push for a national unity government? What can Levi's camp gain out of generating internal struggles within the Likud? Is there no alternative but to eventually leave the Likud, as was once recommended by several members of Levi's camp, including his brother, Maxim? What would happen if an effort was made to garner the support of 75 percent of Central Committee members for holding repeat primaries for the movement's leadership and it failed, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining at the head of the party? David Levi does not seem to have any clear answers to these questions. One option he was prepared to reject categorically this week was the possibility of moving over to Labor, either with or without his group of MK's, as the late Moshe Dayan did at the time. "Says who?" Levi laughs. "Look, I am the subject of all sorts of predictions and speculation. They make me laugh. I remain loyal to my own way. There is no way I will move over to Labor." However, some of Levi's followers are beginning to lose their patience and are pressuring him to take some action one way or another. One follower says: "There is a real feeling that the leadership is faltering, that Raful Eytan's standing in the polls is better than that of Bibi Netanyahu. So far, Levi has been biding his time in silence, but the day is getting near when he will have to make up his mind." Two trends can be seen in Levi's camp: Some of his men believe he should join Bibi and take second place in the leadership. If Bibi fails, Levi would naturally take his place. These men are encouraged by messages reaching Levi, whereby Bibi is prepared to give him pretty much everything short of the leadership in exchange for his cooperation. This option is apparently backed by Rubi Rivlin, Levi's brother Maxim, Aharon Abu-Hatzera, and Dudi Appel. Off the record, activists say that at this point Levi should desist from running for the premiership, seeing that this is not a realistic option at the moment. A second option: to contest the leadership, either in internal or external primaries and, at the same time, to openly challenge the Likud chairman. Mikha'el Kleiner and Moti Mish'ani are "pushing" for such a move. Kleiner: "In the first round, Rabin would get 40 percent, and the rest would be split between Levi, Raful, and Bibi. In addition to Levi's traditional supporters, many middle-of-the-road voters appreciate Levi and would vote for him. The same applies to religious and ultra-Orthodox voters. There is a chance of Levi coming out first among the right-wing candidates in the first round and then getting the votes of the entire right-wing camp, which would close ranks behind him in the second round." Of course, another option is to keep the present situation: to be considered the No. 2 man, but to stay outside. Given its present condition, such a stance could lead to the Likud's disintegration and force political activists to look for a new home. A victory party was held last week in the home of David 'Amar, head of the Nesher local council and an old-time associate of Levi. Many leading members of Levi's camp are heads of local councils. These men naturally dream of being part of the list of candidates to the Knesset, and a gung ho camp could promote them politically. Small wonder that in the jolly get-together in Nesher some people once again called on Levi to set out on a fight within the Likud, using the excuse of the political situation, the agreement with the PLO, and the Likud's stuttering response. Levi's camp must see to the well-being of the Likud and the country, they said. Levi was reluctant to become personally involved in such a move, but he did not curb the initiative to summon a Likud Central Committee session to discuss the issue. Neither did Levi conceal his opposition to Netanyahu's proposal that the Likud formulate a political plan in response to the Oslo agreement. Without using Bibi's name, Levi said: "The political issue is the most critical to the Likud, to its performance and survival. When the government signed the agreement with the PLO, the Likud should have displayed determination, endurance, and loyalty to its own way. However, the Likud did not pass the test. There were people who talked about the need to discuss the Likud's policy and even to amend its platform." Levi survived the trauma of moving from the government to the opposition relatively easily. His friends decided to keep the organization set up to promote his election in the Likud primaries. This organization also finances all the expenditures incurred by his activities. Its members pay "according to their ability," about $100 or more a month. Incidentally, the initiative to keep the organization alive came from Rubi Rivlin, "so that Levi need not depend on some guy with big bucks." Two of Levi's sons, Jackie (the acting chairman of Bet She'an's local council) and Shim'on (a businessman), bought daddy a Volvo and even drive him around when his chauffeur is unavailable. In his free time, Levi goes fishing in the canals in the Bet She'an Valley. When the mood strikes him, he redecorates his house, tearing down and building new walls. Levi nurtures the political contacts he made when he was foreign minister. He keeps in touch with the Jewish communities in Europe, and visited them three times since the last election, twice accompanied by his wife. He does work for the drug-fighting association and large families. Levi meticulously reports to important Knesset plenum sessions. He does not make eye contact with Bibi, but he submits numerous motions to the agenda. He is very involved in faction meetings. He can be frequently seen in the Knesset cafeteria, always surrounded by journalists. Levi has become an important and appreciated spokesman of the right wing on foreign and security affairs, in addition to his dedication to social issues. It was only last week that he led the fight to secure jobs for hundreds of workers fired from the 'Of-Tov factory in Bet She'an. Based on his experience in the contacts preceding the Madrid conference, he constantly cautions about the dire consequences of the government capitulating in the negotiations with the PLO, warns against euphoria and the legitimization of the PLO. He fears the way to a Palestinian state might be paved by "an autistic government, that is incapable of reading the signs of distress of the people." "There is anxiety in every household, the government is teasing the people," he stated in one of his latest appearances in the Knesset. Nevertheless, David Levi has a real problem. If he joins Bibi and helps him win, he will be securing himself the No. 2 position in the Likud but will be giving up his dream of becoming leader of the Likud and prime minister. If he challenges the leadership once again he might hasten Netanyahu's demise, but he might also fall together with him and pave the way for another candidate. He must also be careful not to be blamed again for the Likud's failure. Netanyahu would today seem to be aware of Levi's power. In the first days after his impressive victory in the primaries, the message of Bibi's men was that Levi was "a dead horse." Bibi perfunctorily called on Levi to come over and work together. However, that picture soon changed. Messages started to flow from Netanyahu's followers to Levi's camp about the need for a reconciliation between the two men. These days, when the right wing is in crisis, the two men should close ranks. A few months ago, Gush Emunim members in Netanyahu's camp tried to pull off a handshake between Netanyahu and Levi during of the demonstrations they organized after the signing of the agreement of principles. It did not work out. Bibi took the initiative and personally phoned Levi in his Bet She'an home four months ago. His wife Rashel quashed the attempt. "David is not at home," she said. When Bibi called again he got the same answer. Bibi asked that Levi phone him back, but Levi did not return his call. In intimate meetings, Bibi's men talk about the Levi-Bibi axis as a necessary and desirable move. One of them told me they realize that similar to the Peres-Rabin match they can either rise or fall together. "Bibi will be ready to walk all the way from Jerusalem to Bet She'an to make up with Levi," one mediator told me. It seems that Bibi will also be willing to promise Levi the job of acting chairman of the Likud. However, Levi does not seem eager to make up. He feels ill at ease with Bibi, and not just because of the videocassette affair. Their relationship soured as early as in the days when Bibi was appointed deputy minister in the Foreign Ministry, as a Shamir "plant" -- at least that is how the Levi camp sees it. "A media old rag," people in Levi's camp called Bibi in those days. Referring to reports about the proposal to appoint him deputy chairman of the Likud, Levi says: "These are rumors, and I do not know who spreads them. What purpose do they serve? Are they meant to confuse Likud members and create an atmosphere whereby there are people who propose, give, and bestow while others make demands and say no? In any event, those proposals are not made candidly." Advocates of the Bibi-Levi axis were encouraged recently when it emerged once again that the so-called Likud princes do not consider David Levi their leader. Even if Bibi failed and Beni Begin dropped out of the race, there is another candidate: Dan Meridor. When HA'ARETZ reported that many of Levi's men support Meridor's candidacy, these hastened to his Tel Aviv office to make clear they were not the ones. An investigation into the source of the report was conducted in the corridor outside, and suspicion fell on Ya'aqov Verdugo, spokesman of the Local Authority Center and an associate of Maxim Levi. Verdugo denied it all, of course. "David Levi is the joy and hope of my generation," Verdugo told me in response to my question about Levi's standing among Likud voters. However, the fact remains that Levi's prolonged silence, the Likud's frustration and general condition have left cracks, however thin, in Levi's camp. When asked about his relations with Bibi Netanyahu, Levi's pronouncements are convoluted and rather vague. He will not even mention Bibi's name. Levi: "I cut down the area of friction. There is a given situation. I do not bother anybody. I demand absolutely nothing. Let nobody say that I bother anybody. I have reached the conclusion that genuine concern for the Likud cannot only come from me. If a struggle is necessary and if there is cause for it, this should concern everybody. I am not the only one who should worry." When his associates ask him about Bibi's performance, he refuses to comment. However, at times he may be heard reciting whole passages of snide comments made by other critics of Netanyahu. "And that is the man of whom it was said that he will bring the Likud to power," he ends with a smile. [Barzel] You were offered, on Bibi's behalf, the No. 2 position and to be part of the leadership. If Bibi were to approach you with a consolidated proposal, would there be anything to talk about? [Levi] Nobody is giving me anything, and I am not demanding anything. There is a given situation. I am not bothering anybody and I am not expecting any proposals. [Barzel] Let us talk about your occupations outside the Likud. How many hours a week do you go fishing? [Levi] Fishing is not measured in hours. I have been a fishing buff since childhood. I feel extraordinarily calm when I am in contact with nature. It feels like yoga. [Barzel] Do you have fishing rods and other equipment? [Levi] Sure. I bring the fish, gray mullet and trout, to Rashel and she cooks them in a special way with red peppers and lots of garlic and parsley. These are my favorite fish. They are fresh and I caught them. Even when I am abroad, I eat mainly fish and fruit, both because of kosher rules and because I love fish. [Barzel] What's your wife's name, Rahel or Rashel? [Levi] I call her Rashel. That was her name when I met her, when we immigrated to Israel. It was the eve of Passover. She came from Casablanca with a family of 12 children, and I came from Rabat with my family of eight. We traveled by taxi, with forged passports. When we reached the Strait of Gibraltar I saw Rashel lifting some suitcases and I ran to help her. Later she befriended my sister and my late mother. This relationship continued in the immigrant camp in Marseilles. Then the time came to immigrate to Israel, and our family's turn came before hers. We separated, hoping to meet again in Israel. We were sent to Bet She'an, and a few months later she arrived here with her family. They wanted to live in Jerusalem, but they were told that Bet She'an was close enough. I had gone to send her a letter, to the camp in Marseilles. On my way back home to our cabin I noticed a big commotion outside. I found her and her family embracing my mother and sisters. It was the biggest surprise of my life. [Barzel] Do you consult her or your family? [Levi] Our family grew with political awareness. If there is a certain situation, the whole house gets involved and we talk about it on Saturday. My children, including the married ones, did not leave Bet She'an. One of my daughters married a man whose family lives in France, but I trust that she will soon bring her husband to Israel. Another daughter lives "far away," in Tiberias. All my children and grandchildren come on Saturday to the warm nest we have built. I do not only love fishing, but also building. Every year or two I pull down a wall and start building. It drives Rashel crazy. "Here we go again with the mess. I do not know how am I going to deal with it," she says. But, all my sons and daughters help out. Small renovation work I do alone, either at night or on Fridays. Recently I pulled down a few walls in order to enlarge the dining room, and thank God, now I have a big and beautiful house. I am happy that my sons and daughters stayed in Bet She'an, that they decided the way they did. They remained faithful to something I appreciate, togetherness. They pay a price for it though. Shim'on, for example, gave up an important security job which would have meant moving away. But, there are rewards. Everybody here has known him from the day he was born. In our town, people who make it do not leave. I did the same when I was foreign minister. I used the official apartment in Jerusalem only one Saturday. Every Friday afternoon we rushed back to Bet She'an to get ready for the Sabbath. [Barzel] And how will you get to Bet She'an when an autonomy is established in Jericho? [Levi] I will drive through Jericho. What is happening will not block my way to Jerusalem. I think that losing the road from the Jordan Valley to Jerusalem would be tantamount to losing the natural connection between the entire north of Israel and Jerusalem, and that is why this will not come to happen. My feeling is that the road to Jerusalem will not be blocked. [Barzel] When you were foreign minister you met heads of state. When you were construction minister you built in Judaea, Samaria, Gaza, and Jerusalem. Is it not hard for you now, without all this activity? [Levi] There is a proverb in Arabic which says: "When times get tough, a man who worked all his life will smell his hands and feel satisfied." I did something for this country. Wherever I go people remember my dedication. Unfortunately, within my own party people are trying to minimize and blur my contribution. But friends remember. Wherever I visit, people call me "Mr. Minister." I say to them: "Ex-minister." But they insist: "You will always be a minister to us." That is nice, never mind the belief that politics is ruthless. Only people who have not been put to a test can be predators, without any regard for rules, friendship, or loyalty.
