Mr. Talbott had discussions with the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other important officials. There was no limited agenda for these talks. The earlier impression was that these talks would especially focus on the nuclear program and Kashmir. Mr. Talbott himself said in a press conference later that they had discussions covering a broad agenda. In addition to Middle East and South Asian affairs, establishment of peace, the nuclear program, Kashmir, and trade, they also discussed bilateral regional affairs. The joint communique issued at the conclusion of his visit announced the "greater agreement" between the two countries and the representatives of both countries called the visit very successful. There is concern in Pakistan over the situation under which the U.S. representatives visited our country. The feeling about the United States in Pakistan was not very good because of the suspension of U.S. military and economic aid, pressure on the nuclear program, and coolness over the Kashmir issue. Every Pakistani was watching the U.S. deputy secretary's visit to New Delhi and Islamabad very closely. If we take a close look at Talbott's visit and listen to government sources, we will not be able to believe that this trip was successful from Pakistani perspective. It would have been called successful if the U.S. pressure on the Pakistani nuclear program was lifted, a promise to reinstate military and economic aid was made, a desire was expressed to deliver the F-16s, the cost of which was already paid, some proposal was made to reduce the pressure put by the Pressler amendment, an emphasis was given to resolve the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions, some major trade plan was brought to light, or some words about Pakistan were said like were used for India calling it the leader of this region and outside of it (even though all neighboring nations are suffering from India's expansionist designs and its craze for war). However, we have to say with great sadness that if we carefully analyze the joint communique, and the statements he gave at the press conferences in New Delhi and Islamabad, we do not see any thing that can hint that the U.S. delegation has proposed any concrete and realistic plan to protect Pakistan's interests. Instead, we see a beautiful play on words in the joint communique and any other words that the U.S. deputy secretary uttered. In the end, Pakistan gets "nothing" and the United States keeps "everything." Talbott's statements and the joint communique indicate that Pakistan's point of view was not listened to. It appears that the U.S. and Indian interests were the big winners in this visit. These goals and concerns can be understood by the points raised below. Mr. Talbott announced in the New Delhi press conference that he needed proof of Pakistan freezing its nuclear program. F-16s will not be delivered if the nuclear program is not rolled back. The United States does not favor Pakistan, will not force India and Pakistan to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], recognizes India as a leader even outside this region, and the Kashmir issue is to be resolved by holding bilateral talks according to the Shimla accord. Let us take a brief look at how these views expressed by the U.S. deputy secretary of state in a press conference in New Delhi support the Indian view point and goals. Without criticizing or expressing concern over India's eight reactors which have been worked on day and night for military purposes or India's nuclear blast in 1974, the asking for proof of Pakistan's freezing its nuclear program is accepting the India point of view. Pakistan's decision to unilaterally freeze its nuclear program was a great show of goodwill and cooperation towards the United States and India. Pakistan did not get any "incentives" from the United States or India in exchange. However, instead of thanking Pakistan for this exemplary act of cooperation, they increased pressure on Pakistan. The talks about not delivering F-16s is also according to Indian wishes although Pakistan was talking about the F-16s that are already paid for. "The United States does not lean toward Pakistan," these words were also delivered according to India's wishes. It was not necessary to say this since Pakistan is an older and more trusted friend in contrast to India. Mr. Talbott's announcement that the United States will not force India and Pakistan to sign the NPT is also favoring India on this point. India has continuously declared that it will not sign the NPT even when Pakistan signs it. The Indian prime minister repeated this stand a few days before Mr. Talbott's visit. The original U.S. position was that both India and Pakistan should sign the NPT. Pakistan would have benefitted from this U.S. stand and it is based on fairness. The governments preceding Benazir Bhutto had adamantly demanded that Pakistan and India should sign the NPT together. The United States had also endorsed this stand. The U.S. announcement that it will not force India and Pakistan to sign the NPT is creating a new situation which will benefit India only. This will, however, increase tension in this region. The words, "India is the major leader in this region," clearly prove that the United States wants to give an "important role" to India in this region. It wants to influence Pakistan's relations with China, Afghanistan, newly independent Central Asian republics, and Iran. The idea of resolving the Kashmir issue by holding bilateral talks according to Shimla accord is also part of Indian policy. Since talks between India and Pakistan during our 45 years of history have never been successful, the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved with these talks. Actually, India wants to use these talks as an excuse to buy time to crush the Kashmiri freedom fighters. The most effective way to resolve the Kashmir issue is to implement the UN resolutions. However, the deputy secretary never mentioned the UN resolutions in New Delhi or Islamabad and the Pakistani foreign minister did not remember it, either. After this brief review of hidden U.S. and Indian interests in Mr. Talbott's statement given in the New Delhi press conference before leaving for Islamabad, let us discuss what he said after reaching Islamabad. Did he give any breaks to Pakistan on arriving here or only decisions that serve U.S. interests? 1. The first success the U.S. deputy secretary had in Islamabad was Pakistan's submission of the proposal to freeze its nuclear program. In other words, Mr. Talbott's statement delivered in New Delhi that "I will get proof of freezing the nuclear program in Pakistan" was recognized here immediately. Even more troublesome is the decision for the two countries to do all this through "confidential diplomacy." What does this "confidential diplomacy" mean? When Pakistan has officially declared a freeze on its nuclear program, why do we need "confidential diplomacy" to get proof for it? The Pakistani people were already told that the nuclear program has been suspended. What confidential information that might create public outcry is left to be told to the United States? The truth is that the secret in this "confidential diplomacy" is the one that made the United States win the Cold War and the Soviet Union lose it. The fear is that Pakistani government wants to roll back its nuclear program while practicing this "confidential diplomacy." It should be clear that Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen in July 1990 through this "confidential diplomacy." As for the proof of freezing the nuclear program, these are the words that are being used to deceive Pakistani people. How is it possible that the United States has no proof of this freeze introduced in 1990? The truth is that just like the way this "confidential diplomacy" was used in July 1990 to freeze Pakistan's nuclear program, it will be used now for taking the "next step." The word "confidential" here is not used because of some international protocol, it is being used to keep the Pakistani people "ignorant" of facts. These words of mine get support from our national hero Dr. Qadeer Khan's careful words, "I have nothing left to say. I will talk when I have something to say." 2. Regarding our foreign ministry's spokesman's statement that Pakistan will not accept unilateral and discriminating restrictions on its nuclear and missile program, [we ask] why did we give up our principled stand on signing the NPT and agree to resolve these issues by "confidential diplomacy?" Further, if the talk about providing proof of freezing the nuclear program is not equivalent to accepting discriminating restrictions, then what else is it? Has India taken such a step to freeze its nuclear program and provide proof of it through "confidential diplomacy?" 3. The joint communique did not promise any military and economic aid to Pakistan and did not mention F-16s. All it said was that Pakistan's military and political interests will not be hurt. In other words, despite recognizing Pakistan's defense needs, no assurance of concrete assistance was given. More concerns were expressed over the situation in Kashmir, but India, who is responsible for all this, was not criticized. The truth is that Mr. Talbott's visit to Pakistan was in connection with "rolling back" Pakistan's nuclear program and talks about a broad agenda was floated to hide this. If there is any truth about this broader agenda, then some decisions about Pakistan's concerns and problems should have been brought to light. However, it appears that Mr. Talbott did "fill his file" while Pakistan's drawer remained closed. All our concerns, problems and needs were just given some flat comments and left as were before. Anyhow, the present government is sure of coordinating the "U.S. friendship" and "our national interests." However, the situation indicates that the government has to sacrifice either the U.S. friendship or our national interests.
