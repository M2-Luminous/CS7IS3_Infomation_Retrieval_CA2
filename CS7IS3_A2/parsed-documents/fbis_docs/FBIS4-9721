FBIS4-9721 "drlat063_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Haiti Chamber President Threatens To Appoint Prime Minister Chamber President Threatens To Appoint Prime Minister FL0104004194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1700 GMT 31 Mar 94 FL0104004194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is threatening to appoint a prime minister if President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in refusing to do so. According to the president of the lower chamber, it is a constitutional duty, and we must think of endowing the country with a government within the next few days, with or without President Aristide's approval. We are two months away from elections in the Dominican Republic. These threaten to be stormy. Various political sectors demand that the institutional vacuum be filled. The Chamger of Deputies president said it is necessary to consider the measures to be taken so this vacuum can be filled by President Aristide as soon as possible. In case President Aristide's refuses, we have prepared a parliamentary plan to solve the crisis and we are sticking to it, he pointed out, adding that patience has its limits. It should be noted, however, that the president of the lower chamber has remained aloof from the resolution bill submitted on 29 March by a coalition of political parties calling for the formation of an ad hoc government. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] President Aristide's categorical refusal to appoint a new prime minister is putting Frantz Robert Monde's nerves to the test. My patience has limits, he said angrily in the presence of the journalists who were questioning him on the future of the parliamentary plan in comparison with new steps proposed by Washington. It should be noted that until now, Frantz Robert Monde had developed and maintained a consensus around him, with the result of a more-or-less normal running of the Chamber of Deputies. In the face of the political caprices of the president of the Republic, however, the deputy from Anse-a-Veau is threatening to give up his role as arbitrator to return to his camp, which is opposed to Aristide's. We must think of endowing the country with a government within the next few days, with or without President Aristide's approval, stated the president of the lower chamber. The upcoming elections in the Dominican Republic can only reinforce concerns, but also the determination of President Monde. [Monde] We are two months away from elections in the Dominican Republic, which threaten to be very stormy. The institutional vacuum is tempting to the political sectors. Those sectors on the political scene are demanding that this institutional vacuum be filled, that measures must be considered as soon as possible so this institutional vacuum can be filled by President Aristide. It is a constitutional duty not linked to any conditions. We must make him understand that patience has its limits. We have prepared a plan. We will stick to it. This plan was inspired in its conception and was not influenced by either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be executed or what must be done will be done. [Jean] Frantz Robert Monde is losing patience. He refuses to be tempted, however, by new political adventures. Since the beginning of his mandate, the president of the lower chamber has known how to cleverly avoid efforts of the Group of Citizens of the Greater North with its Government of Public Safety; the ad hoc government of CARENA [Action Committee for National Reconciliation]; as well as the application of Article 149 of the Constitution, advocated by MDN [Mobilization for National Development] and FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress]. These political formations, rallying within the Coordination Committee for National Mobilization, are renewing their attack, and have submitted a resolution integrating their various proposals to parliament. Here again, President Monde is very cautious and expresses reservations. [Monde] Having a new government is not going to relieve the misery of the people. It is not going to reverse the instability of our institutions, the degradation of the social level of the Haitian people. What I am primarily interested in now is any solution that can contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the people and defend my country's interests. [Unidentified reporter] You gave a deadline of next Wednesday. [Monde] I do not receive deadlines from anyone. Any solution that is not aimed at lifting the sanctions has no viable chance of defending this country's interests. [Jean] To this, one can add that Frantz Robert Monde has always stated that he would be the last to leave his office if parliament is attacked. This obviously remains to be proven. [end recording]
