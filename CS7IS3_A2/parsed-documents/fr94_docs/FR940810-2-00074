SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Accordingly, the following summarizes Notice H94&hyph;42): Regional Directors of Housing Field Office Directors of Housing Development, Field Office Directors of Housing Management Chief Loan Management Officers Chief Property Officers NOTICE H94&hyph;42 (HUD) ISS'D 6/6/94 EXP. 6/30/95 Cross References: 4360.6, 4465.1, 4350.1, H 91&hyph;29, H 92&hyph;11, H 92&hyph;54, 4185.1, H 93&hyph;21, H 93&hyph;94 Subject: Mid-Course Correction II (MCCII)_For Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership (LIHPRHA) and Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act (ELIHPA) Programs This Notice sets forth amended processing instructions for Title II and Title VI. Title II has over 4 years of operating experience and Title VI has over a year and a half of operating experience. During this time, we have received numerous suggestions and comments from the Field as well as the industry regarding program changes. After reviewing these suggestions and comments, we have determined that a number of policies and instructions set forth in the current Notices and HUD Handbook 4350.6 should be revised to speed the delivery of the programs and better serve our clientele. In preparing these instructions, we were aware of the problems some Offices were experiencing coordinating the different review functions, which has in some cases made the program more difficult to administer. We have assembled a combined Housing Management-Housing Development preservation unit to work exclusively on this program. This unit has proven beneficial in understanding and providing solutions to the different review functions. This Notice contains instructions for both the Production and Asset Management Branches. It is hoped that combining these instructions will eliminate some of the coordination problems, provide additional processing tools and the administrative flexibility needed to better administer the program. Applicability The following language replaces that published in this part of MCCII, because some public commenters claim that the language was ambiguous: These instructions apply to all Title II and Title VI processing stages not already completed by June 6, 1994, the issuance date of this notice. If an owner or purchaser made a submission prior to June 6, 1994, or the HUD Field Office did an analysis or issued a decision prior to June 6, 1994, the submission, analysis, or decision need not be revised. The owner or purchaser may, at its option, request that it be allowed to make a new submission or that HUD staff do a new analysis or make a new decision based on MCCII. If an owner requests further processing by HUD staff, it should include with the request authorization to extend the processing period sufficiently, if applicable. All reasonable requests should be honored by the HUD Field Office staff. In no case will HUD staff require a new submission; nor will it unilaterally reanalyze or make a new decision where such action has already been completed. ( Note: In no case will the department grant a waiver to sue pre-MCCII guidance if the owner submitted the Initial Notice of Intent after June 6, 1994.) Summary of Notice This Notice describes interim changes to the Preservation Program: Title II and Title VI, Development and Management issues. These changes will eventually be integrated into permanent formats such as Handbooks and Guidelines. For purposes of brevity, this Notice is being referred to on ``Mid-Course Correction Notice II'' (MCCII). A synopsis of the changes follow.
