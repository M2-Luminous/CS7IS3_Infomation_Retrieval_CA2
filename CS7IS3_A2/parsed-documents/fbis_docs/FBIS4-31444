FBIS4-31444 "dreeu111__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-111-A Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Work of Congress Summarized Work of Congress Summarized AU0506202894 Sofia BTA in English 1929 GMT 5 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0506202894 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, June 5 (BTA) -- At a late-night session yesterday the 41st congress of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) approved a draft programme entitled "New Times, New Bulgaria, New BSP", which will form a basis for the party's programme. It will be further developed and the final version will be submitted for all-party consultations in the autumn prior to its adoption, the congress decided after heated debates. The congress also adopted the basis for a BSP election platform and assigned the Supreme Council to revise the draft bringing it "in line with the ideas and prospects of a left-of-centre agreement". "Bulgaria is heading for early parliamentary elections in the grip of a grave economic and social crisis," says the draft election platform approved at the congress. The final version of the document will be drawn up for the new elections. The party sets itself three aims for the post-election period: to create a new climate in political and social life, to apply a new economic reform model, and follow a comprehensive policy of social protection of the population. In his report to the congress BSP leader Zhan Videnov spoke in favour of the same goals. According to the draft platform, the Socialists are in favour of national consensus, against ethnic confrontation, for Bulgaria's single-nation character and territorial integrity. They support socially-oriented mass privatization and will work to halt the drop in output, to reduce unemployment and return the land to its former owners, after which land plots will be consolidated through voluntary cooperatives. The BSP is in favour of goodneighbourly relations with all Balkan countries, for an active and independent policy, absolute neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration into the European structures. The draft document covers aspects of social life, including crime control, the reform of the judiciary and the welfare of young people. The draft programme approved at the congress was prepared by the Centre for Strategic Studies headed by Alexander Lilov. An ad hoc committee under BSP leader Zhan Videnov made additions to the draft document. It describes the BSP as "a mass party of labour, intelligence, initiative and creativity". As a national party the BSP declares itself in favour of ethnic tolerance within the unified Bulgarian state. BSP policy is based on social democracy, a resolution on the draft programme says. The Socialists will work for the evolutionary modernization of Bulgarian society and state that they are open to valuable and progressive philosophical and political achievements of modern science and civilization. Different ideological trends coexist freely in an atmosphere of tolerance in the BSP, the draft programme says. The Credentials Committee reported, however, that only 30 of nearly 800 delegates represented ideological trends distinct from the mainstream. The motion of the ad hoc committee that the programme be adopted in the autumn provoked heated debates in an otherwise smooth proceeding. Many speakers urged that the congress adopt the programme. The motion for an all-party consultation was carried by 310 votes to 221. Speaking to BTA reporters, the author of the draft Alexander Lilov ruled out the possibility of great changes to it in the next three months. It was on these grounds that delegates voted against the all-party consultation. Lilov said he had voted for it and declined to explain what he had in mind when he said from the rostrum that it was against the interests of some circles in the party leadership to adopt a new programme. Today the delegates decided that congresses will be convened once in four years. According to the new statute, the congress will elect a new Supreme Council. From among its members it will elect a new leader, controlling committee and editors-in-chief of the BSP "Douma" daily and the "Novo Vreme" journal. The congress accepted Andrei Loukanov's motion that the chairman of the controlling committee should be elected by the committee itself and not by the congress. According to the statute under discussion, the BSP symbols are a red flag with the acronym BSP, a red rose and a five-pointed star. For the first time the statute envisages that the Supreme Council will include one delegate from every constituency, elected at a general meeting of the chairpersons of the local party councils. The congress, continuing behind closed doors late into the night, will elect Supreme Council and leader by secret ballot. There are two likely candidates for this position: Zhan Videnov and Alexander Marinov, leader of the Sofia party organization. Former leader Alexander Lilov, now strategist of the party, strongly denied having ambitions for the post. Most observers and delegates see Videnov as the more likely choice.
