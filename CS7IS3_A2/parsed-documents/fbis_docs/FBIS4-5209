Hernandez] [Text] The country's overall balance of payment (BOP) position worsened during the first nine months last year, registering a deficit of $843 million represented a turnaround from a $158-million surplus during the comparable period in 1992. Based on the latest Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) statistics, the improved performance in capital account failed to compensate for the widened deficit in the aggregate current account . As of September last year, total capital account surplus amounted to $1.033 billion, more than double the $454 million recorded during the same period in 1992. Specifically, net foreign investment reached $401 million, 45.6 percent less than the year ago level. This developed as more Filipinos invested their funds in different countries abroad as a result of the foreign exchange liberalization program. Under this program, prior approval of the BSP is no longer needed when Filipinos invest abroad. This scheme further provides that outward investments would be less than $1 million per investor a year if funded by resources from banks. Thus, with such deregulation, outward investment jumped to $1.802 billion, more than four times the $368 million posted in the previous year. This marked increase in outward investments offset the hefty 61.5 percent hike to $2.203 billion in the inflow of foreign funds to the country. These inflow comprised mostly of portfolio investments, which rose from $366 million in 1992 to $1.532 billion during the period in review. Likewise, the medium- and long-term account posted a reversal to a surplus of $1.252 billion from a negative balance of $204 million as of September 1992. This positive performance was brought about as loan availments grew 3.6 percent from $3.033 billion to $3.141 billion. Furthermore, loan repayments to foreign creditors drastically dropped to $1.889 billion, 41.6 percent lower than the previous year's outflows. Meanwhile, the current account balance registered a $2.294-billion deficit during the first nine months of 1993. This deficit further expanded from the $905-million deficit recorded during the same period in the earlier year. The continued widening of this component can be primarily traced to the growing merchandise trade gap. Despite the improved performance of the export sector, it was not able to outpace imports, thus, swelling the deficit further. Exports During the period in review, exports reached $8.119 billion, an additional $892 million or 12.3 percent from $7.227 billion registered in the same period in 1992. However, imports likewise rose 19.2 percent to $12.644 billion from the $10.608 billion recorded previously. As a result, the balance of trade deficit widened 33.8 percent to $4.525 billion during the first nine months last year from the $3.381-billion shortfall in the same period in 1992. In contrast, the service account had a net balance of $1.691-billion surplus. This developed as the increased total receipts compensated for the decline in the payments for non-merchandise trade. In particular, total receipts from the service account rose 2.9 percent to $5.54 billion from $5.382 billion. This was largely traced to the 4 percent increase in personal income from abroad to $1.703 billion. This made up the bulk of total earnings from services rendered. Meanwhile, the country paid an aggregate $3.849 billion for non-merchandise trade during the period in review, $325 million less than the payments for the first nine months in 1992.
