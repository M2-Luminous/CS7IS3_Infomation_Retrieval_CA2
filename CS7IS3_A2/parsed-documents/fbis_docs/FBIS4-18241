The meeting between Berlusconi, head of the Forza Italia party, and a delegation from Bossi's federalist Northern League was due to start at 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) at the media magnate's residence in this town near Milan. Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani told hordes of journalists at the scene that "the meeting will not take place here. I can add nothing more other than to say that negotiations are continuing and everything is going well." Meanwhile Roberto Maroni, the head of the League's parliamentary group, said on radio that the meeting would take place Friday morning, but at a secret location away from media attention. The confusion over arrangements for the meeting followed a statement Thursday by the League challenging Berlusconi's claim the premiership. The federalist movement said in a statement that "the Northern League is the premier political force in the country," claiming the right to run Italy's next government. The statement confirmed deep-seated rivalries between the two parties, allied with the neo-fascist National Alliance in the right-wing coalition which won the elections Sunday and Monday. A day earlier the League had reportedly agreed to let Berlusconi become prime minister. The League has threatened to split the rich, industrialized north from the rest of Italy if more autonomy is not granted to the regions.
