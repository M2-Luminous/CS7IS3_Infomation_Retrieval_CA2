FBIS3-56822 "drsov014_s_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Jan 1994 Georgia Press Service Denies Russia Set Conditions on Ruble Zone LD1901191094 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in Georgian 1600 GMT 19 Jan 94 LD1901191094 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network Language: Georgian Article Type:BFN [Text] The CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the press secretariat of the Georgian head of state has issued the following statement: On 13 January this year the Independent Information Agency IBERIA released information alleging that the Russian Government had informed the Georgian authorities through unofficial channels that it would agree to accept Georgia into the ruble zone if Georgia met seven conditions. These conditions include relinquishing foreign assets in Russia's favor; handing over gold reserves to Russia or mortgaging Georgian state property against imported Russian rubles; allowing Russia to approve Georgia's state budget; and allowing Russia to appoint one of the vice presidents of the republic's National Bank by the Russian Government. The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is authorized to state that neither it nor the Cabinet of Ministers, the relevant ministries and agencies, or the head of state possess any documents confirming the above-mentioned information. According to information in our possession, principles of the ruble zone formation are still being formulated. There are differing opinions in this regard among the Commonwealth member states. It should also be noted that none of the drafts being considered includes the conditions listed in the report released by IBERIA. Moreover, conditions for republics' entry into the ruble zone can only be decided on the basis of bilateral talks with individual republics. No one has had such talks with Georgia, which reaffirms the erroneousness of the released information. There is an impression that certain forces are deliberately trying to mislead the population and use methods unacceptable in journalism as well as nonobjective information to prejudice public opinion. It is also regrettable that the newspaper AKHALGAZRDA IVERIELI [young Iberian] has published the above-mentioned information without checking it first. The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is authorized to state that the Independent Information Agency IBERIA has more than once released unchecked information like this. Therefore, the press secretariat believes that when releasing information like this, which does not contribute to the objective coverage of a problem, it is always necessary to indicate the source of the information to prevent similar inaccuracies.
