The ministry presented its fiscal reform policy with a five-year budget outlook through fiscal 1997 in a report submitted to the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, which started deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget Tuesday. The report takes into account neither the planned income and other tax cuts for calendar 1994 nor the deficit-covering bonds to cover the tax cuts since the ruling coalition parties are still to decide on permanent tax reform by the end of the year. Given such uncertainties, the ministry does not actually believe future budgets will match the estimates of the report, a budget bureau official told reporters. The report said budget outlays must be reduced by more than 7 trillion yen annually over three years starting in fiscal 1995 to match the anticipated tight revenues and avoid excessive bond issuance. On the revenue side, the ministry estimates that 850 trillion yen from bonds must be trimmed annually to hold bond revenues to 5 percent of the budget outlays in fiscal 1999. The share of bond revenues in the fiscal 1994 budget is estimated at 18.7 percent, up from 11.2 percent in the initial fiscal 1993 budget and the highest since 19.4 percent in fiscal 1987. The report came after the ministry postponed its five-year target of reducing bond reliance to 5 percent of the budget by fiscal 1995. When accounting for fiscal reform, the ministry expects the outstanding bond balance, excluding 3.13 trillion yen in deficit- financing bonds to cover the tax cuts, to peak in fiscal 2002 at 211.40 trillion yen after rising steadily from 197.50 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. If red-ink bonds for covering the tax cuts are included, the ministry estimates the balance will top 200 trillion yen for the first time in fiscal 1994 to reach 201 trillion yen. But even if the bond balance peaks in fiscal 2002, the ministry estimates it will remain at the 200 trillion yen level until at least fiscal 2007. The ministry has been insisting the government tackle the swelling bond balance since higher debt-servicing costs would put a squeeze on policy expenditures.
