"France and Belgium are thinking along the same lines on this matter," a Belgian diplomatic source stated. The question of a ministerial declaration to be added to the final document establishing the agreement of the 117 GATT members on greater liberalization of world trade has yet to be settled. Several signatory countries are opposed to it and the European Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who negotiated on behalf of the Twelve, is reportedly in favor of a general declaration which they would all support. "The EU must submit a text offering a broader vision of links between trade and the environment, and between trade and social protection," a Belgian source indicated. These questions "received too little attention during the Uruguay Round," Robert Urbain, the Belgian European affairs minister, told his colleagues at the Council of Ministers. "We must make the most of the Marrakech conference to make up for this shortcoming, and in sufficiently broad terms to lay down genuine avenues for future thought rather than simply listing the most flagrant excesses such as slavery or forced labor," he added. Belgium therefore recommends the drawing up of "an agenda for the future" in order to strengthen "the link between social rights, the environment and trade," Mr. Urbain stated. France and Belgium head the "maximalists" who favor a declaration by the Twelve "making it clearly known that the EU intends to see the World Trade Organization launch a global debate on the environment and the social question," explained a senior Belgian civil servant. The Twelve have unanimously condemned the American decision to reintroduce the so-called super 301 procedure which allows the United States to take retaliatory measures against countries which fail to sufficiently open up their markets to U.S. products. "This measure does not directly affect us for the moment, but the Twelve believe that the use of this section sends out a bad signal just before the signing of an agreement that is supposed to commit everyone to a multilateral settlement of trade differences," stressed a Belgian source.
