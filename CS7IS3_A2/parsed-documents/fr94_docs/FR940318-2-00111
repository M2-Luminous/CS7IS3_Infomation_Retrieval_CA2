SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Purpose Section 1142 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-12) authorizes the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to conduct and support research on the outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically. The Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program (MEDTEP) is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, No. 93.180. The purpose of this meeting is to conduct a critical review and discussion of the current science related to treatment effectiveness for common noncancerous uterine conditions, and to recommend to AHCPR appropriate and feasible medical effectiveness research strategies for the future. Topics will address what scientific evidence is available and what is known and not known about the effectiveness and outcomes of treatments for specific clinical conditions. These common conditions include dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pain, uterine prolapse (with and without urinary dysfunction), endometriosis, and leiomyomata (fibroids). The examination of treatment alternatives will include but not be limited to hysterectomy (including all surgical techniques), hormone therapy, other pharmacotherapy, laser technology, myomectomy, and watchful waiting. II. Agenda The opening plenary session will begin at 8 a.m. on May 9, 1994, and provide an overview of the topic and expectations for the meeting. Presentations, which will focus on: (1) Clinical perspectives and issues, (2) economic issues associated with treatment alternatives, and (3) issues in measurement of clinical, psychological, functional, and other outcomes, will follow with open discussion periods. Working groups will meet concurrently in the afternoon. A second set of working groups will meet concurrently on Tuesday, May 10, 1994.
