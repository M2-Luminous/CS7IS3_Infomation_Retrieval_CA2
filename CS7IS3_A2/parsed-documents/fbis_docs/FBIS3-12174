Peres told our correspondent Menahem Friedman that the government had approved tough steps against all manifestations of murder and violence or attempts to undermine the peace process. Foreign Minister Peres said there was a small group of people who posed a real danger to national security. The people who attended the murderer's funeral and shouted that he was a martyr pose a danger to Israel's future. The foreign minister nevertheless stressed that the Palestinians had no better alternative than resuming the peace process.
