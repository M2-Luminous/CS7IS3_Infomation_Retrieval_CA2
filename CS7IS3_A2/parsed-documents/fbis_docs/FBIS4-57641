As a lawyer and a judge, I refuse to issue in haste an opinion on the varied and complex judicial issues raised by the president of the Republic in his 18 May (17 May) statements. It is necessary to study them thoroughly. In addition, as president of the Constitutional Court, I am forbidden from engaging in controversies surrounding the Court's decisions, regardless of whether a citizen or the chief of the Executive Branch himself starts them. 2. The Constitutional Court's decisions, arrived at through a majority vote, are the decisions of the institution, not just the decisions of those who voted in favor of a decision, because neither the Constitution nor the law requires unanimity. This is why the attempt to create divisions and dissension over the Court's vote is inadmissible. There is only one Constitutional Court. 3. The Constitution stipulates the separation of government branches. Thus anything that entails interference by one branch in the inherent functions of another contravenes the Constitution itself. We will have to determine to what extent the president of the Republic's disapproval of the Constitutional Court's decision respects the Court's autonomy, complies with the constitutional mandate established for harmonious collaboration among government branches, and contributes to institutions' normal procedures. 4. The Constitutional Court has ruled and will continue to rule with resolute autonomy, thereby fulfilling its duty to safeguard the integrity and preponderance of the Constitution as stipulated in Article 214. The Court must always remain detached from pressure and flattery, regardless of who exerts the former and who utters the latter. Finally, the public must understand that when the Constitutional Court issues a decision, it does so to meet its exclusive commitments without the need for or opportunity to consult anyone or anything other than the Constitution. [Dated] Santa Fe de Bogota. 18 May 1994 [Signed] Jorge Arango Mejia.
