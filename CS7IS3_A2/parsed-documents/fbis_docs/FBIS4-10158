They warned that the country is risking a class struggle due to the official lack of sensitivity to solving rural problems. Peasant and executive branch relations had entered a stage of relative calm following President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's decision last month to create the Social Development Council, seeking an open dialogue will all social and economic groups. Everything indicated that council negotiations were going to end with a final agreement. The signing of the agreement was even announced for 5 April. But that day the Senate approved a government decision blocking the pardoning of a portion of producers' debts to the Agriculture Development Fund (CAH), which angered peasants. Peasant leaders withdrew from the negotiating table temporarily. However, they later said they considered the position of the executive and legislative branches a joke, adding that in these circumstances they were not willing to agree to anything. "The Senate decision is an insult to peasants, an attack against them that will deteriorate their situation even more," said Alfonso Cohene of the National Peasants Federation. Cohene added that they cannot pay all their debts because they are being paid too little for their products. The secretary of the National Peasant Organization (ONAC) based in Coronel Oviedo, in the country's center, believes the executive and legislative branches' attitude is offensive to farmers, adding that it endangers the future of more than 250,000 families dedicated to cotton cultivation. "It is a dangerous provocation, and the result is obvious because the country is made up of a majority of poor people who are getting increasingly poor and a minority of rich people who are getting increasingly rich," ONAC Secretary Adolfo Ortiz told EFE. Peasants distrust everyone. They no longer believe in official promises. They can make mistakes if they are pushed against the wall, Ortiz admitted, citing as an example what happened at the beginning of the week in Colony Yby Pe, San Pedro Department, some 300 km north of Asuncion. On that occasion a group of landless peasants blocked a road and held four Agrarian Reform Institute (IBR) technicians hostage for 24 hours in order to force a meeting with IBR officials. "If we follow this path we are not too far from violence and class struggle," Ortiz said. The peasant leader announced that national peasant organizations' representatives will meet on 8 April to discuss a strategy to face the derogatory campaign launched by the government against rural demands. "We have enough reasons to walk away from the negotiating table and resort to new mobilizations. We cannot negotiate for six or seven months. We have concrete problems, and they need urgent solutions," Ortiz stressed. Thousands of peasants marched on Asuncion on 15 March. It was the largest rural demonstration the country can remember. Peasants protested Wasmosy's economic policies, demanding more land, better prices for their products, and more efficient sanitary and educational assistance. In the past two months, peasants have blocked several highways in the country's northeast, east, center, and south in support of their demands. They also are holding the largest portion of their cotton production in their farms. According to official figures, cotton bins have received only 30 percent of the total volume anticipated for the year, despite a 15 percent price increase over what was initially estimated.
