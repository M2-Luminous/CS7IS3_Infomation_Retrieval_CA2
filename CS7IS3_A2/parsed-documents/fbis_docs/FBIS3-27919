When the nuclear issue is solved, the government will promote active cooperation and exchange programs with North Korea under the three-stage unification policy which calls for reconciliation and cooperation, the formation of commonwealth and reunification. The chief executive made the prediction after he was briefed by Secretary General Yu Kyong-hyon of the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification on the council's programs for 1994 at Chongwadae [presidential offices] on Monday morning. He stressed the need for national preparations for unification, saying unification is not only a hopeful future of the nation but also a challenge testing the nation's economic and social power. The council must take its root in the people as a trusted unification organization and seek to achieve national consensus on unification. Kim called on the council to increase the use of some 1,000 members in 46 countries for stepped-up overseas programs, saying an approach to North Korea's closed society through overseas Koreans may be effective in creating a unification environment in the North. In his briefing, Secretary General Yu said the council would focus its overseas programs on Korean communities of more than 10,000 in Japan, the United States, Germany, Canada and other countries and increase exchange programs with ethnic Koreans in China in a bid to win their support for Korean reunification. The council will prepare several unification scenarios and increase both direct and indirect programs designed to help North Korea open its doors to the world. To provide students and housewives with an opportunity to discuss their views of unification and thus to achieve national consensus, the council will provide unification forums and classes for them. Yu said the council would name some 300 specialists as monitors of the developments of North Korean and international situations related to Korean unification to make trustworthy unification policy recommendations to the government.
