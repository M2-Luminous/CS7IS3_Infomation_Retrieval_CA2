TRUD carries an interview with Vycheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president. Evaluating the practical consequences of the actions of the president of Russia as regards the conflict over Sarajevo, the press secretary said in particular: "Boris Yeltsin's initiative has led to Russia's big diplomatic triumph on both european and world scale... "Russia has virtually won a major battle for her status as a world power. The point is not only in the fact that Russia has returned to the beginnings of its historical politics and role in the Balkans and defended the Serbs who are close to the Russians spiritually, culturally, and ethnically. "Russia has firmly designated the parameters of her influence in Europe and the world. It has become evident that not a single small or great power can fail to reckon with Russia's stand and her national interests. "It has become obvious that no international organisation of universal or miltiary nature can take effective decisions if they fail to take the voice of Moscow into consideration". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA expresses a different point of view on the Sarajevo events. "Russian diplomacy, so far, has no grounds even for a cautious, moderate optimism, to say nothing of euphoria over the 'triumph' of Boris Yeltsin's diplomacy. The creators of a 'new world order' continue to impose their diktat on the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union by at least backstage, separate collusions, if not by air strikes". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article by Mikhail Gorbachev under the headline "The NATO Ultimatum Was the Worst Possible Solution to the Bosnian Crisis". "The West not only lacks the right to lull its conscience by cutting the knot in the tightening of which it itself had a hand. First of all, the West should come to realise that power politics will not resolve anything there," Gorbachev points out. "Power-political actions, particularly if they are directed only against one of the sides while ignoring the real interests of all those involved, will never lead to peace... "Various political options have now opened up for a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia due to Russia. It is essential to try them, taking into account all the errors made. There is no single culprit to whom an ultimatum could be presented". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Sarajevo crisis: "The Sarajevo crisis can be overcome on the strength of Moscow's initiative". At the same time the newspaper quotes U.S. President Bill Clinton as saying that the need for NATO air strikes in Bosnia has been obviated but that the settlement issue has not been resolved and, so, the ultimatum remains in effect". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wonders whether "the 'hand of Moscow' will undo the Balkan knot", drawing attention to the fact that "the numerical strength of Moslem infantry in the Sarajevo area is three times as high as that of the Serbian one at a time when the 'restraining factor', as represented by artillery guns surrounding the Bosnian capital, is now absent". The newspaper concludes that "the way to the south-east, to the Serbian enclaves, has been somewhat 'cleared' for military forces led by Alija Izetbegovic". PRAVDA, commenting on the situation in Bosnia, points out that NATO will not limit itself to an ultimatum in Bosnia. "But, in the interests of a further political settlement, will the 'necessary balance in Bosnia' be maintained and to what extent? ", the newspaper asks. "In other words, the question is whether the Bosnian Serbs' concession will be compensated by appropriate obligations on the part of Moslem forces. If otherwise, it is not ruled out an idea may occur that that was the Serbs' 'one-sided capitulation'. Such an idea may play a negative role notwithstanding any active peacemaking efforts". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the NATO air strike ultimatum: "The threat of NATO air strikes has been eliminatied due to resolute actions of Russia. NATO placed both itself and the entire world in an extreme situation. Europe could have faced an escalation of the Balkan war up to unpredictable proportions. NATO could be saved from itself only by Russia and she took such difficult decision". ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The word of Moscow turned out to be decisive. Russia coped with the Sarajevo crisis within seven days".
