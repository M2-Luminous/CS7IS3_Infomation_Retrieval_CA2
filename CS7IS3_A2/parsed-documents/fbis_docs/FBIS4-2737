GATT's regulations forbid member nations and regions from obstructing trade exchanges with each other, and it will also be impossible to erect trade barriers even if they want to do so because doing so constitutes a violation of GATT's regulations. At present, opinions in Taiwan vary regarding the adoption of measures to cope with the cross-strait relationship following the accession to GATT. At a meeting of senior party and government officials in early March, Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui) noted that Taiwan is feeling great pressure to effect early direct exchanges with the mainland as the time for Taiwan's joining GATT draws closer and also keeping in mind the requirements for transforming Taiwan into a trading center in Asia and the Pacific. He, however, pointed out the need for the government to develop the cross-strait relationship by adhering to the principles and process of the state reunification plan and for applying the exclusion clause so that it will be impossible for Communist China to find fault with Taiwan's commitment to GATT. Taiwan's commercial and industrial circles, media, and some legislators have long questioned the adherence to the principles and process of the state reunification plan in developing cross-strait relations; they suggested revising the plan to realize direct trade, shipping and air services, and mail between the two sides of the strait at an early date. At interpellation sessions, many legislators asked: If there are no direct shipping and air links between the two sides, and if there is no direct free flow of goods between the two sides, then how can Taiwan put GATT's spirit of free trade into practice following the accession to GATT? Therefore, they called on the authorities to be pragmatic in dealing with cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and to not be bound by the inflexible state reunification plan. To realize the three exchanges, they also called on the mainland and Taiwan to recognize each other as political entities. Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said that by citing the exclusion clause, Taiwan businessmen may trade directly with the mainland and invest in the mainland. Xiao Wanchang [Vincent Siew], chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, said that in dealing with the mainland, Taiwan may not have to resort to the exclusion clause and added that Taiwan's response is contingent upon how the communists play the card. Gao Konglian [Kao Kung-lien], vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, recently said that if the cross-strait relationship has entered the medium-term stage as stipulated in the state reunification plan following the accession to GATT, then the three exchanges between the two sides of the strait will of course have no problems. But he also stressed that there is no absolute relationship between Taiwan and the mainland joining GATT and the entering of the medium-term stage of the cross-strait relationship. In pointing out his ambiguous remarks, Taiwan's media said that Gao Konglian has further complicated the issue. Because of pressures from various sides, the Taiwan authorities still have not adopted a clear-cut attitude in dealing with the cross-strait relationship following the accession to GATT. Because the aim of joining GATT is to converge with the international economy and to pursue the greatest economic benefits, more and more people on the island are beginning to question the inflexible state reunification plan. Following its accession to GATT, Taiwan will have to address the issue of the three direct exchanges.
