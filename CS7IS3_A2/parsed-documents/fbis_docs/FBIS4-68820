On whom are we oriented right now? Which leader can society rely on, a society in which theft and deceit have become the norm, where corruption has encompassed the highest echelons of power? On what individual can our youth orient itself? It turns out our fears are somewhat exaggerated. Here are certain data obtained by the Laboratory of Applied Sociology of the Siberian Personnel Center (headed by Candidate of Historical Sciences N.D. Vavilina). Sociologists conducted studies among the population of Novosibirsk Oblast on the topic "How Young People Feel Socially" (directive quota sampling, 1,500 analysis units). Particular features of the material and social condition of youth were identified, levels of income for certain age categories delineated. Reasons for anxiety, attitudes towards the processes taking place in society, and attitudes towards the structures of authority were revealed. Also appearing in the questionnaire was the question: What kind of leader do young people prefer? The sociologists focused their attention on young people in the 18-25 age bracket (Group A) and 26-30 age bracket (Group B). Significant differences between these two groups were noted in the determination of type of leader. Some 49 percent of those surveyed in Group A expressed preference for a leader distinguished by virtue of professionalism and competence. This percentage was somewhat greater--52 percent--in Group B. But it turns out that a professional specialist competent in his sphere loses to a person who is simply decent, honest, and independent of political outlook. Such a leader--honest and decent--is preferred by 56 percent of the Group A respondents. But these young people are clearly less democratic than their older comrades. They clearly desire more than the others to bring order with a hard-fist approach--44 percent. The 25- and 30-year-olds, on the contrary, are more cautious and basically do not trust a leader capable of "bringing order to society decisively, with a hard fist." Only 36 percent of Group B respondents expressed support for such a leader. But they too attribute a very great deal of importance to moral qualities--honesty and decency, as well as to professionalism. The young people surveyed did not attribute such importance to questions regarding whether or not this prospective leader was party-affiliated during the days of the CPSU, whether or not he supported Yeltsin's policies (although there were more supporters of the president in Group B than in Group A), and which party and movement positions he advocated. Of course, we are not tolerant of others' opinions. Only 18 percent of 18-year-olds and 12 percent of 20-year-olds had the courage to admit that they listen to and take into account the opinions of other people. The antiparty sentiment of young people was also manifest. Over half of all groups either desire to give power to nonparty candidates or they do not trust any existing parties whatsoever.
