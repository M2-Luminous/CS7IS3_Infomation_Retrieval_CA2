The airport is capable of receiving all types of aircraft. The airport has been closed for more than 10 months. Under an accord reached by Bosnian Serb and Russian leaders, the Serbs agreed to reopen it on condition of using it only for humanitarian purposes. About 300 Swedish soldiers will be deployed there to protect the runways.
