In absence of his client, Manush Myftiu's attorney read the defence saying of his defendant and though he did not accepted the charge, he said that he considers the jury's decision to be reasonable and requested that the decision should be take his health into consideration. Adil Carcani's attorney requested the innocence of his client, trying to justify the acts of which he is accused. In regard to the part of treatment of the Hoxha family, after the death of the dictator [Enver Hoxha], the attorney said if the Central Committee secretary and the chairman of the former government decided for such a treatment, the purposes were very noble and dignified for the Albanian nation. Kleanthi Koci, Ramiz Alia's attorney, pointed out that this process is of a great importance for the history of the Albanian nation. Attorney Koci supports the innocence of his client saying that he has not found elements of crime and genocide carried out by Ramiz Alia. He said that Ramiz Alia had agreed with the special treatment of the former leadership, had approved the platform of the former secret police, and had made democratic improvements in it. Koci said that Ramiz Alia had approved the anti-religious and anti- constitutional movement in the 1967, and had agreed with the treatment of the Hoxha family after the death of the dictator, all of these acts in the context of his official duties. Attorney Koci appreciated the figure of his client as a former president though Prosecutor Fana has made clear in the first session that Ramiz Alia is not being accused of any acts he committed during the time he was president. The attorney of defendants Rita Marko and Hekuran Isai did not accepted the decision of the pretence for defendant Rita Marko [as received] saying that it is a partial attitude toward this client because as he said, the state of health of Rita Marko is the same as those of A. Carcanit and M. Myftiu. The attorney said he believes that the jury will declare a suspended sentence for defendant Rita Marko. Hekuran Isai's attorney said that his client does not accept the charge for legal reasons. The attorney of Aranit Cela tried to justify the activity of the Internment-Expulsion Commission. The defence attorney of Rapi Mino spoke once again for the way of proceeding of the State Commission for Interment-Expulsion based on the analyses made by him and witnesses during the judicial investigations. The attorney of defendant Veiz Haderi did not accepted the charge against his client. During the yesterday's seance, the defendants also expressed last saying [as received]. Speaking for half an hour, Ramiz Alia considered his charge as a staged and spoke of past and current current Albanian policy. Ramiz Alia did not mentioned the parts of the accusation against him, because as he said at the beginning, the sentence and its measure were of no importance for him, but avoiding the trial's issues he spoke of the actions for constructing the railways, for the last elections in Libofsha commune, for the Anti-Fascist National Liberation War and its anniversaries. The decision for the 10 former high communist functionaries will be declared on Tuesday, June 28, 1994.
