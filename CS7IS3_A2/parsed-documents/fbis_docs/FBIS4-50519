As soon as they got out of the car, Gu Jinchi and Wen Shizhen put on working clothes and safety helmets and went directly to the No. 2 steelmaking furnace to cordially shake hands with workers on the forefront of production and ask them about their production and living conditions. They also traveled to the control room and to the cold rolling project design and construction site to examine the installation of the 800 bloomers for producing special steel. In the afternoon, Gu Jinchi and Wen Shizhen listened to a briefing given by Zhang Wenda, chief manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. After listening to the briefing, Wen Shizhen said: Although the industrial output value of Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased by 5.2 percent during this year's first quarter compared with the corresponding period last year, and the profits and taxes dropped by a large margin compared with the same period last year, its situation is quite grim. At present, invigorating state-owned enterprises, particularly state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, is an important task facing the entire province. [passage omitted] In his summing-up speech, Gu Jinchi expressed the hope that Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which is a "pillar" enterprise, should change its planned economic system into the market economic system as quickly as possible, regard the study of market situation as the basis of all work and let the domestic and foreign markets decide the categories and quantity of products it should produce. He said: We should define the product orientation through the study of markets and determine the technical transformation targets in line with the product orientation. He pointed out: The key to carrying out our province's "second pioneering program" lies in two points. First, we must see whether enterprises can successfully change from the planned economy into the market economy; and second, we must use high and new technology to transform traditional industries. We can gain a firm footing and give play to our advantages only when we are able to produce products which other medium and small enterprises as well as township enterprises cannot produce. Gu Jinchi stressed: Enterprises should clearly understand that they should regard economic efficiency as the central task. He said: Our province once had the splendor of being placed among the front rank of the country in economic returns. At present, the efficiency norms are not worth mentioning. Regardless of what project we carry out, it will not do if we can only make over 10 percent of profits from it because this can only allow us to barely repay the bank interest. Gu Jinchi pointed out: Enterprise management must be strict. Over the past few years, there were many new terms for enterprise management. Actually, how much have we enhanced the level of enterprise management? At present, the phenomenon of lax management is quite serious in some enterprises. If we allow this situation to continue, we will have endless trouble in the future. Gu Jinchi reaffirmed: Enterprises must persist in regarding personnel as the foundation. It is necessary to strengthen cadres' ideological work, establish a strong rank of workers and staff members, and turn them into the main forces for realizing all targets of enterprises. He hoped that Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which once made major contributions to the development of the country, will continue to take the lead in today's process of building the socialist market economic structure and will provide good experiences for the entire province.
