The trucks were carrying Israeli police equipment to pave the way for the entry of the Palestinian police force. The Palestinians were supposed to celebrate the withdrawal of Israel troops from their country, which has been living under occupation for almost 30 years. However, it seems that the bitterness is deep rooted, and why not? Throughout the years of the intifadah, the Israeli occupation troops killed, wounded, and jailed Palestinians daily without mercy. The deep-rooted bitterness felt by the Palestinians became manifest a few days ago when a Palestinian youngster committed a suicide operation in northern Israel against a passenger bus, killing 8 Israelis and wounding 50 others. What is so strange about this after dozens of Palestinians were killed and hundreds others wounded at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 40 days ago in a treacherous attack during the dawn prayers in the month of Ramadan? These conditions, which are bad by any standard, are to blame for the violence that claims the lives of innocent people. These conditions make it incumbent on the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to do their utmost, and to do it fast, toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, thus easing the hostilities that can be eliminated only through cooperation and goodwill. The burden of this largely falls on the shoulders of Israel because for long years the Palestinians have been subjected to acts of murder, oppression, terrorism, and brutality. The sooner Israel recognizes the Palestinian legitimate rights, the better the atmosphere will be for peace to be created in the land of peace, which for more than half a century has been the land of fire. Without greater, faster, and bolder steps toward peace, the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, solutions, and agreements will be prone to collapse, something that does not augur well not only for the two parties but for the entire region.
