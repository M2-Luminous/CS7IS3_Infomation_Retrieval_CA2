FR940620-2-00109 FR940620-2-00062 b. A description of the composition of the local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas. The application must identify the members of the local partnership, which must include employers, representatives of local educational agencies and local postsecondary educational institutions (including representatives of area vocational education schools, where applicable), local educators (such as teachers, counselors, or administrators), representatives of labor organizations or nonmangerial employee representatives, and students, and may include others appropriate to effective implementation of the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative; the respective roles of each member; and how the partnership is organized to successfully implement the planned local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Given the particular needs in high poverty areas, special efforts should be made to recruit and involve community-based organizations which demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and address the special needs of the youth within the high poverty area. c. A description of the targeted area to be covered, and its relationship to the entire urban or rural labor market. Included in the description should be information on specific employer needs; industry and occupational growth projections; and high-demand, high-wage careers to be targeted. Since high poverty areas frequently lack industries that provide high-skill, high-wage positions and that are able to provide work-based learning opportunities, the description should include information for the entire labor market area in which the high poverty area is located. In addition to the description, a map should be provided indicating the urban census tract(s), block number area(s), or Indian reservation to be served by the local partnership; the population of each urban census tract, block number area, or Indian reservation to be served, along with the total population of the targeted area; and the poverty rate of each urban census tract, block number area, or Indian reservation, among individuals who have not attained the age of 22, as determined by the Bureau of the Census, along with an average poverty rate for the entire area to be served. (NOTE: Such Bureau of the Census information may be obtained through a local college or university, city planning department, state data center; or through the Data User Service Division of the Bureau of the Census: Telephone No., 301&hyph;763&hyph;1150.) Population data published by the Bureau of the Census is provided in age ranges: 0&hyph;5, 5, 6&hyph;11, 12&hyph;17, 18&hyph;24, and 25 and up. Since the age range up to age 17 would be the most inclusive in terms of enabling local areas to meet the high poverty area definition [see Section B. 7., ``Definitions''], the Departments will accept data from this range.) d. A plan for implementing a local School-to-Work Opportunities program. This plan must:
