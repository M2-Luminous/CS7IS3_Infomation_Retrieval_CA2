Prosecutor's Office investigator Mikhail Slinko said the investigation work done by the ICCCC last year lay outside the commission's authority. The prosecution started on September 3, 1993, against officials from the Agrokhim Association (today called the Russian Agrochemical Company) suspected of unauthorized transfer of funds abroad, was quashed on February 22. But eight of the 19 volumes of Agrokhim case documents which concern the operations of the Vozrozhdeniye financial and trading company distributing baby food bought in Israel have been sent over to the Prosecutor General's Office, the Moscow Prosecutor's Office being unable to trace the whereabouts of a shipment of baby food worth $1.5 Mn. On January 17, the Moscow Prosecutor's office terminated the prosecution against former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy, whom the ICCCC suspected of illegal dealings with the Trade Links Ltd. company. In this connection, the office the same day started a libel case against "an unidentified person," in which Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko is a witness.
