FR940902-2-00164 FR940902-2-00070 2. Make available information and technical assistance from government sources, within available resources and as determined appropriate by the COTR. This shall include data from state and national accident databases, human factors data, or any other resources within the government that may be of use in supporting research efforts; 3. Provide liaison with other government agencies and organizations as appropriate; and 4. Help expand the knowledge base of collision avoidance systems and enabling technologies by publishing nonproprietary information developed at Government expense in the scientific literature, thus making it available to all organizations involved in research and product development in this area. Period of Support The research and development effort described in this notice may be supported through the award of a cooperative agreement. NHTSA reserves the right to make multiple cooperative agreement awards for the effort described in this notice depending on the merits of the applications received and the amount of Federal funding available. Contingent on the availability of funds and satisfactory performance, cooperative agreement(s) will be awarded to eligible organization(s) for project periods of up to 3 years. Eligibility Requirements To be eligible to participate in this cooperative agreement program, an applicant must be a for-profit business organization (small or large), a non-profit organization, or an educational institution. Regardless of the type of organization applying for Federal funding assistance, no fee or profit will be allowed. While the proposed research effort may require extensive collaboration among several organizations, it is envisioned that during the pre-application process, these various organizations will designate one organization to prepare and submit the formal application. Application Procedure Each applicant must submit one original and two copies of its application package to: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NAD&hyph;30), ATTN: Henrietta Mosley, 400 Seventh Street SW., room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. Only complete application packages received on or before October 15, 1994 shall be considered. Submission of three additional copies will expedite processing, but is not required. The applicant shall specifically identify any information in the application for which confidentiality is requested, in accordance with the procedures of 49 CFR Part 512, Confidential Business Information. Application Contents 1. The application package must be submitted with OMB Standard Form 424 (Rev. 4&hyph;88, including 424A and 424B), with the required information filled in and the certified assurances included. While the Form 424&hyph;A deals with budget information, and Section B identifies budget categories, the available space does not permit a level of detail which is sufficient for a meaningful evaluation of proposed costs. A supplemental sheet should be provided which presents a detailed breakdown of the proposed costs, as well as the costs which the applicant proposes to contribute in support of this effort, or any additional financial commitment made by other sources. The budget detail shall include all cost components of the project. Labor categories, hourly labor rates, and projected labor hours for each category should be included, as well as all materials, computer time, test facility fees, etc. For planning purposes, the required briefings, during the agreement performance period, will be conducted at NHTSA in Washington, DC. 2. Applicants shall include a program narrative statement which includes the following: a. A statement of work describing the development of the prototype heavy vehicle communication and powering enhancement system(s). All phases of the system(s) development should be described in sufficient detail to demonstrate technical and administrative proficiency in each area of the project (e.g., vehicle communication and powering enhancement devices, assessing system performance, obtaining test vehicles, assembling the system hardware, etc.). Specific details on product development should be included; for example, a system requiring sensors should include information on whether those sensors are off-the-shelf or are to be developed as part of the research effort. b. The proposed program director and other key personnel identified for participation in the proposed research effort, including a description of the project team and individual qualifications and their respective organizational responsibilities. c. A description of the test facilities and equipment currently available or to be obtained for use in conducting the proposed research effort. d. A description of the applicant's previous experience or on-going research programs that are related to this proposed research effort. e. A detailed schedule, and management plan for the proposed research effort, to include: 1. A detailed task schedule, Gantt, or PERT chart to show the duration, relationship and sequencing of proposed tasks, sub tasks, project milestones, and project deliverables. 2. A management plan that reflects the capability to direct and coordinate the project tasks and administrative activities among the team member organizations.
