This project investment company will set up a joint venture with a major European integrated circuit company to engage in the manufacture of chips and the finishing process for grad-scale integrated circuits in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is estimated that the entire production scale will entail a total investment of over $1 billion (about 7.7 billion Hong Kong dollars). Wang Dianpu, director of the Shenzhen Saige [6357 2706] Group, a major shareholder in the Chinese investment company, indicated when attending a meeting marking the establishment of the project's Chinese investment company in Shenzhen yesterday, that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit Project is a national-level high-tech project which was approved by the State Planning Commission in July 1991 and which has the backing of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and relevant leaders of the State Council. After more than two years' preparation, the project's Chinese investment company, namely Shenzhen Saige High-Tech Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, was finally set up in Shenzhen with a registered capital of 280 million yuan. The company has the following five shareholders: The Shenzhen Saige Group as the assets trustee for the Shenzhen Government (with a 62.2-percent shareholders' rights); the Shenzhen New Industry Investment Company Incorporated (with 7.1 percent shareholders' rights); the Shenzhen Urban Construction Group (with a 12.5-percent shareholders' right); the Shenzhen Zhongcheng Electronics Industrial Investment Joint-Stock Company Limited (with a 10.7-percent shareholders' right); and the Shenzhen Changhe Industrial Company Limited (with a 7.1-percent shareholders' right; this company is a joint venture between Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings Limited, Hutchison Whampoa Company Limited, and relevant companies in Shenzhen). Wang Dianpu also noted that it is just a temporary arrangement that the company consists of the aforementioned five shareholders only and the company plans to invite a number of major enterprises in Shenzhen to be shareholders. Wang Dianpu pointed out that the Shenzhen Saige High-Tech Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, during the coming period, will place stress on developing the design, manufacture, packing, testing technology, and supplementary industries for grand-scale integrated circuits. To this end, the company will make full use of all preferential policies granted by the state; develop new and high technology; carry out diversified operations; uphold the orientation of internationalizing investment, product, market, technology, able personnel, and management; and explore and create a new pattern for China's new- and high-tech industries. From a long-term point of view, the company plans to turn itself into a pluralistic transnational company with real economic strength. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit Project will be developed by phases in the form of a Sino-foreign joint venture. The first phase of the project includes the establishment of a factory and design center in Shenzhen's Futian Bonded Zone for the finishing prossess for grand-scale integrated circuits, which will occupy an area of 37,000 square meters. The joint venture will introduce world first class production equipment and technology for the design, packaging, and testing of integrated circuits of all kinds. The designed production capacity in the first phase is expected to be 318 million pieces of packaged integrated circuits and most of the products will be sold overseas. Entailing a total investment of nearly $1 billion, the project will be jointly developed by the Chinese investment company and an international first class microelectronics company. The integrated circuit packaging and testing factory for the joint venture will have the country's highest output volume, largest production scale, and most advanced technologies. The establishment of this project is of great strategic significance to enhancing the level of China's electronic industry, narrowing the gap between the electronic technologies of China and the world, building up an electronic industrial base in southern China, and to pushing forward the industrial development of the Zhu Jiang Delta. The second phase of the project includes the establishment of a world standard factory in Hong Kong for the initial processing of grand-scale integrated circuits, thus turning the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region into China's integrated circuit production and export base. It has been learned that a 34,000 square meter factory for this purpose will be set up in Hong Kong's Tai Po industrial town, which the Saige Group purchased earlier. Recently, Hong Kong's Industrial Department planned to withdraw the land as no construction had been carried out on it long after the purchase; however, the Industrial Department recently agreed to an extension. An investment of over $1 billion is needed for both the initial and finishing processes to develop to an appropriate scale. At present, the first phase of construction has entered the contract-signing stage and the foreign partner is a first class major European integrated circuit company. Both the Chinese and foreign parties have agreed to examine and approve the Chinese and English versions of three contracts in early February; examine memorandums and the constitution of the joint venture; and sign the three formal contracts upon the approval of the boards of directors on both sides. According to relevant plans, after the factory for the finishing process is set up in Shenzhen's Futian Bonded Zone, it will first engage itself in processing materials supplied by clients to gain initial economic results; it will then expand the production scale according to market changes and attain rollover development relying mainly on the efficiency of the joint venture. The finishing process is expected to be put into production next year.
