"We have agreed to cooperate even more," said General Grachev. South Korea and Russia also officially expressed their satisfaction with the level of understanding achieved in the spirit of a similar declaration previously signed. Moscow proposed, and this was supported in principle in Seoul, that a joint group of experts in the military-political area be set up to develop the concept of a system of collective security in the Asia-Pacific region. General Grachev hopes to draw experts from other interested countries into such consultations of experts (the USA, China, North Korea and others). Pavel Grachev expressed "concern over the situation of nuclear affairs in North Korea." Moscow considers Pyongyang's withdrawal from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be extremely undesirable. In the future certain measures "to influence" (pressure) North Korea are possible, fairly mild ones at first. This extremely friendly reception of the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea in Moscow is obviously the first bell for Pyongyang. General Lee Byung Tae announced that "we have found a common point of view on those measures which must be taken to prevent the situation in the region from deteriorating. North Korea must remain within the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and become a full and, most important, a responsible member of the international community." Pavel Grachev accepted an official invitation to visit Korea in '95. Russia's minister expressed his hope that it would be possible at that time to sign agreements on closer cooperation with South Korea, including agreements in the technical military area. General Lee Byung Tae, in turn, promised to do everything possible to see that a future visit by our minister to Seoul would be fruitful. Recently the Japanese press has written extensively about the sale of old Russian submarines to North Korea for scrap through the intermediary of a Japanese company. Feliks Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation's Navy, however, has assured a SEGODNYA corespondent that this matter "was not raised" at all in the talks with South Korea's defense minister. All of official Seoul's attention is focused on Pyongyang's possible nuclear armament. Old submarines are apparently of interest only to the journalists.
