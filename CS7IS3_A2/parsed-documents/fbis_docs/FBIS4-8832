Did anyone propose that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev should replace Prof. Berov? [Vasilev] The ASP Executive Council discussed actions that the government in its present form should undertake to speed up privatization -- which is the sole condition for the cabinet's survival. We give the cabinet one last chance to sign the new agreement with the international financial institutions. This can happen before the beginning of June, but only if the process of privatization is really started. The measures we are recommending to the ministerial team will enable it to save its own skin. Unfortunately, the people in Bulgaria who know how to govern receive no support to do just this. We do not envisage a cabinet reshuffle, and have not proposed anyone for prime minister. At the very least, it is improper to do this before Prof. Berov has completely restored his state of health. However, we set the present cabinet team one emphatic condition: Either it should elucidate what powers the ministers have for launching the privatization, or we will bear no responsibility for the failure of the government's program. They must untie Valentin Karabashev's hands to permit him to act within his delegated sphere of responsibility, or else we will withdraw our representatives from this cabinet. [Naydenova] Why do the ASP experts think that the privatization process has failed to move from its stalemate position, given that parliament recently passed the Privatization Act and that, at the very outset when it was formed, the government stated its firm intention to apply this law. [Vasilev] The law is a matter with which our own party team has been concerned, and it is not a bad basis for real actions. It needs to be amended, but can operate even in its present form. The launch of privatization is being postponed because real economic groupings (not the ones that occupy the front pages of the newspapers) are not yet ready to take part in it, so they are delaying the process by all possible means. To this one must add the lack of readiness on the part of the labor collectives in the enterprises that are likely to be privatized, as well as the vast bureaucratic administration that is being deliberately maintained and makes the process much more difficult. The ASP believes that the mass and market privatizations should be launched simultaneously, but one cannot expect any quick results from the former during the next few months, or even the next few years. [Naydenova] Do you think that the cabinet can work as a team in its present form? [Vasilev] Unfortunately, the formula according to which the government was formed was incorrect from the very outset. At the beginning of its term in office, there were perhaps some faint signs of team action, but since the middle of last year the confrontation between the different tendencies within the cabinet have become quite evident. The cabinet's work has stalled. The ASP cannot be responsible for the fact that its representatives in the cabinet are prevented from doing their jobs. We cannot assume responsibility for the actions and inaction of Matinchev, for example. The country needs a government of political responsibility.
