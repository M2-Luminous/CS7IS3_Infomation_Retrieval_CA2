They invested a lot in China last year. Some investment projects are still under discussion. For example, Anan Panyarachun, former prime minister and now president of the Saha Union Group, is negotiating with China to form joint ventures to set up electricity generating plants in Tianjin and Zhuozhou in Hebei Province. He said that China was encouraging the kind of investments proposed by Anan Panyarachun. China welcomes investment in such infrastructure projects as power plants, highways, and ports. He said that Thai entrepreneurs had achieved good results from their investments in China. The Zhengda Group [Charoen Phokhaphan Group] has already invested in 26 [as published] provinces. Asked whether or not the recent visit to Thailand by Taiwan's Li Teng-hui will affect Thai-Chinese economic relations, the Chinese commercial counselor said there would be no impact. The investment atmosphere in China is good; entrepreneurs invest in areas that have a favorable investment atmosphere. In business circles, businessmen will not get involved in politics. So he believes that the visit will not affect investment activities between the two countries. He said that China has a population of 1.2 billion people, a vast market for products.
