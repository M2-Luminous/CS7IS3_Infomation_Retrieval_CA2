Casas has said that although he respects Dr. Maza Zavala's opinion in this regard, he opposes Maza's proposed formula, because the nonexistence of a parallel market with the application of the auction system will lead to a single bolivar-dollar exchange rate. Casas briefed President Rafael Caldera on the progress of the foreign exchange market during the course of the week, following implementation of a new exchange system. He has said the U.S. dollar has been revalued, but there is a downward trend on dollar prices. The Central Bank president has agreed with Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez that the exchange rate could ultimately be set at 150 bolivares per dollar. [Begin recording] [Casas] I would say the exchange rate could be set at approximately 150 bolivares per dollar. I would not dare quote an exact figure, because there is a psychological demand that still exists, but this demand has been reduced. You can now see there are no lines at currency exchange facilities, but we do not know yet how much of that psychological demand.... [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Will the.... [Casas interrupting] That is not a real demand; therefore, the demand must continue to go down. [Reporter] Will the demand for the U.S. dollar continue to decrease? [Casas] We think so, because there is still some psychological demand. [Reporter] Will this system [words indistinct]? [Casas] Yes, it has yielded very positive results. First, because the exchange rate has declined, and second, because it has taken us to a single exchange rate, which is very open. [Reporter] Are we moving toward a unique rate of exchange? [Casas] Obviously, as can be seen in the graphs published recently. [Reporter] How long will this process take? [Casas] We have practically reached a single exchange rate. If you see the curves.... [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] stabilization? [Casas] The important thing is stabilization. A country without a stable currency.... [pauses] Venezuelans must have confidence in our currency. This country has much to give. [end recording] The fact of the matter is the government and directors of the Central Bank of Venezuela are optimistic and confident about the complete normalization of the foreign exchange market.
