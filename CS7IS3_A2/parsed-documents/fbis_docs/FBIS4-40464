These reports also reflect the ongoing struggle for the markets of nuclear expertise, he said. Some western countries have concentrated their attention on the traditionally Russian markets and are trying to discredit Russian science and industrial and nuclear potential. He said that out of the 10 cases of theft of nuclear materials over the past 18 months, nine involved depleted uranium-238 which cannot be used for making a nuclear bomb. He announced that highly enriched uranium-235 was stolen only once at the research center Luch in a Moscow suburb, when one staff member managed to steal about one and a half kilograms of this material. "But even this amount is insufficient for making a bomb," said Ryabev. No other instances of theft of nuclear materials which can be used in nuclear weapons have been registered, he said.
