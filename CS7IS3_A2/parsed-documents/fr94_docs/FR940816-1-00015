FR940816-1-00015 FR940816-1-00007 In accordance with 1 CFR 5.9(c), this document is published in the proposed rules category. I. Introduction Issues are discussed in this document regarding policy and guidance that will be applicable to areas that have been designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and reclassified as serious areas. This document also discusses issues regarding policy and guidance on attainment date waivers potentially applicable to all areas that have been designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10, as well as policy and guidance on waivers of certain other requirements applicable to PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment areas, and requirements for international border areas in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. Initially, all areas designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 are classified as moderate areas (see section 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act)). 1 Subsequently, in accordance with section 188(b) of the Act, ``The Administrator may reclassify as a serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area *␣*␣* any area that the Administrator determines cannot practicably attain the national ambient air quality standard for PM&hyph;10 by the attainment date (as prescribed in subsection (c)) for moderate areas'' or any area that fails to timely attain. The EPA took final action on January 8, 1993 to reclassify 5 moderate areas that were initially designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments (see 58 FR 3334). The EPA is considering reclassifying additional areas from moderate to serious. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM&hyph;10 national ambient air quality standards (see Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq . This guidance document is being published as an addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (General Preamble) published April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498). 2 Among other things, this PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area guidance document describes EPA's preliminary views on how EPA should interpret various provisions of title I with regard to requirements for PM&hyph;10 serious area SIP's. Although the guidance includes various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind the States and the public as a matter of law. Of course, the use of prescriptive language is appropriate in those instances where the policy is simply reiterating statutory mandates which provide that States must take certain actions. 2 A supplemental notice was published at 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992, which provides certain appendices to the April 16, 1992 General Preamble. Subsequent references in this notice to the General Preamble are inclusive of both documents. Possible approaches to implementing the provisions in section 179B applicable to international border areas, general SIP requirements of section 172(c), the specific requirements in subpart 4 of part D of title I in serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, the issues involved and the means of resolving those issues are discussed in the following sections. The topics discussed include SIP requirements such as provisions to assure that best available control measures (BACM) are implemented; waivers for areas impacted by nonanthropogenic sources; treatment of international border areas; requirements for quantitative milestones, reasonable further progress (RFP) and contingency measures. II. Designations and Classifications A. Designations Section 107(d) of the Act provides generally for the designation of areas of each State as attainment, nonattainment or unclassifiable for each pollutant for which there is a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Certain areas meeting the qualifications of section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act were designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 by operation of law upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments (initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas). A Federal Register notice announcing all of the areas designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at enactment and classified as moderate was published on March 15, 1991 (56 FR 11101). A follow-up notice correcting some of these area designations was published August 8, 1991 (56 FR 37654). The nonattainment areas were formally codified in 40 CFR part 81, effective January 6, 1992 (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991). All those areas of the country not designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at enactment were designated unclassifiable (see section 107(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the Act). B. Classifications Once an area is designated nonattainment, section 188 of the Act outlines the process for classification of the area and establishes the area's attainment date. In accordance with section 188(a), all PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are initially classified as moderate by operation of law upon their designation as nonattainment. C. Reclassifications 1. General Conditions A moderate area can subsequently be reclassified as a serious nonattainment area under two general conditions. First, EPA has general discretion under section 188(b)(1) to reclassify a moderate area as a serious area at any time the Administrator determines the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory attainment date for moderate areas. 3 3 The EPA's interpretation of the reclassification provisions in section 188(b)(1) is discussed in detail in section III.C.1(b) of the General Preamble (57 FR at 13537&hyph;38).
