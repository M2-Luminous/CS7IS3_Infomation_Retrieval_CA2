They also seem to be preparing for lean times. This is indicated by a study conducted by the Emnid research institute for the Chemical Industry Employers Association. Only 4 percent of the more than 3,000 persons polled said that they expect prosperity to grow in the next few years. According to the study, those polled think that Germany has dropped from first place to fourth in the listing of most attractive business locations. The continuing debate has led to growing insecurity among the people, the study says. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are considered either better off or the same as Germany. Only one in four puts Germany first. Two-thirds of those polled (67 percent) said that Germans will have to work longer hours and make do with lower wages, if they want to meet international standards. A total of 43 percent were convinced that German products have become too expensive in the international markets and are thus no longer competitive. Two out of three said that Germans will have to prepare for the growth in prosperity coming to a halt.
