The sharp jump in inflation in the first quarter of the year is quite obvious to all. This is being said by such different people as monetarist Boris Fedorov and his antagonist, Leonid Abalkin. An explosion is in the cards, and no government composition will be able to prevent it. In this context it is very indicative that the "driving force" behind the reforms, Yegor Gaydar, and their chief ideologue Boris Fedorov have decided to "wash their hands," without any longer tying themselves by participation in the cabinet. This produces the impression of a move calculated well in advance. It is also characteristic that in making preliminary terms for his presence in the government, Boris Fedorov acted not covertly, as was the done thing on Staraya Ploshchad, but publicly, informing journalists in detail about the nature of his interrelations with the premier. Now that the radical democrats have disavowed any responsibility for the state of things in the Russian economy, it is quite obvious that the new government will be declared the main culprit for the general disintegration. A corresponding directive has already been issued by Mikhail Poltoranin. Commenting on cadre reshuffles in the government, Poltoranin described them as the advent of "a criminal- political mafia grouping," forecasting with confidence that the present cabinet will leave before May at the latest, under the threat of a Russia-wide political strike. The former head of the Federal Information Center does not use his words lightly, and apparently in the very near future one should expect the beginning of a massive propaganda attack. One can confidently predict that the ex-ministers will be fairly actively using the parliament rostrum to charge the government with ignoring the people's hardships. Naturally the president himself will not be subject to critical attacks. Therefore the new composition of the Chernomyrdin cabinet is in fact a list of "politically doomed people" whose reputation in the next few months will most likely suffer serious damage. It is not accidental that well-known politicians did not hurry to take charge of the bottomless ship. The clever Yavlinskiy seems to have seen through Gaydar's design to lure aboard the sinking ship one of his main political rivals in working out reform strategy, and therefore stipulated his participation in the government by a number of evidently unacceptable conditions. Only "Shakhray party" leaders, who have failed to get enough candidates in the Duma, but on the other hand, succeeded in both falling out with the democrats and losing the president's favor, have agreed to offer their shoulders to Chernomyrdin. Formally Chernomyrdin can celebrate victory. There are no more opponents in the government. The trouble, however, is that the new cabinet has actually "hung in the air:" Behind the White House walls, it is effectively deprived of organized political support. There is no political center at present, while the opposition will never forgive Chernomyrdin his unqualified support for the president during the September-October coup. Moreover there are no reasons that could force politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia or the Russian Federation Communist Party to take on responsibility for the government's actions. The sole guarantee for the existence of the Chernomyrdin cabinet is Boris Yeltsin, who would apparently want neither to seek support exclusively among the democrats nor to increase the political weight of the State Duma, granting it the power to approve the premier. Even so these guarantees for the existence of the reformed government will hardly be sufficiently strong or long lasting.
