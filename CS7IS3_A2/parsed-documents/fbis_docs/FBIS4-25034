It was the first time the ministry published a white paper detailing the country's industrial growth targets. According to the paper, Taiwan's industrial production is expected to reach US$320 billion by 2002, with the annual growth rate set at 6 percent. This is nearly double the current production of about US$188 billion. The paper said the "brain industry" will be the mainstay of future world industry, with "knowledge-intensive" products dominating the merchandise market. The ministry will thus give priority to encouraging development of high-technology, high value-added and high-quality products, the paper said. It noted that the textile industry will continue to boast the top production value at the turn of the century, but the information industry will be the fastest growing sector. By 2002, Taiwan's annual textile output will reach US$34.6 billion, while its information industry production will hit US$25 billion. The annual growth target for technology-intensive industries is set at 9.5 percent for the next 10 years. They will be the driving force behind Taiwan's future economic development, the paper said. In addition to the information industry, the paper said, the machinery, vehicle, consumer electronics, pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries also have great development potential. Traditional labor-intensive industries like textiles and footwear are expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent over the next decade. Machinery output will grow by 1.5-fold to hit US$25.6 billion by the turn of the century, while petrochemical production is expected to reach US$23 billion. The paper said Taiwan's petrochemical output will be able to satisfy 74 percent of its annual market demand by 2002, compared with the current less than 60 percent.
