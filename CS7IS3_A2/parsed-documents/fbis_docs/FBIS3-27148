Leotard expressed his confidence about the developments in Sarajevo but said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would not abandon its threat to bomb Serb-controlled weapons around Sarajevo if they were not withdrawn or handed over to U.N. control by midnight GMT Sunday. He told the ship's crew that the uncompromising attitude must be maintained and NATO would not change its position until the last moment. But he added, "for the moment, things are going in a good direction." French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also emphasized here today the tough stand taken by the French Government, which was the strongest advocate of military actions against Serb weapons around Sarajevo along with the United States. The aircraft aboard the carrier are for regular reconnaissance flights above Bosnia, but the carrier has a more general mission to help protect and evacuate the 6,000 French U.N. peace-keeping troops deployed in the former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, French diplomats' families left Belgrade today. A French military source said six Super Etendard aircraft out of a total of 18 would take part in the possible NATO attacks. Leotard is expected to inspect another French squadron on Sunday at the Italian base in Istrana, near Venice, before meeting his U.S., British, Italian and Dutch counterparts in Aviano, northeast Italy, to assess the situation. After that, he will consult Sunday afternoon in Paris with Juppe, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand.
