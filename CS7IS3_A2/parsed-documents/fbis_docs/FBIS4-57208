FBIS4-57208 "drlat094_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Nicaragua Chamorro Says Deadline Not Needed Chamorro Says Deadline Not Needed PA1305201894 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 13 May 94 PA1305201894 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 13 May 94 Spanish BFN [Report by Vilma Estrada from the "National Newscast"] [Text] President Violeta Chamorro has said that her government has shown clear signals of its determination to settle the property issue, adding that it does not need a 90-day deadline to resolve the problem of properties confiscated from U.S. citizens, as stipulated by an amendment approved by the U.S. Congress. [Begin Chamorro recording] [Words indistinct] 90 days. I have given clear signals of my resolve to settle this issue since I assumed the presidency. We have returned what does not belong to us and gradually resolved other problems. [end recording] Foreign Minister Leal explained that the Gonzalez-Helms Amendment deals with returning properties confiscated from U.S. citizens or compensating them as well as with creating a procedure to resolve this problem in keeping with international law. This is precisely, he continued, what the Nicaraguan Government has been doing. [Begin recording] [Leal] We began returning properties in the hands of the state in October of last year. We began with 40 companies. This is an ongoing process, because as soon as we return some properties, more U.S. citizens appear demanding other properties. [Chamorro, interrupting] I may add that it is not only U.S. citizens but citizens of Spain, Mexico, and other parts of the world who are demanding the return of their properties. This is a terrible situation. We, the Army, and the police must all work together to solve the problem. Everyone who profited from the pinata-like giveaway must return the properties. [Unidentified reporter] What do you think of the insinuations made by the director of Channel 8, who questioned your authority as president during an interview with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo? [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] is wrong because I was elected by the people. I am in control, not Antonio. Antonio, like my foreign minister and everyone who works here, is working for all of you, for the people of Nicaragua. [end recording] President Chamorro presented 21 motorcycles to 21 humanitarian institutions in the country.
