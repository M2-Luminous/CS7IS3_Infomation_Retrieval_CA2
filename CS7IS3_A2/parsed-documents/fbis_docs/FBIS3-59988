In this context she asked for the list prepared by the caretaker government. Drug smuggling has been going on in Pakistan for many years, and it is a great hindrance to our economic progress. It encourages crime and is also destructive for the younger generation. About 15 years ago smuggling was limited to hashish and opium; however, shortly after the Russian aggression in Afghanistan, heroin was added to this trade. Business increased because it is as expensive as gold, and people had gonefrom rags to riches overnight. People who are crazy for wealth, are not afraid of God, and are ready to risk their country, will get into this business to achieve their goals. Over the last 10-12 years, every ruling government has taken steps to eradicate drug smuggling. However, because of the involvement of some important people in the drug trade, especially hashish and heroin, their efforts were not successful. Smugglers managed to escape because of their relations with some influential people, both at the national and international level. In any case, the present government, which was elected by a large majority, has openly declared its intent to eradicat this curse. It has instructed that effective steps be taken in this context. It is expected that these efforts will be successful, and that help will be available to stop the smuggling and the ``crocodiles'' involved in this abominable business. The people of this country will definitely help the government in this important task.
