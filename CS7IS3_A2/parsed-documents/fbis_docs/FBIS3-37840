Yet another "sweet couple" has been uncovered way across the Atlantic -- a high-ranking CIA man and his Colombian wife who provided the USSR and later Russia with information of interest to the KGB-Foreign Intelligence Service for regular remuneration. The Clinton administration has naturally become very upset at Russia which, poor as it is, so unproductively spent $1.5 million to buy the informers. Therefore, they in Washington are demanding that all persons having a hand in such an operation --that is, intelligence operatives -- should of their own accord, with no additional prompting, leave the United States. Otherwise, they say, we will take some measures. It is not ruled out that after such an affront, the Russian special services will announce the detention of an American informer. Traditions should be kept up.
