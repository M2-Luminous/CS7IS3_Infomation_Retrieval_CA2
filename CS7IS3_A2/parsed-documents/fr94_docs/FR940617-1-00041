FR940617-1-00041 FR940617-1-00012 In preparing this amended tentative final monograph, the agency has reevaluated these ``other allowable statements'' to determine whether they should be incorporated, wherever possible, as part of the indications developed under the monograph. The agency has reviewed the `` Other Allowable Statements '' proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in ยง333.85 for health-care personnel handwash, in ยง333.87 for patient preoperative skin preparation, and in ยง333.97 for surgical hand scrub. The statement ``recommended for repeated use'' proposed for a health-care personnel handwash has been included in this amended tentative final monograph as an ``other allowable indication'' in proposed ยง333.455 for antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products. (See section I.B., comment 5.) The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast-acting'' (if applicable) were proposed as `` Other Allowable Statements '' for all three of these product classes in the previous tentative final monograph. As discussed in section I.C., comment 6, the agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definition of the three product classes included in this amended tentative final monograph. Although the term ``broad spectrum'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, the agency does not see a need to include this information in the ``indications'' for these products. Likewise, the term ``fast-acting'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, but the agency does not see a need to include this information in the indications for these products. This type of information may appear elsewhere in the labeling of these products as additional information to the health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not detract from such required information. Other previously proposed `` Other Allowable Statements ,'' i.e., ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s),'' and ``nonirritating,'' are not related in a significant way to the safe and effective use of these products. The agency does not believe that statements such as ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s)'' or ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s)'' are necessary on products intended primarily for health professionals, but has no objection to such statements appearing in the labeling as other information not intertwined with any portion of the labeling required by the monograph. Likewise, the term ``nonirritating'' may appear as additional information to the health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not detract from such required information. However, such statements are subject to the provisions of section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or misleading. Such statements will be evaluated on a product-by- product basis, under the provisions of section 502 of the act relating to labeling that is false or misleading.
