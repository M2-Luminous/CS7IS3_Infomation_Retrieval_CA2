Actually, to put it more precisely, it is preparing to relent. This is the impression that was created by the press conference Russian Vice-Premier A.Kh. Zaveryukha held when he returned from Orel. It is time to recover from the shock, the vice premier stressed. It is time to begin protecting the domestic producer of goods and to supply the population with stocks of its own food. This year Russia will officially refuse to import many types of agricultural products, or at least will not be buying them in the same quantities as before. Calculations have shown that we have enough forage grain, for example. Of course, this does not mean that the country will call a complete halt to integration with foreign partners. It still cannot get by without buying part of its corn, groats, and components for the mixed feed industry. Protection will also be required for animal husbandry, a branch which suffered more than others last year--the output of meat and milk decreased and the size of the herd was reduced. Furthermore, the products of our meat combines are frequently crowded off store counters by inferior but cheaper foreign products. Apparently, more formidable customs tariffs will be instituted for these imports. As for the financial status of the agroindustrial complex, it is more critical than ever before. The reason is that capital investments in agriculture are incommensurate with the proportional importance of this branch in the economy: It accounts for more than 30 percent of the gross national product. And what about the price disparities? Last year the prices of agricultural products increased 8.5-fold while the prices of manufactured goods increased 12-fold. Furthermore, a debt of 1.8 trillion rubles is already owed to the rural community, and this is the reason for all of the unclaimed fertilizer, equipment, fuel.... There is still time to correct the situation, however. The vice premier reported that allocations to agriculture in just the first quarter might amount to 2.3 trillion rubles. Otherwise, the upcoming sowing season could be disrupted. In all, the government has requested around 14 trillion rubles for specific programs. This would be enough to make the agrarian sector work, even if not at top efficiency. Otherwise, A.Kh. Zaveryukha stressed, we can return to the shovel and rake.
