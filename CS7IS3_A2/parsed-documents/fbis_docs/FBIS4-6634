FBIS4-6634 "dreas078__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-078-A Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 ANNEX Australia Evans Discusses Trade, NATO With Czech Minister Evans Discusses Trade, NATO With Czech Minister AU2104183994 Prague CTK in English 1220 GMT 21 Apr 94 AU2104183994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Canberra April 21 (CTK) -- The current visit of Josef Zieleniec to Australia is the first visit by the Czech foreign minister to the continent since the appearance of the independent Czech Republic. Before Zieleniec arrived in Australia, the last stop-over on his current foreign tour, during which he also visited Vietnam and Malaysia, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans stressed that the Czech Republic was playing an ever greater role in Central Europe. He voiced the conviction, which he reiterated at a joint news conference with Zieleniec today, that the Czech Republic had achieved great progress in its political and economic reform since the 1989 revolutionary change. Speaking after short talks with Zieleniec, Evans said that the talks concerned both bilateral and regional problems and could serve as a basis for firmer cooperation. Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic was interested in cooperation in traditional branches -- engineering and the glass industry and that it would also be ready to export Czech beer to Australia, regardless of the highly competitive environment in this field. Zieleniec expressed gratitude to Australia for receiving Czech citizens who had to leave the communist Czechoslovakia. At present these people served as a link between the two countries which helped promote Czech-Australian trade, he added. On the Czech Republic's joining NATO, Zieleniec said that it was not a question of immediate security. Membership was important from a long-term perspective as Central Europe had always been a subject for fights between East and West and it would be difficult for the Czech Republic to exist without certain security guarantees, he said, adding that the Czech Republic wanted to be a member of the West European family. Zieleniec's visit follows Czech Economics Minister Karel Dyba's visit to Australia last August during which an agreement on mutual support and protection of investment was signed. The two countries want to start talks this year on the next agreement -- an agreement on the prevention of double taxation. Czech-Australian trade reached 48.6 million USD last year. The Czech Republic exports to Australia chiefly glass and textile products and power equipment and imports mostly wool. However, imports of Australian wool to the Czech Republic have been diminishing considerably. Since the '80's Australia has been markedly orienting itself towards cooperation within the Asian-Pacific region and was an initiator of the Council for Economic Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific (APEC) which resulted in a dramatic change in the structure and content of Australian trade. More than half of Australian exports currently go to East Asia while formerly they went mostly to Europe and the United States. On the other hand, East Asian goods make up a third of Australian imports.
