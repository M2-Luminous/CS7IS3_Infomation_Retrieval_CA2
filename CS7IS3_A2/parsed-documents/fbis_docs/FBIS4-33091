Minister of Information Jacques Saint-Louis recalled that the VSN corps was dissolved by the government of General Henri Namphy and the dissolution decree is still in effect. But he says he understands some people's fears about a foreign intervention. Rothschild Francois Junior met with the minister of information. He has some details: [Begin recording] [Francois] The Jonassaint government opposes the formation of a new paramilitary corps in Haiti. Questioned about the return of the VSN to the political scene, the minister of information explained that the Armed Forces and the police are the only armed corps authorized in the national territory. Jacques Saint-Louis stated, however, that he understands the attitude of some sectors of the population in the face of threats of intervention, which weigh on Haiti. The minister of information stressed that patriotism under attack requires more social and republican discipline. [Saint-Louis] We consider that this attempt to bring back this corps dissolved by decree, dated, I believe, in 1986 by the government of Gen. Namphy, is a manifestation of people being under attack and feeling threatened; while an American intervention is being considered, it is quite normal for people feel the need to organize themselves. A decree was written, however, in that respect for the dissolution of this corps and we, as the government, do not intend to take a step backward by authorizing another armed corps, parallel to the Haiti Armed Forces and the police. [Francois] If there is pressure from the Volunteers for National Security, would you reconsider this decision? [Saint-Louis] It is out of question. The Constitution is clear on that. Only the Armed Forces and the police remain the armed corps. We count on the population, however, in the sense that the population remains mobilized so that if need be, we can call on the people to assure together the defense of national sovereignty. [Francois] Questioned on the press releases recently issued by the government regarding some provisions of the Penal Code -- an initiative which has provoked many negative reactions -- the minister of information of the Jonassaint government defended himself by explaining that the government only wanted to make a point of recalling that those laws exist. [Saint-Louis] It is just a reminder. You know that with the threat of an intervention, people [word indistinct] and do not know exactly what attitude to adopt, etc. I then thought that it was necessary for the Ministry to recall that there are [word indistinct] regarding those questions. [Francois] Mr. Minister, some sectors accuse your government of wanting to establish a dictatorship in Haiti. [Saint-Louis] We do not intend to establish a dictatorship in Haiti at all. We have a very specific mission and we are going straight to elections. We have some constitutional deadlines to achieve and we make it a point of achieving them. [end recording].
