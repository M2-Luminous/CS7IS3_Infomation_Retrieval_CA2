Rabin made this observation in an address to the Zionist General Council conference. Some of the conference participants, who paraded with anti-government placards, were taken out of the auditorium. Qeren Neubach reports: [Begin recording] [Neubach] [passage omitted] After the protesters were removed, Rabin was able to speak undisturbed. He devoted a major part of his speech to the military threat from Arab countries. Those who claim that the Arab world has no military option against us, Rabin asserted, are frivolous and irresponsible. [Rabin] What is happening today in the Arab and Muslim world? In addition to the Scud-B and Scud-C missiles, Syria has just received production capability from North Korea. And, believe me, the quantity and the quality of the Syrian surface-to-surface missiles makes the Iraqi missiles, to which we were subjected during the Gulf war, child's play. [Neubach] As for the peace process, the prime minister said that the only peace attained so far was achieved after Israel responded to all the territorial demands of Egypt, its negotiating partner at that time. [Rabin] Those who say we should have peace as well as the entire Golan are saying there will be no peace. There can be no such thing! [end recording] [Reporting on the same Rabin address, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 22 June adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that what will avert war is the number of tanks on the Golan Heights, and not the number of settlements. It may be annoying, but it is a fact, the prime minister said."]
