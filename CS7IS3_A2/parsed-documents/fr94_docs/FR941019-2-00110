FR941019-2-00110 FR941019-2-00075 [Finance Docket No. 32585] Donald J. and Carol N. McGrady_Continuance in Control Exemption_Caldwell County Railroad Company Donald J. and Carol N. McGrady (petitioners) have filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Caldwell County Railroad Company (CCR), upon CCR becoming a class III rail carrier. 1 1 Petitioners will own 100% of the outstanding stock of CCR. CCR, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32584, Caldwell County Railroad Company_Lease, Operation, and Acquisition Exemption_Norfolk Southern Railway Company , to lease, operate, and possibly acquire in the future 2 approximately 22.7 miles of rail line currently leased by the Carolina & Northwestern Railroad, Inc., and owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company. 2 CCR's possible future acquisition of the line will require further Commission authority or exemption. Petitioners also control a nonconnecting class III rail carrier, Southeast Shortlines, Inc., d/b/a Thermal Belt Railway (SES), that operates approximately 16.4 miles of railroad in southwestern North Carolina. Petitioners state that: (1) The properties operated by SES and CCR do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Robert A. Wimbish, Rea, Cross & Auchincloss, Suite 420, 1920 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20036. Decided: October 13, 1994.
