In the given situation the only possibility of avoiding complete paralysis of power is to have a constructive dialogue among all of its branches as well as social and political forces in order to create a national program of reforms and to form a government capable of carrying it out. Until the adoption of a coordinated program the Supreme Council shall focus its attention on the following issues: 1. Consideration of the president's edicts adopted in the absence of a legislative organ. 2. Execution of the budget and approval of the budget for the next fiscal period. 3. Performance of oversight functions. 4. International treaties subject to ratification. 5. Expansion and strengthening of international ties. 6. Consideration of laws adopted on the first reading by the Supreme Council of the 12th convocation and returned by the president for further discussion. II The Supreme Council recognizes as a priority the task of immediately providing the maximum possible social protection for the population and making this protection more targeted and effective. The Supreme Council intends: 1. To undertake a number of legislative measures for staunch support of commodity producers. 2. To legislatively limit the authority of the executive power to dispose of state property. 3. To expand the independence of enterprises with all forms of ownership. These measures are needed exclusively to ease the consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy, to eliminate the unsystematic legislation which is ruinous to the state, and to provide for stability of legislation in the Republic of Kazakhstan. III The Supreme Council expresses its hope in the possibility of achieving accord among the branches of power and sociopolitical forces. The Supreme Council proposes getting started immediately on consultations among representatives of the president, the Supreme Council, other state organs, political parties, and other social associations to work out conditions for working on the coordinated reform program. Adopted on 27 May 1994.
