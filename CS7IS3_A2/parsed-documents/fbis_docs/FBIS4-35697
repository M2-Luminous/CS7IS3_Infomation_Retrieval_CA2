FBIS4-35697 "drnes106_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 SYRIA Press Notes `Difference' in Stands on Peace Press Notes `Difference' in Stands on Peace JN0206093594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 2 Jun 94 JN0206093594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] In its editorial under the headline "The Responsibility for the Stalemate in the Peace Process," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his recent tour, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher must have noticed the difference between Syria's way of dealing with the peace process and that of Israel. Syria has accepted the bases of the peace process and was concerned about dealing with this process in both words and deeds. It has sincerely and faithfully cooperated with the U.S. Administration to make this process succeed. However, Israel's intransigence and the Rabin government's insistence on refusing to announce its acceptance of the bases of the peace process, particularly the full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of Golan in full, have brought the talks to a halt and obstructed efforts to reactivate them or push them forward. In addition to this, the paper says it believes that the ones who have caused this stalemate in the peace process are the Israeli rulers because they seek to exploit the peace process in the interest of their schemes of bestowing legitimacy on the occupation, just as what has taken place in the implementation of the secret Oslo agreement, and to bring the peace process to a halt. The paper stresses that Syria has been committed and will continue to be committed to the peace process. However, it rejects diktats, conditions, and blackmail. The paper says: No one should expect Syria to relinquish any Arab rights or land, or to accept secret talks, because Syria, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, has fought with honor and is negotiating with honor, and consequently, it will not do anything it is ashamed of when it holds negotiations for the sake of restoring its national soil and of achieving a just and comprehensive peace. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will continue to cooperate with any efforts to push the peace process forward in accordance with the bases agreed upon in the peace initiative and the resolutions of the international legitimacy. Under the headline "The Real Progress," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: We cannot talk about pushing the peace process forward before Israel announces its commitment to the bases of the peace process and its readiness to fully withdraw from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and all the occupied Arab territories. Undoubtedly, the United States is exerting immense efforts to break what it calls the stalemate in the peace process. However, breaking the real stalemate cannot take place without having Israel give clear answers to the substantive questions posed by the essence of the peace process, represented by full withdrawal. The paper notes: The Israeli rulers lack courage and do not abide by the international resolutions. The Israeli rulers have continued to ignore the requirements of a true peace in order to evade full withdrawal and to peddle partial and incomplete settlements that do not meet the conditions of a just and comprehensive peace. Neither do they respond to the requirements of implementing the international resolutions. These settlements encourage the Arabs to sign the writs of their capitulation similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which placed the Palestinian people under Israeli military siege and put Palestinian economic and political decision under the Israeli trusteeship. Thus, the region has continued to be a hotbed of tension and turmoil. AL-THAWRAH says: Syria will continue to resist Israel's attempts even as it responds to every sincere effort to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. Concluding, the paper says: If Israel does not abide by the bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international legitimacy, efforts will continue to be lost in a waste land. Under the headline "Rabin Stresses Israel's Rejection of Peace," the newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement that he is not ready to withdraw from all Golan, or even to make a promise to withdraw, constitutes decisive proof of Israel's rejection of peace and its efforts to sabotage the U.S. initiative that was based on the land-for-peace formula, the implementation of the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, and the achievement of a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the conflict. TISHRIN adds: Rabin's rejection proves anew Israel's expansionist ambitions and aggressive schemes. The paper notes that the UN Security Council resolutions speak about a comprehensive peace, and not about a partial withdrawal. The U.S. initiative does not include peace for part of the land, but peace-for-land. The paper says: Israel understands peace its own way, not in accordance with the international rules. In other words, peace to Israel is expansion, occupation, devouring the occupied territories, and blackmailing the international community. Therefore, Rabin's stand does not surprise Syria. The paper emphasizes that Syria will not relinquish its land or that of the Arabs. Neither will it compromise on its rights and sovereignty or be dragged into suspect agreements. Syria has openly called for achieving the peace of the brave, the peace of right and justice which eliminates occupation and aggression. Concluding its article, TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for sabotaging the entire peace process and for bringing the region back to tension and turmoil.
