"But I know from my own experience that the use of force only aggravates, as a rule, the state of racial relations and does not lead to the solution of a problem," he added. "In my opinion," Abdulatipov stressed, "the true solution of the problem is not in Washinton or Moscow, as some people believe, but in the land of Croats, Serbs and Moslems. No way out of the crisis will be found until they come to agreement with each other." He expressed apprehension at the same time that this action can be used by chauvinistic forces in Russia to "revive Slavic nationalism". "This is not in the interests of Russia. Besides, this does not settle the Bosnian problem," Abdulatipov stressed.
