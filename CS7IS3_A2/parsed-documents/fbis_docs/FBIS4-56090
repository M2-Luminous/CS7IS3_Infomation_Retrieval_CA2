FBIS4-56090 "dreeu103_y_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal TANJUG Condemns IZVESTIYA Accusations TANJUG Condemns IZVESTIYA Accusations LD2605180194 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1405 GMT 26 May 94 LD2605180194 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [By Djordje Milosevic] [Text] Moscow, May 26 (TANJUG) -- The Moscow pro-government paper IZVESTIYA has recently showed that the principle `innocent until proven guilty' does not apply to the Serbs which it holds responsible for the murder of Russian reporters Viktor Nogin and Gennadiy Kurenoy, reported missing near Kostajnica in the Republic of Serb Krajina on September 1, 1991. IZVESTIYA's reporter Vladimir Mukusev, member of the special parliamentary commission set up to inquire the case, quotes a testimony by `star witness' Stevo Borojevic as saying that the two reporters were ambushed on the Bosnia-Croatia border and later executed by one Ranko Borojevic on charges of spying for Croatia. The Serbs were thus found guilty of murder of the two reporters on the basis of a single testimony and without any conclusive evidence. IZVESTIYA's reporting has been strongly criticized by Vladimir Solovev of the Russian Ostankino television who was also on the investigative team. Solovev said in an interview to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA paper that Mukusev's statements cannot be independently verified. In a series of articles on the situation in former Yugoslavia, IZVESTIYA has always referred to the Serbs as the sole culprits for everything that has gone wrong. The way the paper has presented speculations as solid facts and the timing of the story only testify to malevolence and an unhidden desire to harm the Serbs. By portraying the Serbs as the arch villains, the paper is actually trying to persuade the Russian public that the Serbs started the war in former Yugoslavia. All this is aimed into justifying Russia's position on anti-Yugoslav sanctions, support for a series of inconsistent solutions detrimental to the Serbs and lack of reaction to another Moslem-Croat onslaught in Bosnia. IZVESTIYA believes the Russian public should be constantly reminded of the Serb guilt to minimize criticism of Moscow's erroneous policy towards developments in former Yugoslavia, its biasness, double standards and what some analysts describe as total subordination to the west.
