Today, a wide expanse of clear, sunlit sky was visible over Ashgabat, where spring was in the air. Slogans such as "Welcome Chinese Premier Li Peng" and "Long live Turkmen-Chinese friendship" written in Chinese on large streamers were hung over the downtown's main streets and at the capital's airport. A Boeing 767 special aircraft carrying Premier Li Peng and his party landed at the capital's airport at 1750 (2050 Beijing time). When Premier Li Peng began to walk down the steps from his plane, President S.A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan, who was waiting there, walked forward to him. They cordially shook hands while exchanging greetings. Amid welcoming music, three Turkmen girls in their national costumes presented Premier Li Peng with bread, which symbolizes friendship. Several innocent and lively boys presented Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, with flowers. President Niyazov presided over a grand ceremony. A military band played the national anthems of China and Turkmenistan as Li Peng, accompanied by Niyazov, reviewed the honor guard. Later, Niyazov accompanied Li Peng in cars to the state guesthouse, which is located in a botanical garden. Patrol police and mounted police on large horses stood at attention and saluted when the convoy of state guests passed by. At the guesthouse, Li Peng and Niyazov had short but cordial and friendly talks. Niyazov expressed his warm welcome to Li Peng's visit. He said: The people of Turkmenistan have been looking forward to Premier Li Peng's visit for a long time. They have great respect for China's civilization in the past and rapid economic growth of today. Li Peng expressed his thanks for the warm reception by President Niyazov as well as by the government and the people of Turkmenistan. The two leaders expressed their hopes that in the next two days they can extensively exchange their opinions on a series of issues, including developing bilateral relations. Premier Li Peng issued written remarks upon his arrival at the airport. He said: China and Turkmenistan are friendly neighbors. The peoples of the two countries have shared centuries-old friendly contacts since the "Silk Road" linked the two peoples 2,000 years ago. Since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic relations, their traditional friendship has gained fresh growth. He said: China attaches great importance to its relations with Turkmenistan, and such ties enjoy good prospects for further growth. He continued: "I am convinced that my visit will further promote friendly cooperation between China and Turkmenistan." Those arriving at the airport on the same plane were Premier Li Peng's delegation including Ismail Amat, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs.
