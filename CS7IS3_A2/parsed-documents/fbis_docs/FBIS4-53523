The problem isn't one that can be solved by expanding imports. Rather, a reduction in the surplus will come about when there has been economic structural reform. Why Trade Surplus Continues [Akio Mikuni] It is very difficult for borrower and creditor countries to settle their accounts with each other. This can be seen quite clearly, for example, in the case of automobiles. Japan's production capacity far exceeds domestic demand while, in the United States, production capacity is insufficient to meet domestic demand and cars have to be imported. As a result, Japan has a current surplus. To settle its accounts, the United States must sell a lot of cars to Japan and repay its debt with the proceeds from its sales. But, here, we seem to come up against a dilemma. Since it has excess capacity, Japan can't very well import more than it does. In the United States, production levels are so low as to make it necessary for Americans to import cars, so unlike Japan, they can't very well export more. People often argue that everything would be all right if only the United States were paying its bills. That Americans keep buying cars from Japan means their manufacturers haven't increased their production capacity or their labor force sufficiently to offset the need for imports, but that situation of course won't last forever. [Hiroko Ota] In my view, the current-account surplus itself isn't a problem. If one were to say there is a problem, it's mainly on the side of the country with the current-account deficit and in its having steadily built up a loan balance that keeps getting bigger in proportion to its GNP. The responsibility for that is on the debtor's side. It's a problem for the debtor-country to solve. Textbooks would say there is no direct connection between the trade or export-import imbalance and the current-account surplus. In other words, in an open economy under the floating rate system, the exchange rate goes down and there's an adjustment that way when the balance tilts too much toward imports. Looked at from a long-range perspective, I think the surplus in the current account can be explained in terms of the balance between domestic savings and investments. Because of Japan's current surplus, it is often said we are exporting unemployment, but here, too, a strong connection between the current-account balance and employment can't be substantiated. Rather, a more important factor is the labor market, and I don't think a current-account deficit is the reason that unemployment is increasing. Nor do existing data substantiate such claims. Another argument that is often made is that the growth of Japan's surplus is robbing the United States of effective demand. Here, too, if we look at the problem from a mid-to-long-term perspective, I don't think that argument can be made. In other words, to stimulate effective demand and influence the GNP is only a short-term approach to the problem. The only way to correct the current-account imbalance, I think, is to change the ratio between savings and investments. Actually, what is happening is that the outflow of capital from Japan is financing U.S. investments and thus creating employment. So, I don't think we can necessarily say Japan's current surplus is hurting effective demand in the United States or increasing unemployment there. [Mikuni] If the same methods that we use to analyze financial statements were used to analyze national economies, various perspectives would emerge, just as they do in the case of firms. So, I think it's quite valid to argue in terms of the savings-investment balance when considering the current account. Only, I wonder if we can really say current surpluses don't pose a problem for creditor nations? For example, Japan has been extending a lot of credit to other countries. But that credit isn't worth as much with the yen's appreciation. By continuing to have a surplus, a creditor nation will see its currency valued upwards to a large extent and will suffer a loss in real terms. When the current account balance continues to be in surplus, the exchange rate changes under the floating rate system, and the trade balance moves toward equilibrium. Such changes in the exchange rate are harmful to profits, and manufacturers quit making products and quit exporting them. Conversely, the import industry benefits by seeing higher profit ratios, so it imports more. Naturally, when this situation continues, the gap between imports and exports tends to narrow, and the surplus is eliminated. In Japan's case, however, this mechanism isn't entirely working. There are two reasons. One is that Japanese industry has to persist and keep on producing. Given its system of lifetime employment, Japanese industry can't very well just start dismissing workers. Nor can it do away with its plants and facilities. In any case, what happens is that existing production capacity is maintained and manufacturers take whatever opportunity they can to increase exports. The second reason is that, when profits are suffering in a country where the financial capital market is operating to some extent according to the market principle, rising fund-raising costs will act as a brake. In Japan's case, the Ministry of Finance will not let a single bank fail. Nor will main banks let [client] companies fail. In short, things are set up so that large enterprises don't go bankrupt. The environment makes it easier, in other words, to avoid the kind of situation where fundraising costs go up when corporate profits are down, and production therefore has to be cut back. [Ota] I agree that part of the current-account surplus reflects a structural problem. Only, I don't think the Maekawa Report was right in its approach; in other words, I don't think it was right to consider the surplus itself the problem and to make it the target for macroeconomic policy, do you? Expanding imports in the long term will not reduce the current surplus. I agree it's necessary to expand imports, but for a different reason. Imports should be expanded--not only to raise the level of world trade, but also, for example, to raise the quality of life at home. [Mikuni] I won't go so far as to say a continuing surplus is itself particularly a problem. But when we look at the profit ratio of the manufacturing industry while that surplus is growing and accumulating, we see that operating profits relative to sales for sectors heavily based on exports--for example, of automobiles and electrical products--have been falling sharply and, as a result of declining net receipts from exports due to the stronger yen, companies are no longer showing a profit. For high-level growth, a steady growth in production volume is probably necessary. But high-level growth has become an aim in and of itself. As a result, exports are extremely important for them if they are to maintain their existing rates of operation. Therefore, they export. No one considers such profitless "busy work" strange any more. Another thing is that, when people import products, they are usually profitable, but we have quit importing those things. In addition to these two "absurdities" we also have an "unreasonably strong yen." [Ota] Certainly, there's an element of self-inflicted injury here. The trade surplus and yen appreciation are indications of that, and in that sense, I think the current imbalance is a problem. Another big problem is how Japan, as a creditor nation, allocates funds on a macro-level. As high as our savings ratio is, it doesn't translate itself adequately into a higher quality of life or into questions concerning Japan's future development. Rather, not a small part of these savings is going overseas as credit. This credit is necessary, but at a time when our social infrastructure is so poor, we see overseas credit holdings growing at a faster pitch than efforts to improve social capital. Moreover, foreign credit holdings are themselves exposed to various investment risks, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, so valuable savings intended for our aging population are not being turned toward building up our "stock" at home. Nor are they being linked to the creation of an information and communications network or an industrial base for the future. The fact that these savings are not connected to the future wealth of Japan or its development, I think, indicates a structural problem. [Mikuni] Yes. Before taking a lot of money overseas, we ought to look into whether more investments aren't needed at home. Most important, housing investments haven't really been seriously given any thought. Fortunate Circumstances [Ota] Americans are criticizing Japan, saying that Japan's closed markets are the main reason for our current-account surplus, but theoretically that argument is flawed. It's possible, by increasing trade, to influence the current-account balance temporarily, but the exchange rate will change. In other words, when imports to Japan increase, the yen tends to go down in value, with the result that exports are then increased, offsetting the increase in imports. In the long term, because of changes in price levels and the exchange rate, there is almost no effect at all. Even in the short run, because of changes in the exchange rate, there will not be as much effect on the current surplus as one might expect. That would be even more the case, I think we can say, if we were to increase imports in specific areas like the Americans want. It would have only a very limited effect and not have any influence, in macro terms, on the current-account surplus. So, it's hard to justify the U.S. demands, and I really can't understand why they are being made. [Mikuni] The aim of U.S. policy is neither clear nor easily understood. Another reason--which is different from yours--is that, even if imports were increased to some extent, that in itself wouldn't be enough to reduce the surplus sufficiently to affect our trade or current-account balances given the size of our surplus. It would be very hard, I would think, to reduce our surplus without reducing our exports. What effect that will have on the macroeconomic side would require a separate analysis, however. [Ota] I have a feeling that various frustrations--such as the perceived lack of transparency in Japan's markets, our certification system, etc.--have come to a head and are finding their outlet in the current-account imbalance. But, I do think expanding imports and easing regulations are, in themselves, goals we're going to have to aim for. [Mikuni] Japan's current production capacity is the highest in the world. We have built up a capacity that far exceeds domestic demand. With the end of the Cold War, the United States is shifting from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. As that shift occurs, we will probably be seeing Americans importing fewer durable consumer goods from Japan. With the United States moving in this direction, the Japanese economy will have to move seriously toward increasing domestic demand. This is probably what the Americans believe. From Japan's perspective, too, I would think it is necessary to attend to various unfinished business and expand domestic demand while supporting the world economy to some extent. [Ota] The Japanese are very fortunate right now in that what they have been wanting--to build the social infrastructure and to improve their standard of living and lower the cost of goods by way of more imports--are now goals they can pursue while, at the same time, easing foreign criticisms of Japan. [Mikuni] So, the idea of making the shift--of moving in a direction where Japan can renew its industries and technology, raise its standard of living, and thus forge new products from new domestic demand--the shift, in other words, from a copycat economy to a creative one is really the most important thing, isn't it? [Ota] Yes, I agree. Rather than looking for solutions to the present situation by simply responding to foreign pressure, Japan has to put its energies into restructuring its enterprises and its domestic market. Probably two things are required of Japan. Since Japan's surplus is actually being put to good use in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, one of those roles is to provide funds. The other is to provide a large market for other economies. It is particularly in this role as a consumer that you seem to be addressing yourself, and that, I think, will create the seeds for the future development of the Japanese economy. [Mikuni] Yes. So, the question that's become of the utmost importance is how we are to expand this kind of consumer demand. Surplus Reduction as an Outcome [Ota] I think it was a mistake for the Maekawa Report to say that the current-account imbalance was itself a crisis and then set it up as a policy objective. Of course, if we looked around us at the time, we could see that the U.S. debt had grown and had reached critical proportions relative to its GNP. Admittedly, the situation then was even worse than it is today. Only, it is very important to understand and examine where the problem lies with regard to the current-account imbalance. If it reflects a problem in the domestic situation, then the policy objective should be to find a solution to that problem. In fact, many of those who took part in the Hiraiwa Report suggested taking the opposite approach from the one taken in the Maekawa Report. In other words, rather than thinking that the current-account surplus had to be reduced and using that means to improve our quality of life, they advocated an approach which would first tackle the structural problems that exist at home. In effect, that approach would then result in the reduction of the current-account surplus, it was thought. I would agree, and I think we expected to see these views reflected in the Hiraiwa Report. In the end, the weakest part of the report was the route linking views on the current-account surplus to domestic structural problems. Particularly, in questions concerning the current-account surplus and structural reform, what is important is whether one chooses to get the money to improve the social infrastructure through taxes or through government bonds. Since the current-account balance is what is left when you subtract the fiscal deficit from the savings-investment balance, I think an important route to take in order to improve the quality of life and reduce the current-account surplus is to issue government bonds and improve the social infrastructure. Among other things, because the Ministry of Finance was extremely opposed to the idea, that route wasn't suggested. [Mikuni] Depending on whom you talk with, you get different views and ways of thinking about the current-account surplus. In Japan's case, however, I think the biggest factor [behind the surplus] is that Japanese industries have built up their production capacity out of proportion to domestic demand. About 20 years ago, I remember reading a paper written by Osamu Shimomura. He was arguing from the perspective of "comparative advantage"--if you can get something good but cheaper as an import, then that was the way to go, he was saying. In the Maekawa and Hiraiwa reports, the idea is to make choices based on rational economic principles, choices about which things to do and which things not to do. Like a gardener, you have to decide which trees and which branches need pruning and which should be left to grow in order to have a beautiful garden full of well-shaped shrubs and trees. In Japan's case, the process of making such decisions--I'd call it allocating resources by deductive reasoning--has been to have some kind of goal and then for government to lead the way in reaching that goal or for government and the private sector to be as one in allocating managerial resources. However, with that kind of setup, it is very difficult to make choices--to decide, in terms of policy, which industries will remain or which enterprises will survive or how production capacity is to be reduced. In both the Maekawa and Hiraiwa reports, the problem is in deciding what to do in order to get specific results. New Form of Investments [Mikuni] Everything is macroeconomic policy these days, and to some extent we can expect to see a recovery. But it seems to me that, with the yen as high as it is, enterprises, especially those in the manufacturing sector, are no longer earning profits from their export-related activities. Consequently, I think plant and equipment investments are going to continue to be stagnant. To make the shift toward increased demand, then, we need policy that will give a serious boost to housing investments. As the United States is doing, this means recognizing the interest on housing loans as a necessary expense. If the full amount can be deducted from income, people can buy a home or build a bigger one. The spread effect from this will be quite significant. Again, it's important of course to save money for when our society grows older. But there are advantages, for example, in building the kind of houses now that will last another 50 to 100 years. It would mean no more housing will have to be built when, in another 20 or 30 years, there's even a greater proportion of elderly in Japan and a much smaller productive population. So, in this sense, too, such investments would be very logical. Until now, macroeconomic policy has been formulated in an economy which, if anything, has been running in a "catch-up and overtake" mode and has been an effort to somehow bring about a business recovery. But nothing has been done yet about structural reform. I think that may have been a major factor in the ineffectiveness, in the true sense, of economic policy and stimulus measures until now. [Ota] At this point, an income tax cut or policy to stimulate effective demand alone probably won't do any good. Even in the long term, rather than redistribute resources by way of an income tax cut in order to stimulate already ample private consumption, I think we should focus on the poverty of our social infrastructure. I think we need to put our energies into this infrastructure, and fundamentally reconsider our basic plans for public works investments, not only in terms of amounts, but also in terms of content and the system for carrying these plans out. Since the yen's appreciation in the second half of the 1980's, we have been trying to expand domestic demand through monetary policy, and it was this that led to the bubble economy. Now is the time to put public funds into greater action. For the current-account surplus to have grown to the extent it has means that there is now much broader leeway to expand fiscal expenditures. So, this is the time when we can give our attention seriously to issuing construction bonds and improving the social infrastructure. This is our last chance to do so. But rather than a macroeconomic perspective, policy has strongly reflected the views of the Ministry of Finance; namely, its desire not to severely restrict the budget-making process and also to keep restrictions on future budgets to a minimum. Thus, needed macroeconomic policy has not been adopted. [Mikuni] In the case of public works investments, here, too, we can see that the path which has been taken so far has reflected certain value judgments; namely, the importance of efficiently building up industry. For example, in large foreign cities like London or New York, places with the best scenery are reserved for residential use and for hotels. In Japan, offices are found on those sites. Here, too, we need to change our values. [Ota] For starters, we need to be able to change our way of doing things. We've taken public works investments and housing investments as policies to stimulate the economy, and that has distorted the way things really ought to be done and haven't produced results commensurate with the investments. Rather than measures simply to stimulate the economy, we should, for example, be trying to improve our social infrastructure (this term needs to be defined more strictly), especially in terms of building the foundation for future industry, whatever form that takes, and those things that are related to our daily lives. [Mikuni] "Future industry" sounds simple enough, but actually there is no consensus as to what future technology or the future form of industry will be. How do you make new industries and new technology possible? In the final analysis, only those things that the consumer supports are going to survive. Relaxing Regulations Is Also Necessary [Mikuni] Which is to say, the most fortunate aspect of the Japanese economy right now is that individual financial assets total 1,000 trillion yen. Its production capacity is also quite formidable. If in such a country domestic demand is expanded, it is quite possible to see new technologies and new products developing and those developments having an impact on industry. It is of the utmost importance, I think, to somehow realize this potential. [Ota] Yes. And for that purpose, it is very important to relax regulations. We should have more faith in the strength of the market and government should try as much as possible not to intervene. Another thing, whenever I visit a university, it strikes me how shabby the research facilities are. We also have to build up our research and development infrastructure. And, like President Clinton's information highway, we too will have to build an information and communications network. To do these sorts of things is to effectively utilize our national savings as an objective of macroeconomic policy, and to relax regulations and stimulate domestic investments. In short, it is to aim for the expansion of domestic demand and reduce the conditions that make it necessary for people to save so much. These things will be linked to a reduction of the current-account surplus. We are in a very favorable position to be able to implement macroeconomic policy objectives. Restrictions due to the labor shortage have eased up, and fortunately, land prices have come down. So, we're in the best position now to be able to implement them. If the Hiraiwa Report and others had clearly indicated that structural reform would have an impact, in terms of outcome, on reducing the current-account surplus, then perhaps the United States and Japan would have been able to come to a better understanding or find a better resolution to their disagreements. [Mikuni] In effect, we have to move in a new direction and change the way we have been doing things. In a sense, it is the market which will define that "new direction," but we have to be ready by creating managerial resources that are more fluid. Probably one of those ways is to relax regulations, but it is also necessary to improve the fluidity of things like the labor market, the financial capital market, and our product market. In order to have the kind of system that gives play to the market function, we have to make those market "rules" much clearer and try to maintain them. Of course, such a system doesn't give us the right to act arbitrarily.
