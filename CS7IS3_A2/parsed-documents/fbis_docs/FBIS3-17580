"I had a good rest, notwithstanding the fact that weather was rainy. I even played tennis and had swims in the sea, although the water temperature was only 7-8 degrees. I worked for four hours every day," Yeltsin told journalists before departure. In response to questions as to what important matters await him in Moscow, the president said: "We need to finalise work on a mechanism for the enactment of the presidential message to the Federal Assembly. I worked on it in Sochi, and a group of experts did the same in Moscow. We shall now combine what has been done and will discuss the mechanism together with the Federal Assembly. "Preparing an agreement on civil peace is also a matter to which I attach much importance and which I was also preoccupied with when in Sochi. "I would like very much the agreement to be signed by all parties, public associations, groups, factions, power bodies, by the Federation Council, the State Duma, the government and the president. This would bring about an auspicious and calm situation throughout Russia", Yeltsin said.
