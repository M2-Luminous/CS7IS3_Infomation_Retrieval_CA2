Westinghouse Electric Corp of America and Siemens AG of Germany reportedly desire to co-operate with Chinese manufacturers. For years domestic production of large power generators has failed to meet demand. China, which expects its economy to grow by 8 to 9 per cent over the next seven years, needs to add more than 12 million kilowatts of capacity each year. Capacity is expected to increase from the present 181 million kilowatts to at least 300 million kilowatts by the year 2000. However, State planners predict that the manufacture of large power generators over the next seven years will be short of demand by a big margin. Large generators representing more than 3.2 million kilowatts of capacity were imported last year. Imports this year will account for 4 million kilowatts. Between 1990 and last year, generators of about 47.2 million kilowatts were installed. About 30 per cent, or 13.75 million kilowatts worth, were imported. China now has the ability to turn out 9 million kilowatts of generators each year. Three-quarters are machines above 100,000 kilowatts. Power industry officials point out that insufficient production of generators jeopardizes the government's long-term economic goals. One industry official said manufacturing large power generators with investment and advanced technology from overseas would benefit the country. The official said foreign-funded ventures are expected to fill the gap between production and demand. Economists say the growth in power production should at least match that of the economy. That means a large number of big power plants must be built. Production of generators above 300,000 kilowatts has been on the rise over the past several years. Stimulated by rising demand, production of small machines, or those below 25,000 kilowatts, has also been increasing. In 1991, some 230 small generators with combined capacity of 1.36 million kilowatts were manufactured. In 1992, production increased to 256 generators with 1.4 million kilowatts. Industry officials predict that production will continue to increase so that it will eventually surpass demand. However, the official said more large generators will have to be imported to ensure enough new power plants are built to support the booming economy, the official said. In China, large power generators are produced by plants controlled by the Ministry of Machinery Industry. They are to be used by the Ministry of Power Industry, which oversees construction of new power stations. Foreign-funded power plants in China are usually equipped with imported generators. In large joint ventures, both the Chinese and foreign partners prefer imported machines. By the end of l992, China had signed some $12 billion in power-related contracts with international banks and foreign governments, enterprises and businessmen. Several pump-storage power plants are under construction, including projects in Guangzhou, Tianhuangping in Zhejiang Province and Shisanling in Beijing. Key equipment for the plants is to be imported. Still, more pump storage power plants are planned.
