The detainees included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a special assistant to foreign minister Babagana Kingibe, Bola Tinubu, a former senator, and Olusegun Maiyegun, a former president of the Lagos University students' union, the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said. It added that on Sunday in Port Harcourt, the capital of southeastern Rivers state, a minority rights advocate, Ken Saro- Wiwa, was also arrested. Press reports said he was arrested in connection with four murders. A former president of an association of Nigerian authors, he was to have taken part in Monday's election as a representative of the Ogoni people, a minority group in the state. They have over the years complained of marginalisation and fraud by oil companies operating there. In another statement, Beko Ransome-Kuti, the national chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of about 40 pro- democracy and human rights organisations, commended Nigerians for what he called their boycott of the election. The boycott, he said, was the "unanimous verdict" of all Nigerians that a successful election would remain a "mirage" until the results of last year's vote, annulled by the military, are released. Now that Nigerians have boycotted Monday's election, he urged the regime of General Sani Abacha to resign by May 31 to avert "a national catastrophe."
