FR940523-1-00009 FR940523-1-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 71 [Docket No. PRM&hyph;71&hyph;11] Department of Energy, Receipt of a Petition for Rulemaking: Extension of Comment Period AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Petition for rulemaking: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8143), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published for public comment a petition for rulemaking filed by the U.S. Department of Energy. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations governing packaging and transportation of radioactive materials to specifically exempt canisters containing vitrified high-level waste from the double containment requirement specified in NRC's regulations. The comment period for this petition for rulemaking was to have expired on May 4, 1994. The INEL Oversight Program of the State of Idaho has requested a thirty-day extension of the comment period. In view of the fact that the State of Idaho has received technical background documents regarding the proposed amendment only recently from the U.S. Department of Energy and requests this extension to review these documents and provide comments, the NRC has decided to extend the comment period for an additional thirty days. The extended comment period now expires on June 3, 1994. DATES: The comment period has been extended and now expires June 3, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to: Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. Deliver comments to 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:45 am and 4:15 pm on Federal workdays. For a copy of the petition, write: Rules Review Section, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
