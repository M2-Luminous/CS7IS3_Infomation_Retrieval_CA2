Paul-Henri Morard, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], said two ICRC staff in the war-torn town and two doctors for Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF--Doctors Without Borders] announced the decision in a statement sent to Sarajevo. "They announce their intention to remain silent to protest against the tragic events in Gorazde and their inability to provide help," he said. The ICRC, whose staff avoid taking sides in the many conflicts where they offer humanitarian assistance, said it sympathised with the protest. "They are profoundly dismayed.... They are unable to collect the wounded and assist the victims on all sides," Morard said. The four foreigners, along with four members of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], have until now provided information to the outside world about the Bosnian Serb offensive against the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
