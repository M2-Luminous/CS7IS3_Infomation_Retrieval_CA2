It is understood that the "provisions" clearly define the principle of fairness in evaluating public servants and require that they be evaluated both periodically and on a routine basis and by supervisors as well as the masses. Public servants are evaluated in four areas: morality, capability, diligence, and performance, with the focus on actual work performance. The evaluation criterion should be based on the position, duties, and work assignments of public servants who are rated as outstanding, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. The number of public servants rated as outstanding should not exceed 15 percent of the public servants in each department. The "provisions" demand that the evaluation of public servants should attach importance to actual results and should be simple, convenient, and easily carried out. The evaluation, which is to be made by senior department officials, is divided into routine and annual evaluation. Routine evaluation, to be carried out at any time, requires a public servant being evaluated to factually fill in work records; whereas annual evaluation is to be carried out once a year at yearend or at the beginning of the next year. The basic procedures of annual evaluation, which is based on routine evaluation, are as follows: a public servant being evaluated first makes a summary of his or her own performance; after listening to opinions of the masses, the public servant's immediate supervisor writes comments and recommends an evaluation rating on the basis of routine evaluation records and the individual's performance summary; the evaluation committee or group examines the supervisor's comments and recommendations; and after a senior department official decides on an evaluation rating, the evaluation committee or group will send a written notification to the public servant concerned. The "provisions" also demand that state administrative institutions set up ad hoc annual evaluation committees or groups to take charge of the annual evaluation of public servants under the supervision of a senior department official. The ad hoc evaluation committee is made up of senior department officials and representatives of public servants. The number of representatives, to be elected through democratic procedures, should be at least one third of the total number of members of the committee or group. The responsibilities of evaluation committees or groups are, in accordance with the relevant provisions, to formulate procedures for conducting annual evaluation; to organize, coordinate, and supervise each department's annual evaluation work; to examine evaluation comments and recommendations for rating written by the immediate supervisor; and to examine application for reconsideration by public servants who are not satisfied with evaluation results. To make the evaluation more effective, the "provisions" provide appropriate rewards and penalties for evaluation results: public servants receiving a satisfactory or above rating in their annual evaluation will be given a cash award equivalent to one month's salary; those receiving a satisfactory or above rating for two consecutive years will be given an in-grade step increase in salary; those receiving an outstanding rating for two consecutive years or a satisfactory or above rating for three consecutive years will be qualified for job promotions; and those receiving an outstanding rating for three consecutive years, or a satisfactory or above rating for five consecutive years, will be promoted to the next higher grade of the current posts. Public servants whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory in annual evaluation will be demoted to a lower position job; and those receiving an unsatisfactory rating for two consecutive years will be dismissed. In addition, the "provisions" also provide specific procedures for public servants to apply for reconsideration of evaluation results.
