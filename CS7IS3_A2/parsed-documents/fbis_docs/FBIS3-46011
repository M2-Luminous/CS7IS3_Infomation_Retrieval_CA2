The output value of rural enterprises in 1992 was 30 percent up over the previous year in Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in Northwest China. For the impoverished minority nationality regions, township enterprises have become essential to economic development in rural areas, the officials say. Meanwhile, for three consecutive years between 1991 and 1993, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Central West China had been leading the country in the growth of township enterprises. Last year, their total output value hit 60.1 billion yuan, or 2.15 times that of the previous year. To shorten the discrepancy with other economically developed areas of the country, these regions have been putting more investments into rural enterprises. In Shaanxi Province, some enterprises have begun to attract foreign funds. In the first half of last year, foreign investors set up more than 50 joint ventures with local township enterprises involving a total investment of 600 million yuan. The share-holding system is taking root in such enterprises. Gansu Province now has some 10,000 share-holding township enterprises, while share-holding township enterprises in Shaanxi Province account for ten percent of the total. At the same time, new and high technology is playing an increasing more important role. Many of the rural enterprises are upgrading their technology and readjusting products mix. A number of large-scale and modern township enterprises are taking shape.
