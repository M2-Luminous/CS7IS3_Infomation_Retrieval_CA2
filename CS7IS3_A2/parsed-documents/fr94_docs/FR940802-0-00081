FR940802-0-00081 FR940802-0-00016 (5) A fish trap endorsement that is not renewed or that is revoked will not be reissued. A fish trap endorsement is considered to be not renewed when an application for renewal is not received by the Regional Director within one year of the expiration date of the permit. 6. In §641.7, effective from July 27, 1994, through October 31, 1994, a new paragraph (ee) is added to read as follows: §641.7 Prohibitions. * * * * * (ee) Falsify information submitted in accordance with §641.10. 7. In subpart A, effective from July 27, 1994, through October 31, 1994, a new §641.10 is added to read as follows: §641.10 Red snapper data collection. (a) General. (1) To evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, including individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems and license limitations, it is necessary to obtain commercial red snapper landings data for the years 1990 through 1992. To identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime, it is necessary to identify certain participants in the red snapper fishery, specifically, operators of vessels who were the earned income qualifiers for the vessels' reef fish permits and those who are ``historical captains.'' In the latter case, determination of a historical captain's share agreement with the vessel's owner is also required. (2) For the purpose of the red snapper effort limitation alternatives, a historical captain means an operator who_ (i) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under verbal or written share agreements with an owner, such agreements provided for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who were paid from the share under his or her control; (ii) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992; (iii) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each of the years 1989 through 1993; and (iv) Landed red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. (3) The data collection described in this section will be the only collection for the effort management alternatives currently being considered by the Council. Accordingly, failure to submit requested data may result in failure to be included among the initial participants in the red snapper fishery under an effort management system and/or failure to obtain the full initial share of red snapper to which a person may be entitled under an ITQ regime. (b) Existing data. (1) NMFS has records of all red snapper landings reported by vessel logbook forms submitted pursuant to §641.5 (a) or (b) and has access to records of red snapper landings reported under Florida's trip ticket system. NMFS also has records of the earned income qualifier for each vessel permit issued for reef fish. Data duplicating these records are not needed. (2) Landings of red snapper reported by vessel logbook forms and received by the Science and Research Director prior to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to red snapper landed during the months that such logbook forms were required of, or voluntarily submitted by, a vessel_landings data from other sources will not be considered for such months. In the absence of landings data from such logbook forms, landings of red snapper reported under Florida's trip ticket system and received by the State prior to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to landings in Florida_landings data from other sources will not be considered for landings in Florida. (3) On or about August 1, 1994, vessel owners, and operators whose earned income was used to qualify for a vessel permit, will be mailed printouts of their logbook/trip ticket records of landings of red snapper during 1990 through 1992 and forms for the reporting of additional landings. An owner, or such operator, who had such landings and who does not receive a printout by August 8, 1994, must contact the Regulations and Permits Branch, Southeast Region, NMFS, telephone (813) 893&hyph;3722, for such printout and forms.
