The deindustrialization of the existing automobile parts and apparel industries, which have been hit hard by the high exchange rate of the yen, the city has decided to entice the R&D divisions of VR-related companies to fill the industrial void. However, the fact that the local businesses have had little exposure to VR-related industries, combined with the fact that the accumulation of VR technology by the prefecture itself is neglibile, left the local companies in bewilderment. How is the city going to pursuade companies located both outside and within the prefecture to set up their R&D bases in Kakamigahara? The issues are numerous. Kakamigahara City is proceeding with this plan after it had been approved by the country under the provision of its Intelligent Construction Site Law (the law governing the promotion of the aggregate of specified enterprises designed to contribute to the advancement of regional industries). A total of 38 organizations and businesses, including Gifu Prefecture, Kakamigahara City, the Regional Development and Maintenance Public Corporation, and local businesses, invested in an R&D organization, V.R. Techno Center, Kakamigahara City (Governor of Gifu Prefecture, Hiroshi Kajihara, serving as the center's director), which will serve as a parent body of this undertaking. Thus, the techno-center officially began its operations in April, 1993, with a total capital of ¥2.3 billion. Among the investors are Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric, Sony, Sanyo Electric, Kansai Electric Power, Shimizu Corporation, and Sega Enterprise, an impressive lineup of major companies from outside the prefecture. A site planned for construction of the center is located in the Suei District of Kakamigahara City, with a total development area of 17 hectares. Of these, an area of 1 hectare will be used as a building lot, with a surrounding lot of approximately 8 hectares to be used in creation and maintenance of the "VR Techno Japan," a business development designed to attract private industries to construct their R&D facilities. By this fall, the purchase of the building lot will be completed, with construction and creation of facilities starting in 1994/95. The sale of parceled land is expected to begin in 1996. In addition to VR-related companies, the city plans to invite participation of information processing, software development, mechanical design, and design companies as well. The center which will be constructed at the investment of ¥2.2 billion will have the floor space of approximately 3,340 square meters. It will be equipped with a VR research laboratory, a shared research laboratory, a computer graphics and CAD/CAM (computer-assisted design and manufacturing) practice room, and a rental research laboratory. A large-scale supercomputer capability will also be introduced to the center on an hourly rental basis. "Today, when even the automobile industry is facing deindustrialization as a result of moving its manufacturing base to overseas sites, we must make the first move by constructing a VR technology base." Governor Kajihara, who directs the project as the center's top executive, has high hopes for VR as one of the most promising industries to emerge in the post-automobile industrial era. The fact that Kawasaki Heavy Industries' aerospace division, equipped with a test flight simulation center, is located in Kakamigahara is an advantage to the city. The Prefecture's corporate enterprise section views this as an advantage since "the accumulation of aerospace-related businesses such as this will be helpful in the development of VR technology." However, many local businesses have reservations as indicated by their reactions, "since the future is unknown, we don't know how we can participate in this project." Even among the corporate investors, there are some who are saying, "our investment basically is no more than what we felt was our obligation to the business community. The project itself does not interest us that much." In order to uncover companies' needs, the center established a research forum, calling mainly for participation of local businesses. Because of the recessionary economy, however, response has been slow. Akira Takeuchi, chief of the corporate construction site section, also [says], "VR technology is rapidly advancing. Of all the local self-government bodies in the country, we were the first to come up with this idea of using VR technology to revitalize our local economy. It simply doesn't make sense if we are to slow down now."
