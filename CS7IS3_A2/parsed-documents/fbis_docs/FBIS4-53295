Carlos] [Text] Despite present problems dogging the industry, the prospect of mining investments in the country remains the most lucrative in the world, contends Mining and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) Director Joel Muyco of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Mr. Muyco cited as proof the country's overall per area mineral endowment, which places the Philippines second only to South Africa. The Philippines, he noted, has one of the highest mineral endowment ratio in the world. The mineral endowment of a country serves as a measure of the extent of mineral distribution in a specific area. The ratio is computed by dividing the country's total land area with its confirmed mineral reserves. According to DENR-MGB documents obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, in terms of gold deposits, South Africa has the richest reserves with a 15.80-ounce-per-square-kilometer mineral endowment ratio, while the Philippines is second with four ounces/square kilometer. Papua New Guinea ranks third with 2.33 ounces/square kilometer. Mr. Muyco told BUSINESS WORLD, if only these mineral reserves can be tapped, the mining industry will surely propel the Philippines to a newly industrialized status by the year 2000. The reason the country has failed to truly industrialize is because government do not see the potential of the mining industry. The mining sector is the key, he underscored. Unless government realizes this and put in place the needed programs and policies to relieve the pressure on the industry, the mining sector will remain an ailing industry. At present, a bill reducing the excise tax on the industry is pending in Congress. The existing 5 percent excise tax on the industry is considered as one of the biggest disincentives for investors. The House of Representatives has already approved its version of the bill, which proposes to grant tax relief to the mining industry for an indefinite period or until the sector has recovered. The Senate version of the bill, on the other hand, has just been recently approved on second reading. According to the Senate bill, excise tax on metallic minerals should be slashed on the first three years from the present 5 percent to just 2 percent for gold and 1 percent for copper; on the fourth and fifth years, gold will be taxed at 2-1/2 percent and copper at 1-1/2. On the sixth year, the 5 percent excise tax is restored for all metallic minerals. The country's mining operations have been experiencing massive losses because of depressed metal prices and increasing production costs. As a result, the sector's share of the country's export earnings had plunged, from 1973's 24.55 percent share to a dismal 6.38 percent in 1992. The country's top mining companies include Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp. (Cebu), Maricalum Mining Corp. (Negros Occidental), Marcopper Mining Corp. (Marinduque), Philex Mining Corp. (Benguet), Lepanto Consolidated Mining Corp. (Benguet), and Benguet Corp. (Dizon, Zambales).
