Vice Foreign Minister Jiro Saito called Chinese Ambassador to Tokyo Xu Dunxin to his office and "strongly" protested the test, officials said. Saito told Xu that Japan, the world's only country to have suffered atomic bombings, has especially strong feelings against nuclear testing and called on China not to repeat such tests in the interest of bilateral relations, the officials said. Another senior ministry official took similar action in a separate meeting with a Chinese embassy minister, voicing concern that such a test would have an undesirable effect on Tokyo's effort to win understanding and support of the Japanese people toward economic assistance for China, they said. It was an indirect reference to Japan's fourth package of yen credits pledged to China. The two countries are currently identifying projects to be financed by the loans. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also urge Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their meeting in Beijing on Sunday to refrain from nuclear tests, the officials said. Earlier Friday, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a statement in which he called the Chinese test "extremely regrettable."
