The justified security needs of Germany's eastern neighbors, like Poland and the Czech Republic, needed to be taken "very seriously," the Chancellor told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. He was also in favor of these countries joining the European Union (EU) when they fulfill the economic preconditions for doing so. Kohl once again came out in favor of further expanding security links between NATO and Russia. Without mentioning the name of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right-wing Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Kohl said the recent "shrill extremist noises" from Moscow should not dissuade NATO from continuing on this path. On the contrary, they were an additional reason to maintain the close relations with particular care. He supported the reform politics of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and expected that in the process of building a democratic order, "relapses into old thinking" could be warded off.
