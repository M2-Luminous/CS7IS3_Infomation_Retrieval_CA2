For the past few months, the units of the Western Army's territory have been making great efforts to guarantee every worker the resources that will allow him to do his work with a maximum of security for his life. Also, existing technical difficulties in various types of equipment -- especially that used in engineering tasks -- have been solved by means of interesting innovations. Regrettable work accidents have thereby been avoided. Among those centers with best results is the Western Army's rearguard technical safety unit [unidad de aseguramiento tecnico de retaguardia], which has made over 1,800 gloves for use in soldering or in agricultural activities. Sixteen papers are being analyzed here today, selected from the 50 submitted at the grassroots level. A jury will choose the best six, which will then be presented at the Army's ninth science and technology forum. They will also (?be presented) in the campaign at the level of the [entire] Armed Forces, scheduled for 14 and 15 June, which happens to be the 20th anniversary of the [creation of the] FAR's [Revolutionary Armed Forces'] technical inspection and labor protection specialty.
