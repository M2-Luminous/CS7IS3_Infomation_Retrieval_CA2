The law, called "Joint Venture Act," contains several amendments to a 1984 law on foreign investment bearing the same title, and was adopted by the DPRK Parliament on January 20. The law said that the DPRK Government is "especially" interested in establishing joint ventures with foreign companies or individuals with modern technology, highly competitive products, infrastructure construction projects and scientific and technological research programs. The runner of the joint venture will be its owner and can decide the company's policy independently. The law also called on ethnic Koreans living outside DPRK to invest in the country and said that preferential treatment will be given to them in regard to taxes and land use. There are now some 150 DPRK-foreign joint ventures in the country and dozens of others abroad.
