The MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] have until the end of the month to reach some agreement. The two sides are responsible for the death and misery of thousands of people. Now if they do not reach an agreement, U.S. economic aid will be canceled. Anabela Gois. [Gois] [passage omitted] When faced with the ultimatum, Alcides Sakala [UNITA's representative in Brussels] did not hesitate: UNITA is negotiating with goodwill, if the talks are dragging on the blame lies fully with the MPLA. [Sakala] One cannot put things in those terms. As you know UNITA has made all the possible concessions in order that the peace process might advance. At the moment those backing a war solution are the MPLA who launched this offensive against our positions. The MPLA is totally responsible. [Gois] Naturally, the MPLA has a different opinion. Despite not having official knowledge of the American ultimatum, Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao [presidential spokesman] said that only UNITA is creating obstacles to an agreement. [Conceicao] The process is taking a long time, not only because of the complexity of the issues being discussed and of the nature of the conflict, but also because of the time-wasting tactics by UNITA, who is interested in seeing the process drag on forever. We will do our utmost to find a solution as soon as possible. [Gois] Not even a U.S. ultimatum appears to be enough, for now, to make UNITA and the Angolan Government express their willingness to alter their negotiating strategy. Time will tell whether the United States' threats bear fruit.
