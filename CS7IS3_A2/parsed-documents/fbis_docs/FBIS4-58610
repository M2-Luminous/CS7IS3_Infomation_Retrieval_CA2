The first open Majles session for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] was held yesterday, chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Hamadan, the Jewish minority, Bahar and Kabudar Ahang, Rasht, and Dorud and Azna gave speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech concerning the exalted leader's speech about the work ethic and the social order and also about the injustice of the international organizations, which was printed in the previous issue. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Seyyed Jalal Sadatian, Deputy From Hamadan The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way that it will make the people more hopeful about the nation's future. The first preagenda speaker at the open Majles session was Sadatian, deputy from Hamadan. He offered congratulations on the beginning of the new year and the day of the founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 12 Farvardin [1 April]. He said: In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] many important tasks were completed and steps were taken to build Islamic Iran and make it more prosperous. The Majles approved and studied important motions and bills and gave a vote of confidence to Mr. Hashemi's new cabinet. It studied and approved the 1373 budget with a view to the Second Five-Year Plan, and it increased its control and supervision of the government companies. He then discussed the high and proud role of the Majles. Continuing, he said: The exalted leader emphasized two basic elements, the work ethic and social order, as elements that will build a civilization with reliance on culture, insight, understanding and holistic human thinking, and he gave the good news that our nation is building a civilization. For reaching this lofty goal, Sadatian mentioned the following points: 1 - Duplicate organizations, inefficient organizations, and organizations that do not work must be eliminated by the Majles, and the real needs of the people for organizations that provide service must be met through necessary elimination and consolidation. 2 - The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way that it provides incentives for the people to work and make effort, and makes them more hopeful about the future. 3 - The Social Security, Social Insurance and Government Services Bill that is on the Majles agenda must be approved in such a way that it serves to develop as much as possible social justice, social incentives, and more public participation in social activities. 4 - To eliminate the negative effects of inflation and prevent the problems caused by high prices, in addition to the things provided in the 1373 budget bill, measures that will control prices and in particular, prevent monopolies, must be implemented. 5 - Discrimination is one of the things that undermine the work ethic and the social order. It is incumbent upon the judicial power to emphasize implementation of the law more than ever. In the same regard the deputy from Hamadan discussed greater cooperation between the government and the Majles in the year 1373. He said: An effort must be begun to encourage more than ever the spirit of mobilization and the spirit of doing a good job throughout this dear country of ours, which is busy with work and activity. For example two or three years ago the management at the Esfahan Iron Foundry was able to bring about a change and strengthen the work ethic in the work environment. In this spirit they were able to carry out a large part of the project. At the end of his speech he discussed the importance of the role of the people in reconstruction, and he called for greater belief in the people in the reconstruction of the country. Kuros Kayvani, Deputy From the Jewish Minority Contrary to the purposeful rumors of the human rights organizations, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of freedom. The next speaker was Kayvani, deputy from the Jewish minority. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his speech he discussed the Jewish holidays, which coincide with the New Year celebration. He said: For hundreds of years these holidays have been celebrated with complete tranquility and brotherly coexistence in this wide land of Iran, and they can be an example for the world. All the people of this land have worked and sacrificed their lives to preserve this freedom and solidarity. The minority martyrs are testimony to this claim, and it is confirmed by minority participation in the 10 Days of Dawn Celebration and on God's Day, 12 Farvardin. The speaker also said: Perhaps a careful study of the free staging of these celebrations by the human rights organizations and societies would prove to them that, contrary to purposeful rumors, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of freedom to practice their religious rites and every kind of facility has been made available to them, including, the right to leave for the soldiers under the flag, government agents, and closing the religious schools on their religious holidays. Continuing, Kayvani added: The religious minorities have always followed their religious rules in their individual lives and have been free to teach their faith. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran guarantees this. He also said: History shows that comparing the Jews in the East for example with those in the Islamic lands and especially Iran, the latter have had greater freedom. If in the West it can be said that after the French revolution and what came from it, the Jews were given the full right to follow their religion and that the doors to cultural institutions were open to them, on the contrary in the Islamic lands and Iran the Jews have had scholars, professors and great artists and have played a part in the nation's destiny. They have even reached high government positions such as prime minister. He discussed the fact that racism and limiting the rights of minorities and the publication and spread of inappropriate and empty insults are undeniably part of the imperialist political and cultural invasion. He said: A look at the sayings and writings of that great mystic and wise leader who founded the Islamic Republic of Iran will show the extent to which he respected the rights of religious minorities. Even in his political positions he always emphasized that we make a distinction between Jewish society and Zionism. The speaker continued: As has been said many times, the banner of Islam and the great scholars of Islam and Shiism have always sheltered and protected religious minorities. Therefore such writings and accusations are far removed from the behavior and actions of the nation of Iran, from the laws and goals of the Islamic revolution and from the Imam's path. The great spirit of Iran and the government of the republic, which is great because of the laws of unity and the legacy of the Imam's teachings, is innocent of these accusations. 'Ali Ya'qubi, Deputy From Bahar and Kabudar Ahang The triumph of the Muslims of Turkey shows their interest in Islamic culture and their contempt for the culture of the West. The next speaker was Ya'qubi, deputy from Bahar and Kabudar Ahang. In his speech he offered congratulations on the new year and discussed the slaughter of praying Palestinians by Zionists at Dar al-Khalil last year and the silence of the international organizations. He said: The result of the silence of the international societies and organizations in the face of this savage slaughter and the criminal and compromising approach taken by most of the Western regimes to these crimes will be that we will see a repetition of the al-Khalil tragedy. Continuing, the speaker also said: Despite extensive propaganda by the Turkish secularists, who have vast propaganda resources at their disposal, the Islamic Rifah Party was victorious in the Turkish mayoral elections, and I congratulate the Muslims of Turkey on this victory. This shows the awareness of the Muslims and their interest in Islamic culture and government, and their contempt and loathing for the culture of the West and secular governments. It is hoped that in the near future we will see victory by the Muslims of Turkey in the elections for parliament and other political areas. Ya'qubi then discussed the exalted leader's New Year's message to the people and government leaders, and he asked them to strive to bring this message to fruition. He then discussed increasing efficiency in the offices. He said: The structure of the administrative system must be revised. The existence of huge organizations with duplicated functions and a complicated bureaucracy will have no result other than to reduce efficiency and leave the public with no place to go. Improving management in the government companies and in the institutions affiliated with the government, and making using of committed and specialist manpower that is concerned about the Islamic revolution in key positions will be effective in improving efficiency. The speaker then discussed social order and observing order. He said: We must all obey the law. If someone violates the law, he must be dealt with severely. If the laws approved by the Majles are carefully implemented, we will then no longer see the spending of some 6.5 billion rials on printing calendars and various magazines using funds from the public treasury. In this same regard, he then discussed the fact that in the 1373 budget these kinds of expenditures and frills are prohibited. He said: I ask the speaker of the Majles to take measures even as the year begins to economize and avoid ostentation and to deal with law breakers in accordance with regulations. At the end of his speech, the deputy from Bahar and Kabudar Ahang discussed inflation and the fluctuating foreign exchange rate in the year 1372, and he called for dealing seriously with violators and punishing according to the law those who disrupt the nation's economic system. Mohammad Baqer Nowbakht, Deputy From Rasht The next speaker was Nowbakht, deputy from Rasht. In his speech he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: The nation's management, in view of the characteristics and conditions in the year 1373, needs more planning and comprehensive thinking. The writing and approval of an orderly budget for the current year, whose approved revenues are less than 60 percent of the revenues approved for the previous year, and which has a 13-percent reduction in current expense credits and a 7-percent reduction in development credits in the Majles compared to the figures in the government's proposed budget, entails a coordinated effort by the government and the Majles to apply realistic management. The speaker then discussed the utilization of the same resources and the submission of a more desirable performance report from the government and the Majles in the year 1373, and he called for the implementation of the following: 1 - The government should be careful to apply supervision, to intervene effectively in the nation's economic affairs and to deal seriously and lawfully with those who sell at high prices. Unfortunately, two related phenomena have always kept the government from taking real and proper measures in this regard, or else it has resisted. One of these two phenomena is the incorrect language some people have used, posing as concerned experts and economists, in describing the policy of economic adjustment and the need to adjust the market based on the mechanism of supply and demand. They say that practical supervision or any kind of government intervention in the market are obstacles to private sector cooperation in economic affairs. They suggest that the government's reasonable decision for rational and planned privatization may have been a mistake, and they constantly spread fear. The other phenomenon is the invisible economic abusers, who create such a furor the minute the government intervenes in a market affair that one would conclude that wherever the government does something or intervenes in the market, the situation gets worse. Continuing, he added: In submitting and approving the general form of the Consumer Rights Support Bill, the Majles and the government must first show that they are serious about this and that they will deal clearly with two realities, the first that government supervision and intervention to control the market and even with economic investment activities is not even in conflict with economic and investment goals, much less in conflict with the economic goals of Islam, and second that a distinction must be made between the private sector that wants sound participation and a reasonable profit in economic affairs and those who are abusers. In this same regard the speaker said: Therefore, the deliberations in the second consultation on the Consumer Rights Support Bill will be a good opportunity for the Majles to make the government more careful about preventing uncontrolled price increases, most of which are done without economic consideration on the pretext that foreign exchange rates have increased, and to use all government resources to supervise the marketing of goods at the finished cost with a reasonable profit percentage. This supervision will be no less important than defending the public against an enemy military invasion. 2 - Realistic and praiseworthy measures the government and the Majles have taken, which must be compiled and approved in the best possible way in the year 1373, is the amendment to the Uniform Payments System Law and the increase in retirement pensions. He said the implementation of this law has created many problems for government retirees. He said: In some cases retirement wages have dropped so drastically compared to employment wages that retirement is seen as complete bankruptcy. Elsewhere in his talk he asked the National Expediency Discernment Council to approve Note 1, Article 1 of the Universal Payments System Law, which pertains to employees with bachelor's degrees and lower. In conclusion he said: Another measure the Majles must take has to do with the Social Security Law and eliminating the age restrictions for women retirees. If this is done, women workers, who will have the ability to retire voluntarily without age restrictions, will have more of an opportunity to carry out their maternal responsibilities in the home. This will also create appropriate employment opportunities for individuals willing to work. Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna The final preagenda speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and Azna. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his speech he discussed the province of Lorestan hosting the president of the republic and the joyous and unequalled public welcome he received. He said: The deputies from Lorestan declare their praise and thanks to the respected president of the republic, and they sincerely thank him for designating the province as one in need of development, industrial expansion, services, agriculture, and other services. The speaker also added: Following numerous follow-up measures, messages concerning Lorestan's problems and issues to the executive organizations and the statements by the president of the republic, it is incumbent upon the executive officials, especially the members of the Council of Ministers, to give importance to alleviating the problems in the province of Lorestan, changing the face of the province, developing industry, ancillary petrochemical industries and the Arak refinery in Lorestan, developing higher education and educational affairs, and other things. In conclusion he thanked the minister of the interior for making Pol-e Dokhtar va Azna ol-Shotor a municipality. Legislation Health Insurance Bill The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the first consultation of the Joint Health Care and Plan and Budget Commission concerning the National Health Insurance Bill. Joint Commission's View Hasan Aminlu, expert for the joint commission, gave a speech discussing this bill. He said: The nation's health care and treatment problems and malfunctions require that a basic change be made in the nation's health care system. This is necessary to establish social justice in the country and have subsidies be directed so that our people will receive good treatment, and also so that the people will not have problems when they go to the health care centers, which makes them disappointed with the government. Continuing, he said: Clearly there are points in the details that will be changed in the second consultation. Mr. Aminlu discussed the financial load from this bill. He said: Government staff employees are to pay between one-third and one-fifth of their own per-person treatment fees, and the government will pay the remainder as subsidies. If treatment retains its current subsidy and if the treatment situation is like this, and if government makes infrastructure investments for treatment, then the per-person cost of treatment at current rates will be 500 tumans. Workers will be treated in accordance with the Social Security Law, and clearly a load will thereby be added to the Social Security Organization's responsibilities. Concerning rural people, the fee will be 250 tumans, of which one-third will be paid by the rural people themselves and the rest by the government as subsidies. Self-employed people will pay 100 percent of the costs themselves. The government now pays 75 billion tumans for insurance. In the year 1373 the government will also pay 15 billion tumans for staff employees, bringing the total to 90 billion tumans. The government has also set aside 4 billion tumans to give the Imam's Aid Committee for the vulnerable classes. Therefore the total subsidies for treatment is 94 billion tumans. However, the cost to the government in connection with this bill will be as follows: if we take 10 million people from the vulnerable classes into consideration at the 500 tumans, this will be 96,000 tumans for each person and for that number of people the total will be 60 billion tumans. If we consider 25 million rural people at 1,500 tumans per person per year, this will total 375 billion tumans. For 5 million government staff employees the cost will be 22.5 billion tumans, and the total for all groups will be 120 billion tumans. The government will also have to pay some 20 billion tumans for repeat treatment. The commission expert discussed the hospitals absorbing their own high costs. He said: The hospitals absorbing their own high costs is provided for until the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. Dr. Jabbarzadeh, Opposition Dr. Jabbarzadeh, deputy from Tabriz, spoke in opposition to the general form of the bill. He said: This bill cannot solve the existing insurance problems. Also, with the formation of the Supreme Insurance Council, in effect the main responsibility of the minister of health care and treatment is being taken away from him and will be given to a nonspecialist council. Another of his objections to the bill is its method of financial procurement. He said: Every year the price of social security is increased. How are those who are covered by social security insurance going to pay for it? He then criticized the policy of transferring government hospitals to the private sector. He said: The entire message of the bill is the transfer of government hospitals to the private sector, and if this bill is approved it will not benefit the people. Dr. Zare', Support Dr. Zare', deputy from Shiraz, spoke in support of the bill. He said: It is very important to have proper supervision of the implementation of treatment and providing coverage to all the people in society, and this need requires that a new change be made in the insurance system. He also said: One of the bill's distinctions is that it will end the insurance monopoly . That is, people will be able to meet their treatment expenses entirely through insurance, and the physician's ties to money will be completely cut. Rahbari, Opposition Rahbari spoke in opposition to the National Health Insurance Bill. He said: The new insurance system that you want to pass will bring increased prices for the people. When you want to modernize the treatment system, in practice the people for whom you want to provide treatment will have to pay a high price for it, and in practice a person who cannot pay will expire. He also added: Why is it that the physicians, pharmacies, and treatment centers do not accept this insurance? You go and look for the reason. The financial burden issue is that whoever has more money will receive good treatment, and a person who cannot pay will expire. Rahbari also noted: What mechanism exists so that our rural people can go and get insured? Since they are not connected to any place that can insure them, in effect those who are old and in need of treatment will be insured, and those who are young will not be insured. In practice this will mean that the financial burden on the government's shoulders will be great, and this is very damaging and will hurt the nation's treatment system. Kuhkan, Support Another supporter of the aforementioned bill was Mohsen Kuhkan. During a speech he said: One of the bill's distinctions is that if we are going to subsidize drugs and treatment, we should give it directly to the patient, not to the importer, the distributor, and other people. He then added: The gentlemen are saying that the nation and the government will have to pay more money, but this is not correct. Approving the bill will raise the quality of treatment, and this is acceptable to everyone. Nurbakhsh, Opposition Nurbakhsh spoke in opposition to this bill. He said: What they always say about drugs is that they are not available in the pharmacies, but they can be found on Naser Khosrow Street. Is there any guarantee that when this bill is approved we will no longer have problems getting drugs? He also said: Where in this bill does it say anything about society's vulnerable classes? We believe that government staff employees are also one of these vulnerable classes. He also added: We believe that this bill reduces the prerogatives of the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education. We must strengthen this organization so it can supervise drugs and treatment. We should not reduce its supervisory role and give it to a council. Dr. Sadr, Support Dr. Sadr, deputy from Tehran, spoke in support of this bill, arguing we cannot say that universal insurance is not a good thing. He said: Every day the price of treatment supplies increases in the world and we cannot deny this. One day our brothers in the provinces were trying to get a CAT scan machine, and now they are trying to get an MRI machine. Next they will be wanting a laser machine. Therefore we cannot ignore these issues. We must accept the realities. In the nation's dysfunctional drug and treatment situation, this bill can solve some of the nation's problems. He then said: The government cannot bear the country's entire burden. This will never happen. However, with the government's resources and the money the government pays to the insurance fund, it will definitely benefit the people. Dr. Sadr also added: High prices have nothing to do with the bill, because if you do not approve this bill, drugs and treatment will automatically go up. Nowruzi, Opposition 'Abdollah Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer, spoke in opposition. He said: On the first Majles work day of the year, we are giving our nation the good news that Majles is causing prices to rise. We accept universal insurance, but this bill is not universal insurance. He then said: When you want to collect the finished cost of drugs and treatment, how can professionals and self-employed people, many of whom do not have financial resources, bear the burden of these costs? The cost of heart surgery is already 1 to 2 million tumans. Who can pay for that? He said: The unemployment rate is already 11 percent. Do those people have the ability to pay for insurance? What are they going to do? Nowruzi added: Mr. Hoseyni Shahrudi went to the hospital for treatment. When he came back he said: "what a joke." If they tell me to turn the military bases over to the private sector, I will do so, but I believe you should not transfer the hospitals. Dr. Shahrzad, Support Dr. Shahrzad, deputy from Esfahan, spoke in support with the bill. He said: I say to our dear people, treatment in the year 1373 will be as it was before, and there will be no change in rates or organization. In view of the fact that this bill is going through its first consultation, and its credit resources will have to be procured in the year 1374 [21 March 1995-20 March 1996], this is an answer to some of the respected opponents, for studying and approving this bill is not inconsistent with the Second Five-Year Plan, and it is certainly better for us to study it in the year 1373, The plans for universal insurance and social security services is definitely part of the Second Five-Year Plan. It is very likely that its implementation will be deferred to the year 1374. He then said: I support the general form of the bill, but I do not fully support the bill's current form. When we reject this bill, that will mean that although the existing situation is not desirable, we want to accept it [as published]. Dr. Dastjerdi, a woman speaking in support of the bill, said: The government has left the deputies a free hand to make any kind of change to this bill. Today is a good opportunity for the Fourth Majles to correct the insurance situation for 35 million people in society. I am surprised that the opponents are saying this bill will make the situation worse for the people. Those who do not have an insurance booklet, such as the rural people and society's vulnerable classes, do not have anything. How are these people going to go to the treatment centers? For Caesarian operations in government hospitals, they must pay 20,000 tumans. Where are they going to get this? She said: I have 70 office calls every day, and 20 of them have counterfeit insurance booklets from other people, because they do not have the money to pay. She also emphasized: We members of the commission are 100 percent opposed to transferring hospitals to the private sector, but the hospitals must absorb their own high costs in this way so that they will economize on the materials they consume. The minister of health care and treatment also spoke in support of this bill, and then the general form of the bill was put to a vote and approved.
