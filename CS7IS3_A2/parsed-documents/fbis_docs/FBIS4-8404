[passage omitted] General de Lapresle, the commander of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, justifies the air strikes by the difficult situation faced by the Blue Helmets in the region. General de Lapresle was interviewed by Remy Hourdan: [Begin Lapresle recording] The first point, which seems essential to me, is not to give undue importance to the close air support actions. These were simply aimed at enabling the United Nations to protect its personnel based in the town of Gorazde. This was a very precise case fully anticipated by UN guidelines perfectly known to all parties on the ground. When UN soldiers or personnel are placed in a situation of self-defense we use all means at our disposal. If UN personnel had not been threatened in Gorazde we would not have used the close air support action as we did; we would have used another UN procedure to take into account the fact that Gorazde was designated a safe area and we could have called on NATO planes through the channels provided by the UN resolution.
