[National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini, on the day after convincing the party to "bless" the National Alliance, won the first electoral victory, and he did nothing to hide all his enthusiasm: "From Catania has come the first victory of the new right, the confirmation which rewards our desire to present ourselves as a governing force." But not only the National Alliance leader has reason to be delighted. The CCD [Democratic Christian Center] secessionists [from the People's Party] see in the Catania result the confirmation of their turn to the right. "This result demonstrates that the forces of the left can be beaten," a convinced Clemente Mastella explained, "and to tell the truth we are not overly surprised." Cautious, but also clearly satisfied was [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni, who has received further proof that the left, without the members of the Pact, risks a heavy debacle. "The citizens who voted for the Pact's candidate have appreciated a campaign organized around problems and not ideologies," Mariotto [Segni] claimed, stating that he was determined to continue this strategy. The Catania results also represented a panacea for [Italian Radical Party--PRI Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa, who did not lose the opportunity to emphasize the correctness of his decision not to mix with the left. "Without Segni," the PRI secretary maintained, "the progressive line-up did not even get to the final ballot round." This confirms the National Council's decision not to accept the alliance with Rete and the Communist Renewal. The Italian Popular Party's [PPI] Giuseppe Gargani interpreted the results as a resurrection of the Christian Democratic Party [DC]: "The DC united in a serious pact with Segni's friends and with non-Catholics have permitted the center grouping to reach the final ballot." A cry of alarm, on the other hand, comes from the Catholic associations: "If the contradictions and misunderstandings in the agreement between Segni and [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli are not resolved," ACLI [Christian Association of Catholic Workers] Vice Chairman Michele Giacomantonio warned: "There is a danger of handing over Italy to the right and the extremists." The Catania results are also increasing the League's interest in the National Alliance. "We are looking at it closely," the League's Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni maintained, opening up possibilities, "but we are waiting for them to make some concessions on the question of federalism." On the left, in the meantime, they are reciting their "mea culpa." First of all mayor of Catania, Enzo Bianco, himself apologized. "The progressive grouping had the victory in its hands and yet managed to lose. The responsibility lies with those who allowed sectarianism and squabbling to prevail." Achille Occhetto added: "It is an alarm bell," the PDS secretary maintained, "because the battle will be long and we should not become disheartened but work hard and patiently." "The progressives lost because they were divided themselves," local PDS party manager Giulio Quercini stated. "This is a battle we have lost, but which can serve as a lesson to win the war on 27 March." In the socialist camp, despite the defeat of candidate Maurizio Pellegrino, there is an air of waiting to take revenge. "When vetoes and divisions prevail, it is the right which wins," PSI [Italian Socialist Party] Secretariat coordinator Enrico Boselli maintained, pleased to be finally in a position to give a lesson to everyone who did not want the Socialists to sit at the progressive front's negotiating table.
