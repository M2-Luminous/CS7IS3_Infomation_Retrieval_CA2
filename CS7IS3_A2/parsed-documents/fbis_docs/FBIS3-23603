He was born in 1945 and completed Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman in 1969. He has an electronics engineering diploma and is a doctor of historical sciences, professor, and USSR (Russian) Academy of Sciences corresponding member. He is the author (or coauthor) of 12 books on problems of international relations, military strategy, and questions of arms limitation and disarmament. For a number of years he held the post of deputy director of the USSR Academy of Sciences USA and Canada Institute and deputy chairman of the Committee of Soviet Scientists. At the same time (as is true of many other associates of the USSR Academy of Sciences), he took part in a number of projects financed by the Ministry of Defense, particularly in developing the "asymmetric" Soviet response (familiar from Gorbachev's words) to the U.S. SDI Program. In April 1992 Kokoshin was appointed first deputy minister of defense of Russia simultaneously with General Grachev (duties of Russian Federation minister of defense were being performed at that time by President Yeltsin personally). The "Democratic Russia" movement, influential at that time, tried hard for (and achieved) the appointment of a civilian specialist to a leadership position in the Ministry of Defense. By the way, Andrey Afanasyevich himself has not taken part in quarrels of recent years and is not directly linked with a single political movement. In the Ministry of Defense Kokoshin above all handles questions of military-technical development and relations with the military-industrial complex. [SEGODNYA] As a Ministry of Defense representative, you took part in organizing the successful operation in the North Caucasus in December of last year which ended with the freeing of captured hostages, the helicopter and its crew, arrest of the terrorists and return of the bulk of the ransom paid to them. Tell me, was the Army's participation in antiterrorist operations an improvisation? To what extent was everything planned in advance? [Kokoshin] In principle, hostage-taking is a regular situation for the MVD and other security services, not for the Armed Forces. And they played the leading role in this operation, but the Ministry of Defense was immediately drawn into it inasmuch as the bandits demanded a military helicopter with crew. As first deputy minister of defense, I was included in the state commission, which as you know was headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Minister of Defense General of the Army Pavel Grachev gave directions for using any necessary Armed Forces assets to assist MVD entities in conducting this operation. A three-level crisis management system was established: 1) an interdepartmental commission at the level of the first and second persons of the Ministry of Defense, MVD, FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service], FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information], Ministry of Health and others, which worked for three days in Soskovets' office; 2) operations staffs in each of the departments participating in the operation, including a special operations team on the General Staff and in the Main Commissariat of the Air Force; 3) and an operations staff in Mineralnyye vody headed by General Chebotarev from the MVD. Lieutenant General Vladimir Mikhaylov, 4th Air Army commander, was appointed Chebotarev's deputy. He was almost constantly in contact with the abductors. The fliers--pilot Valentin Padalka (squadron commander, Military Unit 32982) and navigator Vladimir Stepanov (flight pilot-navigator, Military Unit 32982) were from his army and he of course felt responsible for them both from a human standpoint and out of duty. Commander-in-Chief Air Force Colonel General of Aviation Petr Deynekin was at his post around the clock. The fliers, from the CinC to the ordinary pilot, demonstrated their traditional cohesiveness. [SEGODNYA] How do you assess the level of coordination of actions of different departments in this operation? [Kokoshin] The Armed Forces conducted a kind of forced exercise within the scope of the overall operation. It must be said that in the final account good coordination of all branches and combat arms of the Armed Forces, Internal Security Forces, militia, and security entities managed to be achieved. General Mikhaylov and the North Caucasus Military District command functioned excellently. But the main burden of the operation fell on the shoulders of internal affairs entities. There were of course also rough spots in coordination and in work in outlying areas, but our comrades in arms, including First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs General Yegorov, a most experienced person in these matters, assessed the level of mutual understanding very highly. To a considerable extent this was a result of the very effective work style of Oleg Soskovets, head of the interdepartmental commission, and of constant support on the part of the president and prime minister. The criminals' very first steps permitted us to determine with a high degree of probability that they were not planning to fly to Iran, but still the government contacted Iranian authorities through Ministry of Foreign Affairs channels, and they were ready to receive the terrorists in accordance with requirements of international law. Several possible landing areas in the North Caucasus were computed based on the helicopter's capabilities and an analysis of operational data received in various ways. Up to 49 different radars were operating in the region to track the helicopter with the abductors in the concluding phase of the operation. Ground Troops mobile SAM system radars capable of detecting low-flying targets were activated as well, but ground radars sometimes lost the helicopter in folds of mountainous relief difficult for radar operation. Then the decision was made, probably for the first time in world practice of such operations, to bring in two A-50 radar early-warning aircraft (similar to the U.S. E-3A of the AWACS system). By the way, only two countries in the world, the United States and Russia, presently possess such means with high characteristics of their own development and production. By this time the ground radars, tied into a unified system, also began to work more effectively. This system operated intermittently in the initial moment of radar tracking of the helicopter. The A-50 aircraft were moved from another region with an entirely different terrain relief, and the operators initially had a difficult time. Coordination among all radar monitoring crews was not adjusted right away, but in the final account a reliable system for monitoring air space in the region managed to be created through joint efforts of the Air Force, Air Defense Troops, and the North Caucasus Military District command, and not once during the last flight from Mineralnyye vody to Makhachkala did the A-50's, ground radars and specially scrambled interceptors lose "sight" of the helicopter with the criminals aboard. And this was done in very short time periods under standards of the armed forces of any country. The helicopter repeatedly descended to a height of 50 m and lower at the criminals' demand. They took extreme risks, and only the supreme expertise and courage of "Afghan" Lieutenant Colonel Valentin Padalka and his partner saved everyone from perishing. Air defense fighters and the attack aircraft brought in for the operation had high-intensity illumination flares aboard which could facilitate a search for the criminals at night. Necessary aircraft weapons also were ready. By the way, everything was prepared to the maximum extent to seal off all possible landing areas by personnel of Internal Security Forces and the militia, and several Airborne Troops "Spetsnaz" teams were in full readiness (with helicopters). On the whole, forces had been assembled which would have established a double cordon. As a result, not only were the children freed and criminals arrested, but a large part of the ransom also was returned. [SEGODNYA] How new is a helicopter hijacking situation in world practice? [Kokoshin] According to information received, including from foreign agencies through the Foreign Intelligence Service, helicopter hijackings are a relative "innovation" of terrorists, and so responding actions by law-protection agencies have not been worked out hardly at all in world practice compared with experience in the case of aircraft hijackings. [SEGODNYA] Were any kind of military-technical innovations used in this operation? [Kokoshin] We brought in many such innovations. The A-50's gave a good account of themselves in particular. The A-50 in itself of course is not a new aircraft, but its electronic "filling" is constantly being upgraded. Certain special electronic assets also were used. Many were delivered to Mineralnyye vody quickly, both from various security services as well as from the Armed Forces. The General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate also made its contribution. But much remained in reserve. [SEGODNYA] To what extent can the North Caucasus operations serve as a model for future antiterrorist operations? [Kokoshin] The results of this operation are being generalized now. The government assigned [us] the task jointly with the MVD and Federal Counterintelligence Service to create type instructions or a type plan of action in situations of a similar nature for different regions of the country so it is not necessary to improvise each time. Unfortunately, the overall situation in the country is such that interdepartmental antiterrorist plans backed up by appropriate tactics of combat operations are extremely necessary today. [SEGODNYA] There really is a great likelihood of stepped-up terrorism and of the appearance of new centers of inter-ethnic conflicts and local wars on the territory of Russia and near its borders in nearby foreign countries. What weapons will the Russian Federation Armed Forces need in the new situation? [Kokoshin] On 19 January of this year basic directions and priorities of a long-range program for arming the Russian Army were approved at a Security Council session. Low-intensity conflicts and local wars in which far from mass armies will take part are among the most likely kinds of armed conflicts. This also was reflected in provisions of Russian Federation military doctrine. Obviously such an assessment also goes for the new kind of operations--fighting terrorism. We have a three-stage program designed up to the year 2005 for the fighting man's personal gear and equipment and combat outfitting, which envisages different levels of outfitting from the motorized rifleman to officers of special reconnaissance subunits. Units of mobile forces earmarked for immediate or rapid reaction will be reoutfitted on a priority basis. Individual operational data display systems are being developed: Liquid crystal displays built into a helmet, where a fighting man will precisely see his position and that of the neighbor and the enemy, i.e., he will receive his own "portion of the information" on the situation around him. New types of assault weapons have been developed for "Spetsnaz" troops and also new kinds of combat clothing. It is very important that the armament program provide for upgrading the communications and tactical command and control systems. This means above all near-real-time transmission of data, communications among subunits according to the principle of a cellular telephone network (but with necessary and automatic scrambling of verbal information being transmitted), and the classic "commander's communications." We already have systems for precise topographic tie-in of subunits to the terrain using satellite navigation systems. True, the individual fighting man cannot be outfitted with that system for now inasmuch as satellite communications ground elements have considerable weight-size characteristics and are very costly. The first individual systems of this nature evidently may appear only after the year 2000. In the overall scope of military-technical tasks, the Ministry of Defense envisages priority development of various precision weapon systems, from close combat systems to operational-tactical and strategic systems. There is a program for tieing reconnaissance, data transmission and communications systems of various levels and purposes into a unified information system. The predominant content of the effect exerted on the enemy in modern warfare has become not pulverizing his personnel, but throwing command and control and SIGINT systems into disarray and generally demoralizing troops, the command element, and state command and control entities. By virtue of this, EW equipment development programs become even more important, both for suppressing enemy electronics and weapons and for protecting our own weapon systems and data collection and transmission systems. Today supremacy of the air waves is at the very least equivalent to the factor of air supremacy in wars of the middle of the century, and in many cases today EW is no longer a secondary means. A new concept, the electronic-fire strike, has appeared. Modern EW assets are capable not only of "blinding" the enemy for a certain time interval, but also putting some of the most important elements of his systems completely out of commission. [SEGODNYA] What are the main directions in development of strategic nuclear forces? [Kokoshin] This is the topic of a special conversation requiring its own place in print and time to cover all problems caused by the present geopolitical situation. But I will answer briefly that in deployment of strategic nuclear deterrence forces we are placing more and more emphasis on upgrading the battle management system with respect to improving its reliability, and the same thing goes for the missile attack warning system. [SEGODNYA] To what extent are the "Basic Directions" approved on 19 January supported by budget financing? [Kokoshin] This is a tough question. Prices on raw materials, equipment and basic supplies are continuously rising in the country, transportation costs are increasing, and expenditures for communications services, for paying the labor force, and so on are growing. As a result, the cost of fulfilling any kind of program is almost impossible to plan precisely. Many economists assumed the situation would stabilize on reaching the level of world prices, but in many instances now our copper, aluminum and silicon, for example, are being sold at a price considerably above the world price. For the second year the Ministry of Defense has not been financed as befitting a major state client of "goods and services" making up the basis of effectiveness and efficiency of any country's foreign and defense policy. And it is not just a matter of volumes, but also of the financing mechanism. In 1993 the Ministry of Finance allocated funds to us 56 times, while in previous years they would be allocated once every two months and in fully specific amounts. Therefore, we are forced to plan different scenarios for fulfilling defense programs in a rather wide range of pessimistic and optimistic assessments of the development of Russia's economy. On the whole, the majority of weapon development and production programs now are delayed in connection with the shortage of financing. At the same time, through internal maneuvering of modest resources we are attempting to move priority work forward, especially in development of battle management [and] communications systems, above all at the tactical level. We also are trying to finance the development of EW assets on a priority basis. The fact is, one has to pay in blood for shortcomings in communications and command and control systems. It is very difficult to concentrate and maneuver funds today as never before. It is obvious that science-intensive industries must be saved first of all, but more often than not this enters into contradiction with the need to maintain sociopolitical stability in society, inasmuch as the more sophisticated production is, the fewer workers there are in it. Ordinary plants of the former military-industrial complex in which tens of thousands of engineering-technical personnel and workers are employed, where the production capacities have not been utilized for several years in a row now, and where latent unemployment is growing may remain essentially without budget financing. It often happens that wages of a considerably larger number of workers than strictly needed for manufacturing defense products are paid through a defense order. Accordingly, earnings turn out to be low. [SEGODNYA] At a 29 December press conference last year, Minister of Defense General Grachev stated that "new mobilization plans must be made up by the end of 1994 (in connection with changes in the situation) in the Ministry of Defense system and in other departments." What are the basic principles of the new mobilization program? [Kokoshin] Back at the end of 1992 the government significantly reduced mobilization assignments for many enterprises at our suggestion. Now a further correction of plans for mobilization deployment of industry is under way, naturally in the direction of their reduction. [SEGODNYA] But perhaps mobilization plans in industry are not needed at all? In the majority of western countries such plans either are entirely absent or they are of an extremely limited nature. [Kokoshin] What do you mean?! I still can agree concerning the second part, but with respect to absence, I have not yet seen a different scheme in any militarily developed power which could replace the system of planning and consequently management of mobilization readiness. At this stage, planning mobilization capacities not only fulfills tasks of preserving and modernizing Russia's defense potential, but it also is a component part of national industrial policy. There is a special line in the defense budget for which the Ministry of the Economy is responsible, but nowhere have military departments ever been unconcerned about this line of budget appropriations. By the way, very modest funds go for this. Today we are running up against the need for a radical revision of principles of forming mobilization plans for industry. A multipolar power structure of a world magnitude has been forming since the Cold War. For now this process contains a mass of military-political and geostrategic uncertainties for Russia and neighboring countries. The adopted military doctrine reflects realities of today and of the transition period. New mobilization plans are being formed for this doctrine. The likelihood of a major war is minimal in this stage, but this does not mean it must be completely excluded from possible threats to the security of Russia and its allies. [SEGODNYA] Then just who specifically decides the question of the complete and final closing of a particular defense plant or production? [Kokoshin] The government makes the decision on closing a particular military production. The Ministry of Defense cannot decide such a question independently, but of course it is an interested party, as is any consumer of products and services. In fact, everything is decided in the process of forming and distributing the defense order within the framework of the allocated budget and in selecting the manufacturer of products needed by the Ministry of Defense. Generally this is a complicated, painful problem. For example, a government decision was made previously that the defense state order for 1994 and for the subsequent two years will remain at the 1993 level. But now we have received instructions to make an additional correction, inasmuch as keeping the state order at the 1993 level under conditions of a further drop in the level of the GNP and of industrial production will signify an increase in the proportion of the defense order, which the government cannot undertake. You can imagine what a wave of problems again faces us. [SEGODNYA] Tell me, has the problem of the debt for the 1993 defense order been resolved? [Kokoshin] The state debt to the Ministry of Defense was almost 15 times greater by the end of 1993 compared with 1992 (in prices comparable with 1992). As a result, a very serious situation was created in the defense complex, (as in many other sectors of the economy). It is clear that it is necessary to change the system of financing defense needs. The Ministry of Defense made a set of specific proposals to the government. The main task is to preclude such an abnormal phenomenon in the future. Today, I view this problem with somewhat greater optimism than before. The government is engaged in seeking specific solutions in earnest, and a special working group has been formed. [SEGODNYA] Is your optimism connected with the resignation of Boris Fedorov? [Kokoshin] In no way. Why translate everything into personalities? It is not a matter of the personality of a particular appointed person (although this also is of significance), but of following a sensible financial policy. We must not issue subsidies and credits according to the principle of "something for everyone" [literally, "a set of earrings for all sisters"], with more going to the one who is more impudent or is closer, which, by the way, often was done even with the tightest monetary practice. We must extricate the productions vital to the country element by element and not pay off debts to all in succession, but above all to competitive sectors which subsequently will be able both to earn a living themselves and to allow others to earn one. In particular, I am a proponent of helping the aviation and space industries, although unquestionably there are many excess capacities there which must be reoriented. Here we are competitive: Labor productivity in a number of our rocket industry productions is 30 percent higher than in the United States, in experts' estimates. It makes no sense to finance all sorts of sectorial scientific research through the Ministry of Defense such as superpowerful lasers, neutral particle accelerators and other exotic projects about which it is unknown when they will be able to become weapons. And if we do continue them, then we must do so from funds being allocated for basic science and exploratory research or from internal sectorial sources of financing. Today the Ministry of Defense has money only for a limited number of real weapons, and that means the entire defense order and all budget defense financing should be concentrated in the Ministry of Defense, not scattered to other departments as was the custom in Soviet times. We now coordinate joint programs with the Ministry of Science, with the State Committee for the Defense Industry (I would like it to be done more vigorously), with the MVD, with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, and with the Border Guard Troops. [SEGODNYA] It turns out that the Ministry of Defense is objectively interested in reducing the overall number of military enterprises in order to have a concentration of ready money instead of its present dissipation? [Kokoshin] We are interested in a radical structural reorganization of industry and in a sharp increase in labor productivity. The cost system of military production keeps dragging us to the bottom. An improvement in economic conditions of defense enterprises clearly is needed in a large number of cases. The question of a reduction in social infrastructure of defense enterprises is an acute one. [SEGODNYA] What is the destiny of the Russian (Soviet) stealth aircraft (F-117 analogue)? Insofar as I know, the first tests of flying prototypes of such aircraft were held back in the 1980's? [Kokoshin] Well, within limits of what is permitted, I will attempt to set forth my own viewpoint as a scientist with a basic technical engineering education, adjusted to a certain extent by my present official position. Let us begin by saying that two basic ways for developing stealth technology can be traced today: Either make an invisible aircraft or an invisible winged missile, which is both cheaper and preferable, although the development of radar acquisition equipment shows that absolute invisibility is unattainable in principle. By the way, our newest radars and other electronic equipment have no problems detecting "invisible" U.S. aircraft, and at rather long ranges. It is also unquestionable that certain other countries are fully capable of adjusting the production of similar detection equipment or modernizing old equipment within a certain time, and others can purchase it, let's say, for petrodollars. Mass creation of "invisible" aircraft will be expensive. At the same time, it is possible to reduce "visibility" of conventional aircraft by less costly methods and thereby considerably improve their combat effectiveness. [SEGODNYA] In developing the new main F-22 fighter the Americans undertook to make it more "invisible" through a degradation of performance characteristics... [Kokoshin] In the newest military technologies of a practical nature it is always necessary to sacrifice something; the question is just what to sacrifice. For us, performance characteristics traditionally have been the holy of holies, although maneuverability is not always the dominating value in modern aircraft construction. The capability of an aircraft to counter enemy precision weapons and itself employ such weapons is more important. This is achieved by EW assets. Such is the possible "asymmetric" answer to the challenge of the rather promising stealth technology. There are no "cheap" weapon programs in principle, but we will have to seek more refined and at the same time more economical solutions based on the country's capabilities. The world has countries that are highly developed, medium developed and poorly developed in the military-technical sense. One's own set of weapons is needed in case of a conflict, depending on the enemy's level.
