The same Afghanistan produced an ugly image in the international opinion after the culmination of their struggle in 1991 when the Soviet Union-installed government ceased to exist. The Mojahedin, who had been ready to sacrifice all they had in the way of the armed struggle against the Communist occupiers, turned their guns against each other. So far more civilians and military personnel have become victims of their revenge than all the casualties recorded during the 15 years of Soviet occupation. Western countries led by the United States ran away from Afghanistan as after the conclusion of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union their interest in the land-locked country ended. But regional countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, have done their best to solve the internal fight, and have met with no success. Former Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif took all the warring parties to Islam's holiest place, in Mecca, where the Mojahedin vowed not to fight with each other and work for the reconstruction of their almost destroyed country during 15 years of war with the Reds. Their pledge before the Almighty in Whose name they fought the Communists had no meaning and several times they have shed the blood of their own brothers. The last was on Saturday when hundreds of rockets slammed into Kabul, the worst onslaught on the shattered capital in months. The forces of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Hekmatyar battled in other parts of the country also. It looks like the Mojahedin signed a peace agreement for nothing but to break the citizens and bring them more hardship. So far, whatever the neighboring countries have done to bring peace to Afghanistan is not enough and a concrete step should be taken. An immediate summit meeting of regional countries including Iran, Pakistan and some others with influence in Afghanistan, could be held to chalk out a plan for free and fair elections which is a must and that many believe can silence the guns.
