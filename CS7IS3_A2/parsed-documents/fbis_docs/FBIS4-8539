In Athens he had talks with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. After the talks both ministers concluded that it is possible to extend cooperation between the two countries. Andjelko Perincic reports on Minister Granic's visit to Athens: [Perincic] Ministers Granic and Papoulias agreed that interstate treaties on industry, traffic, protection of investments, and the prevention of double taxation would soon be signed, and that business transactions should begin immediately. At the meeting the two delegations also discussed military cooperation, Croatian-Greek cooperation in the sphere of security in southeast Europe and in the Mediterranean, and international military cooperation within the United Nations. Croatia obtained Greek support for its admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace. In this regard, Greece wants the same kind of friendship with Croatia as with all other countries of former Yugoslavia, it was said. The Greek hosts also supported Croatia's efforts to reintegrate occupied Croatian areas in a peaceful way, adding, as Minister Papoulias himself stated at a news conference, that peace in that area and in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be a basis for peace in the entire region. Papoulias said that fighting should be halted in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is endangering peace processes, and that negotiations in which Serbs should also be included ought to be initiated. As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, Minister Granic stated for Croatian Radio: [Begin Granic recording] Our joint conclusion is that a cease-fire agreement, and after that, the inclusion of the third party, the Serb party, into negotiations with the federation [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] are the most important things at the moment. Greece ought to take an even more active part, as the European Union [EU] chairman, in the peace process, the process of negotiations, together with the United States and the Russian Federation. [end recording] [Perincic] The talks in Athens were also useful because Greece is currently the EU chairman. Therefore, its support for Croatia to join the EU PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program is not insignificant. Greece lends its support to Croatia for other forms of cooperation with the European Union and for our efforts to obtain aid from the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other international financial institutions for the reconstruction of our country.
