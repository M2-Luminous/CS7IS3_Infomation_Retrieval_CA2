They also speak about Israel's continued circumvention of the peace process. In its editorial, TISHRIN comments on U.S. efforts to advance the peace process, and notes the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region next Saturday. The paper discusses the ideas conveyed by Christopher to Syria during his recent talks with President Hafiz al-Asad, saying: Informed quarters revealed at the time that the proposals conveyed by Christopher from Israel to Syrian officials during his recent visit did not include anything new. The ideas turned the priorities of the peace process upside down. TISHRIN adds: Instead of Israel's public commitment to full withdrawal from the occupied territories in line with Security Council resolutions and the Madrid conference foundations, the Israeli ideas focused on security arrangements and then a peace treaty, and withdrawal eventually being achieved over a long period of time. Israel, in other words, would secure security and peace in advance. As for the land, it will continue to be under Israeli occupation and blackmail. Syria has made it clear to Secretary Christopher that full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal is a top priority and that peace and security are a consequence of withdrawal and not the opposite. After pointing out that Israel has dragged the Palestinians into the trap of autonomy and deprived them of their rights, TISHRIN adds: The land is the basic factor of conflict, and there can be no peace or security without the return of the land, which means regaining all of the Golan; Lebanon regaining its southern part in full; Jordan regaining its occupied territory; and the return of the evacuee and displaced Syrians, Lebanese, and Jordanians to their land. Any solution to our conflict with Israel that is not based on returning the land is futile and has no future. TISHRIN concludes: It is well known that Syria has insisted, right from the very beginning, on a comprehensive and just solution in the Middle East that ensures the implementation of Security Council resolutions to the letter, and consequently, the return of all the occupied territories. Syria has also rejected phased settlements and partial solutions and insisted on a just and comprehensive peace. It is enough for us to look at the Gaza- Jericho reality and the Palestinians' across-the-board displeasure to see the soundness of Syria's attitude and its concept of a true, honorable peace in the Middle East. Peace does not agree with occupation and expansion and hegemony. There can be no peace without full Israeli withdrawal. Under the headline "Syria Will Not Relinquish Any Iota of Rights," AL-BA'TH writes: Once again, there is news about a visit to the region shortly by the U.S. secretary of state to advance the peace process. The visit might include shuttle tours that serve his mission. The paper adds: Israeli sources have acknowledged that the gap is still wide between the proposals made by Israel and conveyed by the U.S. secretary to Damascus recently and the Syrian reply to these proposals. AL-BA'TH adds: If we contrast the two positions, it is possible to assert that the Rabin government has continued to try to circumvent the peace process and evade a serious discussion that addresses the substance of this process. This is done through adopting the principle of separate solutions and partial deals. The paper stresses that just and comprehensive peace in the region will not be achieved except through commitment to the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, in line with the foundations of the peace process to which Syria has committed itself as a strategic option. It is natural, therefore, that the gap will remain wide between the Syrian and Israeli positions, as a result of the Rabin government's rejection of the peace initiative and Syria's commitment to this initiative. The paper concludes that separate solutions do not serve peace. Depending on the Oslo accord is a trick that is convincing only to those who abandon pan-Arab rights. Syria can never relinquish an iota of these rights.
