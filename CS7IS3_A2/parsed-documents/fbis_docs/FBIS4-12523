The sources said 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, was to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa as part of efforts to clear the obstacles. 'Abbas was a signatory to the September 13 PLO-Israeli autonomy accord. The PLO executive committee member will stay on in the Egyptian capital for the negotiations due to resume here on Sunday. He will work to keep an April 13 target for the Israeli army to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, to be replaced by a Palestinian police force. The PLO accuses Israel of placing obstacles in the way of applying the autonomy accord, which originally was to have been launched on December 13. 'Abbas was also expected to meet delegates of an international observer force to be deployed in the mosque massacre town of Hebron, under a March 31 agreement with Israel, the sources added. The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel last Wednesday adjourned negotiations to finalize a deal on an Israeli withdrawal. The talks have snagged on a PLO demand that Israel set a date for the withdrawal before an advance party goes to the territories to prepare the ground for the Palestinian police.
