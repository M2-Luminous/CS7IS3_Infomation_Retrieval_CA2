FR940223-2-00105 FR940223-2-00056 [Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;677 (Preliminary)] Coumarin From the People's Republic of China Determination On the basis of the record 1 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission unanimously determines, pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports from the People's Republic of China of coumarin, 2 provided for in subheading 2932.21.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 1 The record is defined in sec. 207.2(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR §207.2(f)). 2 For purposes of this investigation, coumarin is an aroma chemical with the chemical formula C 9 H 6 O 2 . All forms and variations of coumarin are included within the scope of the investigation, such as coumarin in crystal, flake, or powder form, and ``crude'' or unrefined coumarin ( i.e. prior to purification or crystallization). Excluded from the scope are ethylcoumarins (C 11 H 10 O 2 ) and methylcoumarins (C 10 H 8 O 2 ). Background On December 30, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Rhône-Poulenc Specialty Chemicals Co., Cranbury, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of coumarin from the People's Republic of China. Accordingly, effective December 30, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;677 (Preliminary). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of January 7, 1994 (59 F.R. 1026). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on January 20, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on February 14, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2733 (February 1994), entitled ``Coumarin from the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;677 (Preliminary).'' By order of the Commission. Issued: February 15, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3988 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
