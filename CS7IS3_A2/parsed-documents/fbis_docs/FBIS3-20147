Voting is taking place in a completely calm atmosphere. This morning the most important state figures cast their votes. Rocco Tolfa reports. [Tolfa] Quiet please, we are voting. Italians are going to the polls and the party leaders are keeping quiet after a fiery electoral campaign. However, the leading figures of the Italian state are saying that these elections truly represent a historic turning point. This was stressed by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who voted in his hometown of Novara. The head of state said this is a decisive moment in the history of our country.
