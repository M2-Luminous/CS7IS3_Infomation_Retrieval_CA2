Some other aspects have come to light today, however. In fact, in the course of the 16th round of the Estonian-Russian talks an agreement on the troop withdrawal from Estonia was almost completely agreed upon. For the first time Estonia agreed officially to the Russian proposal for the troops to be withdrawn by 31 August of this year. This has been stated by Juri Kahn, Estonian ambassador to Russia. According to Kahn the only point in the agreement that remains unresolved is the issue of financial compensation. This will have to be regulated at the level of heads of state. The Russian side has, however, (?stipulated) that they would agree to holding a summit only once the Estonian side has ensured social protection for the Russian military pensioners in Estonia, according to the conditions set by Russia. Considerable progress at this round of Estonian-Russian talks was achieved also concerning issues on dismantling the nuclear reactors at Paldiski. According to ETA this was stated by Mark Sinisoo, leader of the Estonian delegation's working group on Paldiski and an adviser at the Foreign Ministry, at a news conference today. According to him success achieved at the talks in Moscow resulted directly from the conclusions made at the conference held last week in Stockholm on the issue of Paldiski.
