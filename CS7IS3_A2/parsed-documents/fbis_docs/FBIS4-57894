He said the changes will improve the Armed Forces' performance, thus helping to "guarantee the security of the democratic institutions." Garcia gave a speech yesterday morning during a ceremony to commemorate Army Day. The ceremony took place in the Army square and was attended by President Luis Alberto Lacalle and the cabinet. The anniversary of the battle of Las Piedras was commemorated during a ceremony that took place during the afternoon in the town of Las Piedras, and which was also attended by President Lacalle. Mayor Jose Andujar gave a speech in which he defended the amendment of the Constitution through a plebiscite that will be held in November. During the ceremony in the Army square, Garcia said the Armed Forces' restructuralization plan attained "a better use of human, material, and financial resources, which is something essential for the performance of a modern Army." Among the measures that were adopted, he pointed out the staff reduction in the Army General Command, Staff, and Administrative Support Command, several of whose members were reassigned "to field positions." The objective, he said, is to "concentrate the basic units in the large elemental tactical units by carrying out the necessary studies and coordination to modernize and readapt them." After listing the many changes made in the force, he said the improvement of the efficiency, modernization, and readaptation of the Army "will, in the future, allow the Army to efficiently comply with its basic traditional mission of defending our independence, peace, territorial integrity, Constitution, and the laws within our specific jurisdiction, and will contribute to guaranteeing the security of the democratic institutions, which we hereby reaffirm." In conclusion, Garcia said he is sure that "we are heading toward a more efficient and professional Army in which unified thought and action are and will be our line of action to attain our basic objectives."
