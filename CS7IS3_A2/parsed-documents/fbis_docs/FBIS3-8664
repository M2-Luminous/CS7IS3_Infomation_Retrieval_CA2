[Gochev] I think that the conflict was invented in and staged by the Ministry of Defense. The scandal was prompted by collecting signatures for our petition. It started at the Khaskovo Garrison. However, our petition did not attack the ministry or the government. It was intended for parliament and invoked not only the budget, but also the Law on the Defense and Armed Forces. [Grudev] However, the Army budget was adopted and the 37 billion leva requested by the legion was not allocated.... [Gochev] It is mere rumor that we requested 37 billion leva. The almost 13 billion that were allocated is the defense minister's problem. Parliament has in effect refused to assume responsibility for the situation in the Armed Forces and for the defense of the state. The buck was passed to the Ministry of Defense and not without the help of the new members of the minister's cabinet. [Grudev] Whom do you have in mind? [Gochev] Deputy Minister Boyko Noev. [Grudev] What responsibility do you mean? [Gochev] According to the existing law the Armed Forces' payroll is determined by the Council of Ministers following the proposal of the Defense Ministry. Now I understand why the parliament was not in a hurry to adopt the new Law on Defense. According to the draft law it is the National Assembly that should determine the size of the Army. This awkward issue was transferred to the executive. [Grudev] The legion has been accused of requesting higher wages for the officers through a higher budget. [Gochev] In our petition we do not mention at all any request for higher wages. However, a bigger budget would facilitate the improvement of the Bulgarian military's social situation. Nevertheless, this is not the most important issue. We demand kerosene so that our aircraft can fly and continue their training. We demand money for properly functioning equipment and for improving the Army's combat ability. [Grudev] Who is interested in this? [Gochev] Obviously, there are political forces interested in the future development of the Armed Forces. The experts know the price of preserving the army and they have expressed their opinion. Perhaps this irritated many people. Now Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev has said several times that Bulgaria does not need an army of more than 55,000 soldiers. This is absurd. Against the background of this position I do not know whether this is precisely what the new budget was aiming at. I do not know whose policy this is. However, those who adhere to it should publicly explain their position. The defense minister should ask his deputy, Noev, what and whose this policy is. [Grudev] What do you intend to do with your petition? How many signatures have you collected? [Gochev] Before the holidays it had been signed by 3,200 officers and sergeants. We have stopped counting. Now we expect the penalties. The accusations of planning a putsch have evaporated. Now we will ask those who accused us to apologize publicly. [Grudev] Will the petition be handed to parliament as you promised? [Gochev] This is absurd in the existing situation. Those who signed the petition signed it with their three names, their military serial number, and the unit in which they serve. We cannot be sure that someone will not decide to begin the "reform" by dismissing those who have signed the petition. So we will only announce the final number of those who have signed the petition. [Grudev] How will the legion act if there are cuts in the Army? [Gochev] In any event, we will insist that those who will be dismissed from the Armed Forces for various reasons will be granted all forms of security provided in law. We have already heard that instead of the financial compensation that they are entitled to, they will receive securities. The officers are already calling these "pieces of paper." This would be the ultimate mockery of the Army.
