And more patients are arriving continuously at an emergency field hospital in the area, while others are being transferred to hospitals in the Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging region and Garankuwa. So far one death has been confirmed, that of Marinda Zulu, 23, who died in the Delmas Hospital on Tuesday morning. She first felt the symptoms three days ago but went to the field hospital only on Monday. She was transferred to Delmas Hospital on Monday afternoon and died early on Tuesday. Another woman and a primary school pupil had also died, but it had not been confirmed they died of typhoid. Brig Louis du Preez, the officer commanding the field hospital on Tuesday said: ``I don't see it subsiding for at least the next week since the disease has an incubation period of seven to 14 days.'' The Delmas Town Council set up the emergency hospital at the local airport by Saturday morning to deal with the influx of people from Botleng township who could not be accommodated in nearby hospitals. At least 50 SA [South African] Defence Force medical corps personnel are working around the clock treating patients at the field hospital. One of the doctors contracted the disease and was evacuated to one military hospital in Voortrekkerhoogte, Pretoria, on Monday morning. Brig du Preez confirmed there were more than 1,000 cases of suspected typhoid, including those that had been sent to other hospitals. Nearly 150 people were admitted to the field hospital on Monday, although more than 40 were discharged by the end of the day and a further 50 on Tuesday morning, with tablets for them to continue treatment. Brig du Preez said 21 cases of typhoid had been confirmed so far, but added that since test results took 72 hours to be determined, the figure was certain to rise dramatically. Ambulances would continue transporting people from Botleng to the nearby hospital. Loudspeakers were being used to urge all those with diarrhea to report to the hospital, Brig du Preez said. According to Acting Town Clerk Henre de Hart, older people and children were more susceptible to the highly contagious disease, which is spread through body fluids and contaminated food. Delmas Management Committee Chairman David Swanepoel said water had been tested weekly in the past, but was now being analysed daily. Most cases had come from the Mandela View squatter camp on the outskirts of Botleng, although the syringe needles stuck in a map to indicate the origin of each case, clearly showed the disease had struck the entire township. Mr de Hart said the causes were unhealthy living conditions, which were being addressed by a R[rand]6.9 million grant for the development of 2,700 new stands.
