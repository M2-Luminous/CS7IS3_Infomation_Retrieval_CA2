A total of 1,500 directors of enterprises with different forms of ownership, representing 11 industrial branches, answered questionnaire items related to innovation activity (work director--Georgiy Ostapkovich). The inquiry indicated that so-called branch science, the scientific research institutes and design bureaus specializing in the filling of orders of enterprises in definite industrial branches, has almost completely lost orders directly from enterprises and exists only under conditions of a constant shrinking of budgeted financing. Virtually all the work on improvement in the technology of production and the quality of products has been shifted directly to the enterprises and less than half the queried enterprises are at all concerned with this. The principal direction in innovative activity at enterprises is the introduction of new types of production (about half the queried directors). Work on the automation of production, the introduction of new technologies and forms of organization of activity were mentioned by three or four times fewer directors. In the administrative sphere renovation most often involves computerization (39%). In the future a quarter of the queried directors intend to invest sums on innovations. Joint stock companies are exhibiting great activity in this field and the least activity is being displayed by leasing enterprises, partnerships with limited responsibility and production cooperatives. As the principal sources of financing the directors mention their own resources, as well as short- and long-term loans. The directors of 173 commercial banks also participated in the inquiry. More than half of them declared that they make no loans at all for innovation projects, despite the fact that the income received by the banks as a result of such loans is free of taxation; 48% of the queried banks grant loans for innovative projects directly to industrial enterprises and the more actively the greater the statutory reserves of the bank. The bankers, in answering the questions on the questionnaire, declared bluntly that financing for the renovation of production facilities and production will be made available only after a system for state insuring of credits for innovations has been established and a clearly defined mechanism for the application of a secure loan law has been introduced. In commenting on the situation in this field, Garegin Tosunyan, president of the Moscow Bank for the Development of Science and Technologies (Tekhnobank), stated that hopes for the financing of science in the absence of patent and juridical protection of the results of individual work, as well as management servicing scientific circles, is an illusion from which it is necessary to escape as soon as possible. In his words, specialists developing innovations most frequently turn to the bank themselves asking for sums either for a particular project or on a handshake: we will buy something, sell it, repay the loan, and pay ourselves from the profit. Virtually not once, said the banker, have we dealt with an engineer, scientist or designer who was capable of looking at the extension of credit problem from our point of view: how great are the chances that the sums handed out by the bank today will be returned tomorrow with a profit compensating for all the losses, including inflation? To the question of specialists of the Tekhnobank credit section from whence the various kinds of equipment necessary for the new production would come, the most common answer is: ``They promise they will supply us with it.'' It is interesting that there is at least one sphere of production in which the banks themselves have recently begun to exhibit innovative activity: the production of pharmaceuticals. This market at present to a considerable degree is not filled and the demand is very high and elastic: there are medicines for which people are ready to give their last ruble. In addition there are idle plants at which it is possible to master the production of new drugs and an alternative marketing network. In this field itself a management system is now being formed serving the interests of developers and bankers and a system for search for new drugs for the purpose of financing their production. With respect to the remaining branches, according to data from the Market Conditions Center, the greatest innovative activity is observed in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. The situation with innovations in the light, food and printing industries is the very poorest.
