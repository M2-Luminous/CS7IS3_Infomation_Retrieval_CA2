It is well known that the Madrid conference was merely a general conference in which general speeches were delivered determining general outlines for the general policies of all the concerned parties, including the Palestinian side and the Israeli enemy. The impasse through which the talks are going was caused by that massacre which was committed against the Palestinian people in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. Initial investigations proved that the Israeli Government, Rabin's government, and the Israeli Army were directly or indirectly responsible for overlooking [the threat caused by] those settlers, though they were aware of a possibility for such a massacre being committed. Thus, the impasse which the talks have reached does not require going back to zero, but it is in need of the guarantees which the PLO has demanded; security guarantees for the Palestinian people. These guarantees can never materialize before an international force, in one form or another, becomes available to help and protect the Palestinian people. At the same time, the occupation forces should perform their duties toward the security of the Palestinian people. Matters were moving in a natural way before this massacre. There were timetables and measures which would have been taken a few days later were it not for the perpetration of this massacre. Thus, I am saying that if guarantees to protect the Palestinian people were offered to us in Madrid, Washington, Cairo, or Taba, we would not be against any meeting, anywhere, but it should secure for us such guarantees, on condition that we do not go back to the starting point, but to what we have reached, i.e. [Israeli] withdrawal should start within days and conclude before 13 April, the previously agreed on date during the signing ceremony in Washington. [Correspondent] Do we understand that if the Security Council does not sanction in its meeting today, or tomorrow, a resolution regarding your requests, the Palestinians will boycott the talks? [Abu-al-'Izz] If the Security Council does not sanction an orientation which contains security guarantees for our people, it could mean that the Security Council is not really concerned with the progress of a genuine and just peace that would achieve security and stability for the peoples of the region, including the Palestinian people, and the United States bears the responsibility for this. As it is clear, the latter is the one which actually prevents the Security Council adopting a resolution to this effect.
