Since it is known that many are physically and psychologically ill-suited for such work, an effort was made to define screening criteria to be used in selecting such personnel. The work, carried out in three stages, involved a sample of 200 workers from drilling teams and a control group of 200 land transportation workers. The incidence of illness and duration of accompanying incapacity in the study group were analyzed, but special attention also was given to the frequency of occurrence of accidents, which are quite common and result in inability to perform tasks for protracted periods. These were more numerous than in the control. Different afflictions played the most important roles in the study and control groups and the days of work loss were greater in the former than in the latter. Acute, chronic and latent diseases were greater in the study group than in the control group by a factor of 8. A psychophysiological study of the personality was made with respect to 32 parameters, including the implications of introversion and extroversion in subjects of both groups, which are to be taken into account in future screening. A wide range of physiological factors was examined as applicable to professional selection for work in the Far North. The results of the study have been used in formulating rehabilitation programs.
