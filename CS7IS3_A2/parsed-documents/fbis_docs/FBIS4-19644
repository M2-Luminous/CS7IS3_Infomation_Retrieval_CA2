FBIS4-19644 "drweu077_h_94018" FBIS-WEU-94-077 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 GERMANY Economics Ministry Releases Monthly Report Economics Ministry Releases Monthly Report LD1904090994 Berlin DDP/ADN in German 1008 GMT 18 Apr 94 LD1904090994 Berlin DDP/ADN German BFN [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of the German Government, the economic situation in Germany has "brightened up again." In western Germany, current data indicates that the economic recovery is strengthening, says the monthly report of the Economics Ministry for April, published in Bonn today. Furthermore, the upturn in the east German economy "broadened and strengthened considerably." The labor market, however, is still suffering from the after effects of the recession and the consequences of substantial rationalization efforts by companies. The seasonal reduction in the unemployment figure for March, which fell below 4 million for the first time in months, was therefore smaller than usual. In western Germany the March unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent and in eastern Germany at 16.8 percent. At the same time, the ministry points out that unemployment is far from being exclusively a German problem. In all other European Union countries the unemployment rate is higher than in Germany, it notes. The Economics Ministry bases its optimism about the economy on a survey carried out by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research among 350 mainly large companies, which expect an average increase in production of 1.25 percent in 1994. Moreover, new orders in industry and in the construction sector increased noticeably at the beginning of the year. The retail trade sector also registered a slight increase in turnover. Production in eastern Germany will even "expand strongly," the ministry said. At the start of the year orders in east Germany's industrial sector were almost 15 percent up on the previous year's level. Production was 16 percent higher than the previous year's level. Orders in the construction industry were up 29 percent. According to the figures, inflation continues to ease. In western Germany the annual rate in March was 3.2 percent and in eastern Germany it was 3.5 percent.
