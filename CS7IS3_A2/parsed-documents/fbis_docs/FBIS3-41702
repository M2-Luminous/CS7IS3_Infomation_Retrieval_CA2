Nevinnaya: ``Typhoid Rages in Volgodonsk But Specialists See No Grounds for Special Alarm''] [Text] According to data from the State Committee on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery From Natural Disasters [GKChS], the number of persons hospitalized for typhoid in Volgodonsk in the Rostov Oblast has reached 286. As TRUD already wrote several days ago, this dangerous disease began spreading because of trouble in the local water supply system. As of today, the diagnosis has already been confirmed in 179 persons. Yesterday an interdepartmental meeting on the problems of infectious diseases and the epidemic situation in Russia convened under the chairmanship of G. Filatov, deputy chairman of the CKChS. Representatives of the RF State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and Ministry of Health took part in the meeting. Increases in the frequency of cases of typhoid, cholera, diptheria, and other dangerous infections on Russian territory were noted. The following were cited as the main reasons: poor-quality untreated water, contaminated foodstuffs, and infected tourists traveling into the country. Preventive measures and measures to eliminate those foci of disease that have already developed, including in Volgodonsk, were discussed. As were were informed at the GKChS press center, however, ``the meeting participants expressed their certainty that the current situation in Russia regarding infectious diseases is not threat.'' Any commentary is, as they say, unnecessary.
