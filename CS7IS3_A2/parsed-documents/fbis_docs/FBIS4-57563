FBIS4-57563 "drlat098_c_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 MEXICO Deputy Foreign Secretary on Foreign Observers Deputy Foreign Secretary on Foreign Observers PA2005042394 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 19 May 94 p 6 PA2005042394 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Article by Blanche Petrich] [Text] Deputy Foreign Relations Secretary Andres Rozental has said here that the initiative of Senators Robert Torricelli and David Bonior, who oppose NAFTA, presented yesterday to the U.S. Congress in Washington to ensure that U.S. demands that Mexico accept the presence of foreign observers during the August election, is "unnecessary, rather unserious, and disqualifying in essence." As he commented on the U.S. congressmen's proposals, the Mexican diplomat stressed the position already taken by the Mexican Embassy in Washington. "The nature of the Mexican electoral process is something that concerns neither the U.S. Congress nor the U.S. Government." As for the concept of "foreign visitors" which the Mexican Congress already included in the Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe), Rozental pointed out that the government "so far" has not anticipated inviting any foreign figure or institution to witness the development of the general elections. "Should there be an agreement on this issue among the nine political parties, I am sure the government would not oppose it." He also explained that the procedures to extend the invitations will "not necessarily" be accomplished through the Foreign Relations Secretariat. "In that case, the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] and Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, as IFE president [as published], must extend the invitations." According to a document by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit, headed by Horacio Boneo, the Mexican Government is reportedly studying the possibility of authorizing "foreign visitors" who, it is believed, would join the group of almost 15,000 national observers who will verify compliance with the laws at the 94,000 electoral booths that will open nationwide on 21 August. Last week, these observers, members of a large network of nongovernmental organizations grouped under the Observation 94 Civic Alliance, agreed with the United Nations to set up a mechanism to receive training and counsel from the UN Electoral Assistance Unit. Meanwhile, the process to reform Cofipe to allow the presence of "foreign visitors" ended on 13 May, as the Congress unanimously approved the inclusion of this new concept in Mexican legislation. The only thing left to do is to include the definition, responsibilities, and limitations of these "visitors" in the regulating law. So far, only the Confederation of Industrial Chambers has planned to invite some foreign institutions, including the commission headed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, as "visitors." It is expected political parties will hand out their own invitations to similar institutions and personalities. The Bonior-Torricelli initiative, which is based on the concept that NAFTA must foster a spirit of "familiarity" among its three members in all fields, including politics and democracy, failed to receive the endorsement to be presented to the U.S. House of Representatives. It seems only 14 representatives are supporting it, and the Foreign Affairs Committee is refusing to back it. "I have the impression that in addition to a few Mexico-bashers [previous word published in English] there, no further support is going to be found; Bonior and Torricelli will achieve nothing." The deputy secretary stressed that the wording of the initiative by these two Democratic congressmen has "meddling undertones," and it is completely fruitless. "The U.S. Government, even Bill Clinton himself, has supported all efforts made so far to improve the electoral process and, above all, the foreign observation issue, which we are resolving on our own [motu propio]. This Torricelli play does not even help." The duo had previously presented several initiatives on Mexico. The two of them were very active in opposing NAFTA because they thought Mexico lacked the merits to become a privileged member of the northern hemisphere. Recently, they attempted to encourage Congress to discuss the Chiapas conflict. "I feel Torricelli, with his Cuban perceptions on his back, is very resentful because he failed to convince our government to support his anti-Cuban policies," said the deputy secretary. As for Bonior, "this is his revenge for failing to halt NAFTA." The thing "is that neither of them knows Mexico, and it shows."
