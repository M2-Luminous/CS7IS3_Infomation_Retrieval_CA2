Major General Biran, you are speaking live on IDF Radio. What were your feelings at that moment? [Biran] It was a very exciting moment. We have achieved a joint success. I hope this success is only the beginning and we will see over the next few days whether things are fully working out. There is a great deal of promise but reality is a bit more difficult and we must be realistic. [Yokhpaz] What did the Palestinian officer say to you? [Biran] We have been discussing things for many days and these issues are not for comment over the radio. [Yokhpaz] Did you give them any last-minute tips prior to their entrance? [Biran] Yes, we have agreed on our respective duties. [Yokhpaz] Major General Biran, could you bid a short farewell live on IDF Radio to the Jericho autonomous area? [Biran] We have implemented the government's decision. I salute the soldiers here who did an excellent job. [Yokhpaz] That was Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] checkpoint at the entrance to what is now the Palestinian autonomous area in Jericho.
