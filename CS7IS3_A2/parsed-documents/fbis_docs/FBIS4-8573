Pawlak conveyed respective letters to the ambassadors of the European Union states at a meeting in Warsaw on Wednesday. Greek Ambassador Yeoryios Alexandropoulos said that it is not for the ambassadors to decide whether to accept Poland as a EU member but that they will give their full support to Poland's application for the membership. Governmental commissioner for the European integration Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said after the meeting that the foreign ministers of the "Twelve" are to meet in Luxembourg on April 18 to decide, among other things, on the sending of the Polish application to the European Commission for examination. "Such a move will help begin negotiations on Poland's membership of the union," he added. Saryusz-Wolski said he hopes that Poland should become a full member of the European Union in 1999.
