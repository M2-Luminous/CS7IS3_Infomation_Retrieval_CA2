They say that after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir died, his successor Anwar al-Sadat was riding the presidential limousine. When he arrived at a junction in the center of Cairo, the driver asked: Where should we turn here? Where did the late president use to turn? al-Sadat asked. The driver said: Left, of course! (the Nasirist socialism). Well, then, al-Sadat said, signal to the left, but turn right. Israel has become part of the Middle East thanks to the two governments of the late Menahem Begin who signed the Camp David agreements. Agreements that included an autonomy for the Palestinians, an Israeli withdrawal, and a strong Palestinian police force. At the time, everyone realized this was merely a fig leaf for Egypt allowing it to sign a separate agreement with Israel. Everyone also understood that Begin gave up on the entire Sinai to save Judaea and Samaria. With one hand, Ari'el Sharon promoted the construction of strongholds in the Yamit Strip but, in a careless phone call, gave Begin his approval for the full withdrawal from the entire Sinai, and destroyed Yamit to the ground himself. Even the faithful of Eretz Yisra'el were part of the Middle East then. The struggle conducted over the rooftops of Yamit was, in fact, not over Yamit. It was an attempt to deter possible negotiations over the fate of Judaea and Samaria. We can say today that the struggle fulfilled its purpose perfectly. When asked how come there was no bitter struggle over Jericho, we answer that this struggle was conducted in Yamit, and the result of that struggle is the fact that in the current agreement, signed by a leftist government, the settlements remain in place and the Palestinians were forced to agree. Now the struggle over Judaea and Samaria, and Jerusalem begins; or to be more precise: the struggle over Judaea and Samaria for Jerusalem, and over Jerusalem as the heart of Judaea and Samaria. The whole truth is not always said in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is now leading us to new levels in the Middle East. Last week he explained that he denied the letter on Jerusalem because: A. it was not released in Cairo; B. it was not sent to 'Arafat; C. it was not considered a commitment in the negotiations. Here, Peres picked a noble example. If someone asked Ben-Gurion whether he met someone at 5 o'clock when the meeting was at 6, he would simply say no. No one asked him about a 6 o'clock meeting, therefore he did not answer. Peres calls this "an absolute truth." True, the open agreements contain clauses far graver than this letter, and its exposure allows us to, perhaps, close some of the loopholes regarding Jerusalem. But, what about the norms of "our ministers'" conduct? Now I understand what the foreign minister meant when he said that the PLO has not been involved in terror acts since the Oslo agreement was signed. He made the remark when objective sources reported that 35 acts of terror were perpetrated by Fatah groups between the signing of the Oslo agreement and the Cairo agreement. Peres was simply referring to PLO-Tunis diplomats who were busy with the negotiations. The time has come to examine Peres' economic vision for the Middle East. Naturally, he was not misleading us when he spoke of flourishing growth if the agreements succeed. He used the "absolute truth" method. The Palestinians will flourish and experience growth, Israel is supposed to shrink. When Peres stood on the Knesset podium and spoke about the Israeli agriculture, about making the desserts blossom and glorifying Zionism, he knew he was delivering an eulogy. He knew that Palestinian farming is about to inherit Israeli farming; that every Palestinian well drilled in the Janin area will dry up a Zionist well in the Yizre'el Valley; that there is not enough water for two farming systems that make the desert flourish. He also knew that the prices of the Palestinian produce will eliminate the Israeli agriculture. How do I know that he knew? Because, shortly after the Oslo agreement was signed, I obtained the forecasts of "Israel Toward the Year 2025," prepared by professional teams associated with the foreign minister. They clearly forecasted that Israeli agriculture, along with other economic branches that require plenty of manual labor, will collapse. They forecast that Israel will be crowded, with people living in high-rises, and that housing prices will soar seriously. They realized that the growth we have been experiencing since the Six-Days War will be replaced by a Palestinian growth. They also knew that the only chance the Israeli economy has to flourish depends on the level of our incorporation in "joint projects" with the Palestinians. This is precisely why Abu-Hulala [name as published], in charge of Palestinian development, has announced that Israeli entrepreneurs will not be incorporated in any of the projects. Palestinians flourishing at our expense may not be critical, but this will not convince the Tel Aviv stock exchange. There, they have begun to understand this is the "absolute truth." Does this have to happen? No! Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin can still come to his senses and retaliate for the dozens of Palestinian violations of the agreements: A. He can send the Palestinian national institutions to Jericho, with all due respect. B. He can renew construction, if only in the Israeli settlement strip in the western Samaria and Binyamin Districts, where there is a clear Jewish majority even today. In doing so, Rabin will be securing Israeli control over the mountain aquifer, the Dan District water reservoir. He will prevent the elimination of the Israeli agriculture in the Sharon region, and will ease the pressure and distress in housing construction. By resuming construction work in the greater Dan District, we could signal a direction for Israel to thrive, before any Palestinian growth. The Palestinians will gain, but not at our expense. It does not matter whether this is the third or the fourth path. It is certain that the people will back it, no matter who leads it.
