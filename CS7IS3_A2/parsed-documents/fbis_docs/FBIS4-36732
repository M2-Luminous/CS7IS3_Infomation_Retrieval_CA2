The message, dealing with bilateral ties and the continuing coordination between the two leaders over matters related to the current Arab situation, was delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who arrived in Cairo earlier today. After the meeting, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said that Egypt and Saudi Arabia are very concerned about stopping the fighting in Yemen. He said events in that country are very critical, declaring: We are devoting our efforts and energies to ensure a successful cease-fire for the good of all parties. Regarding north Yemen's noncompliance with the UN Security Council resolution to observe a cease-fire, al-Faysal said that continued fighting hinders everything and does not merely hurt Yemen but its neighboring Arab countries as well. Remarking that the wish to end the fighting in Yemen is shared by all the Arab countries, he voiced hope that this wish will find a favorable response, particularly during the current mission of the UN secretary general's envoy there. Asked about the Gulf Cooperation Council's [GCC] position on the Yemeni crisis, the Saudi Foreign minister referred to the GCC statement on the issue and explained that its stance is clear. The GCC believes that continued fighting will force the GCC countries to adopt measures against the party that refuses the cease-fire. He said: Let us give the UN envoy a chance to make some efforts in this matter.
