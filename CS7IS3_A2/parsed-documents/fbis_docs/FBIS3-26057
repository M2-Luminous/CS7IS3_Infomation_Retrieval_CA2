According to the figures and conditions published by related departments, there are many honest officials. Based on the statistics of 79 units at and above deputy-bureau levels directly under the Shenzhen city authorities and 53 enterprises directly under the city's jurisdiction, 126 leading bodies got a score above 80, and only six got a score below 79; of the 626 officials in leading posts of these units, 526 got a score above 80, and only 3 got a score below 59. Another figure from a still wider range was that of the 4,635 officials at and above department levels, 339 believed themselves failing to meet the requirements through self-examination, accounting for 9.3 percent. Failing to meet the requirements refers to those officials who accepted all sorts of gift money, securities (including "Great Wall" credit cards presented by subordinate units), imported liqueur, cigarettes, wristwatches and goods in various categories, and those "officials doing business," namely, those who worked as part-time board directors, deputy board directors, general managers and vice managers in enterprises. Should officials in this category return the money and gifts on their own, or resign their part-time offices, they would be regarded as having conducted self-correction. After that, they would have to sign a letter on the "responsibility system in anticorruption to insure clean government." Such "letters of responsibility" varied in contents with different trades, but will become the criteria for work of officials at various levels in the days to come. Since last September, Shenzhen investigated and handled a number of major cases, with 15 suspects, who were cadres at and above department levels involved; in addition, 119 economic criminals involving corruption and bribery were apprehended. A number of criminals at large were rounded up, with scores of millions of yuan in illicit money recovered. It was said the atmosphere of honesty was on the rise. Government departments have began to treat their guests at the canteen; enterprises stopped giving gifts and holding banquets for their opening ceremonies. The number of cadres refusing gift money and bribes rose by a wide margin. People here believe that the anticorruption struggle has not been thoroughly conducted, and the tasks for the struggle remained arduous.
