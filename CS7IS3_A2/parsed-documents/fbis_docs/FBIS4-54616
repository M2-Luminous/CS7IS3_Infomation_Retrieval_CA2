"The decision comes from the recommendation of the International Agency for Atomic Energy (MAAE) [IAEA], which rates highly the technical state of the V-1 reactor in Bohunice. The agency recommended such action as would allow for V-1 to operate until the year 2002," he said, adding however that the cabinet had yet to decide the issue. Earlier it was said that if not reconstructed, the plant would have to close down in 1995. A Franco-German consortium and the EBRD are making the provision of a 1.3-billion mark loan for the uncompleted nuclear energy plant at Mochovce, west Slovakia, conditional on the closure of the V-1 plant.
