Ozren and Doboj in the north, Bosnian Serb army sources said late on Monday. The Moslems have intensified attacks on the Serb positions in northern Bosnia as part of an all-out offensive, launched with the object of taking the Sava River valley and cutting off a corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic. The Bosnian Serb army command in Banja Luka reported the worst fighting to be in the Teslic area, where infantry attacks on the southern and southeastern sectors of the front were preceded by heavy artillery shellings. Moslem forces have stepped up operations also on the southwestern sector of the Ozren front and on the southern slopes of Mt. Ozren, in an effort to break through the Serb defence lines, the source said. Heavy artillery and infantry operations were reported also on the Doboj front, with the Moslems dropping several shells on the town of Doboj itself. There were no casualties, the report said.
