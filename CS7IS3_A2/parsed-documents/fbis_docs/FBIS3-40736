Embarking on the details and dwelling on an explanation of the causes and results, the economist renounces the game of loyalty and opposition and becomes a technician who tries to control damage and make the promised start the best start possible. One is amazed by the enthusiasm of this man, who was born in Acre in 1916, and by his determination to face the difficulties--and they are many--that obstruct, in his opinion, the rescuing of the occupied territories' deteriorating economy. He is not a politician and has no right to despair. Economy is a science and cannot endure bargaining or withstand failure. Sayigh, a part-time adviser to a number of Arab economic establishments and a member of the Palestine National Council since it was founded in 1964, seems to be the liaison between the PLO, in its capacity as the future government in the occupied territories, on the one hand and, on the other hand, the IMF, the World Bank, and the aid-granting countries. Sayigh, along with Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), tries to reconcile what is economic to both sides with what is political. AL-SAFIR interviewed Sayigh, who talked about the scheduled economic plans, about the obstacles facing them, and about the occupied territories' real needs, as compared with what is actually projected. Sayigh pointed out that all projects are still in limbo awaiting a final political decision, which is supposed to be made by the PLO or, to be specific, by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. In the interview Dr. Sayigh explains the reasons he moved away from Tunis lately, where he was confronted with the problems of bureaucracy and of exclusive decisionmaking, and where he could no longer continue to be a spectator watching catastrophic mistakes being made in preparing for the Palestinian future. He recounts the story of how the Palestinian Economic Council was formed and discusses the debate with the World Bank, the Palestinian economy's future and role, Israel's future plans, the region's future economic conflicts, and the endeavors to promote the so-called Mideastern market. Here is the text of the interview: [AL-SAFIR] Economic issues continue to represent the most important aspect of the accord... [Sayigh] I was away from Tunisia--I was in Lebanon--when the accord was announced on 13 September, and I was surprised by it. But I am not opposed to the accord. However, we could have gotten more economically, especially since Israel seeks to cross into the Arab countries economically through the accord. Had Palestinian negotiators mastered tactics, they would have achieved greater economic gains. [AL-SAFIR] So Israel wants the new Palestinian entity to be a bridge to the other Arab countries? How can this be accomplished tangibly? [Sayigh] Even though most Arab states are eager to lift the boycott of Israel, they say that it cannot be lifted unless Israel reaches a settlement with the Palestinians. Theoretically, these states are in a state of hostility and war with Israel. The only card they hold is the boycott card. Recognition is not a card in the Arabs' hands. Consequently, we have had to fight for the only remaining card. What could we have obtained? Now, we (Palestinians) and the Israelis have become like Siamese twins economically. The appendices to the accord show that we are strongly tied to the Israelis economically and that we will end up turning our back on the Arab economies. It will not be easy for us to separate from the Israelis. The matter will require "surgery," and we will be compelled to perform this surgery. [AL-SAFIR] Fundamentally, did this link with Israel not exist prior to the accord? [Sayigh] It existed in spite of us. Now it has become stronger, with our signature, and herein lies the danger. Initially, the link was imposed on us by a colonialist and occupying power. Now we have put our signature to the accord. Thus, the link has been given our approval. [AL-SAFIR] Does the accord not represent an endeavor to disengage from the Israeli economy? [Sayigh] This matter is negotiable. [AL-SAFIR] How can this be accomplished? A World Bank report talks about a customs union, about the banking sector's role, and so forth. These are points on which you negotiated with the World Bank point by point. So what is the true nature of the ongoing struggle concerning economic issues? [Sayigh] Let us take, for example, the trade relationship: should it be a free trade zone or a customs union? Israel has not projected either of these two options because it is experiencing an internal struggle. Merchants want a customs union and industrialists want a free trade zone because a zone of this kind allows each partner to establish the customs barriers it wishes vis-a-vis the outside world, be they high, low, or moderate barriers. Israel expects us, as a small and young country, to purchase our needs at the lowest prices so we can manufacture, produce, and so forth. Therefore, we need our tariff to be lower than Israel's. If this comes true and such a tariff is established, we will import electronics, for example, and sell them on the Israeli market because there will be no borders between us and Israel, according to the free trade zone. Such a situation will harm Israeli merchants. A customs union means that there will be a single customs tariff for both sides. This will not suit us. Israel's production is much greater than ours and Israel does not import from abroad as we do. Therefore, it is in our interest not to raise our tariff so the prices of our commodities will not rise, whereas it is in Israel's interest to raise its tariff so as to support its products. A union will require us to raise our prices artificially. [AL-SAFIR] So the dilemma is in the need for economic independence and the impossibility of this independence at the same time? [Sayigh] If Israel lifts its hand and allows us freedom of economic decisionmaking, then we can do what we wish. We can, for example, build a new road network. The road network has developed greatly--not the roads that link our villages with each other but the roads that link the settlements with each other, and the settlements are located in the territories occupied in 1948. The same applies to electricity. Like Beirut, the occupied territories suffer from rationing and power outages. This also goes for water. The Jewish settler gets sixfold the amount of water a Palestinian citizen gets from our waters. If we controlled our economic decisionmaking, we would control all these issues. Now, we are destined to use Israeli electricity for one year or more. Private Palestinian electricity companies cannot meet all the demand. Jerusalem has an independent electricity company, but this company is unable to meet the demands of all Arab citizens. The same goes for Ramallah. [AL-SAFIR] But the accord stipulates a united electric power network? [Sayigh] The accord states that if the Palestinians wish to establish their own electric power company, they may do so. [AL-SAFIR] In such a case, will priority be given to the infrastructure or to something else in the first phase, which is scheduled to begin either after the 13th of next January or of next April? [Sayigh] This will be determined in two years, not now. The World Bank program is a two-year program. It is within the World Bank's conditions and powers to study the economy of all the territories occupied in 1967 and to conclude its study with developmental visions and proposals, provided that the emphasis is put on the public sector's role and on infrastructure. No reference has been made to agriculture or industry and only a distant reference is made to the tourism sector. The program focuses on the physical infrastructure, i.e. roads, electricity, and telephones; and on the social infrastructure, meaning education, health, and training. [AL-SAFIR] And housing? [Sayigh] The World Bank refused to include the population in its program. Insofar as the West Bank and Gaza Strip refugee camps are concerned, we basically refuse to discuss their future on the basis of keeping them where they are, considering that their future is governed by resolution 194 of 1948--a resolution that stipulates the right to repatriation. [AL-SAFIR] So will this issue be ignored? [Sayigh] No. We have estimated that there are nearly 20,000 housing units (out of a total of 185,000 units) that are in very poor condition. We will start replacing these units. There are 185,000 units in each of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including enough units to accommodate the 1967 refugees, whom we think will return. Israel has now permitted the repatriation of 5,000 refugees annually, which means that an entire century is needed to repatriate all of the 1967 refugees. We also have a program to replace the housing units in poor condition outside the camps. There is terrible overcrowding. One finds an average of no less than three persons living in a room with an area of no more than four square meters. So, we need a total of 185,000 housing units. The World bank has refused to discuss this issue, expressing the opinion that it requires a political decision. We rejected this position because everything requires a political decision ultimately. When the World Bank issued the first version of their program last spring, they asked to meet with me. We met in Amman and discussed the issue for nine hours. They embraced 70 percent of my observations concerning the housing issue. They said that they will discuss the housing issue if the right to repatriation is permitted. After modifications, we met with them again before the final decision was made in Washington. All the countries involved in the multinational negotiations, i.e. 40 countries, participated with us in that meeting. I headed the Palestinian delegation. The meetings lasted two days, 20 and 21 September [1993]. I was able to convince them that the allocations for infrastructure were very meager. They had allocated a sum of $3 billion for a period of 10 years, whereas our estimates showed that a sum of $4.3 billion was needed over seven years, i.e. more than their estimated figure. Finally, they acknowledged that they had to reconsider the matter, and they raised the sum to $5 billion. At the meeting, which will be held on the 16th of this month (tomorrow) in Paris, the final version of the World Bank program, which is being modified in light of the observations I sent to them, will be presented. It is said that they have allocated $80 million to build housing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip throughout two years in order to replace the units in poor condition. But we have found that the minimum cost of a housing unit with an area of 100 square meters and capable of accommodating six individuals is estimated at $20,000, excluding the land (state-owned land) which will be granted by the government. This cost also excludes water and electricity, which will have to be supplied from outside. This means that the $80 million will build no more than 4,000 units and that this $80 million is one-fifth the needed sum. They have amended the sum for housing, but it is still less than what we are asking. As for electricity, we seek to create the ability to generate enough electricity to meet the occupied territories' needs. But this will take time. To reach this stage, we have two options: either supply Gaza with electric power from Egypt and the West Bank with electric power from Jordan, if they have a surplus, or emulate the "Beirut formula," i.e. purchase big generators to supply individual quarters until we are able to establish a central power-generating capacity. Economic Council [AL-SAFIR] Where did the discussion that was held at one time on forming a Palestinian economic council lead and what are its guarantees? [Sayigh] I will tell you about the council's background. I, Tony Zahlan (a retired A.U.B. professor), and Abu-'Ala' developed the concept of PEDRA. We emerged with the formula for an organization which we called the Provisional Economic Development and Reconstruction Agency, or authority. We said that this was a temporary formula because the agency should not remain independent and that when the state completes its structures, this agency must become a part of the state, either as a development board similar to the one in Lebanon or as an agency divided into smaller parts, with the road construction section attached to the ministry of public works, and so forth. We proposed this formula, realizing that the resources that we are scheduled to receive within five years, i.e. $2.4 billion, would make many drool. An honest man will not steal, but he will do his family and friends favors, and so forth. This is why we decided that means have to be established to control the process; that the board of governors has to operate very openly and has to submit annual reports to be published; that internal and external accounts have to be audited by a well-known international firm; that we have to emphasize capability primarily; and that salaries have to be adequate so that employees will not be compelled to accept bribes or to leave us if they get better offers. Because immense sums of money are involved, politicians, especially Executive Committee members, have felt that this agency would have major powers. To eliminate these fears, we proposed the creation of a higher council, called the Higher Economic and Social council, to supervise the board of governors. We proposed that the council include 40 or 50 politicians and Executive Committee members and be headed by Abu-'Ammar. We also said that the board of governors should be formed of no more than nine members who are experts on the settlement issue, i.e. engineers, economists, and financial and social experts, provided they are accountable before the higher council. This council will assume an advisory character and will meet twice a year. [AL-SAFIR] Where will you meet: in Gaza or Jericho? [Sayigh] In whichever place can accommodate us. [AL-SAFIR] So Gaza is more likely. [Sayigh] Gaza is crowded to start with. I am apprehensive about Gaza because it means reliance on the Egyptian civil administration. So, we proposed the advisory council formula, provided that the main powers and the power to follow up on, implement, and amend programs is in the hands of the board of governors, which will be accountable before the higher council. This formula was proposed in mid-September [1993]. I was assigned to head the Palestinian delegation and to go to Washington and hold discussions with the World Bank and attend meetings of the aid-granting countries. We learned that the aid-granting countries wished to be familiarized with the form of the council we had proposed because these countries do not give their money away easily. But I could not announce any formula before the World Bank or before the aid-granting countries without a political cover. This is why Abu-'Ala' conveyed our vision to Abu-'Ammar, who said that the formula was good and gave it his approval. But Abu-'Ammar said that he could not give us written approval because he is a "democratic man who deals through the institutions and has to present the formula to the Executive Committee." He added that they had created a Higher Palestinian National Committee--of whose members only the chairman has been appointed to date--and that the formula had to be presented to this committee before it is given written approval. I told the World Bank that we had not yet obtained written approval but that there was oral approval. World Bank officials literally told us that they wished to see such a formula but they did not demand it explicitly so they would not look like teachers and we like students. Our formula was identical to their vision. The aid-granting countries and the World Bank approved it unanimously. Moreover, the working team concerned with the region's affairs at the State Department, headed by Ross Kurtzer and including others, invited me for a discussion on the development program and our vision of how to implement it. The U.S. Treasury Department, represented by Under Secretary Summers, and Mrs. Spero, under secretary for economic affairs at the U.S. State Department, also met with me and supported my program. The 40 aid-granting countries also supported it fully on 27 September. [AL-SAFIR] Did they support the mechanism? [Sayigh] They supported the mechanism, the concept, and the projects. [AL-SAFIR] You proposed this formula on the basis of an economic logic. But Washington has its political reasons also. If the PLO's political authority in Gaza-Jericho is limited; if its security authority is inadequate; and if the political authority is stripped away from it; then the PLO will be left practically naked. Is this not Washington's political goal? [Sayigh] We did not forget the political aspect. This is why we proposed creation of the higher council under Abu-'Ammar's chairmanship. [AL-SAFIR] The West and the aid-granting countries propose the formation of an independent commission which would have political independence. [Sayigh] Yes, this is what they want. I explained our proposal to them and told them that it has to be approved by the Executive Committee and other institutions. [AL-SAFIR] Where the Gaza-Jericho accord is concerned, perhaps this point has the greatest degree of overlap between economics and politics? [Sayigh] We, too, realize that people have to see economic benefits in the accord. Otherwise they will rebel against it. I am not opposed to the presence of economic benefits. [AL-SAFIR] What is the format needed to preserve the proposed formula and the PLO's role simultaneously? [Sayigh] The board of governors will be accountable to the Political Committee, which can, for example, dismiss us or direct us. As an example, the Development Board chairman in Beirut is subject to the control of a political authority. However, when I ended my meetings in Washington, I returned to Tunis. Abu-'Ammar had not yet signed the approval. It was 6 October then. The proposal had been submitted to him on 14 September. The World Bank started calling me and I suggested that the World Bank deputy chairman concerned with the region's affairs visit Abu-'Ammar. A World Bank delegation comprised of a deputy chairman, the Arab East region official, and Adviser 'Abdallah Abu-Habib arrived. We asked Abu-'Ammar to sign a resolution establishing this agency (PEDRA), but he said he was unable to do so. He said "I am a democratic man and I have institutions to refer to, such as the Executive Committee, the Palestine National Authority, and the Higher Economic Council." Of these, only the Executive Committee actually exists. 'Arafat asked "When do you want me to sign? What is the grace period?" We told him that we had wanted the resolution signed the day before but that it was still okay and that "we mean what we say." But Abu-'Ammar responded, "I cannot. I have to check with others." We then got a promise from him that the resolution would be signed by 31 October at the latest. But he did not sign it. It was then time for me to leave to a conference of the aid-granting countries on 4 and 5 November. I and Abu-'Ala' represented Palestine at the conference. The arrangement was that I would take the signed resolution with me so it would be announced officially at the conference. On the evening of 2 November there was no news of any signing. On the morning of the 31st [no month or year given], i.e. just prior to my departure for the airport to leave on my trip, I had contacted Abu-Mazin, who is a frank man and with whom I am friendly, and asked him what had happened at the Executive Committee meeting a day earlier because we had received nothing and I had to take the text of the resolution with me. Abu-Mazin said, "Nothing was determined. It was a stormy session and we disagreed and split into two factions." I contacted Abu-al-Lutf, who said to me in the style of Ahmad al-Shuqayri [PLO chairman before 'Arafat], "What is this ultimate grace period? Do they want to control us? Do they want to dictate to us? We will rebel and we will sign after the third day of the month (November)." I said to him, "Are you kidding? These people have offered us $2.4 billion and you want to dictate to them? Are you kidding?" He answered, "No, I am serious." Before I left Tunisia, a young man from the Economic Department told me that Abu-'Ammar had signed the resolution 15 minutes earlier and that he was going to fax it to Abu-'Ala' in Paris. I asked the man, "What is the text?" He responded that Abu-'Ammar had installed himself as chairman, Faruq al-Qaddumi as deputy chairman, and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi as second deputy chairman. Abu-'Ammar also transferred all the powers designated for the board of governors to the higher council, which meets twice a year, and formed the board of governors with the names we had proposed. I left for Paris, where I met with Abu-'Ala' and told him the story. He told me that there was a mistake and that he had just talked to al-Hakam al-Bal'awi, who said that Abu-'Ammar had signed the version we had submitted. The following morning, i.e. 4 November, and just half an hour before the meeting, a fax of the distorted resolution was received. Abu-'Ala' said to me, "You can rebel and say whatever you wish because you are not an employee. But I am compelled to announce the resolution. I will not defend it. But I cannot criticize it." The Europeans were surprised and started to wonder. One European said, "This will not pass." They addressed their words to me at the meeting. I was angry so I referred them to Abu-'Ala', who said that he was not present [at the meeting that adopted the resolution] and that he was in Washington before coming to Paris. The aid-granting countries, especially the European Community and the Norwegians (the accord's godfathers), issued official statements denouncing this formula. They decided that the Norwegian foreign minister, who chaired the conference, would meet with Abu-'Ammar and inform him that this formula had been rejected, and this is what actually happened. The foreign minister returned with a new formula reflecting what we had proposed--an advisory council and a board of governors with certain powers, to which they added even more powers. They also defined the powers of the director general and of Abu-'Ammar, the national authority chairman. They made the board of governors accountable to the national authority, not Abu-'Ammar personally. Faruq al-Qaddumi was made chairman of the board of governors and al-Nashashibi was made a member, not deputy chairman. This angered al-Nashashibi, who considered me responsible for the affair. I received from him a "very malicious" letter in which he says, "you mislead news agencies and say that I am not deputy chairman, whereas the truth is the opposite." [AL-SAFIR] But no direct decision was made by 'Arafat? [Sayigh] No. In the meantime, the board of governors held a meeting which I did not attend. So Abu-'Ammar contacted me to tell me, "The beloved one knows his place, so he dallies." I responded, "No beloved and no dallying. You held a meeting and I suspended my membership for reasons you are aware of because I have stated these reasons publicly. Besides, I was not invited to the meeting." He said, "You were away, and this is why you were not invited. I am inviting you personally now." I answered, "I want to acquaint you with my position on this issue. I have two fundamental objections: First, the board of governors has no powers in the formula you have issued, and second, you have installed yourself as chairman of the board of governors. I have nothing against you personally. On the contrary, I appreciate and respect you as a head of state. But the head of state may not be the chairman of an authority that is accountable to him. How could he be accountable to himself? In all your statements you say that we are accountable to you personally. No, we are accountable to the national authority. If this authority is still nonexistent, then we are accountable to the Executive Committee. Therefore, I feel that if constitutional affairs are not set right, I will not participate. Of the council created since the Norwegian amendment, only the chairman exists so far. There are 60 others whose identities we must know. Moreover, the national authority must be formed and resolutions must be made within the framework of the institutions." Abu-'Ammar answered, "Let us talk about other issues. We must establish a development bank." I said, "Yes, we must do this. But we must fully create all the required conditions." He asked, "What are these conditions and requirements?" I said, "Authorities must come into existence and we must determine on the basis of what law or legislation we will create them." Abu-'Ammar answered, "I will issue a decree right now" and he pulled out a sheet of paper. I said, "This is not how decrees are issued. Do you have the power to issue decrees now? We are still in November. Where did you get the authority to contact the occupied territories? Even if you have the authority in Gaza and Jericho, you must realize that either the Israeli or the Jordanian side will govern this decree. This means that you will issue an illegitimate decree and devise an illegitimate law." He answered, "This is an Israeli reading of the issue." I responded, "Nobody says such a thing to me. My reading is national and patriotic. If this is your opinion, then there is no need for me to be sitting here." Abu-'Ammar answered, "I did not mean that. You misunderstood me." He then proceeded to make justifications. I proceeded to tell him, "Even if you have all the powers, the capital of a development bank has to be $500 million. Should we create it in one session?" He answered, "No, I will give you two or three days." I said, "We have a study conducted by a prominent World Bank economist, a retired Palestinian who spent three months drafting the study. This study was drafted before announcement of the declaration of principles. Therefore, it must be modified in light of the new conditions. We want to put down some of our observations on the study, which will take two or three weeks. Then we want to send them to the economist and get the opinion of an international law adviser. This may take weeks." Abu-'Ammar responded, "You are 'classicists' and you do not known how to work." I said, "Abu-'Ammar, you are an engineer and you will understand what I am going to say: if the foundation is faulty, the whole structure will be faulty." He answered, "And for something that is faulty, one uses extra cement and iron." [AL-SAFIR] Who was present at the session? [Sayigh] There were eight members. The following day I said to al-Qaddumi, "I will attend no more meetings until you, not Abu-'Ammar, head them, provided only those invited by the council attend these meetings." Yasir 'Abdrabbuh and 'Ali Ishaq, who are not members, were present. I also said that we had to establish a constitution that determines how we debate issues and how we vote. [AL-SAFIR] What is the story of the Central Bank and the balances between the occupied territories and the diaspora in forming its management? [Sayigh] In the occupied territories there was full support for our position until two days before my departure from Tunisia. That is when Abu-'Ammar received a message from the Norwegian foreign minister. Perhaps during his visit to the Scandinavian countries he told the Norwegians that if we did not receive financial resources and if the development process is obstructed, "my people will suffer, and you will be responsible." That message appointed Abu-'Ammar to the position of "report point" [as published], a position I had not heard of before. They also appointed al-Qaddumi as supervisor and deputy chairman and al-Nashashibi as deputy chairman, as well. The distribution of powers remained unchanged. I stressed that I would boycott the meetings if Abu-'Ammar headed them. I emphasized this because I had been an Executive Committee member for more than three years and knew that Abu-'Ammar was determined to dictate his opinion. I told them that I was going to spend six weeks in Beirut and asked them to let me know if conditions changed. He [Abu-'Ammar] has not dismissed me to date because he realizes that if the World Bank finds out that I have been ousted, it would mean that the situation had become complicated, considering that I am the only one who stands up to Abu-'Ammar. Abu-'Ammar began to realize that all those around him were criticizing him and that a lot was being said in this regard. Yasir 'Abdrabbuh, Abu-Mazin, Sulayman al-Najjab, and three others--Yasir 'Amr, Samir Ghawshah, and Jamal al-Surani from Jordan--did not sign the appeal [no earlier mention made of this appeal]. This means that six out of nine members did not sign it. [AL-SAFIR] Is it personal love of leadership on the part of Abu-'Ammar or is there concern? [Sayigh] Of course, there is a certain concern, in addition to the love of leadership, considering that Abu-'Ammar loves leadership. Leadership is an instrument and a means to attain power. Money is an additional means. Even if he does not seek to steal, he can channel projects and contracts, and things like that. What is sad is that Palestinian businessmen have refused to participate in the council and have told Abu-'Ammar: It is not right that we will be able to make bids when we are council members. [AL-SAFIR] Do the aid-granting countries and the World Bank object to Abu-'Ammar's role or do they want specialists? [Sayigh] No, they have concluded the accord with the PLO. [AL-SAFIR] What is the objection against Abu-'Ammar? [Sayigh] He may not be chairman of the board of governors. This means that the problem is an organizational problem, i.e. one cannot be accountable to oneself. [passage omitted]
