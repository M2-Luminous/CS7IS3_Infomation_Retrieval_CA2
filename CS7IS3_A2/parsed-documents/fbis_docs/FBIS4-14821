The picketers addressed an appeal to the delegation. The Estonian people have enough strength and patience to wait until the Russian army leaves Estonia. "Go back to your homeland so you will at least be able to watch Ostankino," said Viktor Niitsoo, head of the National Independence Party faction in the Estonian parliament, referring to protests by Russians about Estonia's decision to finish airing the broadcasts of the major Russian TV station in Estonia. Ulo Ojatalu, a former political prisoner, spoke about the remaining Russian army units' alleged connections with organized crime in Estonia. "Army in a foreign country turns into a den of thieves," he said. Pickets in protest against the presence of Russian troops in Estonia are held in front of the Russian naval headquarters a few hundred meters from the Estonian parliament and government building each Monday. The Estonian National Independence Party has called on people to continue the weekly pickets until the last Russian soldier has left the country's soil.
