The average increase rate of Changsha's industrial production over the past 15 years of reform has hit 17.1 percent, one of the fastest rates of growth of any provincial capital in the country. In order to make its industrial development stable and sound, the local government has divided the city's 145 industrial enterprises into four categories: rapid development, stable development, little development and serious predicament. Apart from macro-control of industry, the local government has applied different policies and measures to the four categories of enterprises. Priority has been given to the first two categories of well-run enterprises, which are usually big profit-earners, in allocation of funds, and supplies of electricity and transportation, to guarantee the production of popular products and exports. For enterprises with the potential to eliminate losses and earn profits, on the one hand assistance has been provided to solve their problems in capital, transportation and marketing, and on the other pressure has been brought to bear on them to improve their management and operation mechanism. The city government has also taken bold measures to foster the auctioning, annexing and leasing of enterprises in the red.
