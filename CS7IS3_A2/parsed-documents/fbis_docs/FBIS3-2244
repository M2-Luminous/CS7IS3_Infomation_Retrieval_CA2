The practice of transforming operating mechanisms or establishing a modern enterprise system encapsulates the second section of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: We should advance enterprise-related work and enterprise reform on all fronts, and all state enterprises should effectively implement the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and the soon-to-be-promulgated "Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Property in State-Owned Enterprises," focus on changing their operating mechanisms, and create conditions and lay the groundwork for establishing a modern enterprise system. The numbers "10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10" give concrete expression to achieving breakthroughs in key areas in the current enterprise reform. This means achieving breakthroughs in key areas to promote overall reform through the pioneering role of some enterprises and through supplementary reform in some cities. The number "10,000" undergirds this effort. The number "10,000" means fully granting approximately 10,000 state enterprises the 14 types of operational rights which enterprises are supposed to enjoy according to the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises." It also means making great efforts to realize the transformation of operating mechanisms, effectively implementing the "two sets of rules," and completing the appraisal of fixed assets and working capital, so as to lay a solid foundation for establishing a modern enterprise system and for advancing toward the market. This is completely consistent with the goal set by the State Council of increasing the proportion of well-run large and medium state enterprises from one-third to two-thirds by the end of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan." In implementing the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," we should mainly carry out four tasks: 1) Promulgating and implementing supplementary rules and regulations; 2) continuing to intensify publicity efforts, investigating and dealing with cases in which the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" are violated and retaliatory action is taken against enterprises, and exposing those cases in the news media or even investigating legal responsibilities; 3) continuing to promote the transformation of governmental functions, granting enterprises operational rights, and accelerating the reform of government bodies; and 4) encouraging enterprises to turn inward, combine their operational rights and responsibilities, and use the rights at their disposal to transform their operating mechanisms. To carry out these tasks, we should focus on granting enterprises the right to independently conduct export trade and to refuse to share financial charges, improve procedures for examining and approving applications for permission to independently conduct export and import trade through simplified formalities and greater efficiency. We should allow enterprises, which have been granted the right to independently conduct the export and import trade, to enjoy the same power as foreign trade enterprises in terms of export licenses and quotas. We should consider the effort to halt the practice of collecting unwarranted fees an important aspect of the anticorruption struggle. All localities and businesses should formulate specific measures in light of their actual conditions to halt the practice, publish those measures, and allow enterprises to oversee the implementation of those measures. We should make active efforts to create conditions, and guide and assist enterprises in instituting self-control mechanisms so they will operate in accordance with the law and assume responsibility for their own profits and losses and for preserving and increasing the value of state assets. This year, all localities and departments should uncover and nurture a number of exemplary enterprises which have successfully changed their operating mechanisms, and which are well-managed and efficient, and they should sum up and promote the advanced experiences of these enterprises. In implementing the "two sets of rules," we also should primarily carry out four tasks: 1) Further tracking, ascertaining, and correctly understanding the situation, and promoting the implementation of the "two sets of rules" and the Finance Ministry's "Circular on the Question of Harmonizing Policies on Implementing the New Enterprise Financial System"; 2) Aligning the "two sets of rules" with the "Interim Regulations on Enterprise Income Tax" and other new tax codes, and promptly addressing the common problems of enterprises in implementing the new tax system; 3) Continuing to perfect the enterprise financial and accounting system in accordance with the demands of the "Company Law" and the new tax system; and 4) Actively searching for a management accounting system with Chinese characteristics that meets the demands of a modern enterprise system. Enterprises should perfect their cost accounting system, enhance their capacity for continued development, and ensure that the value of state assets is preserved and increased. Backbone state enterprises which can cope with the situation may quicken the pace of depreciation after obtaining approval to do so. To the extent permitted by state policies, state enterprises may raise money through various channels to supplement their capital, and wholly state-owned enterprises, which have been around for a long time and which will be exempt from delivering their after-tax profits to the state in the near future, may increase their common reserve funds and public welfare funds with the surplus money in accordance with the "two sets of rules." During this year's appraisal of fixed assets and working capital, we should bring 10,000 large and medium state enterprises within the scope of our appraisal, and these include pilot enterprises that will implement the system of appointed supervisory boards and the modern enterprise system, all state enterprises in the 10 cities designated for experimenting with the practice of "optimizing the capital structure and invigorating enterprises," and two-thirds of large and medium enterprises in all localities whose fixed assets and working capital have not been appraised. We should take care to coordinate efforts and solve problems in the course of implementation to ensure that the task of appraising fixed assets and working capital is completed with good qualitative and quantitative results. Along with the transformation of governmental functions, we should improve our work in appraising fixed assets and working capital and give full rein to the roles of certified public accountants, registered auditors, and other intermediary agencies in society. The plan for "transforming the operating mechanisms of or establishing a modern enterprise system in 10,000 large and medium state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 different types of large and medium state enterprises, and enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures" is a new concept for improving large and medium state enterprises in the new situation. We should seriously study and publicize the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the "Company Law," and increase our understanding of the importance, urgency, and arduousness of changing the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and of establishing a modern enterprise system. The principal leaders of economic and trade commissions in all localities should concentrate on undertaking meticulous efforts, organizationally and in terms of leadership; they should devote painstaking and major efforts to tracking the way the "two sets of rules" are implemented in 10,000 large and medium state enterprises so as to make substantial progress this year.
