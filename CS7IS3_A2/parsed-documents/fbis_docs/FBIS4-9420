Alia, 67, and other senior officials are to be charged with numerous abuses, including ordering summary executions, deportations, and compulsory atheism, the spokesman for the Tirana prosecutor told AFP. Appearing alongside the former communist number one will be ex- interior ministers Adil Carcani, Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isia, former Politburo members Manush Myftiu and Rita Marko, and former top secret police and judicial officials, the spokesman said. Their trial will start at the beginning of May. If convicted, they face up to 25 years in prison. The charges against Alia and his henchmen allege their responsibility for the actions of the Sigurimi, the regime's secret police. The charges cite the deportation of thousands of people, the summary execution of 22 people accused of involvement in the 1951 bombing of Tirana's Soviet embassy, and the banning in 1967 of all forms of religious activity in Albania, the spokesman said. According to the Albanian association of deportees and former political prisoners, almost 60,000 people were deported or imprisoned during the regime in place between 1945 and 1991. One of the group's leaders, Kurt Kola, said an estimated 700,000 citizens suffered varying degrees of persecution during that period, while the ex-political prisoners' Liria newspaper added that almost 6,000 people were executed. Six other top officials, including former ideology chief Foto Cami, were sentenced on similar charges in February to between five and eight years in jail. Last year Nexhmije Hoxha, the 72-year-old widow of Enver Hoxha, the founder and long-time Stalinist dictator of the post-war regime, was sentenced to 11 years for embezzling state funds.
