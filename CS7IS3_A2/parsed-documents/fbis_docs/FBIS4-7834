Croat authorities decided on Tuesday to withdraw refugee status from those concerned, who were forced to flee fighting between Moslems and Croats in the Mostar region in spring 1993. The authorities said hostilities in the region between the two sides had ceased some time ago. The statement said the repatriation followed "a growing number of requests from people from Mostar" and did not involve sending back "invalids, sick people and all those whose houses or apartments have been destroyed." According to the statement, the refugees will return home gradually and with the full collaboration of the local authorities in Mostar.
