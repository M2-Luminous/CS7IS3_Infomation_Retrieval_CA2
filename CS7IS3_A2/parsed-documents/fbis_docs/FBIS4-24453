The order warns of increasing disputes, suicides and malpractice in the stock markets and calls for more professionalism and tighter control over shareholders' meetings. The move comes as mainlanders see their investments dipping by the day on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with no recovery in sight. Because of the slump in the market, some investors have been unable to endure their losses and have committed suicide; brokers have turned to insider trading or used public money to speculate on stocks, and there has been an increase in disputes between investors and securities departments. Published in China Securities News by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China and the Shanghai Securities Administration Office, the order says that last year and in the first quarter this year the authorities discovered 49 cases of speculation with public money totalling 91.66 million yuan (about HK$81.71 million). To address the three problems, the order calls for better control of information, promotion of better understanding among the public of investing in stocks and a complete ban on unauthorised information and illegal stock publications. It urges more professionalism among stockbrokers, an end to fraud and imposters trading shares belonging to other people, and a ban on trading on credit. Last month, China's legal authorities uncovered rampant stock market violations by brokers, bankers and even regulators. An investigation by the Supreme People's Procuratorate reportedly found violations to be common, including brokers cheating investors, market officials taking bribes and managers using company funds to trade shares. Two weeks ago, Shanghai People's Procuratorate confirmed that Ma Yue, deputy-general manager of Shanghai Haitong Securities, was under criminal investigation on unspecified charges. Analysts say fraud is not uncommon in fledging securities markets, where necessary legislation is passed as the market grows. The problem has been compounded in China where the government hierarchy is complicated. "What I'm afraid of is insider trading, because companies are all state-owned and brokerage houses are all state-owned as well," an analyst said. "Regulators have to look through malpractices such as insider trading. This is particularly important for B shareholders who do not have much influence on companies." The order says firms holding public shareholders' meetings must inform the police five days in advance with information including the date, time, place, content, the number taking part and planned security measures. "If incidents such as the smashing of cars, illegal marches or demonstrations, attacking (Communist) Party or government buildings happen, firm steps must be taken to prevent them and stop matters from getting out of hand," it said. One recent shareholders' meeting saw the board of directors yield to the demands of minority shareholders who are suffering from the falling stock market. Examples of changes to boards' payout plans include Bao An Enterprise, Shenzhen Gintian Industry, Shenzhen Konka Electronics and China Vanke. All are Shenzhen-listed companies. Concern has been raised over the power of shareholders during meetings and whether changes to payout proposals should be backed by rational and reasonable justification.
