FR940228-2-00030 FR940228-2-00012 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of non-competitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation (UETC) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54065. Estimated total funding in the amount of $15,000,000 will be provided to obtain local officials' participation and expertise in transportation activities including collection and dissemination of information, conducting regional and national workshops, providing technical assistance, and identification and analyses of issues related to transportation of hazardous materials through large urban areas. This activity will promote better understanding of local views concerning clean-up technologies, emergency management and training issues, and transportation operations and outreach. As a result, this will enable DOE to develop programs that will better meet those local needs. The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) that UETC will provide continued activity which is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity. The proposed effort is to establish and maintain networks of senior decision-makers from local communities who are responsible for or concerned about technology development, transportation, and emergency issues associated with energy-related facilities. UETC has a vast array of techniques to accomplish the objectives of the proposed project, including professional techniques in structured meeting design and facilitation, information dissemination through printed products such as newsletters and electronic media, opinion surveys, planning and program evaluation, and public and institutional involvement. The anticipated period of performance is 60 months from the effective date of award.
