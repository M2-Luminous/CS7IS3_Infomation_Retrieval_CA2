The contract for deconcentrating 500 tons of highly enriched uranium was concluded to develop the agreement signed by the two sides last February, the source said. Its implementation will take 20 years. The contract provides for deconcentrating annually at least 10 tons of Russian uranium, which will subsequently be sold on the American market. Its cost will be 12 Bn dollars. According to the official, the delay in signing the document was connected with Washington's condition that Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan should be involved in implementing the agreement. However, later it was agreed that the uranium from Ukrainian nuclear warheads will be returned to Ukraine as fuel for nuclear power plants, and will not be despatched to the American market.
