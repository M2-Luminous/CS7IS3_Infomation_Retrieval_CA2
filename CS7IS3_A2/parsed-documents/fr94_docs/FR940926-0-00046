FR940926-0-00046 FR940926-0-00010 S5.2.2␣ Aluminum containers and aluminum liners. (Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3) shall be 6010 alloy, 6061 alloy, and T6 temper. The aluminum heat analysis shall be in conformance with one of the following grades: Table Two_Aluminum Heat Analysis 1Grade element 16010 alloy percent 16061 alloy percent Magnesium 0.60 to 1.00 0.60 to 1.20 Silicon 0.80 to 1.20 0.40 to 0.80 Copper 0.15 to 0.60 0.15 to 0.40 Chromium 0.05 to 0.10 0.04 to 0.35 Iron 0.50 max 0.70 max. Titanium 0.10 max 0.15 max. Manganese 0.20 to 0.80 0.15 max. Zinc 0.25 max 0.25 max. Bismuth 0.003 max 0.003 max. Lead 0.003 max 0.003 max. Others, Each1 0.05 max 0.05 max. Others, Total1 0.15 max 0.15 max. Aluminum Remainder Remainder. 1Analysis is made only for the elements for which specific limits are shown, except for unalloyed aluminum. If, however, the presence of other elements is indicated to be in excess of specified limits, further analysis is made to determine that these other elements are not in excess of the amount specified. (Aluminum Association Standards and Data_Sixth Edition 1979.) S5.2.3␣Structural reinforcing filament material shall be commercial grade E-glass, commercial grade S-glass, aramid fiber or carbon fiber. Filament strength shall be tested in accordance with the Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Glass Fiber Strands, Yarns, and Rovings Used in Reinforced Plastics, ASTM D 2343 (1967, Reapproved 1985), or SACMA Recommended Test Method for Tow Tensile Testing of Carbon Fibers, SRM 16&hyph;90, 1990. Fiber coupling agents (sizing) shall be compatible with the resin system. If carbon fiber reinforcement is used the design shall incorporate means to prevent galvanic corrosion of metallic components of the fuel container. S5.2.4␣The resin system shall be epoxy, modified epoxy, polyester, vinyl ester or thermoplastic. S5.2.4.1␣The resin system is tested on a sample coupon representative of the composite overwrap in accordance with the Standard Test Method for Apparent Interlaminar Shear Strength of Parallel Fiber Composites by Short-Beam Method, ASTM D 2344, (1984, Reapproved 1989) following a 24-hour water boil. S5.2.4.2␣The test specimen shall have a shear strength of at least 13.8 MPa (2,000 psi). S5.2.5␣For nonmetallic liners, the permeation of CNG through the finished container's wall at service pressure is less than 0.25 normal cubic centimeters per hour per liter water capacity of the container. S5.3␣ Manufacturing processes for composite containers.
