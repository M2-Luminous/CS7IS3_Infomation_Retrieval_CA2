Ventosa report: "Initial Agreement on Purchase of 13 Mirage F1's From Emirate of Qatar"] [Text] Spain has reached an agreement in principle with the Emirate of Qatar on the purchase of 13 secondhand Mirage F1 fighter aircraft belonging to that country's Royal Air Force for a sum estimated at 16.5 billion pesetas, reliable military sources have told this newspaper. The negotiations on this purchase, begun several months ago, recently led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two countries, which, in the absence of a final agreement, shows a clear determination to carry out the transaction. More Modern According to sources familiar with this operation, Spain would purchase 11 Mirage F1 single-seaters and two two-seaters, as well as spares and weapons, and the delivery of a flight simulator has not been ruled out. The Qatar Royal Air Force fighters are rather more modern than the Spanish Mirage F1's, but have a 90-percent degree of logistic compatibility with those of the Spanish Air Force. Defense Ministry and Air Force sources stated that the operation will take another couple of months, since the project has still to be examined by the Council of State and approved by the cabinet, while some additional complications with the Emirate's export legislation have arisen. The purchase of these fighter bombers was one of the priorities for the current legislative term of the Defense Ministry, which set itself the aim of making good the losses in the Spanish Mirage F1 fleet. Out of the 73 aircraft of this type that Spain has purchased since the beginning of the seventies, 22 have been wrecked in accidents over the past few years, which has affected the Air Force's effectiveness. Owing to this, the Air Force began a study of the international aircraft market a few months ago in order to examine the existing offers of secondhand F1 fighters. The study focused from the outset on France -- the manufacturer of the aircraft -- and the Arab countries, among which offers from Jordan, Kuwait, and Qatar were selected. In addition to the purchase of fighters from Qatar, the planned exchange of five French Air Force Mirage F1's for two Spanish CN-235 transport aircraft, which would be constructed by Spanish Aircraft Manufacturing Inc. (CASA), has been virtually finalized. With this, the Air Force would receive 18 Mirage aircraft, which would alleviate the losses of the past few years. The Spanish Mirage F1's will be in service until the beginning of the 21st century, when the first EF2000 fighters, constructed by European industry in collaboration with Spain, will enter into service.
