Since its inception, KORECO has continuously endeavored to overcome a common concern of mankind, resource problems, and to preserve a cleaner natural environment, and has spared no efforts in developing and disseminating waste reutilization technology. In particular, the 1991 revision to the law on waste management allowed KORECO to take a central role in the country's efforts toward waste reutilization. Fortunately, public concern over environmental preservation and waste reutilization has been on the rise for the past few years, and the KORECO has taken on a greater responsibility than ever before. Role and Function United in harmony and cooperation and in the spirit of excellence, KORECO has been commissioned to contribute to the development of national economy through waste reutilization and technological development. Since its founding Sept. 11, 1980, KORECO has systematically collected and treated the main pollutants of the agricultural environment such as used vinyl and used agricultural chemical bottles, thus gradually becoming a leader in preserving the agricultural environment. As the size of the national economy expands and the level of the industrial structure advances, however, there has been a dramatic increase in the volume of wastes. Moreover, an increase in the proportion of special wastes which have either a higher chance of second-phase pollution or other particular characteristics has not only called for the safe treatment and reduction of waste volume, but has reminded us of the importance of waste reutilization. All of these have not only put an emphasis on the role of KORECO in collecting reusable goods, but have precipitated KORECO's assumption of a central role in a variety of waste reutilization programs such as operation of the waste management fund, creation of the Center for Waste Flow Information, research and development (R&D) on all aspects of waste reutilization, and operation of reutilization plants. Treatment of Used Vinyl The development of synthetic resins has dramatically changed human life. The extensive use of synthetic resins, however, has naturally increased the volume of used synthetic resins, whose treatment becomes an urgent task. In particular, the development of farming technology has contributed to an increase in the use of vinyl in the countryside, such as in preparation of rice seedbeds or for cash crop cultivation. The resultant pollution of the agricultural environment is also one of the corporation's major concerns. Used vinyl, when burned, generates toxic gas; when buried in the farmland, affects the growth of plants by interdicting the flow of water. If used vinyl is not properly treated, it creates an array of problems of reclamation, resources and environmental pollution. In order to render the agricultural environment more affluent and cleaner, KORECO has maintained a coherent used vinyl management system from collection to reutilization, and has regularly visited villages in the countryside. Used High-Density Vinyl Reutilization Plant For the first time in Korea and as a culmination of reutilization efforts, used vinyl reutilization plants have been set up in Chongju and Andong, with a combined annual capacity of over 10,000 tons. The vinyl is processed into an intermediate resource, pellets, which are supplied to private companies. In the past, KORECO paid for the collection of used high-density vinyl in rural areas. Those collected vinyl, however, could not be reutilized and was stored in the KORECO's branch offices nationwide, due largely to its lack of economic value and the low level of technology of private reutilization companies. Recognizing that the reutilization of used vinyl would be a vital task in maximizing the use of available resources and preserving the environment, KORECO conducted R&D on the reutilization technology of advanced countries and set up Korea's first reutilization plant in Chongju, North Chungchong Province. Collection and Treatment of Used Bottles Agricultural chemicals are often called "economic poison" in that depending upon whether they are used safely or not, they can do good or harm. In order for agricultural chemicals, an indispensable element in farming, to be most useful, attention must be paid to their usage. Equally important, however, is what to do about them after their use. Shards of used bottles would not only do harm to the people or cattle, but are one of the main culprits contaminating the agricultural environment and destroying the ecosystem. In parallel with its efforts to collect used vinyl, KORECO collected and recycled between 1987 and 1992 a total of about 253 million bottles with a cash value of 3.2 billion won, and has contributed to the preservation of a cleaner agricultural environment. Separate Garbage Collection and Treatment of Reusable Resources A variety of trends associated with rapid economic growth, including a more consumptive pattern, increasing use of disposables, and shorter lifespan of durable goods, have all contributed to an ever-rising amount of household wastes. It should be remembered, however, that the earth has limits in its self-purification capacity, and so do the resources. It is these considerations under which the nationwide separate garbage disposal and collection system has been implemented so that the public can dispose and separate the reusable resources, other waste, and coal ash according to their respective end-forms. Separately disposed garbage can be more effectively collected and reused and can contribute to the saving of resources and the creation of a far better and more comfortable environment.
