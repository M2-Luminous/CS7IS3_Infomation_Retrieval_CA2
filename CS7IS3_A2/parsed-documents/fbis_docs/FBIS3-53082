However, the daily noted that these groups are not in decisive positions either in Tehran or Riyadh which have always played key roles in OPEC since the creation of this highly significant world economic organization. "In the final analysis what counts is the decisions reached at the level of the leaders of the two countries regarding the creation of cordial relationships," the daily added. The daily added that on the final days of 1993 oil prices sank to the lowest level in the past five years and the average price for OPEC oil basket stood at about dollars 12.67 making serious difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting countries. In fact OPEC is the only international organization which sets price on a single raw material that is produced mainly by a number of the third world countries, the daily said. It added that the industrially developed countries which had been accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was their natural right to determine prices both for the raw material they imported from the third world as well as the industrial commodities they exported to those countries, are trying to weaken OPEC And undermine its very foundations. The countries in the region, Iran and Saudi Arabia in particular, realized the problems of the region, said the paper, adding that its security needs will have to be settled and resolved through peaceful cooperation among themselves. Once the regional countries have learned to settle the basic issues of the regional security through peaceful strategies, more expanded cooperation such as preserving their natural right to set the price of oil will automatically follow, it concluded.
