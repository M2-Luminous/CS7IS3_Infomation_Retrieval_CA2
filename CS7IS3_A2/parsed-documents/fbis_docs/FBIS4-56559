Poor and small countries are trying to figure out how we are going to survive in the upcoming decades. Since we are islands barely a few meters above sea level, we ask ourselves: What will happen when the water level rises? Will we be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes, and other weather disasters awaiting us? It is more than an issue of our cultural and human wealth; what is at stake is our very lives, our existence as nations. We are not responsible for this. Others colonized and exploited us. Consumer societies destroyed the environment; annihilated millions of plant and animal species; poisoned the seas, rivers, and lakes; polluted the air; saturated the atmosphere with carbon dioxide [as heard] and other noxious gases; tore apart the ozone layer; depleted oil, coal, natural gas, and solid mineral deposits of enormous wealth; cut down our forests, and ruined theirs. What is our inheritance? Underdevelopment, poverty, dependency, backwardness, debt, and uncertainty. What are they talking to us about now? About sustainable development. Great. We believe in that. To that we aspire. However, is such development possible with immensely wealthy societies that can survive only on the basis of continuous growth and only at the expense of exhausting natural resources? What do they need more wealth for? While Switzerland has a net per capita income of $34,000; Bangladesh, with over 100 million people, and threatened with being swallowed by the sea, has a per capita income of only $210. The chasm between the rich and the poor grows larger everyday. Is this contrast the absurd, irrational example given to the peoples of the Third World? The arms race continues. The weapons trade is on the increase. The most powerful nations sell the most weapons; they do not mind profiting from the death of others. Why should they care about the environment and the fact that islands are sinking underwater? To highly developed societies, the problem is not one of growth, but of distribution; not only of distribution among themselves, but distribution among all. The so much discussed sustainable development is impossible without a more equitable distribution among all nations. There cannot be sustainable development for a part of the world, and underdevelopment for the rest. Whether they like or not, mankind is today one large family and we will all meet the same fate. Let deceitful words be used less, and let there be a change in philosophy since such a selfish philosophy has yielded only the catastrophes we endure today, and the worse ones we will endure tomorrow. Let us hoist above our islands the banners of truth. The poorer and smaller we are, the more firm and courageous our words should be. Let us not resign ourselves to the sad role of those Roman gladiators who bid goodbye to their masters with the well-known, sad phrase: Farewell Caesar, those about to die salute you. We ought rather to tell them: We will die if necessary, but not as slaves. We will die proclaiming that we will fight for our futures, that we will fight for our truth, and that our people, children, and grandchildren also have a right to live. Thank you very much.
