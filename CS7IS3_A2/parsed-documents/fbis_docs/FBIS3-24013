But it did not take place; in voices shaking with emotion and fear, the UT commentators began to read the "instructional" letter from Tsentrizbirkom [Central Election Commission], by which the parties' leaders (top people) were prohibited from taking part in such debates (!?). As a sign of protest, after making statements appropriate to the moment, both party delegations left the television studio. It was pitiful to watch the lonely moderators of the "television debates" pressed close to one another and trying somehow to "save face" for the completely and wholly compromised Ukrainian (read "presidential") Television, which is mired in lies and political censorship. So the party leaders are prohibited from speaking on the air. But then at the most convenient times, in the best tradition of the era of stagnation, the chairman of Gosteleradiokompaniya (State Television and Radio Company), Nikolay Okhmakevich, a candidate for deputy in two rayons of Zhitomir Oblast, was allowed to film and "roll" short features of Ruzhin and Popelnya, where he is registered. It will be interesting to see how events develop further: before last Monday UT had already offered the floor to a number of party leaders. But now it is prohibited. Next Monday is the next round of debates. We express our sincere condolences to our colleagues who found themselves in the role of scapegoats. Why the Christian Democrats Left the Television Studio In the opinion of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the directive read on the air is a flagrant legal offense. The Christian Democrats consider it a case of settling accounts for opposition to the "party in power." After all, preceding us, on 17 February, three parties, two of which are clearly pro-presidential, were not refused permission to take part in an hour-long television debate. In this way Ukrainian Television violated Article 27 of the current Law: "From the time they are registered by election commissions and receive certification, candidates for deputy have an equal right to conduct an election campaign: to appear at pre-election and other meetings, rallies, parades, and sessions directly related to the election and on the mass information media (in the press and on radio and television)." Six of our candidates for deputy were not allowed to communicate with television viewers and acquaint them with the pre-election platform of the KhDPU. So on the basis of Article 18 of the Law of Ukraine "On Elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," we protest the decision of the chairman of the Central Election Commission. And we are submitting this protest to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
