Svoboda has told LIDOVE NOVINY that "nothing more serious happened" and that he will carry on as deputy chairman of the commission. In connection with the anticipated discussion on the recall of T. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, Svoboda categorically rejected the possibility that he could take up this post. He described as speculation the CTK report that he aspires to the post of committee deputy chairman. The new chairman of the commission is current Deputy Chairman V. Doubrava (Czech Social Democratic Party) [CSSD]. In reply to a question on what he thinks of the fact that an opposition deputy chairs the commission for supervising the secret service, Svoboda said that "Doubrava is very objective."
