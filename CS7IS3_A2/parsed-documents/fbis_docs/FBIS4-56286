This mechanism authorizes President Cesar Gaviria to issue special, temporary laws without the approval of the National Congress. This is the only mechanism available to the Gaviria administration to prevent the mass release of inmates upon the completion of their prison terms because public prosecutors have failed to study their cases to begin their trials. The decrees issued by Gaviria during this period will be valid for as long as the state of exception is in effect. According to the Constitution, the state of internal disturbance could last 90 days and could be extended for an additional 90 days.
