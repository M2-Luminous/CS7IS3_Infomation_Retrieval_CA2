Bhattacharya] [Text] The latest review of the Indian economy suggests that the gross domestic product during the current financial year ending March 1994 will be between four and five percent. This may not be an achievement worth a celebration. But at the same time, it is not an easy task either to clock a four or five percent GDP growth in only the third year of the economic reforms. The experience of economic reforms all over the world has shown that there is a sharp decline in growth of GDP in the first few years after the introduction of structural adjustments and economic reforms policies. This is because the industry and other economic agents take their own time to get adjusted to the new rules of the game. As a result, GDP growth is the first casualty. The fiscal squeeze, which normally accompany such reforms and structural adjustment, has also been rather modest, some critics argue. This will mean that there has been virtually no fiscal squeeze in 1993-94. The hope now is that the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, will present a budget for 1994-95 in February that seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit to a more manageable level and in consistence with the pursuit of economic reforms and structural adjustment policies of the government. The government's optimism on the GDP growth can also be explained from the fact that the agricultural sector will once again do reasonably well during the current year, exceeding the production levels reached in 1992-93. Monsoons have been good this year and there has been no slippages in the timely supply of fertilizers. Even the procurement prices for major crops during both the commercial rabi [spring] and main kharif [autumn] seasons were announced well in time, ensuring that farmers go ahead with their plans for sowing in full knowledge of the likely returns the crops might fetch in the market. Since the weightage of agricultural production in the GDP is quite substantial, any increase in the farm output helps the economy record a reasonable growth rate even if industrial production lacks behind the targets. Such optimism has now been further boosted by the fact that the industrial sector has at last begun to see some light at the end of the long tunnel called recession. The depression of demand witnessed in most consumer durable sectors in this country for the last two years seems to be over. A large number of industries, including those in the transportation sector like the automobiles manufactures, are reporting higher sales. The six-monthly performance of the most companies operating in the consumer durable sector have shown a marked improvement in the sales. Excise duty collections, which is one of the key indicators of the degree of manufacturing activity in industry, has also begun picking up. If all this gets reflected in GDP as they should, there is no reason to doubt the government's projection that the GDP growth this year would cross four percent. There is, however, a need for striking a note of caution here. A GDP growth of four percent may be a reasonably satisfactory performance for an economy in its third year of economic reform, but this is decidedly far below the potential of an economy of India's size and resources. As the finance minister has often reiterated in the past India should look forward to an annual growth rate of around 10 percent in the next decade and only then can it live up to the world's expectations of being an uncaged tiger. Quite clearly, the need for the hour is to get on with the second phase of economic reforms without any delay. It is an acknowledged fact that future growth will not come to much from industry as from the services sector. The potential of the services sector in this country lies virtually untapped. The financial sector reforms are now under way. Once the R.N. Malhotra Committee's report on liberalizing the insurance sector is accepted by the government, one can hope for further reforms in this crucial area of the economy also. The financial markets and the capital market too are gradually getting liberalized. This should in near future allow the entrepreneurial talent of the Indian businessmen to exploit the potential availability in this sector in competition with foreign firms. In the financial sector also, more new private banks are being set up, stepping up the pace of economic activities in the economy through a transparently competitive environment. In the coming years, the services sector would take a clear lead in terms of the economy's GDP growth. And, as long as such reforms process continues unimpaired, there is every reason to achieve a higher a GDP growth of around 10 percent in the next few years.
