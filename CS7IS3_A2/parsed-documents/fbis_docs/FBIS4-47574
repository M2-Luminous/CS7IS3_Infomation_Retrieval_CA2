Reshetnikov, Novosibirsk Oblast Fund for Compulsory Medical Insurance; UDC 614.255.5(470) [Abstract] The Novosibirsk Oblast Fund for Compulsory Medical Insurance was created on August 15, 1992, in response to national and regional legislative measures intended to provide compulsory medical insurance in the Russian Federation. The system has been created to ensure that for-profit and nonprofit employees make health insurance deposits in the fund equivalent to 11.8% of wages. Contributions for farmers have been set at 3% of earnings and for the otherwise self-employed at 8%. In adddition, supportive voluntary contributions to the fund from various other domestic and foreign sources are encouraged. A governing board of 22 members has been established to administer the fund. Until all of the administrative and organizational components are in place and functioning, licenses for temporary administration of the insurance program have been granted to selected insurance companies as an interim solution.
