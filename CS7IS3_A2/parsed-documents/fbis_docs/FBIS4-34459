A UH-214 Army helicopter took the Portuguese premier and his entourage from the Maiquetia Airport to the General Francisco de Miranda Air Base in La Carlota. The group included Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso, Commerce and Tourism Minister Fernando Faria de Oliveira, and Luis Sousa de Macedo, secretary of state for Portuguese communities. Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera received the distinguished party with words that recalled the long and close relations between both countries and the beneficial presence of the large Portuguese community in Venezuela: "....the Portuguese presence in Venezuela has without doubt proved to be very positive," the Venezuelan president said. Both leaders met at the recent Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, at the beginning of this week. The Venezuelan reception committee included Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, Tourism Minister Herman Luis Soriano, and Armed Forces Commander Otto Garcia. Upon his arrival, Cavaco Silva, who is 54 years old, has a degree in finance, is a professor and member of the Social Democratic party (PSD), and is visiting this country for the first time, highlighted the importance of his four-day mission in Venezuela. He comes, he said, to strengthen the existing political, cultural, economic, and business relations between both countries. The head of the Portuguese nation said he was accompanied by 50 of the most important and significant businessmen in his country. Cavaco Silva also said that he visited the country as a member of the European Union (EU) and that the talks would thus cover the strengthening of relations between the EU and the Latin American countries, taking into account the fact that Venezuela has played an important role in furthering integration in the region. Cavaco Silva's presence in Venezuela will seal three cooperation agreements between both countries. One is a two-way investment and protection agreement, another will cover the prevention, control, and surveillance of drug use, and the third is for technical cooperation in several fields such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and maritime transportation.
