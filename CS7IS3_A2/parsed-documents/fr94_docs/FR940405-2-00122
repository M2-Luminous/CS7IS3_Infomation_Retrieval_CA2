FR940405-2-00122 FR940405-2-00043 102. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.109(b) (3) (iv). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Chicago, IL Housing Authority to use an occupancy rate of 85% in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for both its fiscal year ending (FYE) 12/31/93 and its FYE 12/31/94. Nature of Requirement: A Low Occupancy Public Housing Agency (PHA) without an approved Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: September 13, 1993. Reason Waived: The Chicago Housing Authority argued that the magnitude of its safety and security needs is so great, it requires the Authority to redirect resources from other priority initiatives such as vacancy reduction to fund safety and security measures. This redirection of resources was expected to continue for at least the two year period of the waiver request. A five-year Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been executed earlier between the Regional Office and the Authority which contained performance targets in the area of vacancy reduction. In order not to jeopardize the agreements that had been reached, a waiver was granted for the Authority's 1993 fiscal year (FY). Conditions were also placed on how the additional operating subsidy generated as a result of the waiver could be used. These included having at least 60% of the additional funds be used specific, identifiable actions to increase occupancy which would leave 40% of the additional funds available for security measures. A waiver for the Authority's FY 1994 will not be considered until a review of actual accomplishments in FY 1993 can be made and compared with the actual goals. 103. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.118(h). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Albany, NY Housing Authority to use an occupancy rate of 95% instead of the 97% goal of its Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 6/30/94. Nature of Requirement: A Public Housing Agency (PHA) with an approved COP must use the projected occupancy rates of the COP. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: September 14, 1993. Reason Waived: The Albany Housing Authority presented material to show that modernization activity at one development was taking longer than projected in the COP but that the work was considered to be on-schedule by the Buffalo Office. Additional units at another development were also being considered for possible deprogramming actions that had not been contemplated in the COP. The Department agreed with the Authority that there were unanticipated vacancies because of the on-schedule modernization work and found good cause to adjust the COP occupancy goal to 96%. The request to make an adjustment for additional vacant units prior to the completion of a feasibility study on deprogramming was not approved. Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Note To Reader: The person to be contacted for additional information about the waiver grant items in this listing is: Mr. Caldwell Jackson, Director, Management Planning Division, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5108, Washington, DC 20410, (202) 708&hyph;3990 (This is not a toll-free number). 104. Regulation: 24 CFR parts 12 and 111. Project/Activity: Accountability in Provision of HUD's Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP). Granted by: Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary. Date Granted: June 2, 1993. Reason Waived: A NOFA was not used to announce the availability of funds under FHAP. A waiver was needed on this case because FHAP is incorrectly listed in section 12.10 as a competitive program, and thus subject to the requirement that a notice of funding availability must be published in the Federal Register when funds are available under the program. The Secretary also waived 24 CFR part 111 which requires a NOFA to be published.
