On the Korean nuclear issue, Wu Jianmin said: U.S. President Clinton announced today that the United States would hold the third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva in early July to seek an overall improvement of relations between the two countries; and it that would also stop pushing for sanctions against the DPRK in the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, the DPRK and ROK have reached an agreement on holding preliminary talks for a summit meeting between them. We are happy to see these positive developments on the Korean nuclear issue and appreciate the wise attitude adopted and positive efforts made by the parties concerned for a peaceful settlement of this issue. He said: Dialogue, instead of exerting pressure, is the basic way for a peaceful and proper settlement of the Korean nuclear issue. This conforms to the interests of all parties and helps safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula. We sincerely hope that all parties concerned will treasure and seize upon this important turning point; hold consultations and dialogue with an equal, pragmatic, and sincere approach; and make constructive efforts to bring about a denuclearized, peaceful, and stable Korean peninsula.
