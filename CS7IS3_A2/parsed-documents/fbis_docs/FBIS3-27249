Transiting Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces for more than 700 kilometers, the farms on the former river course last year turned out a record 1.5 billion kilogram of fruit, 2.5 billion kilogram of vegetables, more than four million head of cattle and sheep, as well as quantities of grain, cotton and edible oil. The area's farm products are sold to more than 20 provinces and municipalities in the country and Europe, America, South-East Asia and Japan. The 5,464-kilometer-long Yellow River crosses the country from west to east and flows from Qinghai to Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan and enters the Bohai Sea in Shandong. It is known as "the cradle of Chinese culture." But the river was also notorious for its drought and flood disasters. According to historical records, the river burst in Lankao County, Henan Province, in 1855, and flooded northwards into the Bohai Sea, abandoning the original river bed. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, local people have been mobilized to plant five tree belts with a total length of 520 kilometers along the river course and trees around farmland to improve ecological conditions. As a result, the sand storm conditions have dropped from an average annual 17.8 days in the late 1950s to zero at present. According to Wang Xinkong, a senior agronomist, China began an all-round development of the former Yellow River course in the early 1980s, when the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences organized scientists to survey the course. "The river course in the 34 degrees north latitude has clear-cut drought, humid, cold and warm climate in addition to abundant sunshine," Wang said. "With the porous soil, it is suitable for growing apples, grapes, pears, walnuts and other fruit," he added. Adopting the agro-scientists' suggestions, the Ministry of Agriculture started to encourage local people to expand areas planted with fruit orchards. Through a decade of efforts, the formerly sandy river course has become a "green wall", or China's longest fruit tree belt, and farmers benefit from it. A survey shows that the average annual income of farmers in the 20 counties of the former river course rose from 60 yuan per person in 1978 to 800 yuan last year. Farmers who grow more fruit trees have earned more. Instead of living in mud-and-straw cottages, more and more farmers have moved into newly-built two-storey brick flats. Many of them have got rid of their limited worn-out hand-woven and made clothes and bought all sorts of clothes: shorts and skirts for summer, down-filled clothes for winter and woollen sweaters for spring and autumn. Even the meals at their tables have changed, from only sweet potatoes every day to flour and rice together with vegetables, meat and fish. A survey shows that every household has bicycles, one-fifth of them own tractors, and some have motorcycles and even motor vehicles.
