Negotiations on the issue of protection for the Palestinians in Hebron may be completed by the end of the week. This was stated by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated yesterday at the end of a meeting with U.S. peace talks coordinator Dennis Ross. Peres stressed that before it proceeds to promote the Syrian track, Israel must reach an agreement with the Palestinians about the continuation of the peace process. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin recording] [Segal] By the end of the week the Israeli and PLO delegations meeting in Cairo will conclude the elements of the Hebron package which will enable the resumption of the negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres assessed last night. According to reports received in Jerusalem from the delegation headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, progress has been made in the two main issues -- the urban police force in Hebron and the nature of the international presence -- but no agreement has yet been reached. At this point, it seems that Peres will not go to Cairo to confer with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. However, one person who will be going to Cairo is U.S. peace talks coordinator Dennis Ross. After meeting him last night, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres commented on Israel's priorities in the peace process. [Peres] If we reach an agreement with the Palestinians, the Syrian track will open. First of all, we must attain an agreement with the Palestinians and overcome all the unsolved problems. I think all of us will make a supreme effort to overcome them. We will see what happens in the next few days. [Segal] In his meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Ross said he had found in Tunis a totally different 'Arafat than a week ago. 'Arafat is sure of himself, feels encouraged, and is prepared to make decisions, Ross told the Israelis. The Syrian track did not come up in the meeting of the Israeli and U.S. teams, but only in the tete-a-tete meeting between Ross and Rabin. The impression is that Ross did not bring any dramatic tidings on the Syrian track. [passage omitted] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 24 March carries an interview By Gid'on Remez with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin recorded after his meeting with Ross. Asked whether he shares the U.S. assessment about an imminent resumption of the peace negotiations, Rabin says: "First of all, I can tell you that the negotiations and dialogue in Cairo are a fact. Second, the U.S. peace team headed by Dennis Ross informed us that the Arab countries consent to resume the negotiations in Washington by the end of April, or maybe earlier." [Asked whether the issue of an international presence in the territories has been settled, the prime minister says: "I will not go into details before the dialogue in Cairo is completed." [Asked whether he is apprehensive that the Russians might attribute to themselves the success of resuming the process, Rabin replies: "I very much hope the process will resume by the end of April."] [A report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 24 March adds that Ross quoted al-Asad as having told him that "if Rabin wants peace in the northern border and the military operations against Israel to stop, he must reach a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the region with Syria." [Al-Asad went on to say that he is trying to curb Hizballah and the Palestinian organizations operating against Israel, but he cannot promise an "hermetical closure" of the northern border against activities from Lebanon. [Ross is reported to have told his Israeli counterparts that "al-Asad is aware of the fact that the time left to reach an arrangement in the region is running out."]
