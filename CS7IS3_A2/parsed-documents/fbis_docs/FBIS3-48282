In October last year, Burma's biggest ethnic rebel group, the Kachin Independence Army, made peace with the junta, or State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), and now the Karens, the Mons and the Karennis along the Thai border have begun talks with the central government. The junta has benefited from being able to negotiate separate peace treaties with each rebel group, a process that also resulted in the increasing marginalisation of Burman pro-democracy groups who sought refuge in rebel strongholds. While the patchwork peace process will probably result in a cessation of hostilities for the time being, analysts say fundamental differences between the Slorc and the rebels must still be resolved before any long-term solution can be reached. "There's a fundamental difference between the Slorc's perception of how to solve the ethnic issue and what the minorities themselves have been demanding throughout the years of civil war," a Rangoon-based analyst told the REVIEW. "The minorities and their Burma allies in the DAB (Democratic Alliance of Burma) are basically advocating a modified version of the federal system that existed before (the first military coup in) 1962. The Slorc, on the other hand, wants a system similar to China's -- let the minorities do what they want within their respective areas as long as they don't interfere with national politics. Bring them to the capital dressed up in their colourful costumes to attend conventions and congresses, but don't let them have a say in the running of the country as a whole." Rangoon's actions so far lend credence to this analysis. When the first talks were held with the Kachins in the border town of Panghsai near China in late 1991, the government representative, Col. Kyaw Thein of the powerful intelligence apparatus, stated clearly that he wanted a separate deal with the Kachins only. He also referred to the Burman members of the DAB -- various pro- democracy groups, student organisations and an association of dissident Buddhist monks -- as "a nuisance," indicating that they would not be part of the peace plan. "It's the pro-democracy movement that is the main enemy. The strategy is to neutralise the ethnic groups in order to eliminate what's left of the Burman opposition," another analyst in Bangkok said. If that is indeed the government's goal, it is succeeding. Since late 1990, the Karen headquarters at Manerplaw has also been the main base not only for dissident students, but also for fugitive MPs, who were elected in May of that year but prevented from assuming office, as well as numerous activists from what was Burma's main prodemocracy party, the National League for Democracy. A number of recent events have effectively separated the Burman opposition from the ethnic rebels at Manerplaw. The current peace talks -- which the Burman dissidents are opposing -- are only one example. In September last year, five leading Burman activists left Manerplaw to travel to the United States to lobby at the United Nations. They have been barred from entering Thailand by security authorities in Bangkok, whose connivance they would need to return to Manerplaw. Thai participation in brokering the peace talks is evident also in the pressure that has been placed on the ethnic rebels to negotiate with Rangoon. The Mons were the first group along the Thai border to strike a deal with the Slorc in late December. The Karennis, who are closely related to the Karens, met government representatives in their area in early January. A meeting in the border areas also reportedly took place at about the same time between the Karen rebel leader, Gen. Bo Mya, and Lieut.-Col. Thein Swe, the Burmese defence attache in Bangkok. Originally, the DAB's stated policy was not to talk to Rangoon's representatives individually but to insist on a political settlement that included the entire front. Under Thai pressure, this policy now appears to have been abandoned. "But even worse is that the ethnic groups lack any kind of coordination. They're entering into these talks just to see what the Slorc has to offer, not with a comprehensive, coordinated agenda," a source close to the ethnic rebels said.
