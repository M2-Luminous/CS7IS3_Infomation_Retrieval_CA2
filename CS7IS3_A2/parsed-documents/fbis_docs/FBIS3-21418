K. Katyal] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 15--Just when there was hope of a positive turn to Indo-U.S. relations--as a result of the visiting Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's talks here--the American President, Mr. Bill Clinton's reference to human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir meant a fresh setback. Mr. Clinton's remark that the United States shared Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir, caused, as was natural, shock and dismay. Its adverse effect was not mitigated even by his subsequent observations--that the United States was opposed to infringements of individual human rights as a result of extremism and fanaticism, that is, of the victims of terrorist violence. It showed, according to an official, that the U.S. policy was either not balanced or not well-informed. It was considered odd that Mr. Clinton should have been taken in by Pakistani propaganda--ignoring altogether the steps taken by the Indian Government to check excesses, including the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, as also the discussion to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International to visit Jammu and Kashmir. That such statements would give a fillip to terrorist activities was additionally disturbing from the Indian standpoint. Even before Mr. Clinton's latest statement there was a perception here that the U.S. Administration's India policy was not anchored in an objective analysis of the situation in the sub-continent. Mr. J.N. Dixit, who just retired as Foreign Secretary, was asked in an interview by "Eyewitness," about the reasons for the statements emanating from Washington on Kashmir and Punjab. He replied: "There can be only two interpretations. Either they are simplistic and you can say it is tactless or there is a deliberate motivation and they may be saying this deliberately to set the context for interference." This, in his opinion, was the most difficult period in Indo-U.S. relations since 1971 and it could last up to two years, because of fundamental differences on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and transfer of dual-use technology. Until the report of Mr. Clinton's statement reached here, the mood of those working for improved Indo-U.S. relations was clearly upbeat. The talks of Mr. Moynihan, Chairman of the U.S. Senate panel on South Asia and a former U.S. ambassador here, with the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, yesterday and with the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, today had led to optimism about a better understanding of India's case on Human Rights and related matters. Mr. Moynihan who, at a recent Senate panel hearing, had strongly defended India on this issue heard a detailed account from the Prime Minister of the latest developments--especially in the context of Pakistan's plans for an anti-India resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights at Geneva. He told both the Prime Minister and Mr. Dinesh Singh that he would convey India's views to Mr. Clinton. He even suggested a meeting between Mr. Dinesh Singh and the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, obviously in the belief that exchange of views at the personal level could help reduce misunderstandings. Hopes recede: In view of Mr. Clinton's latest statement, the chances of India securing U.S. support against Pakistan's move have receded, though Mr. Moynihan's talks here had raised hopes to the contrary. It is, however, to be seen how the United States reconciles the two conflicting concepts--support to Pakistan's view of human rights "abuses" in Jammu and Kashmir, on the one hand, and faith in the continuation of the Foreign Secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, on the other. The consequences of the first run against the spirit of the second. According to Mr. Clinton, "these talks and other forms of dialogue between Pakistan and India should be nurtured and protected from swings in public opinion so that they become a positive feature in Indo- Pakistan relations." Will the United States discourage Islamabad from going ahead with its move because its consequences may not square up with his sentiment about the Foreign Secretary-level talks being a forum for defusing tensions between India and Pakistan?
