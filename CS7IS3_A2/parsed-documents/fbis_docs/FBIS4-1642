The unhealthy trend of participating in smuggling by public security departments in coastal regions had also been effectively stopped. However, such achievements should not be over-estimated, Mr. Tao said, and special attention should be paid to problems facing public security departments. He called for public security departments at various levels to take serious action with crimes committed by leaders and members of the police, particularly cases involving bending the law for relatives or friends, bribery and corruption and torture as well as seeking private benefits through the office they hold.
