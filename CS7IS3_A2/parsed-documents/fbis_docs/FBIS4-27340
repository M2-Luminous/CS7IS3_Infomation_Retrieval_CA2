FBIS4-27340 "dreas105__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Calsonic To Double Sales in Europe by 2000 Calsonic To Double Sales in Europe by 2000 942A0262A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 May 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0262A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Calsonic will double its sales in the European region to 200 million pounds (about 30 billion yen) by 2000 with "Llanelli Radiator," a local production subsidiary purchased from Rover of Great Britain, as the axis. Currently, it is 96 million pounds (about 15 billion yen). It has acquired orders for aluminum radiators for next-model compact cars such as VW and Audi of Germany and Renault of France, as well as for the locally produced cars of affiliates Nissan Motor and Honda Motor and will gradually expand production beginning this fall. Calsonic has received an order for the next model of the compact car "Concerto" from Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), the British production subsidiary of Honda Motor. HUM plans to produce 50,000 units annually beginning in the latter half of 1994 in order to build an annual production system of 100,000 cars, and Suranesurii received the order for the whole quantity. They will supply 130,000 units annually beginning this fall for the next model of the "Audi 80" for Volkswagen-Audi of Germany. They also have received an order for radiators for "Netherlands Car" (abbreviated Nedocar), the joint-venture company between the Dutch Government-Volvo-Mitsubishi Motors, and will supply 180,000 units annually. Production is scheduled to begin in the middle of 1995. Since full production of the Nedocar will be 200,000 units annually, the order is for almost the whole quantity. The next car type from Renault is the compact car "Clio." It is scheduled to begin production in 1997, and they will supply 100,000 units annually. Since previously Valeo, a major parts manufacturer of Europe, had the monopoly on Renault cars, they have destroyed a corner of that by this order. Since they are bolstering a substantial development and production system in Europe, Calsonic is building a new research and development center at Calsonic International Europe (CIE) which is its general controlling company in Europe. The total amount of the investment is about 2.2 million pounds. The development system also will be increased from the current 70 people to 90 people. Llanelli was purchased from Rover of Great Britain in 1989, and is supplying the whole quantity of a little less than 200,000 units annually of the aluminum radiators for Nissan Motor United Kingdom (NMUK). Llanelli still has a cumulative deficit of close to 10 billion yen, but as the result of broad sales expansion activities, the outlook is for it to be able to liquidate it by 2000.
