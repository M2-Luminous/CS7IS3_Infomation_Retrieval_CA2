In a strong defence of his government's policy on interest rates, Willis said it would increase rates only when it saw the need, "which is when we see inflationary pressures emerging." "We don't see that at the present time," he said in a television interview. Willis expected other banks to follow the lead of the Advance Bank and Citibank, which announced late Friday they were immediately raising fixed-term home loan rates for new customers by 0.5 percent. He said he also expected another sell-off on bond markets here Monday following upheaval on US markets Friday when the US Federal Reserve spent three billion US dollars in a failed bid to prop up a collapsing US dollar. The sell-off here last week had been driven largely by events overseas, particularly in the United States, and he expected what he described as "the herd mentality" to continue here Monday. "Now that's not reflecting any view of the bond dealers or the fund managers about the inflationary situation in Australia," the treasurer added. "It is reflecting quite clearly a view about what might happen to prices of bonds and trying to move to ensure that they are not left behind if prices fall further." The financial markets, he said, had "enormous influence," the consequences of which Australia had to bear in a deregulated market. "But that does not mean to say that we are necessarily forced then into a position of raising official rates." It was important to the future of the Australian economy that the government was not pushed into increasing interest rates too soon, he added. "If we wait too long then we will probably have to have a larger increase than would otherwise be the case if we moved earlier," he said. "But we don't want to move too early either because it's just pointless doing that when there are no inflationary pressures there to offset," he added. Asked about a predicted "tidal wave" of interest rates increases as early as Monday, Willis said while it was hoped there would not be a tidal wave, other banks might follow the lead and raise their fixed term rates. But the rates, which had been increased already, were fixed rate mortgages which he said were a very small part of the overall mortgage market and the banks had raised them to cover the increased cost of borrowed funds. He said people should not pay too much attention to reports that housing loan rates could increase by two percent in 12 months, but agreed there would be some upward movement in rates. "We have been quite forthcoming about that, we have never denied that," he said. "It would be stupid of us to do so because monetary policy is an important arm of the government's policy for controlling inflation. "Over the course of a cycle as inflationary conditions develop you have to use monetary and fiscal policy to keep those inflationary pressures at bay," he said. But he described this as "a small price to pay" for continued economic recovery which would not be stymied by high inflation.
