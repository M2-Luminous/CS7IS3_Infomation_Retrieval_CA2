Bezveselnyy; place and date not given: "Mechyslaw Hryb: `My Attitude Toward the Military Has Not Changed'"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Hryb] My attitude toward the military -- for me, this category includes not only servicemen, but also law enforcement officials and KGB officers -- did not change and has remained the same since I was elected chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. However, I would like to ask all these categories of people to enhance their struggle against crime and to further strengthen the legal order. [Bezveselnyy] This task better fits militia organs, does it not? [Hryb] Not only. Servicemen can help militia organs maintain civil order by carrying out joint patrols. In addition, maintaining military discipline among the troops is of primary importance as well. Therefore, the leadership of the executive branch ministries (I have already spoken with all of them) do not oppose this issue. I believe that we can still do this work and we can activate our fight against crime to give our people the chance to live and work. [Bezveselnyy] In a word, you have nominated new ministers instead the old ones.... [Hryb] Not yet. I spoke about people who act as power ministers. In the immediate future, a corresponding Supreme Soviet and Cabinet of Ministers commission will nominate candidates for these posts. [Bezveselnyy] Well, one last question: Who will head the Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security, Defense, and Crime Fighting? [Hryb] We have not yet discussed this issue. In my mind, we will do so in due time.
