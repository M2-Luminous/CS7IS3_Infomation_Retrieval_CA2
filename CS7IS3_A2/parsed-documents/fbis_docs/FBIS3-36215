This was stated by the Supreme Soviet's Chairman Myecheslaw Hryb at a press conference in Minsk. On a question put by an Interfax correspondent he answered that he highly appraised the merits of his predecessor. However, he pointed out that Stanislav Shushkevich had lacked "persistence in organization of coordinated activities of different deputies' groups and factions. This is why the new speaker must take this into consideration and correct this." He emphasized that the peace-loving, friendly relations with neighbors, aspiration to neutrality and recognition of the established borders remained Belarusia's political priorities. Hryb called a more dynamic transition to the market, rebuilding of the economy's structure and privatization the main domestic task. He recommended that a "serious economist" take the post of the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet's Chairman. Hryb proposed that 43-year old Ivan Bambiza be nominated his deputy at the parliament's session on Wednesday. His candidacy will be discussed in the parliamentary committees and commissions. According to the information received by deputies, Bambiza was born in the Gomel Region. He graduated from the Belarusian Institute of Agricultural machinery and received the diploma of a mechanical engineer in 1975. Recently, he has been the head of a regional administration and occupied the post of the Secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Planning and Budget Financial Commission.
