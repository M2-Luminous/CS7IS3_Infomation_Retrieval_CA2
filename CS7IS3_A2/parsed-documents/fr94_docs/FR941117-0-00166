FR941117-0-00166 FR941117-0-00011 (i) Phase I major modification applications may propose de minimis or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such a contract (see §22.912(c)). (ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of §22.951. (4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum coverage requirement of §22.951. (b) Phase II . Phase II is an open-ended filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete. (1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant five-year build-out period. (2) There is no limit the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Furthermore, only mutually exclusive Phase II applications with the same filing date are entitled to inclusion in a random selection process. Where all mutually exclusive Phase II applications have different filing dates, the FCC may grant the earliest-filed application and dismiss all applications excluded by that grant. For the purposes of this section, the filing date of an application is the date on which that application was received or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received. (3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose de minimis and contract SAB extensions. (c) Settlements . Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial settlements) are prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive applications (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later than 15 business days before the random selection process is scheduled to take place. (d) Limitations on amendments. Notwithstanding the provisions of §22.122, Phase I applications are subject to the following additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments. (1) The FCC will not accept amendments (of any type) to mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the random selection process. (2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I applications. (3) Minor amendments required by §1.65 of this chapter must be filed no later than 30 days after public notice announcing the results of the random selection process. §22.951 Minimum coverage requirement. Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the minimum coverage requirement. However, area within de minimis SAB extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA. §22.953 Content and form of applications. Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an unserved area must comply with the specifications in this section. (a) New systems . Forms, pages and exhibits must be prepared exactly as described and assembled in the order listed in this section. (1) Application cover . The paper original of each application must be enclosed in a stiff cover fastened securely along the left edge, without exposed sharp edges. (2) Transmittal sheet . The first page after the front cover of the application must be the transmittal sheet. (i) Copies of the required transmittal sheet may be obtained by contacting the Consumer Assistance Office, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW, Washington, DC 20554. (ii) On the transmittal sheet, the following information is required: the name of the applicant, the channel block, and the market number or numbers and the market name or names in which the proposed CGSA is located. This information on the transmittal sheet must match exactly the information on the jacket of the microfiche and the cover of the application. (iii) The transmittal sheet also contains a certification. Applicants must certify to the following: I hereby certify that this application for an authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service is complete in every respect and contains all of the information required by FCC Form 401 and the Federal Communications Commission's rules governing this service. I acknowledge that, if upon examination by the FCC, this certification is found to be incorrect, the FCC will dismiss this application without further consideration. I certify that I am the real party-in-interest in this application and there are no agreements or understandings other than those, if any, disclosed in this application, which provide that someone other than the applicant has a direct or indirect interest in the application. I also certify that the applicant intends to construct and operate the station as proposed and that there are no agreements or understandings that are inconsistent with that intent. I declare, under penalty of perjury, that I am the authorized representative of the above-named applicant in the matter of this application, that I have read the foregoing certification, and that the matter and things therein stated are true and correct. (iv) The certification must be signed and dated in accordance with the requirements of §1.743 of this chapter. The certification must be signed in ink. Mechanical reproductions of the signature must not be used. The name of and position held by the person signing must be typed or clearly and legibly printed beneath the signature.
