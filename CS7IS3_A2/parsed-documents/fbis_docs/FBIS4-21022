In a month, the Nyborg national prison will open a similar section. Both sections will have room for 12 addicts. "The idea is to help the drug addicts who want to break the habit. When they are separated from the other prisoners, they avoid stress and offers of drugs or demands and threats to pay old drug debts. And they receive help in remaining drug-free," Prison Inspector Bodil Phillip of Ringe said. The drug-free sections are so-called contract sections. The prisoners sign a contract that they will neither take nor deal in drugs. The contract has no legal value, only a moral one. Nevertheless, Prison Inspector K. Taagegaard of Nyborg thinks that the contract will reduce the abuse of drugs. "This is shown by experience from Norway and Sweden, which already have drug-free sections," he said. About 90 percent of the prisoners in Ringe were drug abusers before they were imprisoned.
