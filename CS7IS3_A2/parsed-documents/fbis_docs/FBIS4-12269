'Arafat is no better than a war criminal! Terror must not be rewarded!" The reserve officers -- ranking from lieutenant to brigadier general -- signed a petition initiated by Aharay [Follow Me], a reserve officers movement opposing the agreement with the PLO. Among the signatories are Reserve Brigadier Generals Amatzya Hen and David Hago'el. The letter further states: "All our lives, we fought for our homeland, we went to battle, guarded the border, and lost friends while defending our homeland. By giving away parts of the homeland to the murderers of women and children and shaking hands that are covered in blood, you are telling us that our war was in vain. Our comrades fell in vain, and the battle order was a mistake, because it could have been solved by surrender and concessions to the aggressor and the murderer. "We are opposed to this terrible move, which leads to complete surrender, to an indefensible country, and the loss of all moral values, as well as the loss of our capital of Jerusalem the streets of which are already decorated with PLO flags," the reserve officers write.
