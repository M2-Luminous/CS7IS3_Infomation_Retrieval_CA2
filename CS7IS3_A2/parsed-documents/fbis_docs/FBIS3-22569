As the first signs were detected a few months ago, the Veterinarian Institute warned about the dangers of transferring pigs or pork within those affected areas. This institute has also banned the unauthorized transfer of pigs from those provinces to the rest of the country. The control must be strengthened to quickly detect possible new cases and to facilitate the vaccination of pigs in each zone, municipality, or province, according to the planned program of priorities.
