News agency reports from Manila had said the Quezon City court Friday issued an order putting a 20-day hold on the conference after receiving a petition from the Indonesia-Philippine Association that described the conference as a violation of a treaty binding member countries of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). The friendship association, which is headed by Jose Laurel, member of a Philippine political group, charged that the holding of the conference was a dangerous threat to the Philippines' national security and interests. It also said the planned conference could harm the friendly relations among and The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand in 1976. Under the Quezon City court order the rector of the University of the Philippines where the conference was to take place, will have to disallow the holding of the conference on university premises for 20 days. The conference was to open on May 31. Abidin said the Indonesia-Philippine Association would possibly make further efforts for the complete cancellation of the conference or its relocation to another country.
