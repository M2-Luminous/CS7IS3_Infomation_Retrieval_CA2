FBIS3-1185 "drafr055_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-055 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 22 Mar MB2203135594 MB2203135594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Goldstone Unfair to Police Generals in Gun Running Probe -- "We would be the first to condemn any police involvement in Third Force activities," declares the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 March. "However, we do not think that Mr Justice Richard Goldstone has been fair to the three police generals who were said to have been involved in gun running and other activities. He admitted that the prime facie, untested evidence should be subjected to the normal judicial processes." Therefore, if any policeman is guilty of being involved in Third Force activities, "he deserves to be prosecuted and punished. Conversely, if some or all of them, including the generals, have been unjustly maligned, then we hope their names will be cleared if not by the commission, then by the courts." THE STAR Call for Security Forces Deployment in Natal -- "For two weekends in succession the ANC [African National Congress] has been unable to hold planned rallies in townships near Durban," notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 March. "On the first IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] zealots occupied a stadium in Umlazi which had been booked in advance by the ANC; on the second `Zulus', suspected of being IFP loyalists, again thwarted the ANC by occupying a stadium in kwaMashu. Major conflict was avoided but the portents of a major disaster are there for all to see." It is "good" that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is "sufficiently concerned" to arrange meetings with President de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, and the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly. But, "it is not enough," and security forces must be "deployed in strength, not to overthrow Mangosuthu Buthelezi but to ensure that all parties have the right to campaign peacefully and that all voters have the right to vote or not to vote. The situation must not be allowed to degenerate into chaos." BUSINESS DAY Call for No Vote for Prisoners -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 22 March in a page-14 editorial remarks that "the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has shown little backbone, particularly for anything the ANC does not want. The ANC is among the parties wanting to slip a ballot paper under every cell door. Prison riots may be all that is needed to persuade the council that any perpetrator of any crime, no matter how heinous, should have a say in the composition of the next government. The answer to that proposition must remain a firm no." SOWETAN `Unrealistic Expectations' of Prisoners -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 March in a page-10 editorial is "aghast at the violence that has led to the death of 23 people in prison riots." "The Prisons Department, unhappily, is shrouded in secrecy forced upon it by apartheid laws. Such laws must disappear in the South Africa of the future. Those friends of the prisoners, who may be sparking unrealistic expectations, should be wary of causing more harm than help to their charges." CITY PRESS Zwelithini, Buthelezi Conceal True Intentions -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 20 March in a page-18 editorial is not surprised by the proclamation on 18 March of a sovereign kwaZulu/natal kingdom by Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini. Zwelithini and Chief Minister Buthelezi "were determined to break up this country. However, they concealed their true intentions with claims that all they wanted was greater powers for the regions. Now, the pretence is over. By this decision King Goodwill and Chief Buthelezi and the King must be stopped. We cannot allow a coterie of power-hungry potentates to dismember the country." "The unpalatable truth is that Buthelezi was never keen on testing his popularity at the polls. All that he wanted was kwaZulu/Natal. To achieve that he seems prepared to go to any lengths."
