FR940705-2-00220 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a. Delivery System. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). What cells are the intended target cells of recombinant DNA? What target cells are to be treated ex vivo and returned to the patient, how will the cells be characterized before and after treatment? What is the theoretical and practical basis for assuming that only the target cells will incorporate the DNA? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Is the delivery system efficient? What percentage of the target cells contain the added DNA? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(3). How is the structure of the added DNA sequences monitored and what is the sensitivity of the analysis? Is the added DNA extrachromosomal or integrated? Is the added DNA unrearranged? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(4). How many copies are present per cell? How stable is the added DNA both in terms of its continued presence and its structural stability? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b. Gene Transfer and Expression. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). What animal and cultured cell models were used in laboratory studies to assess the in vivo and in vitro efficacy of the gene transfer system? In what ways are these models similar to and different from the proposed human treatment? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2). What is the minimal level of gene transfer and/or expression that is estimated to be necessary for the gene transfer protocol to be successful in humans? How was this level determined? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(3). Explain in detail all results from animal and cultured cell model experiments which assess the effectiveness of the delivery system (see Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a) in achieving the minimally required level of gene transfer and expression (see Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2)). Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(4). To what extent is expression only from the desired gene (and not from the surrounding DNA)? To what extent does the insertion modify the expression of other genes? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(5). In what percentage of cells does expression from the added DNA occur? Is the product biologically active? What percentage of normal activity results from the inserted gene? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(6). Is the gene expressed in cells other than the target cells? If so, to what extent? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c. Retrovirus Delivery Systems. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(1). What cell types have been infected with the retroviral vector preparation? Which cells, if any, produce infectious particles? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(2). How stable are the retroviral vector and the resulting provirus against loss, rearrangement, recombination, or mutation? What information is available on how much rearrangement of recombination with endogenous or other viral sequences is likely to occur in the patient's cells? What steps have been taken in designing the vector to minimize instability or variation? What laboratory studies have been performed to check for stability, and what is the sensitivity of the analyses? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(3). What laboratory evidence is available concerning potential harmful effects of the transfer (e.g., development of neoplasia, harmful mutations, regeneration of infectious particles, or immune responses)? What steps will be taken in designing the vector to minimize pathogenicity? What laboratory studies have been performed to check for pathogenicity, and what is the sensitivity of the analyses? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(4). Is there evidence from animal studies that vector DNA has entered untreated cells, particularly germ-line cells? What is the sensitivity of the analyses? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(5). Has a protocol similar to the one proposed for a clinical trial been conducted in non-human primates and/or other animals? What were the results? Specifically, is there any evidence that the retroviral vector has recombined with any endogenous or other viral sequences in the animals? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;d. Non-Retrovirus Delivery/Expression Systems. If a non-retroviral delivery system is used, what animal studies have been conducted to determine if there are pathological or other undesirable consequences of the protocol (including insertion of DNA into cells other than those treated, particularly germ-line cells)? How long have the animals been studied after treatment? What safety studies have been conducted? (Include data about the level of sensitivity of such assays.) Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3. Clinical Procedures, Including Patient Monitoring. Describe the treatment that will be administered to patients and the diagnostic methods that will be used to monitor the success or failure of the treatment. If previous clinical studies using similar methods have been performed by yourself or others, indicate their relevance to the proposed study. Specifically:
