FR941026-0-00016 FR941026-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 914 Indiana Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Plan AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Indiana Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Plan (hereinafter referred to as the ``Indiana plan'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana plan to allow the State to assume responsibility for administering an emergency response reclamation program in Indiana on behalf of OSM. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger W. Calhoun, Director, Indianapolis Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Minton-Capehart Federal Building, 575 North Pennsylvania Street, Room 301, Indianapolis, IN 46204, Telephone (317) 226&hyph;6166. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I.␣Background on the Indiana Plan II.␣Submission of the Proposed Amendment III.␣Director's Findings IV.␣Summary and Disposition of Comments V.␣Director's Decision VI.␣Procedural Determinations I. Background on the Indiana Plan On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana plan. Background information on the Indiana plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the Indiana plan can be found in the July 26, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 32110). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at 30 CFR 914.20 and 914.25. II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment Section 410 of SMCRA authorizes the Secretary to use funds under the AMLR program to abate or control emergency situations in which adverse effects of past coal mining pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or general welfare. On September 29, 1982 (47 FR 42729), OSM invited States to amend their AMLR Plans for the purpose of undertaking emergency reclamation programs on behalf of OSM. States would have to demonstrate that they have the statutory authority to undertake emergencies, the technical capability to design and supervise the emergency work, and the administrative mechanisms to quickly respond to emergencies either directly or through contractors. Under the provisions of 30 CFR 884.15, any State may submit proposed amendments to its approved AMLR Plan. If the proposed amendments change the scope or major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its AMLR program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in reviewing and approving or disapproving the proposed amendments. The proposed assumption of the AMLR emergency program on behalf of OSM is a major addition to the Indiana AMLR plan. Therefore, to asume the emergency program, Indiana must revise the Indiana Plan to include conducting the AML emergency program.
