TASS learned from the prosecutor of the region Aleksandr Fedotov on Tuesday that Zhirinovskiy is accused of violating the law on the status of lawmakers which fixes inviolability of their offices. Nemtsov is a member of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. The incident occurred during a recent visit of Zhirinovskiy to the city on the Volga where the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party was met by angry residents shouting "go home" to him. Zhirinovskiy qualified the "welcome" as "infringement on personal prestige" and wanted to clear up the issue with the local governor. Nemtsov was out of his office at the moment. However, Zhirinovskiy used his government telephone to report his complaints to the presidential administration, the government and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. According to the staff of the governor, Zhirinovskiy resorted to numerous threats against them.
