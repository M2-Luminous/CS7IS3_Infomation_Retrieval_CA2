After midnight, a protocol was concluded with the Free Trade Unions in the field of education, which is affiliated to the CNSRL [National Confederation of Free Unions in Romania]-Fratia and with the Autonomous Trade Unions Federation in the Pre-University Education, which is affiliated to the National Trade Union Bloc. The protocol refers to the claim of supplementing the education budget. Likewise, at that hour, a memorandum on negotiations regarding the ways to find solutions to the four claims of the Alfa Cartel was in the process of finalization. Our correspondent at the government headquarters informed us that after the trade union representatives had withdrawn from negotiations, at around 0215, the commander of the Bucharest Police, Major General Nicolae Nitu, called on demonstrators to clear Victoria Square and have busses and trade unions members move to the Aviatorilor Square. After a series of discussions, at around 0300 local time, the shield bearers who were positioned in Victoria Square also withdrew while trade union groups got in the cars that are at this hour still parked in front of the government headquarters. In a statement made last night to our radio station, Mr. Bogdan Hosu, leader of Alfa Cartel, expressed his hope that discussions with the government side will continue in order to finalize the negotiations that have been held for over two days. In turn, Mr. Octavian Partenie, special representative of the government for relations with trade unions and employers' associations, reviewed the major points discussed with the trade unions and mentioned that the sides jointly agreed that by next Wednesday a mediation meeting will take place with the participation of the prime minister.
