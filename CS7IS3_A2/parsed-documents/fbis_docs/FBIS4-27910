It represented the fourth year of consecutive declining profits in the postwar period and it seems that we could hear cries that "we cannot tolerate a further decline." It is predicted that fiscal year 1994, which ends next March, will reflect a throttling of the declining profits, but we cannot necessarily be optimistic. Conditions affecting businesses were difficult during the past year. The yen advanced in value amidst historically low interest rates. Movements intensified to correct foreign and domestic price differentials, and "destruction of price structures" spread. Both major and midsized businesses were forced to adapt to globalization based on imports of materials and products from overseas, especially Asia, giving birth to the situation where Japanese businesses can no longer adhere to keiretsu transactions. It was also necessary to dispose of issues left as a result of the bursting bubble. The various firms worked assiduously to improve corporate performance, but earnings reports testify that they were not able to take adequate remedial actions. A sector analysis shows that raw materials makers such as steel and chemicals faced recessionary conditions and that fabrication and assembly firms recorded varying results. However, of even greater significance than differences between industries was the sharp contrast in performance among firms of the same industry in response to the existence or lack of management actions taken to improve corporate performance. The severity of the problems surfacing as a result of the bubble economy and the differences in skills associated with the handling of restructuring projects have determined the ultimate performance of individual corporations. Firms that took early remedial and bold actions to restructure have succeeded in producing minimally acceptable results. Additionally, skills exercised in responding to "price destruction measures" such as the procurement of materials and products from overseas made a difference in corporate performance. It was a phenomenon visible even in the United States, but we cannot overlook the fact that major corporations had a tendency to be hobbled by past performance and to suffer from delays in restructuring. There are signs of a recovery in the economy. Conservative restructuring actions such as reducing fixed expenses have progressed to a considerable degree. Industries operating in the information equipment, housing, and environmental equipment sectors will probably undergo aggressive restructuring while focusing on primary goals. As long as the future sees growth in demand leading to increased sales, underpinnings for increased profits now being laid will come into play. However, we have not passed the stage of operational reductions, balancing of supply and demand, and prospects for reduced profits in the nonmanufacturing sector, and most corporations are still cautious about capital outlays and the issue of employment instability still lingers on. The foregoing condition probably persists because individual firms do not have the resources to resolve all of the pending issues. Taking the single issue of foreign exchange, most firms visualize a rate of 105 yen to the dollar for the year ending in March 1995, but if the rate should fall below 100 yen during the year, there is the risk that corporate programs will become unattainable. A strong yen means lower materials costs and provides businesses with some advantages, but it is a matter of degree and it could have an unbearable impact on Japanese society if it leads to a hollowing of industrial sectors. We cannot overlook factors such as the direction of Japan-U.S. trade talks, deregulation, and the effects of political trends on business psychology and performance. Notwithstanding, it is not a time for inaction because of the vagueness of external factors. We see a movement emerging that favors a departure from the trend to reduce the scope of business operations. Although the structural strength of corporations has been weakened by several years of difficult economic conditions and there is some concern about how long they can persist, we cannot help but hope that they will persevere and expand their current efforts.
