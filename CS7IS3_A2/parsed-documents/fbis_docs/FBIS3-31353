On Wednesday Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Greens-Ecological Social Party, will sign a charter on their proposals and intentions to link up. The merger congress is to take place in Bled on 12 March. A coordinating group of the parties compiled a draft statute of the new party last Friday. A group for program documents is to complete its work this week. The so-called coordinating group of party presidents has already harmonized the majority of views regarding the forthcoming merger. A meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party Council is scheduled for next Monday. At that meeting the highest party authority will adopt a stance on the proposed statute and pass concrete decisions about future linkage. According to the scenario of the merger, all the parties are to hold their congresses on the morning of 12 March. After passing a decision to merge into a new party, the congress of the new party is scheduled to be held in Bled the same day. The new party does not have a name yet. It has been agreed that Janez Drnovsek will be its president. The party will have three or four vice presidents. As the leaderships of the Democratic Party and the Greens- Ecological Social Party explained to STA news agency this morning, the Democrats, the Socialists, the Greens-Ecological Social Party, and the Slovene Craftsmen-Entrepreneurial Party will form a new joint party even if they do not find a common language with the Liberal Democrats.
