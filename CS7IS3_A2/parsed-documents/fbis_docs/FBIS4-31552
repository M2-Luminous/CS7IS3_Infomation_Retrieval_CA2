Although it has not been officially disclosed, it is certain that a so-called Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] National Democratic Faction has proclaimed itself within the party. As we have learned, this faction includes a large number of parliamentary representatives of the VMRO-DPMNE and is a counterbalance to the party's core leadership (it is said that there are more than 10 representatives attached to the faction). In this faction of the VMRO-DPMNE are representatives Stoile Stojkov, Tomislav Stojanovski, and the coordinator of the party group Tomislav Stefkovski. The day before yesterday, before the announced beginning of the parliamentary session, a special party meeting was held during which some positions emerged which, for unknown reasons, were not revealed publicly in the announcement. The faction explained the reasons for its declaration primarily as a reaction to the ideological, national, and organizational failures of part of the party's core leadership in the VMRO-DPMNE. Representative Stoile Stojkov allegedly at one point in the Assembly openly announced the formation of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE. Although the disunity in positions could be "read" in the attacks from the assembly podium, he explained some of the reasons for this step. It was brought to the attention of the core leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE, for example, "the closing of the party to the acceptance of new members, especially those with higher education." Similarly, the following reasons for the (un)revealed existence of the faction were cited: "the characterization of the party as terrorist," the behavior and statements of certain members, as well as those of the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary by-election candidate in the electoral district 103 in the Skopje-area Kisela Voda opstina, Branislav Sinadinovski, and the simultaneous support of these comments in the name of the VMRO-DPMNE by the general secretary of the party, Boris Zmejkovski. We found out first-hand that the representatives and [local government] councillors of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE "remaining faithful to their constituents and sympathizers, will continue their political commitment to the well-being of the Macedonian state and the Macedonian nation." Stoile Stojkov believes that "We have serious observations concerning the privatization of the party. That a mass party like the VMRO-DPMNE should allow privatization by certain leading members is completely undemocratic." Among those better acquainted with conditions in "the most Macedonian party," this development is not unexpected. What is interesting is the manner in which the disagreement over the policy of the party's core leadership is expressed, that is, in the formation of a faction within the party and not a secession from it. Anyhow, factions do exist in parties and probably will continue to exist, but it is another thing whether they are revealed or not. Nevertheless, the (non)declaration of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction in the VMRO-DPMNE, which is now a fact, became more visible a few days ago when the VMRO-DPMNE Opstina Committee (OK) in Kisela Voda issued a public communique. In it, the committee broke its silence about some "methods" of activity in the party. The chairman of the OK reacted to "the despotic act committed by VMRO-DPMNE General Secretary Boris Zmejkovski, which has been documented in one of the OK publications in Kisela Voda; this is an act, according to the OK, which is typical only of totalitarian parties." The committee strongly protested to the VMRO-DPMNE leadership and asked (in writing, according to the communique) Zmejkovski to explain to the Macedonian public "why he employed such antidemocratic methods and why he found party policies like those of Aleksandar Dinevski and Ivan Sokolov necessary." The VMRO-DPMNE OK chairman in Kisela Voda characterized that same act as personal retaliation and a demand for an alibi for the unsuccessful by-election in the 103d district, saying "with his pledge to distinguish himself, the unsuitable candidate Branislav Sinadinovski brought the VMRO-DPMNE the slander of terrorism." It is not accidental that this public disclosure from the VMRO-DPMNE OK in Kisela Voda has appeared at the same time as the declaration of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction; behind this faction there are a large number of representatives and, as we have learned unofficially, a large number of councillors. Namely, in the first multiparty election, Kisela Voda was the largest trump card for the VMRO-DPMNE. From this area came a solid number of representatives. We should recall that it was thanks to the voters in this Skopje-area opstina that Boris Zmejkovski, Kole Lulovski, Ratka Dimitrova, Tomislav Stefkovski, Nikola Krstevski, and Dosta Dimovska arrived on the political scene. In any case, if there is discord in the attitudes of party members--we are not speaking of just the representatives--then that fact would better highlight the declaration of this faction. The analyst can expand this trend to include the opstina committees in Titov Veles, Bitola, Ohrid, and even now in Kisela Voda. It is not possible to forget the divided party positions about the visit of the party's core leadership to Bulgaria, and especially, the (un)expected presence of Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska at the recent support rally in Skopje of the Movement for Cooperation and Friendship between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria. [28 May p 4] [Text] Farce About Alleged Espionage The formal (non)declaration of the so-called "Macedonian National Democratic Faction" in the VMRO-DPMNE was no surprise for those who are better informed about this party, a party that has the most representatives in parliament. Just the fact that one can now speak of any kind of faction within a party is a surprise in itself. Perhaps for the public, the fact that is surprising is that in the faction there is a large number of representatives, among whom there are people who, until yesterday, were considered to be "the most ingrained VMRO types." The reason for such a division within the party, according to the faction, lies in the "dissatisfaction with the ideological, national, and organizational scrambling by the core leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE." Let us be more concrete: It is a question of a disagreement with Chairman Ljupco Georgievski, Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska, General Secretary Boris Zmejkovski, and some others among them, like Dragi Arsov or Branislav Sinadinovski, for example. According to Stoile Stojkov, "A mass party like the VMRO-DPMNE permits itself to be privatized by individual leading members. This is not democratic. Moreover, practically from the convening of parliament, there have been disagreements and differences--and what are they, if not factions? This process began already at the time when Vladimir Golubovski left the party and has continued through the settling of accounts in the opstina committees." And, in fact, much has happened in the ranks of this numerically strong party. From its ranks emerged first the VMRO-DP [VMRO-Democratic Party], then the VMRO-Fatherland, and the VMRO-United. The formation of these parties became necessary because of divisions or secessions over some party policy of the VMRO-DPMNE. And not just that. Some attacks made from the assembly podium by representatives of this party show that something serious is happening within this party. The culmination probably was the contradictory explanations following the election in the 103d Skopje-area district, which, in effect, divided opinion about the kinds of methods the VMRO-DPMNE would employ to gain power. The latest case is the visit of the core leadership to the Republic of Bulgaria just at the time when the second round of voting in the 103d district was taking place, and the promotion of the movement for Macedonian-Bulgarian friendship and cooperation, at which, according to some party members, Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska was suspiciously in attendance. From this, one could hear more audibly talk of some pro-Bulgarian option. What is perhaps more essential is whether the division in the party leads to reciprocal accusations and suspicions: Which is the pro-Bulgarian orientation, which the pro-Serbian, who is the infiltrator from state security, and so forth. In this context, the departure of Ratka Dimitrova from the coordinating function and her particular distancing from the party is an example. All these coincidences, especially the declaration of the faction, are open to many "interpretations" about what is going on within the party. Thus, Stoile Stojkov, who also serves as chairman of the parliamentary Commission for Control over the State Security Service, has been called a spy by some people in the VMRO-DPMNE leadership, while Tomislav Stefkovski is allegedly an infiltrator from the party with "special tasks." Stoile Stojkov says categorically: "Such a farce about alleged espionage is not only untrue, but also counterproductive. Besides, this is no new tactic; such tactics were used at the time against Vladimir Golubovski and Ratka Dimitrova." This, however, is not everything that can be heard within the party. For some people, that measure (the faction's declaration) is, in fact, the first step toward movement into the Democratic Party (DP). In the DP, however, this is roundly denied, and it is said that such an allegation is a banana peel intended for the VMRO-DPMNE by state security. Those, again, who have had somewhat different perspectives maintain that it is precisely that faction and its members, now said to number 11 and to include members of the parliamentary staff, who are really closer to the so-called Macedonian left, as can be seen in their attacks in the assembly. On the other hand, the motive is distancing from the stubborn attitudes and the phobia of the leadership headed by Ljupco Georgievski and General Secretary Boris Zmejkovski with respect to the government and, especially, toward the president of the country. According to Stoile Stojkov, "The latest version of my visit and of the consultations of Tomislav Stefkovski with President Kiro Gligorov is already in the making. General Secretary Boris Zmejkovski maintains that there is an audio tape of the meeting the two of us had with Gligorov. If that were true, I would ask him to release the tape publicly, so it can be known what we talked about at that meeting. And if there were anything to it, then the question arises whether someone is controlling the chief of state, or, on the other hand, whether Zmejkovski is so skillful and installed the listening devices." Stojkov's faction has reproached the core leadership for its privatization of the party, exclusiveness, and the lack of respect for the opinions of others. Another VMRO-DPMNE representative, Kole Lulovski, is likewise estranged from the party. "I have always been on the second flank for the party, and now I am on the third. We should recall that my positions are individual; I do not participate in the caucuses of the core leadership, and I am absolutely even more aloof from these revelations. The formation of the faction is new to me--`a special firm' in the VMRO-DPMNE." In any case, he continues, "It would be good to clean up the situation before the elections." Obviously, the VMRO-DPMNE has some calculating techniques. Meanwhile, another matter comes to mind. The practice in this party has been that whenever it is understood that there is dissent from the leadership, those espousing such views are simply excluded from the party. Whether that was done with the aim of acquiring the impression that there were no people within the party with dissenting views is another story. In any case, the outcomes in the VMRO-DPMNE opstina committees in Bitola, Titov Veles, and Ohrid are in themselves indicative. Out of them, a new party (VMRO-Fatherland) has emerged, and the local leadership in Ohrid, along with the party youth group there, went over to the competition (at least from Ohrid's point of view), that is, the VMRO-DP. Whether this time there will be a deviation from that practice will be a difficult question to answer, although it is known that things are not harmonious. Perhaps the key lies in the distribution of members, who, in any case, have led the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary group, more precisely in the existence of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE, to act as a serious counterbalance within the party ranks. For those who want to make forecasts, a nerve-racking party resolution is soon to be settled. But, no one knows how at this time.
