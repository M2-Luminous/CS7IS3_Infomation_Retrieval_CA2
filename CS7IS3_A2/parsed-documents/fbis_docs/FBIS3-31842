Vatican's re-involvement and its pressure on Zagreb to return to the anti-Serb coalition with the Islamic fundamentalists rallied around Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic, aim to oust Russia from the Balkans and give the United Nations a role inferior to NATO. Following talks with Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal Toran, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic confirmed that the Holy See had assessed as positive Croatia's acceptance of its proposals, Radio Vatican reports. The turnabout of the Croatian policy in Bosnia, which is also based on the ceasefire agreement with the Moslems, could have been unreservedly accepted only by those who are poorly informed about Vatican's underlaying strategy and who see this region as the threshold of Catholicism. The unnatural alliance with the 'isle' of Islam in Europe, imposed by Vatican, is only the initial stage in pushing back the orthodox religion over the Drina river which separates the Bosnian Serbs from their brothers in the east. In view of this, it is hardly surprising that the agreement between the Serbian and Croatian presidents, Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, on the gradual normalization of relations, was strongly criticized by Vatican. The Catholic Church, and specially Cardinal Kuharic in Zagreb and Archbishop Vinko Puljac in Sarajevo, were given the task of preventing any kind of rapproachment in the interest of peace between Zagreb and Belgrade. In view of the pressure by Germany, Italy and the Holy See to freeze Croatia's military presence in Bosnia, the Serbs are still described as the aggressors and threatened with possible new ultimatums, while the Russian initiative for a summit meeting of the five big powers on the Bosnian crisis, is viewed as unfavourable.
