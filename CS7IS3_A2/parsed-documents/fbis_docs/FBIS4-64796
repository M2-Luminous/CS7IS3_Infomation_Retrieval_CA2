Quartermaster General According to "I.G.T." writing in the 15 April Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, General Espirito Santo, presently chief of the Portuguese mission to NATO, will be the next Army quartermaster general. His appointment, which will become effective at the beginning of May, caused surprise in Army ranks, since it was expected that he would be nominated to head the Institute for Higher Military Studies or the Army's operational command. "I.G.T." noted that the quartermaster general post is considered a stepping stone to the position of chief of the Armed Forces general staff. This expectation will probably apply to Gen. Espirito Santos as well, "I.G.T." writes, as he enjoys "great prestige and the sympathies of the political powers that be." Lajes Agreement Update The resolution of possible labor conflicts is the last hurdle before signing a Lajes base agreement between the United States and Portugal, writes Jose Vegar in the 23 April Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. A meeting of the two sides at the end of April in Washington will attempt to reach a consensus on a labor agreement for the Lajes base, including eventual indemnification to dismissed workers, a burden Washington does not want to assume alone. "Strangely," according to Jose Vegar, no date has been scheduled yet for the signing of the agreement, with both sides awaiting a "propitious date."
