Such allegations are a falsification by mass media," President Mircea Snegur said at a meeting with the U.S. deputy state secretary, chief coordinator of the State Department for the CIS James Collins in Kishinev [Chisinau]. Snegur acknowledged that the synchronization of the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova with giving the Transdniestria a special legal status "is yet a subject for discussions with the Russian side." At the same time, Snegur pointed out that he categorically objects to such an approach. Collins praised "the fact of common vision by the Moldovan leadership of the ways to settle the problems of Transdniestria and villages populated by Gagauzes." As an official representative of the Gagauz administration told INTERFAX, representatives of Gagauzes and the Moldovan leadership are expected to sign a conciliatory protocol in Komrat (the center of the self-proclaimed Gagauz republic) on Saturday [14 May]. The same source said that if by that time the existing differences are not eliminated, the sides will wait for the conclusions of the European Council regarding the draft law on the status of Gagauzia. During last week's visit by the European Council delegation to Moldova the draft law was handed by representatives of Gagauzes to this international organization for studying and making a conclusion. IF Note: On Thursday the Moldovan parliamentary commission on defining the special legal status for regions populated by Gagauzes met in Kishinev. A delegation of the Gagauz parliament led by Vice- President of the non-recognized Gagauz republic Petr Buzadzhi took part in its work. The Gagauz leaders stated their readiness for certain compromises, but they continue to insist that the law should determine the status of Gagauzia as a national-territorial state unit with its own constitution.
