Based on the game rules currently in effect, the number could easily have been even larger. This makes one think of tightening the rules. It is very simple to fulfill the requirement of needing the signatures of 20,000 supporters, if they can be collected in the same manner as one fills out a lotto ticket at a service station. Signing for someone else or for an imaginary person constitutes fraud and deception of the authorities. A person who engages in such behavior, or the candidate's election representative, could be brought up on criminal charges. The right of popular movements to appoint candidates should not, in itself, be made too difficult in connection with direct popular elections. If we end up having as many candidates as we have now, the notion of giving all candidates equal treatment in the media becomes absurd. The media, including the Finnish Broadcasting Company, must, to a greater extent, rely on their journalistic judgment. Otherwise, we would end up in a situation where the media publicity resulting from the status as a presidential candidate could be used as a front for various ulterior motives. Some obvious weaknesses have become evident in the parties' preliminary election procedures. Remedying these shortcomings should mainly be up to the political parties. In particular, the experiences that all the parties involved have had with the open preliminaries should give us food for thought. The appointment of a candidate for the Social Democratic Party moved away from the party to outsiders. The Center Party's preliminary elections, in Helsinki and suburbs, attracted a large number of people from other areas who only wanted to protest against the appointment of the party's sure candidate. In its current form, the presidential election campaign, including preliminary elections and party summer congresses, will last almost a year. As the preliminary elections have come to stay, the role of the party congresses in appointing candidates becomes insignificant and a formality. The preliminary elections and the naming of candidates could easily be moved to early fall, which would mean that the election campaign could be shortened to only a few months. If some parties want the party congress to give a candidacy its imprimatur, they could arrange for an extraordinary party congress once every six years.
