The seminars were sponsored by the Xinjiang Geographic Institute, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan. The seminars focused on two subjects: use of water resources and control of mud-rock flow. The seminars were held in Urumqi, capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Almaty, capital of Kazakhstan. Scientist attending the meetings visited water conservancy and mud- rock flow control projects in the autonomous region. Xinjiang and Kazakhstan are neighbors in the desert area of Central Asia. Two rivers flow from Xinjiang into Kazakhstan, which are major water sources for Kazakhstan's inland areas. The two rivers are fed by melting glaciers. As the globe becomes warmer, glaciers have been shrinking faster rising to higher altitude, while the rivers have seen less water flow. This phenomenon poses a serious threat of water shortages in the region. At the same time, mud-rock flows have caused large losses of life and property in the area. The seminars were attended by 74 scientists from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, Russia, Japan and Germany. Participants put forward 83 theses on rational tapping of water resources and control of mud-rock flow.
