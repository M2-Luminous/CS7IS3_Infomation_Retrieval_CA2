It was not only first in achieving successes in a market-oriented price reform, but also gained abundant experiences in its exploration of price management through regulation and control under the conditions of market economy. 1. Direct Regulation and Control of Government-Fixed Prices The method employed by the Shenzhen SEZ was: Prices and charges in areas of a monopolistic, scarcity, protective, and mandatory character shall still be fixed, regulated, and controlled by the government. These include charges for electric power, communications and transportation, water supply, urban public utilities, primary means of agricultural production, real estate, education, health services, and administrative enterprises. This is a pattern in which the government by itself applies the law of value in regulating and controlling prices. In the actual practice of regulating and controlling these prices, the Shenzhen SEZ strictly observes the limits of authority in matters of price administration as between the central, provincial, and city governments. It will rationally determine and adjust the said prices and charges according to the product costs and expenses in the various lines involved, according to the supply and demand situation, also considering the average profit margin of social funds, and also considering the need for optimizing the production structure. The aim is to allow these lines and products to earn, under the conditions of normal production and rational operations and services, more or less the same profit as the average profit margin of social funds, and furthermore to promote the sustained and well-coordinated development of all the various industries and trades of the national economy. 2. Price Management by Regulation and Control of Prices Determined by Market Forces In its price reform, one step ahead of others, the Shenzhen SEZ has already decontrolled all prices and charges for products and labor services of a competitive nature and allowed them to be regulated by the market, with the result that prices for 97 percent of all retailed commodities had become market-regulated. In this vast array of market-regulated prices, the SEZ government chose food prices, which were of primary importance for the people's livelihood and which accounted for over 60 percent of all retail sales, as its breakthrough point in carrying out the said regulation and control measures. It effected regulation and control by economic measures, through new rules and regulations, and by necessary administration means, and thereby, ahead of others, accumulated experiences in the regulation and control of market-regulated prices under the conditions of the socialist market economy. A. Establishing markets for the trading of agricultural products, promoting normal circulation of commodities. To establish wholesale and retail markets for the agricultural products of the SEZ, the SEZ government instituted unified planning, and through the methods of investments by public finance, raising funds among the public, loans, and the shareholding system, it set up successively large and medium-sized wholesale markets for agricultural products of altogether over 100,000 square meters in Yuanling, Futian, Buji, and other places. It restored or newly built over 100 retail markets for agricultural products over an area of over 300,000 square meters, accommodating over 60,000 vendors' stalls. The purpose of establishing these markets for agricultural products was not only to enliven circulation, promote production, and greater convenience for the people, but also to provide the preconditions for fair competition and trading at reasonable terms. This is an important link in the establishment of a new market order for the whole series of processes, from production, to circulation, and to consumption of agricultural products, in accomplishing normalization of market prices, and in effective price management through regulation and control. B. Using economic measures in the regulation and control of market prices. These are the essential measures by which government effects macroeconomic regulation and control of market prices under the conditions of the socialist market economy. They are also objectively demanded by the operational mechanism of an economy that works on the principle of "let the state regulate and control the market, and let the market guide the enterprises." It is for this reason that the industrial and commercial departments of the SEZ exert efforts in the following ways: First, closely monitoring of market movements, being accurately in control of supply and demand changes in the market, signalling to the government danger signs in the market, and suggesting countermeasures that will effectively control prices. For instance, in 1989 the entire city's total demand in 1990 for major foodstuffs was forecast as: grain 180,000 tons, edible oil 20,000 tons, sugar 12,000 tons, aquatic products 30,000 tons, poultry 18 million heads, egg products 12,000 tons, and vegetables 280,000 tons. The forecasts were also for the particular seasons, months, and days of the demand, and in this way provided clear and definite targets for the scientific regulation and control of supply and demand of agricultural products in the market, for the development of production, for the organization of out-of-town sources of supplies, and for ensuring a well-balanced availability in the market. Second, energetically developing production, increasing effective supplies. Guided by the policy of "developing production, increasing supplies, expanding exports," the SEZ government formulated a set of "food basked projects" which combine concern for the economic development of the SEZ as also for the livelihood requirements of the people. It has so far established 646 specialized and intensively operating fresh foodstuff production entities. By 1990 the entire city had become self-sufficient in aquatic products to 64 percent, in vegetables to 50 percent, in egg products to 60 percent, in pork to 41 percent, and in poultry to 31 percent. Third, opening all gates to the SEZ, enlivening the circulation system, and on a broad scale opening up supply sources in outlying areas. Production and construction in the SEZ is rapidly developing, employees, workers, and floating population are all rapidly increasing, and the excess of demand over supplies in the market is becoming an ever more significant factor. Under these circumstance, the SEZ government is exerting great efforts in the development of production and in increasing the local sources of commodities, while at the same time ridding itself of the ossified traditional distribution system and smashing the exclusivity of business operations by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. The SEZ is establishing a diversified circulation system with many divers channels which flexibly react to changes, with a minimum of intermediary links, and with an integration of production, supply, and marketing. Under the new system of having the commercial and trading enterprises "operate in a diversified way but adopting one line as main line of business," and of "integrating domestic and external trade, while making production, supply, and marketing one well-coordinated process," the gates of the SEZ will be opened wide, "commodities are welcome from any direction, and people are welcome whether in state-run, collective-run, or individually operated enterprises," all may participate in the market, to engage in fair competition and free trading. On a broad scale, main agricultural production districts in outlying areas are being interested in setting up commercial enterprises in the SEZ, so that commodities from all directions may flow into the SEZ's markets and continuously increase effective supplies to the SEZ. Fourth, exploiting to the fullest the advantageous location of the Shenzhen SEZ for export trade, developing import and export trade, aiming at a balance of supplies and demand in the market. Shenzhen is separate from the hub of international trade, Hong Kong, by only a bridge, and the SEZ has a unique advantage for earning foreign exchange by exporting fresh foodstuff to Hong Kong. At the same time, it is also in a position to obtain through Hong Kong most rapidly supplies of important commodities from the international market and information on price fluctuations. The SEZ can be flexible and selective in its import and export trade, so as to achieve a balance of supplies and demand in its market. For instance, early in 1989, the grain market became disturbed, and No 3 rice, even at as high as 160 yuan per 50 kilo, was hard to come by. At that time the SEZ immediately imported rice from Thailand and stabilized the grain market. 3. Using rules and regulations as means of effectively regulating and controlling market prices. From the viewpoint of administrative control, market economy is an economy operating within a legal system. The Shenzhen SEZ has therefore formulated a complete set of rules and regulations operationally effective in its system of wholesale and retail markets. First, the SEZ's rules and regulations for the administrative control of wholesale markets. 1) Operators must register and display their license when operating wholesale markets. 2) Wholesale business in agricultural products must be transacted inside the market. 3) Market control organs must daily publish the commodity supply situation, the prices of the various commodities in transactions the day before, so as to provide price information for buyers and sellers. 4) Set prices must be clearly marked out in the market. None other than legally prescribed standard scales and weights must be used. Fraudulently cornering the market, hoarding and speculating, adulterating and falsifying, and the deliberate forcing up of prices are strictly prohibited. Prices must accord with the quality offered, competition must be fair, and trading must be free. 5) Operators must pay taxes and administrative charges according to regulations. Invoices are prescribed, and invoices must accompany all commodities transacted, to provide, for later linkage with the retail sales, a basis for the determination of retail prices, according to the system of having a rate for the differential between wholesale and retail prices. Second, the SEZ's method of administrative control of retail markets and its system of law-consistent trading operations. The SEZ's policy is to treat state-run, collective-run, and individually operated businesses equal and without discrimination. 1) The trading system is to be one of openness. The SEZ prescribes that every retail trader shall install himself/herself and conduct trade within his own vendor's stall. He/she shall openly display the quantity and quality of goods and clearly mark their prices. Transactions shall be fair and in observance of the law, and all trading shall be courteous and open to supervision. 2) The trade control system shall be well documented and conducted with proper bookkeeping. When retail traders bring good bought at the wholesale market to the retail market, they must have documentation of legal transactions, and they shall fix the retail sales prices according to the prescribed rate for the differential between wholesale and retail prices. They must also strictly keep accounts of all transactions according to proper accounting procedure. The accounting system shall enable checks as to whether the traders have observed all legal provisions. 3) Instituting a system of "cards of reputable conduct." To ensure fairness of transactions, and to guard against adulterations and falsifications, short weighing and arbitrary forcing up of prices, every retail sales stall has to prepare at the time of any transaction a "card of reputable conduct," showing the type of commodity sold, its quantity, quality, unit price, and total amount involved, to present to the buyer and the city official in charge for examination and verification, as proof that vendor has conformed to law. (4) Instituting an administrative control system by means of recording negative marks for violating rules or regulations. Rules and regulations, as well as penalties for violations, shall be publicly displayed inside the market. Violators shall be penalized by recording negative marks. The SEZ is carrying out its comparative appraisals in an enlightened way: those who had no negative marks during one month are vendors of excellence, those who had only one to two negative marks are good vendors, those with three to five negative marks are vendors due to receive a warning, those with five to 10 negative marks shall be temporarily closed down and undergo rectification, those who have accumulated 25 or more negative marks during the year shall have their license revoked and be expelled from the market. 5) The SEZ instituted a "target achievement" administrative control system. This is a mechanism of self-control of administrative control personnel. The system of job responsibility applies to personnel of every rank enforcing basic administrative control of industrial and commercial commodity prices in the SEZ. A comparative appraisal of "target achievements" shall furthermore be conducted every month, quarter, and year, and administrative market control and service achievements shall be linked to rewards, penalties, and promotions. 4. Using administrative measures to control the rate for the differential, according to the principle of giving due consideration to production prices. This is a kind of new type of administrative control method which effectively regulates and controls market prices by applying the principle of adding the average rate of profit to the cost price. By a rational determination of the rate for the differential allowed between the prices at which the goods are brought in and the prices they are sold for, the Shenzhen SEZ is regulating and controlling for a certain time and for certain special commodities the rate for the differential between wholesale and retail prices. This kind of control of the rate for the price differential reflects the government's conscious application of the production price (plus average profit) principle, arrived at by making full use of the function of market regulation. It enables, on the one hand, effecting changes according to the changes in costs and charges, and, on the other hand, enables formation of rational purchase, wholesale, and retail prices under the restraints of market supply and demand. It establishes a harmonious coordination of profit distribution as between the various links of production, wholesale, and retail. It has also, as a consequence, resolved the irrational situation of "having people at both ends crying, while the middleman laughs" and of having exorbitant prices being demanded, a situation that had arisen after the traditional prices had become irrational, had been decontrolled, and allowed to freely adjust. It has also enabled control of prices at an appropriate level. In short, after several years of hard work in the economic field, and exploratory efforts in the field of socialist market economy, the Shenzhen SEZ has achieved excellent results in its government's regulation and control of prices.
