FR940207-2-00123 FR940207-2-00065 The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the CBOE to list and trade options on ADRs given that these options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, CBOE rules require that the ADRs underlying these options meet the CBOE's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible to manipulation. Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the CBOE make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the CBOE standard. The Commission believes, however, however, that requiring the CBOE to review the foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can be potentially manipulated. 16 16 For example, we would expect the Exchange to consider delisting an option on an ADR if the price and public float of the underlying security did not meet trading or size maintenance standards, or if the security underlying the ADR failed to meet other standards that raised manipulative concerns. Third, the CBOE has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although the proposal does not require the CBOE to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair the ability of the CBOE to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective underlying ADR market. 17 17 See ADR Letter, supra note 6. As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses. In Particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information from foreign jurisdictions. In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the marketplace. 18 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. 18 See also securities Exchange Act Release No. 26653 (March 21, 1989), 52 FR 12705 (order approving the trading of options on the International Market Index (``IMI''), an index comprised of ADRs traded in the United States based on foreign securities). In this approval order, the Commission specifically required that there be comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place between the Amex and the foreign exchanges on which the securities underlying the ADRs trade so that a substantial percentage of the Index was covered by comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
