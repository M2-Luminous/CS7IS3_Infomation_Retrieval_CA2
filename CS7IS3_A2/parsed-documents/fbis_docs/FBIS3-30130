FBIS3-30130 "dreas038__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-038-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Digital Center for Multimedia Software Proposed OW2502004294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2502004294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has compiled a tentative set of rules on copyrights pertaining to software for multimedia use to help promote the growth of the multimedia business which is considered to be the most promising field in information-related industries in the future. The ministry's proposal includes a plan to set up a new "digital information center" where video and audio information will be centralized, and their copyrights managed. It also provides for database users to freely copy and edit accessed data whose authors have registered their copyrights with the information center, simply by paying a compensatory fee. MITI plans to shortly urge the Agency for Cultural Affairs to make revisions to the Copyright Act. So far, producers of multimedia software have had to get approval separately from several authors to use their data. This has been very time consuming. Should MITI's plan materialize as envisioned, the groundwork would be completed toward promoting the multimedia business. Multimedia techniques allow free editing of audio and video data by computer. For example, it is possible to create a piece of work that has a different appearance or capabilities compared to the original by changing the colors of a visual image or pasting a different image. However, the concept of multimedia has yet to be clearly defined. There may be broader applications depending on future technological advances. However, audio and visual data which serve as the raw materials in the production of multimedia software are protected by copyrights. Before multimedia software producers can use such data, they must get approval from the respective copyright holders. Particularly since multimedia software is characteristically produced by combining a wide variety of copyrighted data, it is necessary for users to locate all the copyright holders and negotiate with them on royalties. Therefore, it has been very time and money consuming. According to MITI's proposed set of rules, authors can voluntarily register their copyrights with the digital information center, and prospective users can go to the center where they will have access to a complete list of available copyrighted data along with their respective royalty fees. These fees paid by users will be collected by the information center which will in turn reimburse the copyright holders. In this way, users will be relieved of having to search for individual copyright holders. MITI's plan also calls for revision of the current Copyright Act regarding a provision which prohibits editing an item in a manner not in line with its author's beliefs. Specifically, the plan calls for permitting free editing of data as long as such editing does not discredit its author who can file a suit with the court to forbid objectionable acts only when he judges that he has been discredited. Other major industrialized nations are also faced with difficulties regarding the handling of copyrights on multimedia-related items. An idea which is very similar to MITI's plan to set up a centralized body to handle such copyrights has surfaced in the United States. However, it is still uncertain whether MITI's plan will simply be accepted as it is by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and its Copyright Council, which are reviewing whether it would be necessary to revise the Copyright Act.
