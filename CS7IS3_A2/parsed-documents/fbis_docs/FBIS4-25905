Carter arrived here on Monday [13 June] in a prelude to his visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for possible mediation in Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program. During his stay here, the former U.S. president respectively met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, deputy prime minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. Carter is likely to convey to the DPRK the position of the U.S. and South Korea on a settlement of the nuclear problem. His visit to the Korean peninsula comes at a time when the DPRK decided to quit the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency while South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are stepping up their effort towards U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. The DPRK has reportedly banned inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether it has been diverted secretly to make atomic weapons. The DPRK insists that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula would be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he said. The former president will return to Seoul via Panmunjom on June 18 to brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks with DPRK leaders before heading back to Washington.
