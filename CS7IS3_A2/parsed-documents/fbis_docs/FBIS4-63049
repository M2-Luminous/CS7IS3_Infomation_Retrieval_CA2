This was announced by Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin at a briefing in Moscow today. He said this document would contribute to the integration of Russians with the political, social and economic life of the newly independent states (the ex-Soviet republics) and their adaptation to local culture preserving at the same time their appropriate cultural particularity. Karasin announced that a draft of the register of urgent measures for 1994 which must contribute to the settlement of issues concerning the situation with Russians living abroad had been also worked out. He stressed that the discussion had revealed the necessity for a special body which would solve problems of Russians and coordinate activities of different organizations in this sphere. The best way will be to set up a governmental commission composed from representatives of the respected departments and the appropriate parliamentary committees. Public organizations working on problems of Russians would be represented in the expert council under the commission, Karasin suggested. He recommended that the commission primarily should work out a long-term program on support of Russians living abroad and ensure its implementation.
