Bill Clinton tried to convince the viewers that in the world arena "weakness, indecisiveness, and a lack of principle" are qualities not characteristic of Washington. Not one of the journalists or politicians from the United States, Cuba, Poland, South Korea, Israel, or the many other countries enabled by CNN to question the president in person was able to catch him out. The president was steadfast even though his administration's foreign policy did not become any clearer after his 90-minute defense of it on live television. Bill Clinton told Lawrence Pezzullo, the U.S. representative to Haiti, expelled from the island by the military regime, that he has not yet abandoned the idea of using military force to restore democracy there. He promised North Korea friendship if Pyongyang agrees to an international inspection of its nuclear facilities where, it is believed, work is being carried out to create a weapon of mass destruction. Clinton is convinced that Beijing has partly rectified the human rights situation and would thus like to extend to China most-favored-nation status in trade with the United States. But the situation is far from perfect. For that reason the possibility of depriving China of trade privileges remains in existence. South Africa was promised an increase in U.S. aid, on which a "dream will be built" there [na kotoruyu tam budet "postroyena skazka"]. As for Bosnia, the problems there "have proved far more difficult than I imagined when I was running for the presidency," Clinton said. President Clinton claimed Russia, the Near East, and trade problems as the big successes of his foreign policy. But at the present time the world is in a state of turmoil and is resisting the attempts of the United States, the world's leader and guarantor of the universal standards of human rights, to call it to order. Furthermore, the absence of a second superpower (the Soviet Union) has, on the president's admission, not made foreign policy problems any easier.
