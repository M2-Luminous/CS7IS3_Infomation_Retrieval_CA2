On March 1, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department confirmed that the remark of Hubbard, a senior U.S. Government official, publicly demanding the repeal of the "NSL" reflects the official position of the United States. The South Korean authorities and the "Democratic Liberal Party" side now are much upset by it, calling it an "interference in their internal affairs". Meanwhile, a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Party of South Korea in a commentary strongly demanded the authorities repeal the "NSL", saying it is natural in view of universal principles that the U.S. side manifested its official stand urging the abrogation of the "NSL".
