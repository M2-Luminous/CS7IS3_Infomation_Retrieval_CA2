The "Convention" stipulates: All convention signatories pledge to exemplarily comply with all relevant state regulations on protecting copyrights and will boycott all activities that infringe on the rights and interests of audio and video publications producers. All signatories are naturally agents for protecting copyrights and give full authorization to other signatories in investigating pirating, illegally copying, counterfeiting identification marks, selling counterfeit publications, and other activities infringing on signatories' rights that take place in their locale. The convention is the first of its kind of China's audio and video publications industry. [passage omitted] It has been learned that the China Audio and Video Publications Exchange Association is China's first mass organization dealing with the audio and video business. The organization primarily devotes its efforts to protecting copyrights of audio and video publications and to conducting exchanges between the audio and video industry and the film and television industry, as well as exchanges with units outside the country, to bring about common improvements, to improve the quality of China's audio and video publications, and to purify the country's audio and video publications market.
