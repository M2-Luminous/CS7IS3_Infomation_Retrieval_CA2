FR940503-1-00082 FR940503-1-00012 (f) EPA inspections. The inspections, reviews, collections, and audits under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be conducted: (1)(i) At the foreign refinery; (ii) At any other location where gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for use in the United States is stored or transported; and (iii) At any other location where documents are kept which relate to the quality and/or quantity of the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for use in the United States; (2) Either announced in advance, or unannounced; (3) At any time prior to January 1, 2003; and (4) With relation to any gasoline produced: (i) During 1990 and any other year for which data are submitted to EPA in support of an individual baseline; and (ii) For use in the United States during the period December 1994 through December 1997. (g) Failure to meet requirements. If any requirement specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section is not fully met for any calendar year, or if the Administrator determines that the information submitted to EPA under paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section is inaccurate in whole or in part, then compliance with the requirements of §§80.41 (h) and (i) by an importer shall be measured, ab initio and for each and every calendar year or for such other period of time as the Administrator may determine, from the baseline that otherwise would apply to the importer in the absence of the operation of this section. (h) Volume constraints. (1) During any calendar year the total volume of gasoline imported by one or more importers to which a foreign refinery's baseline applies shall not be greater than the refinery's 1990 baseline volume. (2) Where the volume of gasoline for which the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed by one or more importers during any calendar year exceeds the refinery's 1990 baseline volume, the refinery's baseline applies only to the first volume of that refinery's gasoline that is imported into the United States that equals the 1990 baseline volume. (3) In the event any importer uses a foreign refinery baseline in violation of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this section the importer shall, ab initio , calculate compliance using the baseline values that properly apply under paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this section. (4) In the event any gasoline is imported before January 1, 1995 for which a separate foreign refinery baseline is claimed: (i) Such gasoline shall be combined with gasoline imported during 1995 for which the separate foreign refinery baseline is claimed for purposes of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this section; and (ii) An adjusted 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery shall be calculated, for use during the combined 1994 and 1995 period only, by multiplying the 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery times 1.17.
