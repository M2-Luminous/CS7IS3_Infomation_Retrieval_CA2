Tomaz Gerden reports: [Begin Gerden recording] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, of course, attracts great attention wherever he goes. This was also the case in Bled were approximately 100 foreign and domestic journalists and cameramen have gathered. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who was invited here by the National-Social Alliance, in the introduction praised Slovenia, which he is visiting for the second time. He was here for the first time in November 1990 at the congress of the Liberal Party. I view the Slovene nation, which has chosen its own fate, with respect. Zhirinovskiy also said that he knew that our country was highly developed and cultured and handled its affairs into which he would not meddle by itself. An avalanche of reporters' questions ensued: Zhirinovskiy answered fiercely. Occasionally he had problems with the translation. He gave preference to Slavic journalists over western journalists, who are obviously getting on his nerves. For example, he accused them of creating a false impression that he favored war. The leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats assured them that he has always favored peace and was opposed to the use of force. All foreign troops, including the blue berets, should withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only then will there be peace. He also spoke in favor of not changing borders and of freezing the situation in Europe as it was in 1945 after World War II. Asked what are his alleged connections with the former KGB, he categorically assured: I have no connections with the former or the present KGB. I would gladly have had connections with the KGB as this was the most powerful political police in the world. Had I been connected with the KGB, I would be sitting in the Moscow Kremlin now and not in this small town on the shore of a lake. Mr. Zhirinovskiy then distributed his book among the journalists, again threatened Western, corrupt journalists, and said that he would meet any Slovene politician who might wish to do so. For example, he had received Mr. Jelincic yesterday. Finally, it is worthwhile noting that the news conference, despite sporadic outbursts, was carried out in perfect order. Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who will soon leave for Serbia, repeated on several occasions that he favored peace and only peace and that his former militant statements were misrepresented. [end recording]
