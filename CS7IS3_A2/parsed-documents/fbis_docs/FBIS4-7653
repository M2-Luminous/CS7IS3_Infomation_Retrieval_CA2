It decided to give this cabinet which is no longer supported even by President Zhelyu Zhelev a month and a half to get the crisis under control. A six-point resolution on the price and currency crisis was adopted. The party's leadership is to formulate clear requirements to be presented to the government, said BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva. "We give the government a month and a half to resume control," said ex-Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov. In his opinion, the government stands an approximate 10 per cent chance of success but it should be allowed to try. It is unrealistic to consider the formation of a new cabinet within this parliament, he said. The BSP will demand from the government control over price formation, rapid completion of the activity of liquidation commissions in regard to the land reform, stabilization of the foreign exchange market, no politically motivated dismissals in the army before the passage of the armed forces bill on second reading, and information on the progress of negotiations with international financial institutions. Emergency measures have to be taken to save the municipalities, health care, education and welfare payments. The government must present a clear stand on the issues of social policy together with the central bank's report in May. The party's leadership and the parliamentary BSP will develop a stand on structural, functional and personal changes in the cabinet, more particularly in its economic team. If the government fails to stabilize the situation elections are the only alternative, the socialists maintain. The Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) whose government was overthrown in November 1992 took a firm stand for early elections.
