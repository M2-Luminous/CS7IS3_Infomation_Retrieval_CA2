Portov] [Text] Vladivostok, 12 Jan -- A senior officer in the Pacific Fleet Command in the Russian Far East revealed on 12 January that the Pacific Fleet Command plans to export four Foxtrot-class submarines -- now deployed at Vladivostok Naval Base -- to North Korea and that the contract on their sale has already been been signed with North Korea. The contract has been pushed on top secret instructions from Navy headquarters in Moscow, and the price remains a secret. Officially, North Korea says it will dismantle the submarines and use the steel materials therefrom. But a source at Fleet Command said North Korea could repair the submarines to create a new submarine flotilla or use their parts to repair other submarines. The submarines were built in the 1960's. At present, they belong to the Submarine Training Brigade and are docked in Ussuri Bay.
