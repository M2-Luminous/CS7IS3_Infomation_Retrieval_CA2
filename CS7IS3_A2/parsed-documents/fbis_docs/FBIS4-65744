[passage omitted] Richardson said his country wants to see the confidence-building measures succeed and described them as a very significant step. He added that he does not believe the confidence-building measures process has failed. Asked if the reason for his visit is to persuade Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to accept the confidence-building measures, the British official said his country has been attempting this for a long time. He added: The British Government is in continuous contact with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community. Richardson said he assumed his current duties three months ago, but that he had dealt with the Cyprus issue in his former position of British alternate representative to the United Nations.
