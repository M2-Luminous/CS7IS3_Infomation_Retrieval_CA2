Rodoljub Jovic reporting for Croatian Radio from Split. The illegal container carrying undeclared ammunition, explosives, and other military equipment instead of 6,950 kilograms of petrol and gas has been stored at the Split customs warehouse. The head of the customs office of the port of Split, Rade Roso, has completed all the administrative formalities and has forwarded all the relevant documents to the commander of the British warship through the mediation of an official agent. He has also filled out a customs violation report and has submitted it to the judiciary. According to initial estimates, the value of the undeclared cargo is 1 billion 230 million Croatian dinars and the penalty for such activities is a fine and the compulsory confiscation of the cargo. In reference to yesterday's statement by the spokeswoman for the British peacekeepers, Rade Roso repeated today that the ship's commander had behaved strangely during the routine inspection of the container in question. Namely, the above-mentioned container was opened forcibly because the key had allegedly been lost and the excuse for this did not strike us as plausible because it was given after the violation had been discovered and after the real cargo list had been found locked up in the container.
