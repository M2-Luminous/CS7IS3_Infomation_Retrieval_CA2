FR940930-2-00030 FR940930-2-00019 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;789&hyph;000] Trunkline Gas Co., Notice of Application September 26, 1994. Take notice that on September 21, 1994, Trunkline Gas Company (Truckline), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1642, filed a request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;789&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon by sale two 4-inch diameter liquid transmission laterals 1 located in Vermilion Block 26, offshore Louisiana, to Union Oil Company of California (UNOCAL), all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection. 1 See orders at 21 FPC 704 (1959) and 23 FPC 640 1960). Truckline proposes to sell its Laterals 210B&hyph;1700 (approximately 1,390 feet long) and 210B&hyph;1800 (approximately 1,540 feet long) in Vermilion Block 26 To UNOCAL. Following abandonment Truckline would permanently disconnect Lateral 210B&hyph;1700 (which runs between UNOCAL's Vermilion Block 26 B platform and Trunkline's Vermilion Block T&hyph;2 platform) and Lateral 210B&hyph;1800 (which runs between UNOCAL`s Vermilion Block 26 C platform and Trunkline's Vermilion Block T&hyph;2 platform) from its system and connect the two laterals on the T&hyph;2 platform. Trunkline states that UNOCAL intends to use the laterals to move low pressure natural gas in conjunction with its production operations. Trunkline proposes to sell the laterals to UNOCAL for $25,000 and would not incur any expenses in connecting the laterals on the T&hyph;2 platform. Trunkline also states that it has not used these laterals since 1974. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October 17, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Trunkline to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
