FBIS4-27105 "dreas104_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 North Korea Remarks Said `Treacherous Crime' Remarks Said `Treacherous Crime' SK3005052794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0509 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005052794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Unpardonable Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- It is a most heinous crime which can never be justified that the South Korean puppets scrapped the joint declaration on denuclearisation, hurling groundless slanders at the North, declares NODONG SINMUN today. The analyst says: The South Korean puppet unification minister, Yi Hong-ku, at the "National Assembly Committee of Foreign Affairs and Unification" recently, heaped abuses on the North and said "the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has already been nullified in actuality," stating that the South "will discuss it from a new angle." This meant that they unilaterally scrapped the "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" adopted by the North and the South and declared its abrogation. This is a treacherous crime never to be condoned and an open perfidy and malicious challenge to the North which has made all sincere efforts for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The Kim Yong-sam group, after grabbing power, has hastened the development of nuclear weapons and engaged themselves in well- planned maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration on denuclearisation, a hurdle in its way. Practically, the Kim Yong- sam traitor group is making haste with the development of nuclear weapons in full scale under the "nuclear umbrella" of outside forces, trampling upon the joint declaration. Not much penetration is needed to see why they openly declared the nullification and renunciation of the joint declaration on denuclearisation at a time when the uprightness of the North's nuclear policy is being proved more clearly. They seek to accelerate the development of nuclear weapons, unhindered, by destroying the joint declaration which stands in the way of their introduction of nuclear weapons and development of their own nuclear arms. The Kim Yong-sam group will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its perfidy in reducing "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" to a dead letter.
