"The main task of the Central Bank is to curtail inflation", the newspaper quoted him as saying. "Jointly with the IMF and the World Bank a package of anti-inflation measures has been drafted in order to keep the situation under control and then considerably decrease the rate of inflation. The moderately tough financial policy which was determined yet in November 1992 will be preserved. However, the Central Bank is not going to implement the course at any price which can result in mass unemployment and a further decrease in living standards", he said. Among other priority tasks Khandruyev listed "further reform in the settlement system and improval of the work of commercial banks". The newspaper commented that the bank will call on commercial banks to increase their charter capital, improve the licensing system, introduce world banking standards. The Russian VESTI newspaper published on the front page reports by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "The agro-industrial complex faces a very difficult economic and financial situation", the newspaper writes. "The debt to agriculture amounted to 2.3 trillion roubles by the beginning of 1994, while the agro-industrial complex, in its turn, owes 1.8 trillion roubles for material resources". Zaveryukha believes that "the situation in agriculture can be stabilised only by state subsidies". Shafranik said that mutual non-payments "had aggravated the crisis situation in fuel and energy complex to the maximum". Russian and CIS consumers owe the industry 11.6 trillion roubles for 1993 which is a 6.6-time increase compared to the previous year. "Russia should not turn into a dumping ground for poisonous waste from the world", the KRASNAYA ZAVEZDA said in an article devoted to the dumping problem. It stressed that, according to a Greenpeace report, 96 attempts to bring to Russia dangerous toxic waste with a total volume of 34 million tonnes has been registered since 1987. More than a half of the attempts - 58 - took place during the last two years. Over 80 per cent of waste brought to Russia is of the German origin. Besides Russia, in 1990-1991 nearly eight thousand tonnes of toxic waste were brought to Poland, 5,000 tonnes to Estonia, 3,500 tonnes to Romania, 270 tonnes to Ukraine and 40 tonnes to Lithuania, the daily added. The PRAVDA, commenting on the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, noted that "one cannot by pay attention to the more than strange metamorphosis of the United Nations". Instead of fulfilling the peace-keeping mission it actually turns into a "world gendarme who is ready to punish and does punish mostly those who do not suit the forces lobbying in the UN headquarters, rather than than those who act against peace and humanitarian principles". "There is an impression that the United Nations is distancing itself from initially proclaimed principles and turns from an impartial world arbiter into an instrument of politics of a group of countries headed by the USA", the daily said. The TRUD publishes an interview with Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov who, speaking about privatisation, said: "I believe it is impossible to sell for nothing state property which was created and accumulated in decades of work of many generations. (Privatisation Minister Anatoliy) Chubays either conceals the true state of things or does not understand anything in what he is doing". The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes the speech of Communist Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov who summed up the results of the party activities in the first year since the August 1991 ban on it was lifted. Zyuganov noted, in particular, that the Communist Party "is the biggest in strength and the third in the number of electorate, has organisations in all regions and enjoys a rather numerous and influential faction in the Federal Assembly".
