This should be done on the basis of international legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of all Resolution 242. The appeal said that talk about peace and negotiations has become a delusion and called for a series of activities, including: -- The immediate launching of a comprehensive and responsible national dialogue with the participation of all national and Islamic forces in a bid to unify our people in confronting the developments of the present stage. -- A new formulation of national unity on militant bases and under the umbrella of Palestinian national constants. -- The hoisting of black flags in the streets and on roofs throughout the occupied territories for a period of 40 days. -- The holding of conferences by national and popular institutions and prodding international organizations and human rights committees to provide temporary international protection for our defenseless people. -- The opening of businesses from the morning hours until 1700. Merchants are urged to adhere to this time.
