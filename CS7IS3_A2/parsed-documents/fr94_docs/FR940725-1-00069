FR940725-1-00069 FR940725-1-00010 The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend parts 1 and 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR parts 1 and 23) as follows: PART 1_DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1347, 1348, 1354(a), 1357(d)(2), 1372, 1421 through 1430, 1432, 1442, 1443, 1472, 1510, 1522, 1652(e), 1655(c), 1657(f); 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 2. A new definition is added in alphabetical order to §1.1 to read as follows: §1.1 General definitions. * * * * * Maximum speed for stability characteristics, V FC /M FC means a speed that may not be less than a speed midway between maximum operating limit speed (V MO /M MO ) and demonstrated flight diving speed (V DF /M DF ), except that, for altitudes where the Mach number is the limiting factor, M FC need not exceed the Mach number at which effective speed warning occurs. * * * * * PART 23_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: NORMAL, UTILITY, ACROBATIC, AND COMMUTER CATEGORY AIRPLANES 3. The authority citation for part 23 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430; 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 4. Section 23.3 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2), (d), and (e) to read as follows: §23.3 Airplane categories. * * * * * (b)␣*␣*␣* (2) Lazy eights, chandelles, and steep turns, or similar maneuvers, in which the angle of bank is more than 60 degrees but not more than 90 degrees. * * * * * (d) The commuter category is limited to propeller-driven, multiengine airplanes that have a seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 19 or less, and a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds or less. The commuter category operation is limited to any maneuver incident to normal flying, stalls (except whip stalls), and steep turns, in which the angle of bank is not more than 60 degrees. (e) Except for commuter category, airplanes may be type certified in more than one category if the requirements of each requested category are met. 5. Section 23.25 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (a)(1) introductory text, and paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(iii) to read as follows: §23.25 Weight limits. (a) Maximum weight . The maximum weight is the highest weight at which compliance with each applicable requirement of this part (other than those complied with at the design landing weight) is shown. The maximum weight must be established so that it is_ (1) Not more than the least of_ (i) The highest weight selected by the applicant; or * * * * * (iii) The highest weight at which compliance with each applicable flight requirement is shown, and * * * * * 6. Section 23.33 is amended by revising paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) to read as follows: §23.33 Propeller speed and pitch limits. (b)␣*␣*␣* (1) During takeoff and initial climb at the all engine(s) operating climb speed specified in §23.65, the propeller must limit the engine r.p.m., at full throttle or at maximum allowable takeoff manifold pressure, to a speed not greater than the maximum allowable takeoff r.p.m.; and (2) During a closed throttle glide, at V NE , the propeller may not cause an engine speed above 110 percent of maximum continuous speed. * * * * * 7. Section 23.45 is revised to read as follows: §23.45 General. (a) Unless otherwise prescribed, the performance requirements of this part must be met for_ (1) Still air and standard atmosphere; and (2) Ambient atmospheric conditions, for commuter category airplanes, for reciprocating engine-powered airplanes or more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight, and for turbine engine-powered airplanes. (b) Performance data must be determined over not less than the following ranges of conditions_ (1) Airport altitudes from sea level to 10,000 feet; and (2) For reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds, or less, maximum weight, temperature from standard to 30 ○C above standard; or (3) For reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and turbine engine-powered airplanes, temperature from standard to 30 ○C above standard, or the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature at which compliance with the cooling provisions of §23.1041 to §23.1047 is shown, if lower.
