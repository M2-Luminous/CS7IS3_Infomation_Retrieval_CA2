National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis has convened the legislators for 9 May at the Haitian legislature to conclude the seventh legislative session but Bernard Sansaricq, who claims he is president of the National Assembly, has also convened the legislators. Here is a report on this situation by Leontes Dorzilme. [Begin recording] [Dorzilme] The parliamentarians of the 45th legislature must meet in national assembly on 9 May in order to close the seventh legislative session. The president and vice-president of the National Assembly, respectively Senator Firmin Jean-Louis and Deputy Robert Monde, officially convened this meeting on 6 May. Today, 9 May, eyes remain glued on the Legislative Palace where there is much disagreement. Will the elected representatives of the National Front for Change and Democracy agree to sit down with the parliamentarians elected on 18 January 1993, who are themselves very determined to attend the meeting convened by the office presided over by Sansaricq? Who will the real president of today's session be? No one knows. We have received two convocations in our newsroom, issued by the two -- antagonistic -- offices of the Senate of the Republic. There is a slight nuance, however: Chamber of Deputies President Monde and Jean-Louis, president of the official Senate Office, are expecting the members of the 45th legislature at 1100, while Sansaricq is expecting them at 1200. One cannot anticipate which side Monde -- who is torn between two forces and who, according to what he himself has said, will cooperate with whichever Senate Office is operative -- will support.
