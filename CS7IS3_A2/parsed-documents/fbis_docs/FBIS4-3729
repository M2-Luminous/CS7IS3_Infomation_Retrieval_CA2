From January through March, the bank's working capital loans in hard currency to foreign-funded firms accounted for 85 per cent of the bank's total foreign exchange credits to such firms in the first quarter. Meanwhile, 99.6 percent of the bank's total loans in renminibi to foreign-funded firms are working capital credits, said an official with the bank, who declined to be identified. In accordance with the State's policy of curbing the over-expansion of capital spending, the bank will keep strict control over lending for investment in fixed assets. In the first quarter, the fixed-assets loans for foreign-funded ventures dipped slightly compared with the same period of last year, he said. The official declined to give more details about the exact sizes of the working capital credits and the exact decline rate in the fixed-assets loans. The official stressed that his bank will give full support to foreign-funded ventures. He said more loans are expected to be granted in the second quarter than in the first and predicted that the amount lent to foreign-funded ventures this year will be more than last year. But the rate of growth will not be too big, the official said, since the State will maintain its controls on credit in the face of soaring prices. The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion worth of foreign exchange loans to foreign-funded ventures, 28 per cent more than in 1992. As a major channel for foreign investment, the Bank of China has followed a credit policy that favours foreign-funded ventures. Since 1980, it has provided foreign-funded ventures with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange and 135.6 billion yuan $15.5 billion) in renminbi. About half of all foreign-funded ventures in China have opened accounts with the bank, and a fifth of them have been granted loans. Since the demand for loans is much higher than the bank's capacity, the official said, the bank will direct most of its limited capital into selected firms according to national industrial policy. Most of the enterprises on the bank's preferred list are in energy, transportation and telecommunications. Those with high profitability and credit worthiness will also be given priority. While converting itself from being a State specialized bank to commercial operations, Guan said, the Bank of China will pay more attention to the efficiency of its loans. "We will enhance the anti-risk sense to protect our bank's assets," he said.
