Have you come out with encouraging results? [Talabani] My meetings with French officials have been successful, fruitful, and encouraging. We met with Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and discussed with them issued of interest to Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. The results in my view were very positive. [Nawfal] Have you won practical support? [Talabani] Yes, we realized definite and clear things. For instance, Leotard emphasized France's continuing contribution to the forces that are protecting the people of Iraqi Kurdistan and pledged to continue offering humanitarian, economic aid to the Iraqi Kurdistan region. As for Alain Juppe, he emphasized to us France's clear and firm policy toward the Kurdish people and the need to give them their political and democratic rights within unified Iraq. As you are aware, France, like us in the Iraqi Kurdistan Front, opposes partitioning Iraq but emphasizes the need for the Kurds to enjoy the broadest form possible of self rule for the Kurdish people within Iraq. Juppe assured us that France wants Iraq to fully abide by all UN Security Council resolutions, especially Resolution 688 concerning the Kurdish people's rights, and that France will not lift the economic sanction on Iraq unless Iraq abides by all international resolutions and unless it agrees to allow the Kurdish people to enjoy their legitimate rights within a unified Iraq. [Nawfal] We would like to ask you about conditions in Iraqi Kurdistan. [Talabani] Conditions in Iraqi Kurdistan are developing and improving despite the difficult economic and social problems. Despite the presence of 300,000 displaced Kurds from the Karkuk area, to which the Iraqi Government refused to allow them to return, and despite the presence of tens of thousands of victims of the notorious arrest campaign, economic conditions are improving because the Kurdish peasants returned to their villages and began to rebuild them. The crops will be good this year, God willing. The Kurdish people have begun to plant and produce. The democratically elected Kurdish administration have started to electrify hospitals, schools, and other services. Our special security organizations are developing. For instance, the sabotage network sent by the Iraqi government to assassinate foreign nationals recently has been busted. Therefore, several sabotage and assassination networks, which the Iraqi government supported with arms and money, have been wiped out. [Nawfal] But how can you manage? Are you in control from the security viewpoint, despite all the recent events? [Talabani] We are in better control that others. [Nawfal] What do you mean by others? [Talabani] I mean our neighbors, for instance. Compare our conditions with Tehran, where they have explosions and booby trapped cars every day. With Baghdad, or southern Iraq, where they have daily explosions. Of course, I mean that we should not be compared with Afghanistan and Somalia. We are very much superior in this regard. I mean that even compared to our neighbors, the security conditions are improving in Iraqi Kurdistan. I do not claim that they are ideal, but I am aware of the meaning of the phrase Improving conditions. We hope this improvement will increase in the future. But as you know, we in the east, even in the European countries, we cannot prevent crimes and assassinations and explosions completely. But in Iraqi Kurdistan we realized great successes in foiling many bombings attempts and the killing of innocent people. [Nawfal] In northern Iraq, you are playing host to non-Kurdish Iraqi opposition groups. How do you deal with them? [Talabani] Yes, sir, we in Iraqi Kurdistan have an open, democratic society and we are proud of realizing a model democracy. Everybody enjoys democratic freedoms--the freedom of party work, of the media, and of politics. Because Iraqi Kurdistan is part of the Iraqi state, other Iraqi brothers--Arabs, Turkomans, and other Iraqi citizens--have the right to come to Iraqi Kurdistan and work there. For instance, in Iraqi Kurdistan there is the headquarters of the unified Iraqi National Congress [INC], which includes many important groups of the Iraqi opposition and which is continuing unrest for the democratic alternative in Iraq. Our shiite brothers and other parties, even the parties that do not belong to the INC, have the right to work. We have invited our brothers in the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the dissident Iraqi regional leadership, and the Islamic al-Da'wah Party, who are outside the INC to come to Kurdistan and work there. I even would like to give you an exclusive news item. Sharif 'Ali, who is claiming the throne of Iraq, sent me a letter, sometime back, asking to be allowed to open an office in Kurdistan. We have agreed to and welcomed this request. We would like the Iraqi Movement for Constitutional Monarchy [al-harakah al-malakiyah al- dusturiyah fi al-'iraq] to have the right to pursue democratic activity in accordance with the Koranic verse: So announce the good news to my servants, those who listen to the word and follow the best of it. [Nawfal] Thank you for this revelation. Many reports speak of contacts between Baghdad and Kurdish groups to hold agreements with Baghdad. We do not know how true they are. What is your opinion? How true are they? [Talabani] These reports are completely baseless because the Iraqi Government does not think seriously of establishing a dialogue with the Kurds and the Kurds do not want this. [Nawfal] I mean a group of Kurds, not all of them. [Talabani] These reports are not true. Today I was asked by Juppe and I answered ... [pauses] when we emerged together, a Turkish reporter asked our opinion of the Turkish attempt to mediate between the Kurdish leadership and the Iraqi Government because Mr. Sanberk, the Turkish Foreign Ministry under secretary, stated upon his return from Baghdad that he proposed this to the Iraqi officials who expressed a desire to have a dialogue with the Kurds to solve this problem. My answer was that Resolution 688 is the correct basis because this resolution includes the need for Iraq to abide by the rights, democratic freedoms, and human rights for all Iraqi citizens, including the Kurds, and asks the Iraqi Government to negotiate and hold a dialogue with Iraqi citizens to realize these rights. If the Iraqi Government is serious, it must implement this resolution, and hold a dialogue with the Iraqi people, including the Kurds, to resolve the issues in a peaceful political manner. [Nawfal] Thank you, Mr. Jalal Talabani. [Talabani] Thank you, brother.
