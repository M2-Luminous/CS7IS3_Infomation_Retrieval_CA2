He added that Egypt intervenes in this process only to defend the interests of Palestine and other Arab countries because it sees things from a different perspective than the United States, Europe, and Israel. The foreign minister said that the day will come when Egyptian efforts in this area will be brought to light. In an interview that will appear in tomorrow's edition of the weekly magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF, Musa said that peace means the restoration of land that was lost on 5 June 1967 as well as Palestinian rights. The Egyptian foreign minister said that any analysis of the talks will show that the Palestinian side is the weakest, for the Palestinians do not have many cards while Israel has the land, the power, and international assistance. Therefore, it is necessary for the Egyptians to throw their diplomatic weight on the Palestinian side to give it the momentum and power to negotiate. Musa pointed out that Egypt has intervened on the side of the Palestinian delegation on more than 12 occasions. In each of these cases, the Palestinians would reach a certain point and then the Egyptians would step in and introduce alternative ideas, he explained. Minister Musa said that there are no concessions being made. If we give Israel part of the land, this is a gain because the land was completely lost and there was no Palestinian presence or authority there that could be used to regain it. The foreign minister said that if we let this opportunity slip by for five more years it will be lost completely. He noted that between 1967 and the late President Anwar al-Sadat's peace initiative in 1977, there were no more than a handful of settlements [built in the occupied territories] and only a few hundred settlers. Today, we are dealing with 180 settlements and upward of 200,000 settlers. If we fail to face this situation, the number of settlements will rise to 300 and the number of settlers to 0.5 million. The Jews will become a majority and we will not be able to get them out, Musa said. The foreign minister denied that the situation in South Africa is analogous to that in the occupied territories. There is a great difference, he said. In South Africa there is a white minority and a black majority, no land is occupied, and discrimination is on the basis of skin color. The problem in Palestine is one of Israeli occupation coupled with thousands of immigrants pouring in from abroad and the millions that are being spent on them. The standards of international powers allow Israel to win land every day, he stated. Minister Musa said that, had the Palestinians participated with us in the Camp David accords, we would now be discussing self-determination. Those who call for deferring the issue to future generations overlook the erosion of land, political momentum, and Palestinian presence. The also forget that Palestinians are living in hell and have no jobs or hospitals, Musa pointed out. The foreign minister rhetorically asked if it is not better for Yasir 'Arafat to return to Jericho; tour the occupied territories; take control of Nablus and other towns; and open universities, schools, and hospitals. In his interview, Musa noted that Egypt has never abandoned its role in Somalia. He said the first phase of the Somali problem required the sending of food and humanitarian aid. This role was undertaken by the rich states and the international aid organizations, which managed to stop the famine. Musa noted that the political role of reforming the situation in Somalia is a very complicated matter. It is impossible for one state, no matter how strong, to undertake a drastic action in Somalia alone. Musa explained that Egypt could not have intervened alone to separate the warring factions in Somalia. He noted that the United States was the only state that was able to implement the Security Council resolutions. The United States was the only state that could move a whole army and its ancillary equipment to Somalia. Musa said Egypt is calling for four things in Somalia: the establishment of a government or a transitional administration, the achievement of national reconciliation, the disarmament of the Somalia factions, and the reconstruction of Somalia. He said that Egypt emphasizes that national reconciliation must include all factions without discrimination. Therefore, it has invited all factions, including the faction of General Aidid, because it rejects the principle of electing one person from among the factions and installing him because soon afterward the civil war would resume. Musa stressed that Egypt can help Eritrea and compete with Israel's role. However, it cannot compel Eritrea not to cooperate with Israel because this is considered intervention in its internal affairs. He indicated that it is in Egypt's interest to help Eritrea, instead of Israel. Musa called on the Iraqi regime to recognize Kuwait without preconditions so that the Arab crisis with Iraq can end. He noted that the crisis lies in the Iraqi regime's insistence that Kuwait is Iraq's 19th province. Musa explained that Egypt is against the partition of Iraq. However, it cannot approve of Iraq's stance on Kuwait or call for lifting the blockade on Iraq unless it complies with the UN resolutions. He stressed that Egypt is prepared to do everything to ease the Iraqi people's suffering. However, Egypt does not have the last say on this subject. Musa denied that there are any direct or indirect Egyptian-Iraqi contacts. On Egypt's stance on Libya, Musa explained that Egypt respects the UN Security Council resolutions but is against escalating them out of concern for the Libyan people's interest. He stressed the need for the trial [of the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident]. If there is disagreement on the venue of the trial, the Libyan demand must be taken into consideration because it is just. Asked about the fate of Libyan opposition figure Mansur al-Kikhya, Musa said that contacts with Libya are still continuing, but we cannot accuse anyone until we have all the evidence. Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement that the regime in Egypt is "shaky and unstable," the foreign minister affirmed that Egypt has received an official denial of this statement from Israel. Otherwise, there would have been a strong Egyptian reaction to it. Regarding the terrorism issue, Musa said that it should neither be underestimated nor exaggerated because it is not new and has existed since the forties. He affirmed that the terrorist attacks and murders that are taking place will not affect political, social, economic, and technical progress. The issue is marginal. There are exaggerations in the foreign media in depicting the situation in Egypt. Musa expressed the view that some neighboring countries support terrorism, but he refused to name these countries. Asked about Egyptian-Sudanese relations, the foreign minister affirmed that despite the differences between Egypt and Sudan there is an opportunity for dialogue with the brothers because historic relations must not be allowed to collapse. He emphasized that Egypt opposes the secession of southern Sudan. At the same time, it believes that there should be no bloodshed among the same people because the people of the south are part of Sudan. Musa affirmed that Egypt and Iran are large countries in the same area, and what links them is stronger than what separates them. The opportunity is available for the establishment of good relations between Iran and Egypt. The foreign minister noted that he has good relations with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. He said that Egypt, as a government, does not want a permanent split with Iran but the obstacle is the difference in views. Musa noted that Egypt has often criticized Iranian policy toward the Gulf states, Iraq, and some African states because it wanted to draw Iran's attention to the fact that Egypt rejects any attempt to undermine Arab national security or infringe on the territories of any Arab state, and the United Arab Emirates in particular. Musa said that Egypt has the largest market. The economic reform program goes hand-in-hand with the peace process. At a certain point in time we will achieve peace and a favorable Egyptian economic situation. If other favorable economic conditions are added, there will be no fear that Israel will control the situation. It is difficult to imagine that a small country like Israel can threaten us economically. He added that the Israeli economy distinguishes itself in technological services and not in heavy industries, mass agriculture, or mass consumer production. He said that investors will go to the state that offers better conditions. For this reason, we must be able to provide favorable conditions for investment and economic progress, and this demands reaching an Arab understanding on this issue. The foreign minister explained that the Middle Eastern market is a slogan. We are talking about a new situation in the Middle East with new economic, security, and political elements. Musa affirmed that a Middle Eastern market cannot be realized before peace. Otherwise, where will Syria and Palestine stand? The Middle Eastern market means sitting together and defining the role of each party. This has not taken place and has not been raised until now.
