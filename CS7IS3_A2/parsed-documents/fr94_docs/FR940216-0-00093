FR940216-0-00093 FR940216-0-00010 During calendar years 1995 through 1997, refiners and importers may certify reformulated gasoline pursuant to either the Phase I simple model standards, or the Phase I complex model (early use) standards. This election must be made separately for each refinery on a calendar year basis. During calendar years 1998 and 1999, all reformulated gasoline must meet the Phase I complex model standards, and beginning in 2000, all reformulated gasoline must meet the Phase II complex model standards. The final rule establishes reformulated gasoline standards for oxygen, benzene, toxics emissions performance, and heavy metals under all models. Standards for RVP, sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins are included only under the simple model, and standards for VOC and NO X emissions performance are included only under the Phase I and II complex models. A refiner or importer electing early use of the complex model during 1995, 1996, or 1997 must determine individual refinery or importer performance standards for VOC, toxics, and NO X . These standards are determined by evaluating the following slate of fuel parameter values in the Phase I complex model: The simple model requirements, per section 80.41(a) or (b), for benzene, RVP and oxygen; the aromatics value necessary to meet the simple model toxics standard using these values for benzene, RVP and oxygen; the refinery or importer individual baseline values for E&hyph;300, sulfur, and olefins; and the statutory summertime or wintertime baseline value for E&hyph;200. The percent reductions in VOC, toxics, and NO X emissions determined using the above fuel in the Phase I complex model are the reformulated gasoline standards for a refinery or importer electing early use of the complex model. Beginning in 1998, the Phase I reformulated gasoline VOC, toxics, and NO X standards for a refinery or importer are as specified in section 80.41 (c) and (d). As a result of the individual refinery or importer baselines under complex model early use, gasoline that is produced under this option at any specific refinery or imported by any specific importer, may not be fungibly mixed with gasoline that is produced at another refinery or imported by another importer. This segregation of early use complex model gasolines, and other segregation requirements, are discussed more fully below. Refiners and importers may elect to meet certain reformulated gasoline standards either on a per-gallon basis or on average. This election, which must be made separately for each parameter and separately for each calendar year, applies to all gasoline produced at a refinery by a refiner, or imported by an importer, during a calendar year. Refiners and importers cannot meet the standard for any single parameter on a per-gallon basis for certain batches and on average for other batches during any calendar year. A refiner or importer that opts for compliance on average must also meet requirements for gasoline quality surveys. Standards that may be met on average are RVP, oxygen, and benzene, and VOC, toxics, and NO X emissions performance. The purpose of the gasoline quality surveys is to ensure, for example, that RVP averaging by refiners or importers does not result in a covered area receiving reformulated gasoline that, on average over the covered area, has a higher RVP than would occur without such refiner or importer averaging. This applies for each parameter subject to refiner or importer averaging. In the event a gasoline quality survey reveals that the gasoline being used in a covered area does not meet the per-gallon standard for any regulated parameter, the per-gallon maximum or minimum standard for that parameter is made more rigorous, and except in the case of oxygen the standard for average compliance is made more rigorous. With certain limited exceptions, these adjusted standards apply to all gasoline produced at each refinery that supplied the covered area with the failed survey during the year of the survey failure, or during any year the adjusted standards apply. These gasoline quality survey requirements also apply to oxygenate blenders that meet the oxygen standard on average. The final rule also includes other mechanisms to ensure that refiner or importer averaging will not result in a covered area receiving reformulated gasoline that, on average, is less ``reformulated'' than would occur absent such refiner or importer averaging. To meet this goal, EPA established standards for average compliance that are more rigorous than the standards for per-gallon compliance, and established the per-gallon maximums and minimums that apply to gasoline meeting the averaged standards. These maximums and minimums limit the range of averaging for the averaged standards, and the more stringent averaged standards require refiners and importers to further reformulate their gasoline to meet these standards. Refiners and importers may meet the averaged standards for oxygen and benzene through the exchange of credits. Credits are generated as a result of a refiner producing, or an importer importing, gasoline that on average exceeds the averaged standards for oxygen or benzene over the averaging period. An oxygenate blender using the averaged oxygen standard may generate, or use, oxygen credits. The final rule specifies the manner in which credits must be used. Credits must be generated in the same averaging period as they are used_credits may not be banked for use in a later averaging period; all credit transfers must occur within fifteen days following the end of the averaging period in which they are generated; and only validly created credits may be used to achieve compliance.
