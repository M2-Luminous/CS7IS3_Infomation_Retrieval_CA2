[Bigay] With the help of these two contracts, we will probably regain our share of the market during the years prior to the Gulf War in 1993. But we cannot draw any conclusions from that as to the total volume of the military market. What we can see is that there was first of all a partial reorientation of the market toward very heavy attack helicopters, like the Apache. This happened rather paradoxically, at that, since the frontal threat in the center of Europe has disappeared and because this is currently reflected by the switch from highly specialized helicopters toward more multirole helicopters. That is the way the development trend is going in Germany between the PAH-2 and the UHU, which is the German version of the Tigre. A certain number of countries have procured very heavy and highly sophisticated helicopters for themselves and they will probably have trouble getting their money's worth out of them. Our response to that market obviously is the Tigre. Unfortunately, the latter is currently not available on the market and we have not been able to participate in the competitions. [AIR & COSMOS] Are you afraid of American competition on these markets? [Bigay] It is obvious that the cut in the United States defense budget persuaded American builders to increase their export share in an effort to hold on to those sectors in which they were strong; the export business has not been one of their priorities so far. The first expression of this American aggressiveness was the involvement of authorities at a very high level, much more so than was ever done in the past. France, more so than other countries in Europe, took some time to react to that. Today, the various persons in charge in our respective countries realize that being technically and financially good was no longer enough to walk away with the big contracts. From here on in, you have to be able to come up with financing plans equivalent to those of our competitors and, above all, you have to show that France has a strong political interest in getting the contract signed. French officials are now fully aware that if we stand together and if we dedicate ourselves to our industry in a sector where it is competitive and strong, then the chances of an even fight and victory in the end is within reach. [AIR & COSMOS] You were talking about the French Government. But what is the position of the German Government? [Bigay] The two contracts we just got involve Cougars which are exported under French law. We have had the unfailing support of our chief shareholder, that is, Aerospatiale, and it is entirely normal that we should have the support of the French authorities. Of course, we have been having a certain amount of trouble from the German authorities regarding everything that has to do with armament export policy. But we have so far not suffered too much as a result of that, of course, to the extent that we do not have any deal in the final stage that would involve equipment exported under a German license. [AIR & COSMOS] You are involved in other negotiations in a certain number of other countries. What kind of volume do they represent? [Bigay] As for realistic business deals, we are currently conducting negotiations on the equivalent of the 100 Cougars. And then, of course, there is the British competition over the supply of 91 attack helicopters, a challenge we took up with a particular version of the Tigre. [AIR & COSMOS] On that score, you received the British Defense Minister at Marignane. Did you submit your proposal to him? [Bigay] Eurocopter responded to the British bidding invitation with a model of the Tigre that is very close to the French antitank version and the German UHU version. As we told Minister Malcom Rifkind, the broad outlines of our proposal also point to involvement of British industry (through British Aerospace) covering the entire service life of the complete Tigre program. By the way, British industry is already associated with the Tigre program in a very significant fashion since it is participating in the design of the MTR 390 motor and the Trigat missile. In addition to responsibility for specific equipment to be used in the British version, we entrusted it with the straightforward production of the aft portion of the fuselage and the armament fins. The end of this century is a unique opportunity for putting in place common and interoperable military resources in Europe. The current competition is an opportunity for Great Britain to get back in since it withdrew from the NH-90 when Sikorsky took out a partnership in Westland. Besides, if it were possible to arrive at interoperability between the German, French, and British armies, the costs of the program, especially in the matter of logistics (basic and advanced training, maintenance, etc.) would be greatly reduced. [AIR & COSMOS] What are the strong points of Tigre as compared to its competitors? [Bigay] Generally speaking, looking at our real competitors, Tigre features a technology that is between 20 and 25 years younger. All you have to do is to go back 25 years to realize that the technical evolution is quite considerable here. We are getting equivalent and even higher performances from a lighter helicopter as far as antitank weapons systems are concerned. As for the industry aspect, we went for a long-term policy with real partnerships, not a short-term solution that, for example, would be based on licensing. We should view the European alliances in the form of a partnership and not in the subcontracting format. We tried to get the best combined effort and we think that this association with British Aerospace is one of the best we could put together to the extent that we supplement each other. We have competence in helicopters, British Aerospace is competent in handling big orders, in managing systems, and in the processing of important business deals in logistic terms with the Ministry of Defense. [AIR & COSMOS] The British specifications mention industrial production in 1998, whereas the Tigre program looks to 1999... [Bigay] Mr. Francois Leotard answered that question and assured us that the Tigre program would be continued without delay and that France was prepared to go for industrial production by the date necessary to meet the British demand. [AIR & COSMOS] What about the Netherlands' project to procure attack helicopters? [Bigay] The competition has not been started as yet. When it does start, Eurocopter will pick up the challenge. In the more or less well-informed press, I read that they were about to buy 75 Apaches on sale. All I can say on that score right now is that we were not consulted. I think nevertheless that the purchase of 75 helicopters will require real and proper consultation. [AIR & COSMOS] Do you think that the NH-90 program which was recently attacked in a parliamentary report is threatened? [Bigay] The '94 budget provides the sums of money necessary to develop the NH-90 program as planned. I do not think that it is threatened, nor could it be threatened by the new planning law. One must not forget that this program involves seven different armies and that we are now in a period where no European country has the means for developing its own product, a time when cooperative efforts are necessary to share the burden of financing new products and, thereafter, to share the ownership costs. I am confident that if the program were to be examined once again, we would arrive at the same conclusions as those that led to its launching. Perhaps, we may nevertheless have to improve certain points in the decision-making procedure. [AIR & COSMOS] What results do you estimate for 1993? [Bigay] The '93 and '94 results were held down by the lack of orders in '92 and at the start of this year. The business we picked up in '93 will add up to a business volume in '95 and '96. I estimate that our total business volume will once again drop 10% when compared to '92; the operating result will not be as good as anticipated, but it will be balanced and the final result will probably be negative. This is because of the trouble we are going to run into with our civilian operator customers who are suffering tremendously as a result of this crisis. Out of our 30 French operators just a couple of years ago, only half are still operational today. But if we were to implement stricter payment terms, then we would be left with only a few. That, unfortunately, also applies to our foreign clients. Nevertheless, regardless of the result, it will not have any serious impact on the company in medium-range terms. [AIR & COSMOS] Are you going to continue to cut jobs? Is the establishment in La Courneuve threatened? [Bigay] In 1994, we will have to tackle the situation by temporary measures without touching our organizational structure. If we should have to cut our personnel force once again significantly at Eurocopter France, then the existence of the two establishments would be in doubt. But that is no longer the case today. [AIR & COSMOS] DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] is being restructured. Are these measures going to affect Eurocopter Deutschland? [Bigay] Eurocopter Deutschland is managed independently of DASA. As for Airbus production, which was assigned to us, we have a commitment on the part of DASA stipulating that this production effort will continue to be handled through ECD [Eurocopter Germany] until Tigre and NH-90 start coming off the assembly line. [AIR & COSMOS] What about your cooperation with the Russians? [Bigay] The difficulty with our Russian friends does not spring from any lack of new ideas. They have what it takes to build all kinds of helicopters. The difficulty resides in putting together a viable industrial structure, that is to say, financing their investments on the basis of series-production and customer service. As of today, we cannot see any significant development with our partners. Their technological capacity and their imagination when it comes to getting into a program cannot be doubted. They will have cleared a decisive hurdle the moment they are capable of organizing an industrial helicopter company with a complete economic cycle. I cannot see any sense in multiplying our alliances with the Russians today. 17 Cougar Helicopters for the Netherlands They finally dropped the other shoe. The Dutch Air Force (RNLAF) or, more precisely, the future Mobile Brigade of the Netherlands will be equipped with AS 532 U2 Cougar MkII helicopters as of 1996. The contract is worth about 1.4 billion francs [Fr] and calls for the delivery of 17 craft; it was signed this Friday, 29 Oct 93, by Ton Frinking, secretary of state for defense of the Netherlands, and Jean-Francois Bigay, president of Eurocopter. The deliveries will be spread out from January 1996 until the middle of 1997. This contract includes a big industrial cooperation program accounting for 120% of the sales figure. These compensations will be spread out over 12 years and will, in particular, relate to the involvement of Dutch industry in the manufacture of Cougar, in the development of elements intended for the Tigre, EC 120, and EC 135 programs, but also a boost in Dutch participation in the NH-90 program (currently handled to the extent of 26.9% by Agusta, 24% by ECD, 42.4% by ECF [Eurocopter France], and 6.7% by Fokker). Beyond these helicopter activities, the program also calls for technology transfers, subcontracting, and miscellaneous aeronautical purchases, plus related high-tech activities (cars, shipping, chemistry, etc.).
