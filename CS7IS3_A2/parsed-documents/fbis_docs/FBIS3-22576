Debbache: "Sour El-Ghozlane: 67 Typhoid Cases Confirmed"] [Text] In the last two weeks, public health authorities in Sour El-Ghozlane have reported numerous cases of typhoid. Out of more than 80 reported cases, 67 have been confirmed by laboratory analysis, and these alone are enough to constitute a veritable epidemic -- to the great distress of local inhabitants, some of whom are close to panic. The first case was reported on 27 December 1993. To deal with the situation, public health workers have mobilized personnel and equipment resources commensurate with the threat. Two wards -- one for men and the other for women -- have been reserved on the third floor of the hospital, under strict isolation procedures. The pediatric ward is overcrowded and looks more like a day nursery than a hospital ward, but the important thing is that tests and proper care are being administered. The hardest part is still ahead, because if wider contagion is to be prevented, the source of contamination will have to be identified and eliminated. Some observers blame the poor water treatment facilities, others the decrepit state of water mains vulnerable to contamination from waste water, while still others point to the whey sold in the street in plastic containers exposed to the open air. In any case, and as a preventive measure, the sale of whey in plastic sacks has been suspended temporarily, while the churns used by small producers to make the whey have been idled. In addition to identification and eventual elimination of the loci of contamination, an extensive vaccination drive has been launched at the community and even the family level. Visits have been paid to Dachemia and Bordj Okhris, where suspected cases have been reported. Also, with the appearance of diphtheria cases in the wilaya, steps have been taken to arrest this scourge. It should be noted that the reappearance of diphtheria after its eradication more than 15 years ago signals a certain fall-off in the vaccination program. All of which serves to emphasize the high priority that must be given to dissemination of information and to general public awareness campaigns. Also, we noted during our visit the large number of medical personnel on hand, including Dr. Garti himself.
