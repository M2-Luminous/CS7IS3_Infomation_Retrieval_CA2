This was a directive issued yesterday by Kibondo District Commissioner (Thomas Kingi), when he was explaining to refugees at (Kamomba) Camp that they are required to respect all of this country's laws when they arrive. Ndugu (Kingi) said that the refugees who decide to return to Burundi will be given their weapons back, after they satisfy their respective refugee camp heads that they acquired those weapons legally. The district commissioner also said that refugees who want to go out of their camps and return later, and those who decide to go back to Burundi, should report to the heads of the camps instead of running away. Those found to be violating the law shall be prosecuted.
