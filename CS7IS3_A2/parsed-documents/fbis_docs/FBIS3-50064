Zebic said the government on Sunday adopted the last in a series of measures necessary for launching the economic reform programme which would primarily focus on curbing hyperinflation. The programme for slashing the monster inflation whose monthly rate reached one million percent last December starts with the issuing of the new convertible dinar with 100-percent gold and hard currency backing. Other measures include a radical reduction of the primary issue and an increase in production geared for the market made almost non-existent after many companies withdrew their products from the market because of hyperinflation. Economic expert Dragoslav Avramovic, the chief architect of Yugoslavia's stabilization programme, said that the package did not envisage wage or price freezes and that the state could opt for such measures only in a very limited number of cases.
