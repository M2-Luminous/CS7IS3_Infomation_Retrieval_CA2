FR941206-0-00208 FR941206-0-00019 (A) Visually inspect the tank as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section at least every 5 years; or (B) Visually inspect the tank as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. (iv) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes, and sleeve seals (if any) each time the tank is emptied and degassed. If the internal floating roof has defects; the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric; or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric; or the gaskets no longer close off the waste surfaces from the atmosphere; or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the tank with waste. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of tanks conducting the annual visual inspection as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and at intervals no greater than 5 years in the case of tanks specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. (v) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each tank for which an inspection is required by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section to afford the Regional Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Regional Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the tank. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification, including the written documentation, may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Regional Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling. (2) After installation, the owner or operator of an external floating roof shall: (i) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the wall of the tank and between the secondary seal and the wall of the tank according to the following frequency: (A) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the tank or within 60 days of the initial fill with waste and at least once every 5 years thereafter. (B) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with waste and at least once per year thereafter. (C) If any tank ceases to hold waste for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of waste into the tank shall be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section. (ii) Determine the gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures: (A) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports. (B) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in each place where a 0.32-cm diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the tank and measure the circumferential distance of each such location. (C) Determine the total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
