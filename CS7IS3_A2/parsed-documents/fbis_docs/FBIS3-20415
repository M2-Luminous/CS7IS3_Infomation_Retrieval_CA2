Bustling brokers even more frequently shout at the telephone, "cocoa, buy three; coffee, trim!".... And in the hall, one tense heart after another repeatedly stews over the fact that whether the "10,000 dollar words `buy' and `sell'" make a profit or a loss all depends on making a prompt decision. In the blink of an eye, some people become suddenly wealthy or fall into poverty. This is the current futures exchange, full of challenge, stimulation, and risk. So-called futures, are the opposite concept from spot transactions. In spot transactions, one side hands over money and the other side hands over merchandise with the object of acquiring the ownership or use of the commodity. Futures transactions are a type of business with advance payment and the transfer of merchandise after a certain period. In this, the commodities themselves by no means enter the futures market. What are exchanged are only what are commonly called futures long-term forward contracts. In futures exchanges the vast majority of investments are by no means for buying and selling commodities, but for transferring profits or shifting risks in price changes through agreements. So, futures exchanges have a strong speculative flavor. But this is legal speculation. Some experts have predicted that futures exchanges will become the most attractive current new investment hot point. I. Unstoppable Tide In a bumper harvest season more than 100 years ago, farm owners from the southern United States overjoyed drove wagons full of corn and wheat to Chicago prepared to sell it. But the city was full of sellers and supply far exceeded demand. They could only anxiously watch the prices of agricultural products fall sharply. But a few months later, by the spring and summer seasons of the following year, when there was a temporary shortage, grain prices again rebounded and skyrocketed. Watching the market changed by a strange combination of circumstances, these farm owners could only despair and sigh. But astute American businessmen took inspiration from this and in 1848 proposed the formation of a brand new orderly managed market---the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Here buyers and sellers traded fairly, and agreed on long-term forward contracts. Buyers and sellers agreed on the price at the time of the exchange and determined that after a year or several months at a designated point to buy up or sell off a specified amount of a certain type of agricultural product. The prices fluctuated up and down with changes in the seasons and the markets, and contracts could be transferred. That day they discovered the embryonic early stage of the futures exchange. Now it has become the world's largest futures exchange. People can see the top of the building like the Roman goddess Cereus soliciting grain and bumper harvests. More than 100 years later, with the market's enormous strength and economic demand, more than 80 nations have now established futures markets linked to the United States. Futures exchanges are approaching 100 and more than 100 types of commodities are exchanged on the market. Among them are mainly agricultural products, grains, cotton, cocoa, and rubber, as well as metals. Since the 1970s, formerly popular material commodities such as grains and metals have gradually withdrawn to a secondary position and such financial products as gold, currency, and stocks and securities have extremely actively poured into the commodities futures exchanges. There are numerous types of financial futures, the same things in different guises. Receiving the market's favor, they become major futures commodities. In the United States, futures exchanges are extremely mature. In 1993 when a Nobel prize-winning economist learned that the prize that he would be receiving in a few months would be in Swiss francs, his first reaction was that at that time the comparative value of the Swiss franc was constantly declining and the prize money that he would receive in three months would no longer be the present amount. So, he immediately instructed the futures market to sell off Swiss francs and buy up United States dollars, thereby compensating in futures for his cash losses. II. Futures Fever Quietly "Lands" Perhaps it is a historical coincidence that in 1848 when European communists were issuing their political manifesto, United States farm owners were organizing the world's first futures exchange---the Chicago Grain Futures Exchange. Today, after nearly 150 years of change, the communist struggle and market economy development are constantly blending, as reflected in China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping on his southern tour affirmed the socialist market economy and the unrelenting surge of the commercial tide, the frequent hot points, the tempestuous stocks, the unabated real estate investment fever, and the futures exchange quietly landed on the mainland. Its ardor overwhelms people far more than stock and real estate investment trends. But futures exchanges appeared in Shanghai, China, as early as the 1930s and 1940s. But the planning system formulated for several decades caused the Chinese to have no reason for such things as futures and stocks for more than thirty years after New China was established. This must be said to be an historical pity. By the 1980s, China's economy had grown by leaps and bounds, laying a firm foundation for "restoring the position of futures." Especially with reform and opening up, China clearly proposed the socialist market economy theory and the scope of market adjustment in the overall economic life expanded more and more. With the supply and demand of some commodities such as grain, live hogs, steel, and coal, sometimes tight and sometimes relaxed, and prices suddenly rising and suddenly falling, it brought extreme risk to the vast majority of farmers and business people. Rising and falling of the comparative values of foreign exchange brought even greater risks to Chinese enterprises. So, futures could effectively avoid or lessen these risks. For example, in 1985 U.S.$1 could be exchanged for 3.42 German marks. In 1993 U.S.$1 could only be exchanged for 1.68 German marks. If mainland enterprises exported to Germany at the quoted price of the U.S. dollar, it would mean that half the value would be lost to the 50 percent exchange advantage of German merchants. If at this time the mainland enterprises bought up mark futures at the same time as they made the exports, they could be used as a countermeasure to avoid the risk of devaluation of the U.S. dollar, compensating for the foreign exchange losses in the exports on the futures market. So, in 1987 Mr. Yang Ching-yu [2799 4552 5038] from Hong Kong, in accordance with the development and characteristics of the Chinese market, proposed "the development of a futures market" to relevant mainland leaders. At the beginning of 1988, the State Council Development Research Center established a Futures Market Policy Research Group. In October 1990, the first commodity exchange market in New China with futures characteristics, the Zhengzhou Wholesale Grain Market, opened. In March 1991, that market signed the first long-term forward contract for which it did not receive wheat, suddenly opening the curtain on Chinese futures exchanges. After that, futures companies sprang up all over like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. According to incomplete statistics, China presently has more than 360 futures companies and more than forty futures exchanges. In addition, there still are a considerable number of "underground futures brokers." Unconsciously, a futures fever gradually rose in the economic life. Especially with the first wave, foreign exchange markets cooling, real estate sliding, and the fascination with the stockmarket lowered, the opening and development of the futures market seemed to find an avenue for the funds withdrawn from the stockmarket and the real estate and foreign exchange markets. Some people even chanted slogans like, "One hundred thousand yuan households set up individual enterprises, million yuan households open companies, 10 million yuan households speculate on stocks, and 1 trillion yuan households engage in futures." Although the saying is a little fantastic, the futures market has temporarily exploded. Especially after China enters the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the market will open to the world and mainland enterprises will truly enter international circles. Opportunities for economic development will be numerous for persons in charge of the government economy and enterprises, but risk factors also will be great. So, whether from the perspective of developing the national economy or abiding by the laws of the market economy, cultivation and development of the futures market is an inevitable trend. III. Playing Makes the Heart "Jump" Last year from 26 February to 5 April, the quotation for red bean [ormosia] futures quotation dropped abruptly 3,150 points on the Tokyo grain exhange. The information was that worldwide, during this period, people lost a total of more than U.S.$700 million on this variety. A number of investors took deep losses. This is just one of the most recent examples among unpredictable futures market risks. In doing business, there are profits and losses, and with futures exchanges, there is even more of this. Transferring risks and acquiring investment profits coexist. The money itself does not propagate. If there are profits, there must be losses. It is nothing more than bills changing pockets. If decisionmaking is accurate, someone can make a large profit. If decisionmaking is faulty, the risk naturally could fall on one's own head, and it is difficult to avoid losses. The futures market can be summarized as half profits and half losses. Strictly speaking, the losses are greater than the profits, because the brokers take some in commissions. Regarding U.S. futures exchanges, losses generally make up about 80 percent of the business. Only those large companies and people with ample experience can make money. China's futures business has just begun. The vast majority of brokers still cannot measure up to the masters on international futures markets in skill and experience. So, it could be inevitable that there be greater loss of money on the part of investors. Last April nearly 180 customers played the Tokyo April red bean futures market through the Nanjing Jinzhongfu [6855 0022 1381] International Futures Corporation. As a result, 90 percent of the customers were trapped. After the recognized losses were trimmed, total customer losses were figured at about 35 million renminbi, causing more than 100 customers to be impacted by the "Jinzhongfu" incident and shocking the whole country. Although there are a great many reasons for this, one can clearly see the great risk of futures. But as a mature investment tool, futures exchanges have the capability of "getting a thousand jin for four taels" [getting much for little]. Investors often need only pay 5 percent to 10 percent cash deposit and they can transact business worth scores more than their money. Exchange regulations of the Shenzhen Nonferrous Metal Exchange (SME) even specify earnest money at only 3 percent of the value of the transaction. If traders are speculating on the rise and fall of prices, unlike people engaged in spot transactions, they need not even consider such diverse procedures as storage, transport, and settlement. "Using a little to gain much" even more provides investors with the opportunity to acquire high profits. But high profits must have high risks. Small fluctuations in market prices are enough to cause investors' profit and loss rates to reach several tens percent or even several hundred percent. But for those who are bold enough to brave the risks, can endure enormous mental pressure, and attempt to get rich quickly, this is an enticing and challenging paradise. Although futures have more or less been carried off to the dustbin of history, they have after all come to us and they will inevitably be looked upon favorably by more and more investors.
