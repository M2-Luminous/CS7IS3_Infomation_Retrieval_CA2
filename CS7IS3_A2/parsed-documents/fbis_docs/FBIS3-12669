Sources close to international financial organizations who follow changes in Iran have confirmed these reports. They say the relatively old phenomenon of capital fleeing from this country has taken on unprecedented proportions in recent months. At the European headquarters of the World Bank in Paris, a high-ranking official who did not want to be identified told KEYHAN (published in London) that according to the latest assessment by this organization, in the year 1993 about $8 billion in capital left Iran in various forms. The same official disclosed that World Bank delegates recently submitted the results of their assessment of this matter in Tehran. Six members of the World Bank met with Morteza Mohammad-Khani, minister of economic and financial affairs. This meeting was attended by Daniel [?Pupay], director of World Bank cooperation with Morocco and Iran. Why The Flight of Capital? So far spokesmen for the Islamic Republic government have treated the flight of capital as a normal phenomenon and have attributed its increase in the years since the revolution to the ill will of those affiliated with the monarchy regime and to the consequences of the war. In its issue of 17 Mehr 1372 [9 October 1993], the newspaper RESALAT wrote: Based on the estimates that were made, the volume of capital leaving Iran between the years 1352 [21 March 1973- 20 March 1974] and 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] was more than $27 billion, or about $2 billion per year. The peak was in the years 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] to 1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], when agents and affiliates of the former regime played the basic role. However, the end of the war and the beginning of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policy of "reform" was only able to halt temporarily the massive flight of capital from Iran. This halt ended months ago and has resumed at a more rapid rate with the weakened position of those who supported "economic adjustment" and the terror of the economic crisis. In the view of foreign and domestic experts, the expedited flight of capital is caused by four factors, the decline in value of the rial, increased insecurity for investors, disorder in economic policy making, and Iran's increased foreign debt. 1. The drop in value of the rial: Heightening inflation and the irresistible erosion of the value of Iran's national currency against international currencies is one of the main reasons for the flight of capital. In view of the nation's empty foreign exchange stocks, the drop in the price of oil, factory shutdowns and the unprecedented increase in the demand for foreign exchange, Iranian public opinion is convinced that the price of the dollar on the free market, which is already hovering around 212 tomans, will not remain at its current level and that the rial will continue to fall (late in the week a report was received that the price of the dollar on the Tehran foreign exchange market reached 219 tomans). The long-term outlook for Iran's national currency is especially dark in view of the fact that all the Islamic Republic's experts expect a significant increase in the inflation rate in the coming months. 'Ali Taqi-Khamushi, deputy from Tehran and chief of the Iran Chamber of Commerce and Industries, recently discussed the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. He said: Unfortunately, this budget includes inflation of 50 to 60 percent. 2. Increased insecurity for investors: They have compared capital to a bird that lands only in a secure environment and flees as soon as it senses danger. Since the time of the revolution of 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the Islamic Republic has never been able to encourage Iran's capital to participate actively in the task of the nation's economic reconstruction. In the insecure atmosphere the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult has created in Iran, capital has been either going into short-term profitable activities such as brokering and speculating, or it has been going to foreign countries at any price. 3. Disorder in economic policymaking: The lack of any kind of specific economic policy, the war between factions over directions for development and continuous changes in choices have made investors despair concerning the future and persuaded them either to leave their capital inactive or send it out of the country. In the last year, following the paralysis of the nation's economic leadership apparatus and the crisis in the policy of "economic adjustment," there has been a vast wave of confusion in Iran's economic and financial circles and confidence in the future has been severely shaken. 4. Increased foreign debt: The experience of Third World debtor nations, especially in Latin America, shows that there is a close relationship between increased foreign debt on the one hand and the rapid flight of capital on the other unless the indebtedness can be used in the framework of a specific and constructive economic strategy to strengthen industrial foundations. Iran's foreign debt, as we know, is one of the worst kinds of debt a country can have, because it has been used to import consumer goods. Moreover, because of its nature (taking the form of usance), it comes at very high interest. Increased foreign debt in a country like Iran is indicative of even greater instability in its political and economic positions and for this reason has made the atmosphere even more insecure for investors, and it increases the illegal flight of capital. Consequences of Capital Flight Iranian capital makes its way abroad in various ways: In the form of cash in the transfer of foreign exchange, through manipulation in the prices of export or import goods, and other means. For example, exporters can show the amount of foreign exchange earned from their exports to be less than it is and they can keep the difference between the real foreign exchange and the amount declared abroad. Likewise, importers may negotiate with foreign companies to show the foreign exchange needed to be greater than it actually is and keep the difference abroad. The flight of capital, in whatever form it takes, is very costly to Iran's economy. The consequences can be summarized as follows: - A significant portion of the nation's domestic savings is transferred abroad instead of being used in economic circuits. - The portion of incomes subject to taxes is reduced, and since the government's revenues also decreases, a significant share of the tax burden falls on the weak classes. - It increases the demand for foreign exchange and for this reason the fall of the rial against foreign currencies is precipitated. - It decreases the resources needed for domestic investment and drives the country to borrowing on the international financial markets, thereby increasing the nation's foreign debt. Economic experts say the only way to combat the flight of capital is to create a secure atmosphere, restore the overall economy to soundness and put producing units into operation. Legal restraints in this regard are not that effective. The Search for Capital The flight of $8 billion in capital in one year is taking place at a time when Iran is faced with an unprecedented drop in foreign exchange. On Tuesday 12 Bahman [1 January] Hasan Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, said in the province of Semnan that due to the drop in the price of oil Iran has suffered a $4 billion revenue loss in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. He added that during the First Five-Year Plan Iran lost $6.4 billion in foreign exchange due to fluctuations in the price of the dollar against other currencies. Rowhani said: We sell oil in dollars, but our purchases are recognized in pounds, yens, marks, and other currencies. The foreign exchange shortage has halted many of the Islamic Republic's development programs. Even development projects in the nation's oil regions in the Persian Gulf have stopped. The newspaper SALAM's correspondent in the oil regions of the Persian Gulf reports that the development projects in the nation's oil regions in these areas have been stopped by the government because of the failure to allocate sufficient credits, and Iran's shared gas reserves are being drained by nations in the Persian Gulf. On Sunday 11 Bahman [31 December] Engineer 'Abbas Vakil, chief of the Lavan oil district, said: Due to the failure to allocate credits and to make suitable investments to develop the Dalan-Kangan (Khuf) gas field that is shared by Iran and Abu Dhabi, this project has stopped. There is no gas exploitation or development being done by Iran, and the Abu Dhabi government is using advanced techniques to produce and extract the shared gas from this field. Engineer 'Abbas Vakil emphasized the need for Iran to invest in activity and exploitation in this gas field. He said: The Khuf gas field has been in use by the government of Abu Dhabi for three to four years. The Khuf gas field is in the lower layer of the Mosalman gas field, 150 km from Lavan Island. The severe shortage of foreign exchange and the halting of many development projects has persuaded the Islamic Republic's officials again to seek foreign investment. Morteza Mohammad Khan, the Islamic Republic's minister of economic and financial affairs, recently met with Rafi' al-Din Ahmad, executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and told him: "Economic and legal conditions are favorable in Iran for attracting and supporting foreign investment." Mohammad Khan is inviting foreigners to invest in the Islamic Republic at a time when the uproar of opposition to Coca-ola has provoked very negative reactions outside Iran. Recently Mohsen Rafiqdust, supervisor of the Foundation for War Veterans and the Oppressed, said: We will remove the American Coca-ola company from Iran. In its 5 Bahman article [25 December], writing in this same vein, the newspaper SALAM published an article quoting one of its readers: The question that comes to my mind is, this company (Coca-ola) has invested and started a factory with lawful authorization, and all the public officials have witnessed its activities and advertising. Now why all of a sudden is there all this commotion about removing it? A reader of SALAM--or perhaps the newspaper's editorial board preferred to have this said in the words of a "reader"--wrote in answer to the above question: "Zarifi said that this company, associated with world-devouring America, has created problems in the field of competition for domestic producers affiliated with the Foundation for the Oppressed and War Veterans. Therefore, the chief of this foundation's very serious opposition is not without its points!" Of course, to obtain his reward in the hereafter, it is useful for him to invoke the war against the cultural invasion. In any case, this measure by Mr.Mohsen Rafiqdust shows to what extent the public atmosphere in Iran is ready to protect Iranian investments and to attract foreign investments.
