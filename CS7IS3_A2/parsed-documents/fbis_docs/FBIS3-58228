At the same time, they want to strengthen the West European pillar of the alliance. In a final communique of the conference, the draft of which is available to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the delegations will agree on the following formula: "We expect and would welcome an expansion of NATO toward the democratic states east of us in an evolutionary process that would take into consideration the security-political development in Europe." In a first step, the alliance will offer the East European states political and military cooperation under the formula Partnership for Peace. The heads of state and government and the foreign ministers of the 16 NATO states will meet in Brussels for a two-day meeting today. According to the agenda, the declaration Partnership for Peace is to be adopted on the first day, and a final communique on the second. Both documents have largely been completed after weeks of negotiations. Some particularly controversial issues -- the financing of Partnership for Peace, for example -- are still unsettled. The Partnership for Peace declaration states that NATO will remain open for other states "that are in a position to promote the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic territory." First of all, however, the Partnership program will be adopted to allow the development of a new "security relationship." "Active participation in the Partnership for Peace program will play a significant role in the evolutionary process of NATO expansion," the declaration reads. The states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and other CSCE countries have been invited to participate. NATO bodies will decide on the election of the partners. NATO promises that consultation will be held with every participant in the program if its "territorial integrity, political independence, or security are in peril." It is still unclear whether the individual partners in the program can ask NATO for consultations or whether the alliance has to take the first step. The communique stipulates that the East European partners themselves will decide to what extent they want to reveal their defense budgets, to what extent they subject their defense ministries to democratic control, and whether they want to participate in joint exercises and plannings. NATO wants to carry out joint exercises for peacekeeping missions with all partners in the program as early as this year. Under the headline "European Security and Defense Identity," the final declaration stresses the need for a close link between NATO and the Western European Union [WEU], the defense organization of the European Union. The individual NATO bodies are requested to draft new political and military structures with which NATO can react in a more flexible manner to crises. NATO wants to strengthen the WEU as its European pillar. The military command and task forces of the WEU should be organized in a module system. They should be "separable" but not develop separate structures. The name of the task force is the Combined Joint Task Force. It will consist of army, air force, and naval units of several member states of the WEU and other nations. It is conceivable to also integrate troops from East European states -- for peacekeeping measures of the CSCE, for example. Concerning the chapter "Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction," the negotiators failed to adopt the far-reaching demands of the United States. A working group is to be established that will draft a consistent NATO policy and improve the existing measures against the proliferation of the weapons. It is not clear yet, for example, in what way NATO should become active in preventing proliferation and whether -- this would be the most far-reaching scenario -- it may carry out punitive expeditions to destroy these weapons. When preparing for the meeting, a dispute apparently erupted as to whether the alliance will comment on the renewal of the Nonproliferation Treaty on nuclear weapons. The treaty will expire in 1995. The draft of the final communique contains the following sentence: "We are determined to achieve the unlimited and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty at the 1995 conference." According to reports, some delegations successfully insisted on eliminating the sentence from the communique.
