While the president expresses understanding for the growing need to increase the number of Blue Helmets, without which the agreements that have been reached could not be implemented, he points out that there is an even greater risk if soldiers from any Balkan country participate in the Blue Helmets. President Zhelev expresses confidence that the UN general secretary is aware of this danger and will continue his efforts to seek an appropriate solution on the part of the world organization. The Bulgarian president recalls that since the beginning of the crisis Bulgaria has repeatedly declared that it will not take advantage of the situation and will not participate in any military way in the events in former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria also appealed to the other neighboring Balkan states to do the same. The president also recalls the strict observance of the UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, and stresses that, despite its great losses and difficulties, Bulgaria will continue to follow this policy.
