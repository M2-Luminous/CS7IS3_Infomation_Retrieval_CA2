Speaking on this subject at the Walloon Enterprises Union (UWE), Robert Urbain, minister of foreign trade and European affairs, listed the positive aspects. He highlighted four from a European viewpoint: "The growth incentives proposed in the white paper with regard to competitiveness and employment will be substantially increased," he stressed. Indeed, the OECD thinks that the liberalizing effect of a general reduction in tariffs will lead to an increase in the level of prosperity in the world equivalent to $270 billion for the year 2002. "The legal guarantees have been strengthened: The multilateral rules bring clarity and certainty to trade, while restraining unilateral tendencies. "The service sector which represents 60 percent of European GNP is subjected to multilateral regulation for the first time; the liberalization of services within the General Agreement on Trade in Services will facilitate the expansion in this sector. "Intellectual property is protected thanks to the Uruguay Round. The Commission estimates the shortfall suffered by industry in the European Union through violations of royalties at ECU2.6 billion. In addition to this there is the forging of trademarks, violations of patents, and so forth. Our high technology industry can only benefit from better protection in this sphere." As for the impact on the Belgian economy in particular, it seems promising because of the importance which foreign trade has for our GNP: "More than 60 percent of our GNP depends directly on foreign trade, whereas this figure varies between 20 and 25 percent for most other industrialized countries." Case Study Referring to the international flow of investments and their effects on employment, Robert Urbain warned against simplistic or glib ideas. This is a direct allusion to the debate on relocation which he refuses to avoid but which requires a degree of intellectual caution. "When a foreign enterprise is established in Europe, it creates jobs. However, it is important to see whether the production unit thus created does not replace local enterprises which will have to reduce their production. Let us bear in mind the transplanted Japanese automobile manufacturing factories: Their production competes directly with that of the European manufacturers." The minister, an expert in case studies, then reversed the observation: "When a European enterprise creates subsidiaries abroad, it does not necessarily reduce employment on the Old Continent. For instance, when Belgian enterprises like Jansen Pharma and Bell Telephone create joint ventures in China, and when they are ranked first and second, that boosts Belgium's reputation on the Asian markets and not only generates exports in their own sector but also creates business opportunities for other enterprises and other national sectors." Social Clause and Fair Trade Having said that, Urbain does not deny that the ferocity of international competition and the big disparities in production costs might prompt European enterprises to relocate to Asia, North Africa, or East Europe. "The government is aware of this problem," he stressed, while immediately noting that it must be tackled at the level of the European Union's trade policy, without ruling out its implications at the level of GATT and the future World Trade Organization (WTO, which will be established on 1 January 1995). What is the solution...? The minister referred to the suggestion to introduce a social clause: "In this sphere, many preliminary points will have to be resolved, like a definition of the fundamental social rights, the means of incorporating a social clause into agreements with third countries, the means of monitoring respect for this clause and punishing failure to respect it." In the absence of the textbook case in which production conditions would be comparable throughout the world, free trade, pure and simple, is impossible, Robert Urbain also said. Hence his plea, instead of this, for a combination of "free trade" and "fair trade." And he concluded with an appeal to continue the efforts. The result of the Uruguay Round "does not mean that the work is over." Belgium, like Europe, must pay more attention to the competitiveness of its economy in a more open world economy (and in particular stimulate high-level research and development), "multilateral negotiations must be furthered, especially as regards the link between trade and environment, and between trade and social rights."
