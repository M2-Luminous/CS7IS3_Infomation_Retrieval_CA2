FR940105-2-00073 FR940105-2-00033 [Docket Nos. AB&hyph;32 and AB&hyph;355 (Sub-Nos. 61X and 13X)] Boston and Maine Corporation_Abandonment Exemption_New Haven County, CT; Springfield Terminal Railway Company_Discontinuance of Service Exemption_New Haven County, CT Boston and Maine Corporation (B&M) and Springfield Terminal Railway Company (ST) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances to abandon and discontinue service over a segment of B&M's Dublin Street Track line of railroad between milepost 17.29 and milepost 19.86, a distance of approximately 2.57 miles, in Waterbury, New Haven County, CT. B&M seeks authority to abandon the line, and ST, which leases the line from B&M, seeks authority to discontinue service over the line. B&M and ST certify that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic, if any, has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment or discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on February 4, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 3 must be filed by January 18, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by January 25, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Energy and Environment in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit this Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicants' representative: Kevin J. O'Connell, Esq., Law Department, Iron Horse Park, North Billerica, MA 01862. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. B&M and ST have filed an environmental report which addresses the effect, if any, of the abandonment and the discontinuance on the environmental and historic resources. The Section of Energy and Environment (SEE) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by January 10, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEE (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEE, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: December 27, 1993. By the Commission, Julia M. Farr, Acting Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;172 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
