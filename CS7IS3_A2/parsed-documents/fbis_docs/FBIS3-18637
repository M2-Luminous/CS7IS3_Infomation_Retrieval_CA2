Italy will be going to the polls in three weeks' time. It is going through an incredible period. [passage omitted] Silvio Berlusconi, good evening. [Berlusconi] Good evening to you. [Sinclair] We are recording this program on Friday evening [4 March] in Milan because you will be campaigning throughout the country tomorrow and on Sunday. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] If you come to power, do you intend to sell your group? Will such private interests be compatible with the responsibilities of a prime minister, a European prime minister? [Berlusconi] Is TF1 interested in buying us up? [laughs] [Sinclair] I don't think so. This is a serious question. Is it possible to be a prime minister and to have so many private interests? [Berlusconi] It must be pointed out that, if we, as a political party, are responsible for setting up a government, it is obvious that it will not be possible to submit to my judgment or ask me to intervene in any problem likely to concern my group directly or indirectly. [Sinclair] I did not mean the daily management of your group. It is obvious that if you are the prime minister, you will not manage Fininvest, your group, directly. My question was a question in principle: Is it possible today to be a major private entrepreneur, to have one's own private capital and govern a leading country? [Berlusconi] There have already been precedents. I know what is happening in the United States, for example. There, it is provided by law that, when someone has responsibilities within a government, political responsibilities, this person must resign from all posts in their group and distance themselves from the decisions regarding the group. I think that we may go in that direction. I also believe that we may sell most or all of the group's stakes if need be. But it is a prerequisite for me to be given responsibilities within the government, really. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] Earlier you mentioned the National Alliance -- everyone has adopted new names for these elections -- it was called the MSI [Italian Social Movement] not so long ago and they were known as Neo-Fascists. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, who lost in the last Rome elections -- you gave him your support at the time -- is calling himself a post-Fascist. Isn't it a problem to be allied with a party in which Alessandra Mussolini is invoking her grandfather, a party that put cassettes of the Duce on sale at its last meeting? Didn't you demand a public renunciation from them? [Berlusconi] This does not correspond to reality. Adversaries gave this picture of this party. [Sinclair] Bossi himself said that Fini was a Fascist. [Berlusconi] It was an election speech, it must be understood that he needs to reassure his supporters, to find other positions and an identity. I believe that the French must be told that Mr. Fini is no more on the right than Mr. Chirac is in France. [passage omitted] [Sinclair] The former Yugoslavia has a frontier with Italy, so it is a subject that is of great concern to you, and we don't know at all what you think about it. I suppose that like all Europeans you supported the ultimatum? [Berlusconi] Certainly. I would only say that we waited too long. There was a degree of over-caution in Europe about intervening like this and about setting the ultimatum. I think France was right, and Italy too, but we should have done it earlier. [Sinclair] General Cot, who commands the UN forces throughout the former Yugoslavia, is demanding to be sent extra troops urgently, because they not only have to act as buffer between belligerents, but also to occupy and guard the protected zones. [Berlusconi] I think Europe should take on more responsibility here, because today we have a situation that is somewhat dangerous, with America supporting the Croat-Muslim confederation, and Russia supporting Serbia. We have let two non-European countries into the Mediterranean, allowed them to get involved in a problem that affects us, a problem that belongs to us. I think Europe should in the future be more involved, and make more resolute interventions. [Sinclair] If you head the government tomorrow, you would take the initiative on this? [Berlusconi] I have said several times that all the foreign ministers should be brought together to discuss this burning question. [Sinclair] That is often done. [Berlusconi] Yes, but permanently. To make decisions with more courage. [Sinclair] Unfortunately, Europe does not yet have a foreign policy nor a defense policy. You are a convinced European, a convinced Maastricht man. You think that is the right way forward? [Berlusconi] Certainly. I am convinced that Europe also has to be enlarged and opened up to all the countries of East Europe. [Sinclair] Opened up to all the countries of East Europe, but aren't you afraid that too great an economic disparity might drive a wedge through the homogeneity of the European Twelve? [Berlusconi] No, we have systems to give the countries of the Treaty of Rome greater weight. But I think that if Europe wants to face up to the other world powers, it must be strong and be truly representative of European geography. [passage omitted]
