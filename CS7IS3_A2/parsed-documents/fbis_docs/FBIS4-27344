Marubeni will cooperate with SIDANCO from delivery of machinery and facilities for drilling and refining to capital procurement and overseas expansion. In the future, they also will consider investment. The Russian Government has the idea of cultivating major domestic firms into [international] majors (international oil capital). Marubeni's plan is to ensure an oil supply base for Japan through this tieup. SIDANCO was just established on 5 May. Eight oil production, transport, and refining companies with Tyumen Province of Western Siberia as a home base and the Russian government have jointly financed it. The crude oil production capability of the group is 700,000 barrels a day. Their scale follows Rosnefte and Look [as transliterated] Oil in Russia. In the future, they also are scheduling oil field development in the eastern part of Russia such as Eastern Siberia and the Far East, and expansion to China and Vietnam as well. Marubeni has made a tieup with a U.S. oil company, Anglo-Swiss (Houston, Texas), which has a record of establishing joint-venture firms with Russia. Besides cooperating in order to bring financing from Japanese Government-affiliated agencies on the development of new mining areas at home and abroad by SIDANCO, they are undertaking the export of pipe. Furthermore, they are prepared to invest in any case since the Russian Government has approved acquisition of up to 15 percent of SIDANCO stock (currently 5 billion yen) by foreign investment. Marubeni views SIDANCO as being able to become a supply source of crude oil and petroleum products for Japan which is close in terms of distance. Currently, two groups, the Japan-U.S.-Europe five-company cartel with Mitsui Corp., and a cartel with U.S. Exxon and Sakhalin Oil Development Cooperation (SODECO), a Japanese Government and privately financed company, are proceeding with a development program off Sahalin, but the possibility has emerged that a new export to Japan project with the participation of Japanese firms will appear.
