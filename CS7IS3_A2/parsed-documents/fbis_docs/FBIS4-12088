The AL-SHARQ daily asked whether the patriarch's homily was "a call to rebellion," adding that if it was, "it would be extremely dangerous." The remarks of Monsignor Sfayr, spiritual leader of the largest Lebanese Christian community, "go against national understanding, while the patriarchate should be the meeting place for all Lebanese," the paper said. Meanwhile, the AL-SAFIR newspaper accused Monsignor Sfayr of saying "things that are pleasing" to supporters of Samir Ja'ja', head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) militia, and General Michel 'Awn, the anti-Syrian former prime minister exiled to France in 1991. Monsignor Sfayr said Friday Christians were living in "anguish and bitterness" because they were not treated "on an equal footing" with Moslems. He charged that Christians did not receive a fair deal in the provision of state jobs and in the protection of property and said Christian leaders had been forced to leave the country. "Christians are not claiming privileges and do not wish to impose their will on anyone. But they want to feel that Lebanon belongs to all its citizens, who enjoy equal rights and responsibilities." Private radio and television stations have been banned from broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele Liban and Radio Liban. The move came as the authorities launched an investigation into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54 others. The authorities accused seven members of the Lebanese Forces of involvement in the attack. They arrested the group's deputy Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF, which formed a political party in 1991. The LF was one of the militias widely held responsible for much of the bloodshed and destruction in Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
