Einseln in his statements recently has called the country's problem military unit, the Laanemaa volunteer infantry company, a "political mob" and has driven parallels between the unit and the Nazi groups in Germany at the beginning of the Hitler era in early 1930's. Einseln, an emigre Estonian and retired U.S. army colonel, who returned to his home country and took over command of the defense forces last spring, has also been publicly critical of the Estonian state and people. The MP's in the statement admit there are lots of problems of a complex character waiting to be resolved in Estonia, including problems in the defense forces and in the sector of the Interior Ministry. "But all this cannot and shouldn't serve as basis for any person in the service of the Estonian state to disdain the Estonian people and the Estonian state," the MP's say. The MP's who signed the statement say Einseln must publicly bring his excuses or an explanation of a possible misinterpretation of his words by the media.
