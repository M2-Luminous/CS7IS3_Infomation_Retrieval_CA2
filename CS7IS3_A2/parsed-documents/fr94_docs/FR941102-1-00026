FR941102-1-00026 FR941102-1-00006 Uniform decertification procedures would provide another approach for MSHA to direct a change in the actions and attitudes of certified and qualified persons who do not comply with health and safety regulations. Temporary or permanent decertification should compel compliance with the law, as decertification could adversely affect that person's livelihood, and in the most severe instances, result in loss of employment. This proposed rule will encourage certified and qualified persons to maintain their level of competence and follow required procedures, by establishing appropriate remedial measures when MSHA identifies a certified or qualified person or an approved instructor who is not fulfilling his or her responsibilities, either deliberately or as the result of accident, oversight, or lack of training. MSHA believes that establishing uniform decertification procedures will ensure that certified and qualified persons fulfill their responsibilities with due regard for compliance with safety and health standards. III. Discussion of Proposed Rule Section 42.1‚ê£Purpose and Scope This part would establish the criteria and procedures for revocation of the authority given to persons to perform certain tasks that must be done by a certified or qualified person, or an approved instructor. In general, temporary or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who either repeatedly exhibit clear disregard for compliance with training, health or safety standards or other relevant regulations, or who commit a particular offense that is evidence of a serious disregard for the health and safety of miners affected by their activities. When evidence indicates that a certified person does not adhere to the required procedures that are necessary to fulfill his or her certified or qualified duties, or has failed to adequately fulfill his or her work responsibilities, the appropriate MSHA district manager would initiate the decertification process. During the course of the decertification process, the district manager would determine if the certified person's actions are intentional or the result of accident, oversight, or lack of training. Based upon the facts in each case, the district manager would decide the appropriate deterrent or remedial measures to be taken, such as those described below. MSHA intends that the agency's district managers would also be able to propose temporary or permanent decertification. The issuance of warning letters, proposal of remedial measures or temporary or permanent decertifications are actions intended to augment existing enforcement policies and procedures. When a certified person fails to adhere to required procedures due to accident, oversight, or lack of training, the district manager would generally issue a warning letter or propose remedial measures, such as additional training. If, after these initial measures are taken, the certified or qualified person continues to disregard proper procedures, MSHA would pursue temporary or permanent decertification.
