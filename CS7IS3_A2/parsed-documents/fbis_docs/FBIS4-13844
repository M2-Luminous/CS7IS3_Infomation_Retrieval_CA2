Mollazadeh: "NATO's Cosmetic Actions"] [Excerpts] The limited strikes by NATO warplanes on some less important Serb positions around the city of Gorazde, strikes in which it is said that only one Serb tank was destroyed, raise the question: Why has NATO resorted to this cosmetic action? If we were to glance at the news reports concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, the answer would not be very difficult to find. Before U.S. airplanes overflew their positions, the Serbs had carried out chemical bombing of Gorazde and the city was on the verge of collapse. [passage omitted] The Muslim people of Gorazde gained nothing from these attacks and the danger of a massacre was not mitigated. Clearly, the Western mass media carried out extensive propaganda on this superficial action, as if to say that it actually halted the Serb advance. The Bosnian president welcomed NATO's action but openly declared that such limited strikes were carried out too late and could not change the course of events. This is worth mulling over. A sovereign country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, a UN member, cannot expect support from the greater powers; it is not in such a position. [passage omitted] Obviously things will continue as they are, as the Serbs will not only continue their aggression, but will also try every means possible to occupy all the Bosnian areas to which they profess historical claims. They will not hesitate to perpetrate greater atrocities, such as using banned chemical weapons. Unfortunately, the world has closed its eyes to such crimes and no sounds of deterrent seem to be emanating from any country. In such circumstances, the Serbs continue their campaign of bloody ethnic cleansing against the Bosnian Muslims. Undoubtedly, limited, ineffective action will not solve the problems of the Muslim defenders of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Bosnian war. With their silence, the international organizations, European countries, the United States, and Russia have extended their tacit consent for the Serbs' atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is tantamount to complicity in these crimes. They cannot shrug off their responsibility with such superficial actions. Limited operations against the Serbs cannot fool the Bosnian Muslims into untimely optimistic conjecture. But since conditions are so difficult for them, they cannot ignore even a glimmer of hope. There is also the theory that NATO carried out these strikes to divert attention from the Serbs' use of chemical weapons against the Bosnian Muslims. This is what happened and the international mass media directed all its attention to reporting on NATO's aerial operations so that people everywhere would have less time to ponder the criminal actions of the Serbs and their chemical bombing of Gorazde. It is not unlikely that the international community's inertia and the indifference by Europe and the United States over using their troops to halt the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina may result in dismembering this country. This will enable the Serbs to achieve their goals. If this occurs, there is no knowing where the Serbs will stop, because they may covet other remaining Muslim territory. The war may spread further in the region and may even continue for an unforeseen period. In the circumstances, will the world move toward unbridled power for some countries and fail to rein in the lust for power of fascist and chauvinist groups? If events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be considered the criterion for judgment, you can state with great regret that the world is facing bleak prospects.
