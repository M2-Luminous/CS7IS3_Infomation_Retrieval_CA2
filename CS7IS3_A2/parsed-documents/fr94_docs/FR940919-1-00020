E&hyph;G99, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The request must be received by the Agency no later than November 9, 1994. The request shall include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. Organizations are requested to bring with them, to the extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each of the areas to be addressed. An organization that has not filed main comments on the rulemaking will not be allowed to participate in the hearing, unless a waiver of this requirement is granted in writing by the Record and Hearing Clerk or the organization is appearing at the request of EPA or under subpoena (40 CFR 750.6(a)). A panel of EPA employees shall preside at the hearing, and one panel member will chair the proceedings. The panel may question any individual or group participating in the hearing on any subject relating to the rulemaking. Opening statements should be brief and restricted to points that could not have been made in main comments, or to emphasize points which are made in main comments, but which the participant believes can be more forcefully urged in the hearing context. Persons in the hearing audience may submit questions in writing for the hearing panel to ask the participants, and the hearing panel may, at their discretion, ask these questions (40 CFR 750.7(a) and (b)). See 40 CFR 750.7(c) for the rule governing the submission of additional material by the hearing participants. After the close of the hearing, any participant in the hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA no later than 1 week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available (to determine when the transcript is available, interested persons should call the number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT ). See 40 CFR 750.8(a) for a description of the information that shall be included in such a request. Interested persons may file reply comments. Reply comments shall be received on or before December 15, 1994, and shall be restricted to comments on: (1) Other comments; (2) material in the hearing record; and (3) material which was not available to the commenting party within a sufficient amount of time before main comments were due on July 8, 1994 (40 CFR 750.4(b)). Extensions of time for filing reply comments may be granted pursuant to 40 CFR 750.4(c). Reply comments and a transcript of the hearing will be placed in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center as part of the rulemaking record for the proposed rule (docket number OPPTS-62134) and will be available for inspection and copying (see TSCA Docket Receipt Office listed under ADDRESSES).
