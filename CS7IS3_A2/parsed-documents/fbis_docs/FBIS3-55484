[Begin recording] [Menagharishvili] The Georgian authorities did everything in their power in order to establish the truth. You know that a special investigatory group has been sent to Samegrelo region, west Georgia, and another investigatory group comprising the representatives of the prosecutor's office, and the Security and Interior Ministries has left together with the representatives of the Chechen authorities for Groznyy. They tried there to meet the witness who, according to the Chechen authorities, had witnessed the fact of Gamsakhurdia's death. Unfortunately, this meeting did not take place and the witness has not said yet where the former president is buried. Our representatives in Chechnya learned only that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's corpse had been buried in a mountainous zone of Samegrelo, approximately in the rayon which is still being controlled by one of the armed groups of his supporters, therefore, the authorities do not yet have a possibility to establish the truth by going to the scene. The official version about the alleged besieging of the former president and his suicide is doubtful to us as during the recent weeks no combat or search operations for finding him have taken place and accordingly, this statement raises serious doubts. The demands which our authorities put to the supporters of the former president are that the supporters officially legalize the burial place of the deceased so that the official authorities have a possibility to establish the truth -- what had happened, and the relevant examination be carried out followed by a traditionally accepted routine. Unfortunately, we have not yet received a positive answer to all these demands and therefore, we have no possibility to tell the public more details. [Unidentified correspondent] If the Georgian authorities in the long run get a positive answer to this demand, and if all these doubts are confirmed, where will Georgia's former president be buried? [Menagharishvili] It has already been officially announced that we are unanimous in thinking that the burial place of the former president, whether he is buried in Tbilisi or somewhere else, must be chosen solely by his family. It has always been a tradition in our society and nobody is going to break this rule. [end recording] [Announcer] Based on Irakli Menagharishvili's words, we shall add that in case of a necessity, the Georgian authorities undertake the responsibility of reburying the corpse, provided that a qualified forensic examination is carried out and that every interested party as well as foreign experts are given a possibility to take part in the examination.
