The Ministry of Foreign Affairs most firmly condemns this criminal and irresponsible action just as it has condemned and continues to condemn any act of violence committed by the forces that oppose the easing of tensions in the Middle East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the hope that, despite this dramatic incident and other attempts to hamper the peace process, the desire by the sides to solve the conflict in this area by political means will continue with the same determination to capitalize on the favorable preconditions offered by the results of the bilateral Arab-Israeli negotiations in Washington, which have led to a mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel and to the signing of the principled declaration of 13 September 1993. By virtue of its traditional relations in that area, Romania reiterates its readiness and interest in supporting the process of achieving peace, understanding, and economic cooperation in the Middle East, the statement by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has been faxed to us, emphasizes in conclusion.
