Meanwhile I am resting." This was said by Russia's bugbear, the Black Specter in politics Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and winner in the latest elections, but he was not telling the truth. Some rest: He travels, sees, meets, makes speeches, shakes his fist in the corridors of the Duma (the Russian parliament), and he gives a few interviews, such as this. [Scaglione] You are about to visit Belgrade. Are you pleased with the document in support of Serbia approved by the new Duma? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, partly because the document stemmed from an initiative on our part. We told Kozyrev (foreign minister -- FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA editor's note) clearly: Unless you adopt a pro-Serbian stance right away, we will make you resign. We have no doubts: We are with the Serbs. [Scaglione] How can the war in the former Yugoslavia be ended? [Zhirinovskiy] It is enough to remove all the foreign armed forces. Let us remove them, then you will see how order will return. [Scaglione] You will be visiting Poland, where you are not much liked. Why? [Zhirinovskiy] I will be visiting Poland, true -- but Slovenia, too -- and I have been to Bulgaria. I am in solidarity with them: We should form a community of Slavic states together, but with no ideology, no pan-Slavism. This is demanded by the compactness of our territories, our customs, our history, and our culture. Be that as it may, the Poles must not be afraid: We are in favor of the inviolability of borders. Unfortunately we are forced to defend ourselves because the West is trying to change ours, despite the accords signed in Helsinki in 1975. [Scaglione] I beg your pardon? [Zhirinovskiy] Those accords envisaged the inviolability of borders in Europe. Why, then, were the Soviet Union's borders changed? Who gave them the right to do that? France cannot be touched. We will not even mention Germany. Only in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union have the borders been changed -- as it so happens, the Slavic countries. These are double standards: How can we be happy with that? There is nothing fascist about it. They call us fascists to denigrate us and to frighten our supporters. They will pay for it: We have sued Yegor Gaydar over this, and have demanded 100 million [currency unspecified] in damages. [Scaglione] Why do you take issue with the West so much? Not long ago you said that Russia needed technology and aid. [Zhirinovskiy] This business of Western aid is just a provocation. Nobody gives us a cent: In fact they only come here to take. This IMF is just an illusion; it does us harm, and that is all. The tide of profiteers will gradually be eliminated: By 1995 we will have thrown them all out, we will have a new government and a new policy. [Scaglione] Is there no European political leader that you respect? [Zhirinovskiy] None. They all hate Russia. But we will get along on our own -- and better. [Scaglione] If it is as you say, why sell so many weapons abroad? To China, for instance? [Zhirinovskiy] We will continue to sell weapons everywhere. Whoever wants to buy will always be welcome. But we will ensure that our weapons do not end up in the hands of those who have aggressive intentions with respect to Russia. So to our neighboring countries we will sell only defensive weapons, while to distant countries we will also sell offensive weapons. [Scaglione] Do you not consider this a harmful attitude for you to take? You are not even allowed to enter Germany. [Zhirinovskiy] This is already the second time that I have been refused a visa. The first time, last year, I organized a picket outside their embassy in Moscow, and after two hours my visa was ready. But that is not the important thing: I will be visiting Spain, Norway, Australia. There are many countries that I still have to visit. In any case, this time the picket was not necessary: My German friends and colleagues organized one outside their Foreign Ministry. Not bad, would you not say? Be that as it may, Germany is a country with limited sovereignty, a colony of the United States and the Zionists. What kind of freedom are they talking about? The freest country in the world is Russia. The strongest country in the world is Russia. And Russia's largest party is the Liberal Democratic Party, my party. Freedom is here, in my office. Germany is a colony where foreign troops have resided for 50 years, plagued by 4 million Turks whom the Germans are starting to burn alive in their homes. That is fascism. [Scaglione] No cooperation with anyone, then? [Zhirinovskiy] On the contrary. I am in favor of joint projects. For instance, we should build a freeway from Germany to Japan via Russia. The traffic would be huge, and we Russians would stay home drinking tea and live off the transit tolls. Or: The Germans build good motors, we build excellent armor plate. Together, we could build the best tank in the world. We could take the Italians into space, and you could give us automobiles. There are opportunities. It is the European countries -- hostages of the United States and the Zionists -- that are reluctant. They eat, drink, and remain silent. And to think that it was we who saved them. [Scaglione] I beg your pardon? [Zhirinovskiy] In the 13th century, from the Mongols. In the 18th century, from the Swedes. In the 19th century, from the French. In this century, from the Nazi-fascists. We confronted the Ottoman Empire, freeing the Balkans, Southern Europe, and Central Asia. We saved Israel, when we were the Soviet Union, and as Russia we saved Iraq. [Scaglione] What is the status of your relations with President Yeltsin? [Zhirinovskiy] Good. We meet from time to time. He likes volleyball, and so do I. He is a good man, and he gives me no trouble. [Scaglione] Are there no problems between you? [Zhirinovskiy] Problems? Why should there be? He was deceived by Gaydar, Burbulis, and their group, and it is never pleasant to be conned. Now, having seen the results, he is trying to redress matters, but that is a difficult task. If I were in his shoes, I would already have expelled them from the country or put them in prison. But Yeltsin is a good man, and he is not doing anything to them. But I will not leave them alone; I will make sure that they pay the penalties envisaged by the criminal code for those who attack the state's security and prosperity. They know this, which is why they shout, "fascist, fascist." [Scaglione] But will you take Yeltsin's place sooner or later? [Zhirinovskiy] Certainly. Through lack of rivals. Now, or in a year or two: It makes no difference. Yeltsin is finished politically, and look who is around -- Gaydar, Sobchak, Volskiy, Travkin, Yavlinskiy -- all people who command 10 percent of the votes. We have 120,000 members and received 12.3 million votes. In the next election it will be triple that. This is why they hate me: They know that I will be the next president.
