He said that a modern enterprise system is an enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. Modern technology and management methods can be introduced from other countries, but the modern enterprise system cannot be introduced from other countries. It is necessary to proceed from China's own national conditions, fully absorb and adopt things of universal character in this country, and make explorations and creations according to successful experience. Hong Hu said: China's modern enterprise system should take public ownership as the mainstay, with various economic elements developing together; take the distribution of income according to work as the main form, with various forms of distribution existing side by side; and ensure the role of party organizations and workers' democratic management. He pointed out that the modern enterprise system is the orientation of enterprise reform under different ownership systems, but it is mainly the orientation of the state-owned enterprises. Hong Hu said that the modern enterprise system is an enterprise system under the socialist market economic structure, but it is not the only enterprise system. Hong Hu said: A modern enterprise system is the foundation of the structure of China's market. According to the essential requirements of the modern enterprise system, reform should mainly be carried out by governments, but enterprises also have to do a great deal themselves.
