This is shown by a survey done by IMU-Testologen. Of those questioned, 40 percent would vote no, 33 percent would vote yes, while 27 are unsure how they would vote. The survey was carried out in April at the request of the newspaper ARBETET. Compared with an equivalent survey done in February, EU opponents have increased by 2 percent while the number of proponents declined by 1 percent. These changes do, however, lie within the statistical margin of error. If the respondents are divided according to party sympathy, a clear change is noticed. Within the nonsocialist bloc (not including New Democracy), the number of yes voters has increased from 51 percent in February to 57 percent in April. In the socialist bloc the number of yes voters has decreased from 25 percent to 21. The number of opponents is about the same on both sides, 20 percent among the nonsocialists and 21 among the socialists. Therefore the number of undecided voters is significantly larger on the socialist side. Of those who voted for the EU, 21 percent thought the statement "Sweden should not be isolated" was decisive in their choice. For 18 percent the statement "necessary for export" was decisive, and for 17 percent the statement "serves peace in Europe" was. Among the no voters, 33 percent thought that the statement "the consequences are not sufficiently determined" was decisive, while 24 percent said "open borders cause problems with drugs and violence" and 23 percent said "poorer quality of foodstuffs" were the most important motives. The survey included 1,012 people.
