According to Mr. Daskalov, the meeting was useful and the participants expressed a wish to hold, if necessary, similar meetings in future as well. The main issues discussed at the meeting were how the neighbouring countries could help the solution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the impact of the Yugo-embargo on them. A report was circulated unofficially estimating the Yugo-embargo losses sustained by the neighbouring countries, Foreign Minister Daskalov said. Each of the participating countries is to make its comments on this report. Bulgaria has invariably been for a peaceful solution and non-intervention in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. But should the need arise to resort to restricted air strikes as an extreme measure, these should meet a number of conditions, the Bulgarian foreign minister said regarding the NATO ultimatum. According to him, these conditions are that the air strikes result in no casualties among the peaceful population, that they do not lead to the spread of the conflict and that they do not threaten neighbouring states. At the meeting no one gave guarantees that neighbouring countries would not be affected, Foreign Minister Daskalov said.
