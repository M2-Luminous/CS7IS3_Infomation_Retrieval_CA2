FBIS4-14176 "drnes082_c_94018" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Egypt Opposition Party Leaders Issue Statement on Dialogue Opposition Party Leaders Issue Statement on Dialogue NC2604123394 Cairo AL-WAFD in Arabic 22 Apr 94 pp 1, 5 NC2604123394 Cairo AL-WAFD Arabic BFN [Text] On 20 April Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri handed Dr. Yusuf Wali, agriculture minister and secretary general of the National Democratic Party [NDP], a statement by the opposition parties and political forces. The leaders of the opposition parties issued a statement on 14 April concerning a political dialogue and asked the Labor Party leader to hand it to the NDP secretary general. The statement says that political reform should be at the top of the agenda of a national dialogue and that all opposition forces should take part in preparations for this dialogue. The statement also calls for guarantees for fair elections and for revising laws obstructing the establishment of a democratic society, noting that terrorism will recede if democracy is achieved. The statement also calls for a solution to the economic and social problems that beset ordinary people. The following is the text of this statement: A. When President Husni Mubarak issued a call for national dialogue at a session of the People's Assembly marking Mubarak's reelection for a third term, leaders of the opposition parties and political forces met and unanimously agreed to welcome a dialogue in principle, viewing the president's call as an answer to their repeated requests for cooperation and solidarity in finding the best solutions to the country's problems. The opposition leaders also examined the principles ensuring the seriousness of the dialogue and issued a statement including their views, which they presented to the president and released to the public. B. In later exchanges between the NDP and opposition representatives, it became clear that the NDP agrees with most of the opposition's statement. C. This was followed by quite a long period in which there were no exchanges and no particular steps were taken to prepare for the conference on a national dialogue. D. Following a recent meeting of the NDP General Secretariat, which was chaired by President Mubarak, Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif announced a decision by the NDP Secretariat to invite a 25-member committee to prepare for the national dialogue conference. E. On 14 April, leaders of the opposition parties and political forces who signed the aforesaid agreement met to look into the developments since their previous meeting, and reached the following conclusions: 1. The conferees, once again, state their commitment to the statement they issued at their last meeting, in which they stressed that political reform should be the top priority of a national dialogue. They also stressed the importance of the participation of all the opposition forces in preparing for the dialogue. There is a particular need to guarantee the probity of elections and to reconsider laws that impede the establishment of democracy. Democracy will weaken the wave of terror and help resolve the country's economic and social problems that haunt the lives of ordinary citizens. 2. A dialogue can only be conducted in a spirit of equality. Therefore, the opposition leaders request to have a part in naming the members of the preparatory committee for the national dialogue conference. They believe that the rules governing the dialogue should be formulated in agreement among the participants in that dialogue. 3. The signatories of this statement wish to note the importance of providing a healthy atmosphere for national dialogue through the following steps: a. Ending the arbitrary measures that are being taken against journalists of opposition papers; and b. Refraining from passing laws or making decisions that interfere with national political life, such as the amendment of the village mayors' law and the extension of the state of emergency by three years. The latter move, made only two months before the expiration of the Emergency Law, could have been delayed until the national dialogue had its say. We implore Almighty God to guide us all toward what is best for the nation.
