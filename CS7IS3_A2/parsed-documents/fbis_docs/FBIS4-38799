ROK President Kim Yong-sam Answers IZVESTIYA Chief Editor Igor Golembiovskiy's Questions"] [Excerpt] [Golembiovskiy] Mr. President, you were the first South Korean politician to come to Moscow. That was five years ago. You played an important role in establishing diplomatic relations between Moscow and Seoul, which presaged the most extensive links between our countries. Why, in your view, have Russian-Korean relations proved to be so modest? [Kim] As you have correctly remarked, I was the first South Korean politician to visit the Soviet Union. Afterward, in March 1990, I visited the USSR again. At that time there were no diplomatic relations between our countries, and therefore my visits were extremely difficult. Official diplomatic relations between the ROK and the USSR were established six months after my visit; I think that even my modest efforts played a part in this. Relations between our countries have been developing very dynamically since September 1990 right up until the present moment. The treaty signed between the ROK and the Russian Federation during President B. Yeltsin's visit to the ROK in November 1992 became the systemic basis for the development of bilateral relations. Relations in the political, economic, social, cultural, and other spheres are being developed on this basis. In the political sphere, in addition to top-level bilateral visits, frequent exchanges have taken place at the level of foreign ministers and other state figures. Trade turnover between the two countries last year reached almost $1.6 billion, almost twice the level of the previous year. This testifies to a dramatic growth in our economic relations. The number of visits by citizens of the two countries has also grown. Thus last year 18,000 Russians visited the ROK, almost twice as many as in the previous year. But at the same time, when I say that our relations do not yet meet our mutual expectations, I mean that they do not yet fully correspond to the great potential for cooperation which is worthy of our countries. My visit to Russia should serve as a boost to relations between the new Russia and the new Republic of Korea. We have accumulated healthy experience. Our cooperation will develop further on the basis of this experience and our mutual interests. [Golembiovskiy] Your predecessor, President Roh Tae-Woo, promised Moscow a loan of $3 billion, of which our country received only half. Now the question of returning this $1.5 billion has arisen; moreover, the Republic of Korea refuses to accept anything Moscow offers in payment for this debt -- from raw materials to arms. The impression arises that Seoul is not very committed to trade and economic relations with Russia. Is this so? [Kim] The loan was frozen because the major part of the debt had not been paid. Bilateral relations are now under way at a working level; moreover, all proposals put forward by the Russian side are discussed. I believe that we will be able to resolve this problem. Your words about the ROK's lack of interest in trade and economic relations with Russia are evidently connected with the fact that you do not have an exact idea of how our relations are developing. Once again I will repeat that our cooperation with Russia in the economic sphere is developing very dynamically. Russia is a country with great economic potential, the basis of which is constituted by its fundamental science and advanced high technology, its rich natural resources, and its high level of public education. The development of economic relations between the two countries on the basis of our economies' complementing one another will proceed more quickly if we manage to combine with Russia's potential our industrial technology and our experience of working in the international market. At the same time, investments and trade depend mainly on how mutually profitable our direct links with individual countries become. Hence the two countries' governments must work on expanding and consolidating the legal and structural base in order to exclude difficulties and obstacles in the activity of Korean and Russian entrepreneurs alike. Many South Korean entrepreneurs are already working in the Russian market, and I hope that my visit to Russia will help to create favorable conditions for more energetic activity on their part. [Golembiovskiy] The absence of international monitoring of North Korea's nuclear installations worries the whole world. Do you not think nevertheless that talk of the possibility of war and any kind of military preparations only aggravate the situation? Ultimately there is no precise information regarding the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea, and it is hard to imagine its leaders' really wanting a military conflict. [Kim] At the moment there is no precise evidence that the DPRK possesses nuclear weapons. However, there are suspicions that Pyongyang has long time been developing nuclear weapons and is already using a considerable number of nuclear components for military purposes. In order to rid the international community of these doubts it is necessary to ensure total glasnost regarding North Korea's nuclear installations. The DPRK should accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as quickly as possible and ensure that full inspections are carried out in its country. The ROK Government and the world community are making every effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully if possible. However, there is a limit to the world community's patience. In the event that North Korea does not renounce its plans and continues to develop nuclear weapons, rigorous sanctions by the world community will inevitably follow. [Golembiovskiy] Do South Korean diplomats plan to take part in the multilateral conference on this subject proposed by the Russian Foreign Ministry? [Kim] I would first like to express gratitude to Russia for cooperating in tackling the North Korean nuclear problem. The International Atomic Energy Agency, South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, and other interested parties are not only holding bilateral consultations but also making efforts in this area on a multilateral basis via the UN Security Council. In this connection I think that for the time being we should continue to follow the efforts made by the world community. [passage omitted]
