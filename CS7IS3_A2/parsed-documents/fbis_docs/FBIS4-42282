The supporters of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and those of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani have been engaged in violent clashes. The fighting broke out in a small area. It assumed a violent nature very quickly. The U.S. officials, who are very influential in the region, belatedly decided to take action last week. They suggested to Talabani, who has been living in Damascus and making no effort to end the clashes in northern Iraq, that he "should go to the region and halt the incidents as soon as possible." Talabani responded by asking them to provide him with a helicopter because he had to cross through territory under Barzani's control. He stressed that he did not wish to do that. However, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reports that the area Talabani mentioned was not sealed off by Barzani's men. In fact, several of Talabani's assistants left Damascus and crossed through that territory to reach their area. Considering that state of affairs, the U.S. officials rejected Talabani's request. The situation that has emerged in northern Iraq is as follows: "Syria is supporting Talabani against Barzani in the clashes. Talabani seems to have urged Damascus to increase Syria's military and political support for his supporters.... As far as I am able to see, Talabani and Barzani mostly differ on matters related to northern Iraq's future. Barzani supports the idea of a federation or a confederation with Baghdad. In other words, he supports Iraq's territorial integrity. However, Talabani wishes to establish an independent Kurdish State." The approach maintained by the two Kurdish leaders will force Turkey to willingly or unwillingly side with Barzani. Talabani is either unaware of that state of affairs or he is convinced that he stands to gain more by cooperating with Syria.... He may be planning to use Syria when the situation returns to normal in the region as a result of a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. Nevertheless, Turkey has not intervened in the fighting between the two sides. That was the right thing to do. The United States is expected to intervene in the situation in the near future. A very high-ranking foreign ministry official has said that "Turkey has to maintain a wise policy." Considering the developments in northern Iraq, I wish to criticize those who defend the view that the "Hammer Force must immediately withdraw from Turkey." I do not know what else I should say. Question of Iran Let us consider the developments that took place during the Iranian delegation's visit to Ankara a few days ago: 1. The Iranian officials explained the anxiety the developments in northern Iraq have caused in Iran.... They conveyed a verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to President Suleyman Demirel on Iran's uneasiness. 22. President Demirel and the foreign ministry officials informed the Iranian officials that Turkey is worried by Iran's approach on matters related to the activities of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]. The Iranian officials said that their country has been trying to do everything it can on the matter. They called for coordination between the two sides. The framework of such a coordination is unknown. However, the two countries can cooperate through the Turkish-Iranian Security Committee. 23. The delegation did not propose joint intervention in northern Iraq by Turkey and Iran. 24. The Iranian officials said that their country is opposed to the establishment of an independent Kurdish State in northern Iraq. The Turkish officials said that they shared that view. 25. The Iranian officials said that they were worried by the possibility that Talabani may emerge stronger against Barzani as a result of the clashes in northern Iraq. The Turkish officials responded by saying that Turkey and Iran should wait until the situation becomes clear in a few months.... That is how the Iranian delegation's meetings in Turkey can be summed up.... The Iranians seem to prefer to visit Turkey to express certain views that otherwise could be conveyed through telephone calls. Apparently, frequently traveling to foreign countries seems to be attractive to them. Someone Is Provoking Several people seem to have disrupted the relations between Turkey and the United States. In fact, they have been making an intensive effort to achieve their objective in Washington. A number of them have an "official capacity." The U.S. Congress' Helsinki Commission on Human Rights has been convinced to focus on the Kurdish problem in an unprecedented way during the past few months. Unfortunately, it has failed to discriminate between the PKK and the Kurdish problem. Speaking at a meeting that was held two days ago, the members of the International Human Rights Legal Committee made horrible accusations against Turkey, in spite of the fact that they visited Ankara to study the situation for only four days. Kathryn Porter, wife of Republican Congressman John Porter, addressed that meeting. She claimed that she was treated in an unbelievable way in Turkey, which she described as a police state and a country in which democracy does not exist. Furthermore, she said that the situation in Diyarbakir was worse than that in the former Soviet Union. She also claimed that several of the people who accompanied her were killed and that she was harassed by officials. Kathryn Porter is not a new name for Turkey.... She maintains a hostile attitude toward the Turks. In fact, she traveled to south Cyprus and encouraged the Greek Cypriot women to march against the Turkish Cypriot border some time ago. She appeared in many photographs at the time. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has to realize the harm that is being done to the relations between Turkey and the United States by individuals who maintain hostile feelings against the Turks. In fact, the U.S. Embassy has to take measures against them.... The matter is not a joke. It must be considered seriously. Turkey is not a colony.... The U.S. ambassador in Ankara must immediately explain that to Washington.... It seems that the individuals who address the commissions of the U.S. Congress are selected very carefully.... Ambassador Barkley, you must end that state of affairs. Mr. Ambassador, have I made myself clear?
