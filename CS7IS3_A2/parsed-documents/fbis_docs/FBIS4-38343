One of the deputies of the Swedish parliament, Peter Lyuksep, proposed that this affair be considered by the Swedish Parliament and also turned to parliamentarians of other European countries. The German Christian Democratic Union, the Conservative Party of Great Britain, the Conservative Party of Norway, the Liberal Party of Finland, and also the Human Rights Democratic Institute in Warsaw have already shown interest in the Boychyshyn affair. "Perhaps, the fact that Boychyshyn's case is becoming increasingly known in the international arena will compel law-enforcement bodies, which show total inactivity, to do something," a hopeful Vyacheslav Chornovil said.
