All forces and figures in Jericho participated in a demonstration this morning in which they called for international protection and the disarming of the settlers. After the demonstration ended safely, the Army interfered and fired at people killing a 17-year old youth. When the Army started shooting I headed for the market downtown where, in my direction, they fired tear gas and a stun grenade which hit me in my left leg. Praise be to God, there are some bruises, but the injury is not serious. However, what is more important than all this is that since the terrorist act carried out by the Israeli settler in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, the Israeli Army has killed 21 Palestinian youths. The Israeli Army is indiscriminately firing at our people. As Israel hides its crimes by standing behind settlers or its terrorist cliques, the regular Israeli Army is killing people and carrying out terrorist acts. This situation strengthens the Palestinian demand for international protection in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin urged the PLO to resume the talks and the Israeli Army is continuing brutal and repressive acts on the ground. How can we reconcile these two extremist Israeli stands? ['Urayqat] It is impossible to reconcile these two stands. Rabin must make a choice between settlements and peace, because the two cannot coexist. This message was conveyed to Rabin last Friday through his delegation in Washington. The PLO told him that he has to move toward four things: First, disarming the settlers; second, providing international protection for the Palestinian people; third, dismantling settlements in Gaza and Hebron; and fourth, placing the settlements issue at the top of the talks agenda. We believe that if the issue of settlements is not at the top of the talks agenda these talks will be useless. Regrettably, Rabin's responses, which came during the cabinet meeting, were weak and meaningless formalities. We want Rabin to make the appropriate decisions. The talks in themselves are not the objective. On the other hand, the U.S. Administration has tried to limit the danger by adopting procedural measures such as moving the venue of the talks. It ignored the substantial issues; namely, the settlements and international protection for the Palestinian people. This thing places the peace process in a deadlock. We, the Palestinian people, seek a just, genuine, and comprehensive peace on all Palestinian and Arab fronts. We want peace in accordance with the international charters and UN resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338. Rabin, however, cannot hold talks just for the sake of holding talks. [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the PLO yesterday suspended negotiations with Israel pending the meeting of its conditions regarding the occupied territories: Providing protection for the Palestinian residents and disarming settlers. In your opinion, can these negotiations resume without these PLO conditions being met? ['Urayqat] As I said, the negotiations cannot be an end in and of themselves. The PLO sent a host of questions to the Israeli Government, headed by the demands that I have mentioned to you. We are waiting for the Israeli Government's response. The negotiations are suspended now. The PLO is holding extensive international and Arab contacts, covering the United States, Russia, Europe, and Arab states. Under these particular circumstances, we hope that we will be able to revive Arab coordination. This is because it was a great decision by other Arab delegations toward entrenching the concept of a comprehensive solution when they suspended the negotiations in Washington in the wake of the massacre. I believe that it is high time that the Arab nation moves toward devising a comprehensive strategy. Likewise, negotiations on other tracks cannot continue for the sake of negotiations only. [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, some experts say that a unified Arab stand demanding that Israel implement UN resolutions practically annuls the possibility of negotiating the Oslo-Jericho [as heard] agreement, which specifies an interim period for the occupied territories before arriving at the final status. Can the Oslo agreement be abandoned? ['Urayqat] In fact, the question is not one of abandoning any agreements. Everyone realizes that the Palestinian track in the peace process has certain peculiarities. We are not talking about an occupied part of the Palestinian territory. We are talking about occupied Palestine as a whole, about all aspects of life in Palestine under the control of the occupation. Therefore, the question does not concern the method of the Israeli implementation and withdrawal, be it phased or not phased; the question has to do with listing a basic item on the Palestinian-Israeli agenda, which is the issue of settlements. In the past, Israel insisted that this issue be postponed until the final status is discussed. During the negotiations, when they were asked how they will provide protection or prevent the settlers from carrying out terrorist operations against the Palestinian people, they said: This is our responsibility. Last Friday, this Israeli responsibility was put to the test and failed. Israel proved that it cannot do that. Therefore, the question of placing settlements on the agenda is essential. In addition, there is the issue of international protection. If Israel withdraws and redeploys its forces, then why should it mind an effective international presence in the Palestinian territory to provide protection for 2 million defenseless Palestinians? [Reporter] In other words, you are demanding international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the disarming of the settlers, and the raising of the issue of settlements at the table of negotiations. Otherwise, you will not go to the negotiations with Israel? ['Urayqat] The decision will be made by the leadership. However, I personally believe that any negotiations that do not place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda will be useless. [Reporter] Sa'ib 'Urayqat, are you personally optimistic about the resolution that the UN Security Council may issue? ['Urayqat] In fact, I realize that the U.S. Administration is being hesitant. I realize that from the outset, the U.S. Administration intervened and focused on procedural issues rather than on substance. This is not promising. The U.S. bias toward Israel is very clear. I am not very optimistic about the U.S. position, specifically at the UN Security Council. [Reporter] Thank you, brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat for this interview with radio Monte Carlo. ['Urayqat] Thank you.
