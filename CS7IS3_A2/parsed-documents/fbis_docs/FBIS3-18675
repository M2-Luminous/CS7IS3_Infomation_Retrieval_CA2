Ireland Select Committee PM0403132294 London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH in English 4 Mar 94 p 10 PM0403132294 London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Language: English Article Type:BFN [Phillip Johnston report: "Major Sets Up First Select Committee on Ulster"] [Text] The first select committee on Northern Ireland is to be set up to enhance scrutiny of the province at Westminster, the Government announced last night. The move was seen as an attempt to placate Unionists following their threat earlier this week to boycott cross-border talks on the future of Northern Ireland, though the committee was promised several months ago. But it angered Ulster's nationalists and also threatened a row between the Government and Labour over who sits on the parliamentary body. Mr Tony Newton, Commons leader, tabled a motion for debate next week setting up the committee -- which has long been sought by Unionists and was suspected to be at the centre of a deal with Mr Major last summer to secure support over Europe. On the same day, the Commons will be asked to give its annual approval for renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- which will again put Labour on the spot as it opposes the legislation. Ever since direct rule was imposed in 1972, Unionists have objected to the way Northern Ireland business is handled at Westminster without any effective monitoring by MPs. The Government had resisted a select committee for Northern Ireland, fearing it would degenerate into a sectarian squabble. But ministers have judged the time is now right to establish the group to bolster recent efforts to broker a settlement among the political parties. Nationalists have long harboured suspicions about a select committee, which they see as an attempt to tie Northern Ireland closer to the Union and cutting across efforts to win an agreed settlement among all the parties. Mr Seamus Mallon deputy leader of the SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party], said in the Commons yesterday that the committee was being imposed against the wishes of a substantial group of MPs. Ministers, however, do not anticipate any boycott of the committee, though they envisage fierce arguments over the composition. The Government wants an overall majority, in keeping with the convention that select committees should reflect the balance of power in the Commons. But with none of the main parties represented in Northern Ireland, the issue has become complicated. The committee is to have 13 members -- six Conservatives two Labour, two Ulster Unionists, one Democratic Unionist, one Nationalist SDLP and Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Popular Unionist, who could be chairman and would ordinarily vote on the Government side. Labour is unhappy with such a balance, arguing that it breaches all the rules of select committee composition set down since 1979. They also want the chairmanship. A possible compromise could be a 15-strong committee, retaining an overall Government majority but giving Labour more seats. The Government disputes any suggestion that the select committee cuts across the three-strand talks process it is still pursuing despite recent setbacks. Earlier this week, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, said that he did not see any future in talks involving Dublin and that he wanted to concentrate on winning agreement for new forms of government in the province. However, he has not broken off contact with the Government and further meetings are planned between the Unionists and Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister, who is trying to find common ground. Realistically, ministers do not expect any movement on the talks process until after the European election on June 9.
