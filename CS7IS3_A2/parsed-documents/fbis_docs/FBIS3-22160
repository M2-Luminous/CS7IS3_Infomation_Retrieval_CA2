The Tokyo Workshop on Cooperation for the Conservation of Biological Diversity in Asia brought together about 70 people, representing the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program, the governments of Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In a closing statement to the gathering, the workshop president, Taishichiro Sato of the Japan Wildlife Research Center, said the participants had decided to promote the development of knowledge and specialized technology for the preservation of biodiversity in Asia. Sato said they also expressed a desire to encourage more local bodies to participate in biodiversity conservation and to encourage more efficient data collection and sharing so that development decisions can be made without compromising the region's biodiversity. The gathering was organized by the Environment Agency of Japan and the Japan Wildlife Research Center. Colin Rees, head of the Land, Water and Natural Habitats Department within the World Bank, said the technology to ensure biodiversity is maintained is still inadequate. Rees called on Japan to foster more people able to preserve biodiversity in its other agencies and ministries and not just within the Environment Agency. Representatives from the Foreign Ministry, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Japan branch of the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) also attended the meeting.
