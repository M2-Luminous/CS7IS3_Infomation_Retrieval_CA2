FR940916-1-00092 FR940916-1-00016 FRA proposes to establish a power brake inspection scheme in which various stated factors determine the distance that a freight or passenger train is allowed to travel without additional inspection. These factors include: the qualifications of the employee performing the initial terminal brake inspection; the extent of performance of supervisory spot checks of maintenance and inspection activity; the presence or absence of a single car test program on the railroad; the power brake defect ratio on outbound trains for the railroad; and the type of equipment used and installed on the train. Based on the conditions that are satisfied by the railroad, a train may be allowed to travel anywhere between 500 and 3,500 miles from the point of initial terminal without additional power brake tests or inspections. Furthermore, in order to ensure that initial terminal brake tests are being performed, FRA proposes to require railroads to maintain a record of all initial terminal tests that shall contain the name of the person who conducted the test, when appropriate. The factors and mileage limits mentioned above will be discussed in more detail below. VIII. High Speed Passenger Train Brakes High speed passenger trains (up to 200 mph) require braking systems which far exceed the capabilities of those presently installed on North American trains. The energy required to be dissipated in a stop from 200 mph is well over one billion foot-pounds. To achieve this braking capability, more advanced methods of train braking must be utilized; such as, electro-pneumatic braking systems, microprocessor-controlled braking, or advanced train speed control systems. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62557), FRA requested comments, information, and suggestions regarding the operation of these types of advanced braking systems, the equipment required for their operation, and the kinds of regulatory requirements that are needed to ensure the safe operation of trains equipped with these advanced braking systems. The AAR and several passenger railroads provided information regarding high speed passenger operations. These commenters suggested that any specifications developed for these types of operations need to be performance standards based on stopping distances for specified speeds. Amtrak stated that the hardware exists today that can probably be used at speeds of 150 mph or below, such as a combination of disc, tread, and blended brakes. Amtrak also mentioned that in order to operate at speeds in excess of 180 mph a regenerative-type braking system is probably required combined with a friction-type system. This commenter also suggested that operations of over 150 mph need to be dedicated systems where the train and track are designed as a unit. Amtrak said it would like to form a committee to work with FRA to develop regulations and specifications for these types of systems. Another railroad recommended that any passenger service operating over 90 mph should operate on separate dedicated rights of way, physically removed from any freight service traffic. The AAR and two commuter railroads suggested that if economical and reliable sensors can be developed they will be essential in monitoring these systems, but should not be applied in high shock areas that would make them vulnerable to failure. These commenters also stated that diagnostic programs incorporated into computer software must be used to monitor the braking systems. They also stated that these programs would eliminate the need for time-based maintenance since they would continuously monitor the system's components and store information on any operating defects occurring while a train is in use. These commenters also felt that back-up or stand-by computers were unnecessary because the systems are designed to stop the train if a failure occurs and a mechanical override would be sufficient to allow movement of the consist. FRA Conclusions. FRA feels that passenger trains that operate at speeds in excess of 125 mph should be classified as high speed operations. FRA recognizes the unique designs and features that the braking systems of these types of operations may incorporate. FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the types of train brake systems used by these operations should be controlled by some type of automated computer system. These computer systems should be able to run diagnostic programs capable of self-testing the brake system and detecting faults in the system and should have the ability of either alerting the engineer of these faults or taking automatic corrective action. In addition, the computer software of these systems should be analyzed to determine the safety impacts of software failures and to ensure the software is fail-safe and functions as intended. FRA also believes that if these types of trains are equipped with on-tread brakes they should be designed to prevent application of the tread brakes at speeds greater than 80 mph. Furthermore, in order to allow technological advances in this area of train braking, railroads may petition FRA to convert some of the train brake system design and maintenance requirements into performance-based safety requirements.
