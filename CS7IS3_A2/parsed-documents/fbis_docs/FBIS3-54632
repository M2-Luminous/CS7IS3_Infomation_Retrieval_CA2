Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia Your question goes straight to the point. I will not forget 1993. You can guess why. 3-4 October, the storming of the White House... I admit that for me this decision was not only forced on me, it was the most agonizing and difficult decision. On that tragic night, hour after hour I watched real signs of civil war developing in Russia, with consequences far in excess of the Russian people's national tragedy at the beginning of the century. The decision had to be made quickly. I took that step for the sake of a single goal -- to avoid war within the country. I am not likely to forget all I felt during those days and hours. Now, for an emotionally positive event in the past year. It was, of course, the adoption of the new Constitution. My compatriots, the people of Russia, once again demonstrated the people's wisdom. That event, that day, can, for me, be seen as the goal of my political career. I was working toward it for three years, and I am happy that Russia has at last acquired an intelligent, worthy Constitution. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan Almaty -- This year was extremely tense both for Kazakhstan and for the Commonwealth, and probably for the entire world community. Amid the kaleidoscope of complex and dramatic events of this year, it is not easy to identify the most important. Fratricidal conflicts in various regions of the Commonwealth brought pain and suffering. But in the main we were able to prevent them from developing into global interstate clashes. Wisdom and farsightedness doubtless lie not in driving conflicts underground, but averting them by political means. In our countries there is a growing awareness of the futility of confrontation between peoples. And nobody but ourselves can stop that confrontation. The most important thing that should exist in relations among our countries is equality, friendship, and consideration for mutual interests. That will undoubtedly help us to reach a new level of integration. I hope the language of cooperation and mutual understanding will become the basis of our partnership. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate IZVESTIYA's collective and all its readers on the new year, 1994, and to express the wish that everyone may have as many peaceful and joyous days as possible. I would wish us to cherish our main asset -- good-neighborliness and the indissoluble bonds of friendship. Leonid Kravchuk, President of Ukraine Kiev -- I realize these are metaphorical questions: It is not easy to single out one or two days from the whole torrent of days. Let me say, I am pleased when some question that is important to Ukraine is resolved, when a step is taken toward boosting our prestige in the international arena or when, say, we have been able to reach agreement with our neighbors or within the state on some economic, political, or diplomatic question. Or when a sick grandson or granddaughter gets better -- then I am happy. And I am pleased when people smile at our meetings -- I know how hard things are for them, they think it is partly my fault, and that is true, but it is a sign that they believe in Ukraine's future. The most important, crucial act this year, from the viewpoint of the state's future, was parliament's adoption of the decision on early elections. I am convinced that the present parliament, whatever you may think of it, is not capable of doing more than it has done. And that is not simply the deputies' fault -- the parliament was elected in a different time, it bears the stamp of that time, and it is not professional. Therefore I was pleased that it was not necessary to use any strong-arm measures to persuade the deputies of what they ought to do. As for major unpleasantnesses, I have had two this year. The first was the miners' summer strike. I saw disaster was not far off. After that, there was the meeting with the Russian delegation in Massandra. Russia then saw how hard the strikes were hitting Ukraine, and it was brought to its knees by internal problems. On top of that there was external pressure, and people were taking advantage of our weakness. And the second difficult day, and difficult night, for me -- 3 October in Moscow. I knew that if the Khasbulatov and Rutskoy crew was victorious in the White House, similar processes would begin, as usual, in Ukraine. That evening I had information that in some regions people were already preparing practical steps to overthrow the presidential structures and restore Soviet power under the slogan: "All power to the soviets." It could have meant extremely difficult times, even bloodshed. I cannot ever remember feeling such agitation in recent years or having such an outlook. Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus Minsk -- I cannot distinguish one day from another in the past year, and therefore I cannot name the most difficult. There was a lot of work on the Supreme Soviet -- intensive work, highly necessary to the republic and the people. Unfortunately, it was necessary to "chase" certain dishonest people. They sometimes raised problems of what I would call back-street significance. All this diverted attention and cost time and effort. The behavior and actions of certain leaders, even some of very high rank, who say they care about the people is annoying. The most gratifying days in the past year were when the Belarus Supreme Soviet adopted the laws on public privatization. The republic government's task is to fulfill these laws, so that instead of a handful of millionaires getting rich, the entire people have something, to make life a little bit easier for them. The fate of the Belarusian people is all too hard, they have borne too much in their history, and things are very difficult for them at present. They have a right to a better life. I would like to take this opportunity sincerely to congratulate all IZVESTIYA's readers on the coming New Year and to wish them good health, happiness, prosperity, and calm. Mircea Snegur, President of Moldova Chisinau -- It is perhaps better to speak about features rather than days, because I almost never have a day that is absolutely happy. So, now for what is sad, or rather vexatious. I am talking about the Tiraspol leaders' incredible lack of understanding of the changed situation. Despite the efforts and initiative of the republic leadership, we have not succeeded in moving toward the elimination of the consequences of the conflict. God and the people will be their judge. Now for what is happy. We have had a year of peace. Privatization has begun. We have introduced a national currency. Certain other steps were also taken along the path of consolidating the republic and its statehood and independence. At the personal level, for me, of course, the big event was my grandson's first birthday. Happy New Year to all IZVESTIYA's readers! Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan Tashkent -- I cannot name a specific day: Every day in the past year was both difficult and happy in its way. There are many people who do not like peace and accord, political stability in the republic, and the consistent, phased implementation of economic reforms. To be frank, our opponents cannot tolerate two factors which determine our true wealth: One is the interethnic and civic accord, the cohesion of all the inhabitants of Uzbekistan, and the other is Uzbekistan's gold, our high-carat gold, which is becoming famous throughout the world and is winning prestige in the international market. Incidentally, as of today, Uzbek gold worth $500 million is invested in West European banks as a guarantee. We intend to bring the account up to $1 billion, in order to widen the influx of foreign investments into Uzbekistan's economy. Imamali Rakhmonov, Chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Council It is hard to single out my happiest day in the past year. But nonetheless, I think the January days were the happiest. In that period, in a short space of time, Dushanbe, which was devoid of people, came to life following the advent of constitutional power. I was happy to see smiles appearing on the citizens' faces. People straightened their shoulders -- the fear had gone, and real hope had sprung up for the establishment of peace, stabilization, and the attainment of national accord. That was when I was happy, in purely human terms. The most difficult time for me, as for all the people and the republic as a whole, was, unfortunately, the whole of 1993. It was the most difficult year in my entire life. During this period very many socioeconomic difficulties and problems have arisen, which we have worked and are now working to resolve. I hope 1994 will be the year of the normalization of the highly complex situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, a year of mutual understanding and accord between forces of different political orientations in our country, for the sake of achieving peace and security not only in Tajikistan, but throughout the Central Asian region. Saparmurad Niyazov, President of Turkmenistan Ashgabat -- I will not try to isolate the single most difficult day; there were many such days. But I associate the happy day with that sunny day in December when Turkmenistan and Russia found one another in a new capacity. The appearance on the eve of the session of CIS heads of state of the agreement on the settlement of dual citizenship questions, the process of resettlement, and the defense of the rights of migrants, and also the treaty on the joint security of the Turkmenistan's border, in many ways determined the success of the summit meeting in Ashgabat also. I confess, the decision connected with these documents was arrived at with difficulty. Both sides' groups of experts worked long and painstakingly on the agreements. We were perfectly aware what role these documents are designed to play in establishing democratic ideals and defending the individual's right to choose. I was happy that we reached agreement... Askar Akayev, President of Kyrgyzstan Bishkek -- The happiest day was 5 May 1993, when Kyrgyzstan's Constitution was adopted, opening the way for the progressive development of the republic, for the construction of a democratic state, and the formation of a civil, rule-of-law society. I am convinced that not only members of the constitutional commission who formulated this Constitution, and not only the deputies who adopted it, will be proud of it, but also the future generations of Kyrgyzstan. The most difficult day was 20 December, when a crisis of state power arose at a session of the republic Supreme Council, and the opposition of the two branches -- the legislative and the executive -- reached its very apogee. The difficult and only possible solution in this situation was a decision by the whole government to resign. I am glad that this difficult step, this difficult day, and this difficult decision enabled us to resolve several problems at once. This made it possible for us to avoid conflict or confrontation both in parliament itself and within the republic. After this decision, everyone felt some kind of relief, and I am glad that we found the path of harmony and consensus in forming the new government. This new government can be called a coalition government. Geydar Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan Republic Baku -- It is hard for me to speak about a happy day. Indeed, how is it ossible to be happy, when Azerbaijan is being subjected to aggression, when 20 percent of its territory is occupied, and the republic has 1.2 million hungry refugees? There can be no happy day, happy hour, or happy moment for any president in the world in a similar situation, I am convinced. This, I am convinced, is out of the question. As for a complex or, as you remarked, difficult day, perhaps it was the day I assumed the heavy responsibility for the fate of the Azerbaijani state and its people. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, President of Armenia Yerevan -- The happiest day for me will be the day peace is restored in Nagorno-Karabakh. Until that day, all days have been and will be difficult.
