And also about the accusations addressed to him? Rutskoy gets off to a flying start: "It has all been invented in order to take attention away from the serious crisis that the people in the country are experiencing. The men in the regime are looking for a scapegoat. This is what happened in 1991 when the Communist Party was destroyed because it was becoming too much of a nuisance. Then the same thing happened again the following year in 1992. The target was the Supreme Soviet. In October 1993 they shelled Parliament. Now once again they want to eliminate those who are a nuisance. Nobody planned a coup because there has already been one." [Livi] In practice, are you saying that the president's men were the ones that spread the rumors about the coup? [Rutskoy] I do not know who spread the rumors. What I can say is that it is all an act. I am sure that it is a farce. [Livi] The alarm, the threat of destabilization: Everything points to a degenerating situation. What are your forecasts for the future? [Rutskoy] Forecasts? The term sounds excessive. But this instability, this making the boat rock from one side to the other, the underhanded political games: These usually have a bad ending. [Livi] Do you think that there could be a repetition of what happened last October, i.e., a hard and bloody confrontation? [Rutskoy] Everything seems possible today. God save us, however, I would not want to experience those events again. I have had enough time to think over what happened and to draw my conclusions. [Livi] Which? [Rutskoy] That the current situation in Russia is a difficult one. But we must not dramatize. A remedy can be found. As long as we act on basic territory, the economy. As long as the people do not have enough to eat, as long as they do not have houses, medicine, and the security of stable laws, there is no talk of this. The state must regain control of and manage the economy. The reforms, incentives for production, and respect for the law must be redefined. Policy today must be based on these priorities if we want stabilization in the country. [Livi] Is this a presidential program? Will you present yourself at the presidential elections? [Rutskoy] Keep calm. Perhaps those elections have already been announced without my knowing anything? First, we must get to the elections. And then it will be necessary for somebody to propose my candidature. In that case we will see. I am ready, I have stated clearly what my positions are. [Livi] The new center-left "Agreement for Russia" opposition front is not looking at you as a candidate, then? [Rutskoy] According to me, all the political and social movements that are developing in the capital do not have a great deal of influence on the current situation. As I said before, the stability of Russian society depends only on the solution of vital problems: i.e., economic ones. [Livi] How do you feel? Already president; vice president, as you were before last October, or former vice president? [Rutskoy] It depends on how one judges the events of last fall. If the coup (by President Yeltsin -- IL MESSAGGERO editor's note) is considered legitimate, then I am the former vice president. But if it was against the law -- and is to be considered such according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation -- then I remain vice president. However, according to the law I am a Russian citizen, with all the rights that derive from this. [Rutskoy ends] There is no use insisting. The bodyguards form an impenetrable ring. The cameramen who try to break through are pushed back, somebody in the crowd falls roughly on the ground. Rutskoy has said what he wanted to. That he is not the candidate of a party, but of a vast popular protest front. That he is the anti-Yeltsin for the people who cannot make ends meet today and who want to put an end to the "new rich" and the mafia. The czar of the ultranationalists, Zhirinovskiy, will have a tough nut to crack. [passage omitted]
