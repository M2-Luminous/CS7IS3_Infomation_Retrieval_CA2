He refused to say that concluding defense treaties with the great powers meant Kuwait's failure on the Arab and Gulf fronts. In a statement to the weekly magazine AL-SHURUQ, he said: "Everybody knows that all the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member-states put the lives of their sons at risk to liberate Kuwait. We are still, after the liberation, going ahead with coordinating joint defense among the GCC states, which proves that cooperation among them is successful". On the Arab front, he added: "There are Arab countries which participated in the liberation war, such as Egypt and Syria," pointing out that this coordination had continued later on within the framework of the Damascus Declaration, which includes these two countries alongside the six GCC states. Shaykh Sabah denied the existence of external pressure on the State of Kuwait regarding the direction of its policy, pointing out that the recent visits of Western personalities to Baghdad were made for a specific reason, namely the release of Western hostages imprisoned by the Iraqi regime. He stressed the continuation of the isolation of the Iraqi regime for its refusal to comply with all UN resolutions in connection with its aggression on the State of Kuwait, pointing out that: "No country could extend its bridges to a regime which inflicts starvation and homelessness to its people and practices the most cruel torture against it". Shaykh al-Sabah denied the allegations that Kuwait's statements calling for distinction to be made between the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people were in variance with actual practices, and stressed that Kuwait had helped the Iraqi people with food and medicine, particularly those expelled by the Iraqi regime in the north and in the south to whom humanitarian aid was sent. He further said: We do make a distinction between the regime and the people and it does not please us at all to hear about a fraternal people beset by hunger and poverty. On whether he expected success in forthcoming days to efforts days aimed at bringing about a reconciliation with the adversary states that supported Iraq in its aggression against the state of Kuwait, Shaykh al-Sabah asked: On what basis would these efforts succeed and reconciliation be brought about. He added: First, the problem must end, and then reconciliation begins, but if reconciliation comes now, it would be absolutely useless. Kuwait has, in fact, specified the conditions for a reconciliation with the adversary states to the effect that these states must announce their recognition of the UN Security Council resolutions pertaining to the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. In his statement, the Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign minister expressed the hope that harmony would prevail and all the accumulations resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait would disappear. The invasion, he said, had frozen everything, including peace which he hoped would be realized. He further said: So long as differences exist in the Arab world, everything will remain suspended and frozen. In his assessment of the current events regarding the Arab- Israeli settlement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said: "We welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step." He added that he "hopes that this step will lead to an agreement in all processes, otherwise there will not be any progress towards peace." Regarding the GCC's failure to reach a total union so far along the lines of the European Maastricht Treaty, Shaykh Sabah said: "The European Council is over 50 years old and despite this it has not taken its final shape yet. By contrast the Gulf Cooperation Council was created only 14 years ago." He added: "It is true that we have not realized all the hopes pinned on the Council, but we should not ignore the fact that many of these have been realized." He further said: "We all hope to achieve the remaining aspirations in the coming years." In reply to a question on whether he thought that the success of the GCC as a formula for regional cooperation was due to a weakening of the Arab League's role, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad indicated that the Cooperation Council did not come from outside the framework of the Arab League, but that it had been set within the framework of the Arab League Charter which stipulates that Arab countries should cooperate among themselves. He also stated that the Council continued to play its part in reinforcing the Arab League and making its role more effective. He added that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the state of disunion and division which ensued led to a fragmentation of the Arab decision. He also deplored the fact that this had led to the weakening of the role of the Arab League to the point of marginalization.
