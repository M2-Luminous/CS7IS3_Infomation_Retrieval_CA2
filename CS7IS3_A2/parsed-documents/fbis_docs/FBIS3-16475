This was announced at a meeting between Japan's Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, with Russian journalists ahead of his visit to Moscow on March 19. Hata said Italy, which is president of the G-7 meetings this year, will decide on inviting Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the G-7 summit in Naples and on the form of his participation in it. The earlier tested scheme "seven plus one," in accordance with which the Russian president has already participated in G-7 annual meeting, is quite suitable for discussing frankly and openly political and economic issues of concern to all, he added. "I consider the fact of Russia's regular participation in G-7 meetings as important," Hata pointed out and stressed that a change to the current formula would depend on the results of dialogue between Moscow and the leading industrial powers of the world.
