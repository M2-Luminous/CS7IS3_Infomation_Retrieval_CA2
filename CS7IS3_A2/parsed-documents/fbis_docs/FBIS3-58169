As has been reported, [Defense Minister] Werner Fasslabend, Austrian People's Party [OeVP], and [Interior Minister] Franz Loeschnak, Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], suspended the talks on Tuesday without any results. The contentious issue was the duration of national alternative service. SPOe Chairman Vranitzky said the SPOe has already contributed so much in terms of improvements and concessions that he does not understand why the OeVP cannot "take this last step." He wants to call on Loeschnak to talk with Fasslabend once again, the chancellor said. Busek said he would be pleased if Vranitzky gave Loeschnak new leeway for negotiations.
