(2) CCOC's with less than 360%, but greater than or equal to 240%, prior to further flight, with ferry flight permitted, in accordance with paragraph (i) of this AD below. (e) Thereafter, ultrasonically inspect CCOC's, P/N's 796761 and 806675, for cracks at intervals determined by maximum ultrasonic signal amplitude, in accordance with paragraph 2.A. and Appendix B of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, for installed CCOC's; or paragraph 2.A.(5) and Appendix C of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, for uninstalled CCOC's; as applicable, as follows: (1) For those CCOC's that meet the criteria described in paragraph (d) of this AD, remove from service and replace with a serviceable part. (2) For those CCOC's with less than 240%, but greater than or equal to 100%, at intervals of 1,000 CIS since last inspection. (3) For those CCOC's with less than 100%, but greater than or equal to 40%, at intervals of 2,500 CIS since last inspection. (4) For those CCOC's with less than 40%, inspect at the next removal of the CCOC from the engine since last inspection. (f) Mark CCOC's with new P/N's, in accordance with paragraphs 2.A.(5)(c) and 2.A.(11) of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, that meet the following criteria: (1) At least two consecutive ultrasonic inspections have been performed on the CCOC; and (2) the second inspection was performed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD; and (3) have accumulated at least 2,500 CIS since the first ultrasonic inspection; and (4) that exhibit a maximum ultrasonic signal amplitude of less than 40% in both inspections. (g) Remarking of CCOC's with a new P/N in accordance with paragraph (f) of this AD constitutes terminating action to the inspection requirements of this AD. (h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (i) Except for aircraft with engines having CCOC's that must be removed from service in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this AD, special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
