It is also possible that North Korea will use the proposal for propaganda purposes and to delay the settlement of the nuclear issue. A relevant high-level official of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] pointed out that Russia should not overlook the fact that the UN Security Council is now discussing the North Korean nuclear issue, even though its proposal is an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue internationally and politically. In addition, he stressed that problems may arise in the positions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA, which have made efforts for nuclear nonproliferation throughout the world.
