The Association's Preparatory Committee was elected within the framework of yesterday's talks. During the course of the next two to three weeks, it should draft all of the materials for the constituent general assembly. According to Miroslav Petru, the president of the Avia-Hamilton Standard Aviation company, who was one of the initiators of this event, the association will endeavor to improve the economic conditions for our aircraft hardware manufacturers. In his opinion, the aircraft industry is the leader in industrial production, and the overall expansion of industrial output depends on its favorable economic development. According to him, the association's establishment could lead to an improvement in the position of our aviation industry and thus support the development of this branch, which, by its state-of-the-art technology, sets the tone for the other branches of industrial production. Petru also said that the association will lobby for specific government assistance but gave no further details on this issue. He merely said that specific support for the aviation industry as the flagship of the economy is simply a matter of course in such economically developed countries as, for example, the United States and Great Britain.
