The conference of the communists of Kalininskiy Rayon was held in the 40-Let Oktyabrya Cultural Center. The stage was decked with flowers, the banner of the rayon party organization, and a bust of Lenin. Comrades who had recently been accepted as party members were issued their party cards by O. Shenin and G. Zyuganov and were congratulated on this momentous day in their life. There was an uncompromising discussion of current party events. The work of communists since the special 30th conference was analyzed in depth in the party raykom report by Secretary S. Penkov and in the subsequent debates. Speakers focused attention on the restoration of the structures of the rayon party organization and the reinstatement of primary party organizations. Intraparty ties were strengthened, and contacts were established with other parties and movements with communist, socialist, and patriotic aims. The communists of the rayon have taken an active part in all the rallies and demonstrations organized by the opposition in Moscow. They have conducted indoctrination and explanatory work among workers and the population. They gave the editors of PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and GLASNOST financial assistance and distributed these and other opposition publications. There was also some self-criticism in the speeches, however, in reference to certain shortcomings and omissions. According to communists, the biggest obstacles impeding the growth of party ranks are the continued absence of a CPRF program and the endless arguments over its relationship to the UCP-CPSU. O. Shenin and G. Zyuganov addressed the conference participants and answered their questions. During the discussion the communists approved resolutions "On the Results of the Rayon Party Organization's Work in the Report Period and Its Primary Objectives" and "On United Action by the Communist Parties of the Russian Federation and on Their Relationship to the UCP-CPSU" and other documents. The administrative bodies of the party organization and delegates to the Moscow municipal party conference were elected at the conference and candidates were nominated to serve as delegates to the All-Russian CPRF Conference.
