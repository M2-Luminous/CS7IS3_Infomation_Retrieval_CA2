Tamar Asalem reports from the Knesset: Israel will honor the agreements reached in Cairo in the spirit of the Declaration of Principles, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said upon leaving the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The committee was interrupted twice because of telephone calls from 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th. [Begin Peres recording] Mr. Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and I informed everybody about the agreements we reached in Cairo. We stand by them. A person's word has to be honored. A debate is legitimate until agreement is reached. After that, agreements must be honored. [end recording] [Later in the newsreel, Mr. Peres, after talking with Sha'th, said "`the conditions are not yet ripe for renewing the Taba talks.' The two exchanged several more faxes, but the dispute between the two sides has not yet been resolved. Peres told the Knesset committee that Israel is demanding from the PLO that there be no deviations from the Cairo agreements in future negotiations."] On the security of the settlements and the border crossings, the foreign minister explained that there is no room for compromise. [Begin Peres recording] We are not asking for new agreements. We are trying to understand how the Palestinians feel, yet we insist on Israel's security. [end recording] Responding to a question on Kibbutz Netzarim, Mr. Peres said there might be a need to revise security costs for the isolated settlement. He said Netzarim would not constitute part of the negotiations with the Palestinians, but would be brought up in an internal debate. We might have to ask ourselves about resources and the size of the settlement, but I would not like such a debate to be held in the shadow of the negotiations, Peres added. The foreign minister also referred to the upcoming Clinton-al-Asad summit and said that despite the high expectations in the United States, his expectations were sober. Severing links between Syria and the terrorist organizations would be a central issue in the negotiations with them, Peres said.
