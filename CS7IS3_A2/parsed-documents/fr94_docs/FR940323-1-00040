(2) Effective January 1, 1991, the agency must consider any pregnant woman who has established eligibility for Medicaid under this part and who, because of a change in family income, would no longer be eligible, to be eligible to receive services as mandatory categorically needy under §435.118 throughout the pregnancy and the 60-day period after pregnancy ends and for any remaining days in the month in which the 60th day falls, without regard to any changes in income that may occur during this period.
