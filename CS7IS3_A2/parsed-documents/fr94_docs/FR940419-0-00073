FR940419-0-00073 FR940419-0-00019 5. Conflict of interest applied to employee level. One commenter stated that it is not clear why EPA is applying conflict of interest rules at the individual employee level and that the regulation should clarify how the ``objectivity/bias'' rule could be compromised at this level. Throughout this rule, we have emphasized the special nature of Superfund work and the importance of ensuring integrity of work at sites so that the enforcement actions are not jeopardized. We believe that a contractor employee with a personal conflict of interest that impaired his objectivity in performing work for EPA could impact Superfund work. Persons working on our contracts must be able to render impartial assistance so that the integrity of the work product is not questioned. For example, if a contractor employee performed work for EPA at a site on which the employee had performed work for a PRP, and the individual was called upon to testify in court to support prior actions taken by the PRP, as well as to testify to support actions by the EPA, the credibility of the employee's testimony may be questioned. Moreover, a contractor employee with a conflict of interest stemming from a relationship with a PRP at a site could pose an unacceptable risk of disclosure of sensitive information that could impact cost recovery strategy or other enforcement action regarding the site. All we require is that personal conflicts of interest be reported so that we have the opportunity to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts that may jeopardize our programs. 6. Relationships covered by personal conflict of interest clause. One commenter requested a definition concerning the types of ``relationships'' that might be covered by the personal conflict of interest clause. ``Relationships'' may include personal, financial or business affiliations/connections which would impair a person's objectivity in performing the contract work. 7. Individual ownership of stock and mutual funds. One commenter pointed out that the term ``relationship'' in this clause can be interpreted either narrowly or broadly, and asked how EPA views the ownership of stock in an entity or the owning of shares in a mutual fund which owns stock in the entity. Since each situation is different and should be examined on a case-by-case basis, it is not appropriate to establish a position on whether certain ownership of stock in an entity would or would not create a conflict. We would generally view substantial ownership of stock in an entity as having a higher conflict of interest risk than the more passive investment in a mutual fund which normally conducts transactions without the active participation of the shareholders. However, specialized mutual funds may exist which invest in a very narrow group of stocks. Therefore, each situation should be considered on its own merits. 8. Notification to the Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer. One commenter stated that notification to the EPA Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer is redundant and unnecessary and that notification to the Contracting Officer should suffice. We have reviewed this recommendation and have decided to retain notification to the Project Officer. Personal conflicts can have an immediate impact upon work that is performed. Notification directly to the Project Officer will expedite the EPA response time in avoiding mitigating, or neutralizing such conflicts which would be beneficial to both the Agency and the contractor. 9. Remedies for non-disclosure. One commenter stated that the rule does not identify what remedies, if any, would be available to the Government in the event that EPA concludes that a personal conflict of interest was not disclosed by a contractor. The commenter further stated that appropriate action referenced in the clause could only be termination for convenience. We disagree. Remedies may include avoidance, mitigation, and neutralization of the conflict as well as any other remedies which would be permitted under the terms and conditions of the contract.
