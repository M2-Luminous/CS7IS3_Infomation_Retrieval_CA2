FR940425-0-00018 FR940425-0-00016 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 21, 22, and 94 [ET Docket No. 92&hyph;9; FCC 94&hyph;60] Redevelopment of Spectrum To Encourage Innovation in the Use of New Telecommunications Technologies AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: By this Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) the Commission refines and clarifies the rules and policies adopted to make spectrum available for emerging telecommunications technologies. The MO&O adopts rules to complete a regulatory framework for relocating fixed microwave operations where necessary to implement services using emerging technologies in the 2 GHz bands. This action is necessary to provide 2 GHz spectrum for future wireless communications services while preventing disruption to incumbent 2 GHz fixed microwave licensees. This action facilitates future authorizations of a broad range of new wireless communications services that employ emerging technologies. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Fred Lee Thomas, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;6204. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order adopted March 8, 1994, and released March 31, 1994. A summary of the Second Report and Order (Second R&O) and Third Report and Order (Third (R&O) that were reconsidered in the MO&O may be found at 58 FR 49220 (September 22, 1993) and 58 FR 46547 (September 2, 1993), respectively. This action will not add to or decrease the public reporting burden. The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order 1. The MO&O effects changes to the rules to further the Commission's goals of providing for the fair and equitable sharing of 2 GHz spectrum by new services and the existing fixed microwave services that currently use these frequencies, and for the relocation of existing 2 GHz facilities to other spectrum where necessary. The rules provide licensees of services using emerging technologies with access to 2 GHz frequencies in a reasonable timeframe, while at the same time preventing disruption to existing 2 GHz operations and minimizing the economic impact on the existing licensees. 2. The MO&O responds to twelve petitions for reconsideration or clarification that address a variety of issues related to Commission decisions in the Second R&O and Third R&O. The modifications and clarifications adopted conclude the Commission's actions to allocate spectrum that can be used for emerging technologies. Such new technologies are expected to contribute to the development of the national information infrastructure and serve the need for ubiquitous wireless access to voice and data communications, thus providing new services to the public, creating new jobs, and fostering effective competition in the global market. 3. In the Second R&O, the Commission adopted minimum digital data rates for each channel bandwidth of the higher fixed microwave bands made available for relocation of incumbents to ensure efficient use of these bands. The Commission adopted a 3.5-year transition period ending June 1, 1997, after which all new equipment for these bands must meet the specified date rates. Further, to minimize the use of equipment that does not meet the new efficiency standards, the Commission prohibited the manufacture or importation of such equipment after July 15, 1994. 4. In the MO&O the Commission states that it is persuaded by the petitions for reconsideration that the July 15, 1994 deadline may unduly burden those manufacturers that recently have developed products that comply with the old rules, particularly if the manufacturer maintains a low or ``zero'' inventory. Therefore, the Commission concludes that the deadline should be extended two years, to July 15, 1996. Changing the deadline will provide manufacturers flexibility in discontinuing product lines that do not meet the new standard but will maintain the Commission's goal to change to more spectrum-efficient equipment within a reasonable time period. The Commission leaves the 3.5-year transition period unchanged because it believes that this period is reasonable. Therefore, the Commission will continue to require that all equipment applied for, authorized, and placed in service after June 1, 1997, meet the efficiency requirements adopted in the Second R&O.
