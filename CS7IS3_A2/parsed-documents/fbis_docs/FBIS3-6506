Western human rights groups and Buddhists have said that Thich Huyen Quang, the 77-year-old patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), has been held under house arrest since February 1982 and has been cut off from all communications with the outside world. But foreign ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said: "He is now practising his religious services at the Hoi Phuoc Pagoda in Quang An" in central Vietnam. The International Federation of Human Rights recently appealed to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to intervene with Hanoi as Quang was said to be in need of urgent medical care. But Lan denied this, saying: "His physical health is normal." Quang became head of the Church in 1992 after the death of Patriarch Thich Don Hau, but his succession has become the focus of a violent row with the government, who have refused to recognise Hau's right to choose his successor. Fearful of unrest sparked by Buddhists, who make up 70 percent of Vietnam's population, the government here has tried to bring all religions under the control of the communist party's Fatherland Front, a patriotic organisation of social groups. Lan also brushed off reports of the "arbitrary detention" of another member of the UBCV, Vo Han Duc, a 48-year-old abbot sentenced to three years in jail in January. "This man was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for his crimes against on-duty officials," Lan said, adding that the sentence had been handed down through normal legal processes following Duc's arrest in July last year. A court in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau imprisoned Duc for disturbing public order on charges of "conducting activities against the law" and "handing out documents hostile to the socialist government of Vietnam."
