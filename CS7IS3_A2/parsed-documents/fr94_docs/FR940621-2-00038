FR940621-2-00038 FR940621-2-00028 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;600&hyph;000] Ozark Gas Transmission System; Application June 15, 1994. Take notice that on June 10, 1994, Ozark Gas Transmission Company (Ozark), 1700 Pacific Avenue, LB&hyph;10, Dallas, Texas 75201 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;600&hyph;000, an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and §157.7(a) of the Regulations (18 CFR 157.7(a)), for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the upgrading of metering and associated measurement and control facilities in Franklin County, Arkansas to provide additional capacity into the NOARK Pipeline System (NOARK), all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Ozark states that it seeks this authorization to install an eight-inch tap and a six-inch meter run and associated measurement and control equipment, capable of delivering an additional 35,000 Mcf of gas per day to NOARK, with a total delivery capability of 70,000 Mcf of gas per day. Ozark estimates that it will cost $34,000 to construct the proposed facilities, to be financed with equity funds and aid-in-construction funding from NOARK. Ozark explains that becasue the location of the proposed delivery point expansion is in Township 9N, Range 26W in western Arkansas, it is required to obtain a Section 7(c) certificate in accordance with a Stipulation and Consent Agreement approved by the Commission in 1983, 22 FERC ¶ 61,324 at p. 61,578, instead of qualifying under Ozark's blanket construction certificate. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regualtory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time requried herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate for the proposal is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Ozark to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
