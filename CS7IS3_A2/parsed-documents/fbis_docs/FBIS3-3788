He added that their duties performed during the rule of the British-Hong Kong government would not be retrospective nor investigated. Mr. Zhang made these remarks at a seminar attended by district affairs advisers of the New Territory section. In response to attitudes held by general civil servants at present, Mr Zhang said that the future SAR government would not look into the past responsibilities they had had after 1997 and that if civil servants were by that time willing to retain their position, they could do so. He added they would not be found to be at fault for their former words and deeds. As for those criticized by the Chinese side, this was purely because their worlds and deeds were in violation of the Sino-British joint Declaration. Another deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the NCNA, Mr. Zheng Guoxiong, attending the same function pointed out that under the circumstances where the British side had destroyed the foundation for cooperation, the Chinese side had to rely on Hong Kong compatriots, including the district affairs advisers to make joint efforts to realize a peaceful and steady transition. He added that the district affairs advisers were persons of influence in various districts and in different professions. Mr. Zheng said that they could help the Hong Kong branch of the NCNA to hear and collect opinions and views on a wider scope in a bid to ensure peace and stability during the transition.
