Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, limits on distribution of the product or provisions that the biological product is restricted to use by veterinarians, or under the supervision of veterinarians, or both. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has received requests from the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) to consider proposing a Federal restriction that animal rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The NASPHV believes that a uniform national restriction would result in: (1) proper handling of animal rabies vaccines to help ensure potency and (2) improved documentation of animal rabies vaccinations. APHIS has attempted to identify specific issues that need to be addressed prior to proposing such restrictions on animal rabies vaccines. The Agency is seeking data and information on these issues for consideration before it decides whether or not to proceed with such a proposal.
