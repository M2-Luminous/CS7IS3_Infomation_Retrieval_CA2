Under Swedish law a bill which involves changes to the country's constitution must be approved by two separate parliaments. The Swedish parliament is dissolved in June, with a general election in September, and unless the constitutional bill paving the way for the treaty can be presented to the current parliament, the final decision might have to wait a further four years until after the next general election. Swedish officials were yesterday urgently studying ways around the obstacle. One would be to allow a vote on the constitutional bill before the outcome of the negotiations with the EU were known. An alternative would be to present the constitutional change to the new parliament, and then call a general election shortly afterwards so that a fresh parliament could also add its approval. This would be a highly unorthodox move, breaking the practice of fixed-term parliaments but it is not impossible for the Prime Minister to call a snap election. Sources in Sweden said yesterday that the worries about the timetable have subsided as constitutional experts have insisted that Swedish membership would not be jeopardised by such technicalities. A failure to settle quickly the dispute over EU minority voting rights could jeopardise the whole enlargement process, Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's Minister of European Affairs, warned yesterday. Sweden, Finland and Norway have been relaxed about the dispute which has pitted Britain and Spain against the ten other EU members. However, concern is now growing that the inability of the Twelve to settle the matter will force a postponement of the Nordic countries' entry into the EU, scheduled for January 1, 1995. Any such delay would have a negative effect on the outcome of forthcoming referendums to be held on the issue in the three countries, Mr Dinkelspiel said. A majority of voters in Norway and Sweden oppose membership and the governments face an uphill task in convincing them otherwise. In Finland a majority supports joining. "I think we are approaching a critical point. If there is a further delay it will not be possible for the European Parliament to deal with the enlargement negotiations this spring and that will effectively delay entry," Mr Dinkelspiel said. On a visit to Stockholm earlier this week Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, defended Britain's stance. "I think if you in Scandinavia had a government that had found itself being out-voted all the time because its political colours don't match the political colours of most of the other governments, you will find there is a growing resistance to that," he said.
