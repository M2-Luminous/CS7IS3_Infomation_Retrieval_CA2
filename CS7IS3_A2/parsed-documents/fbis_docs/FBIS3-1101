The Nigerian deputy foreign minister told the Nigerian press agency NAN that he is confident on the issue of holding such a referendum, since, he said, 90 percent of the population of this peninsula is made up of Efik-speaking Nigerians. How do the Cameroon authorities react to this proposal? We asked Augustin Kontchou, information minister and spokesman for the Cameroon Government: [Begin Kontchou recording] We are surprised by such a declaration. It shows quite clearly that the Nigerians do not consider the Bakassi Peninsula to be Nigerian territory. Cameroon cannot of course accept that a referendum should be held in order to determine that part of its territory should go elsewhere. I would like, nevertheless, to thank the Nigerian deputy foreign minister for showing the international community with this declaration that the Bakassi Peninsula is indeed Cameroonian territory. I would, however, like to know what the Nigerians really want. We have been negotiating with them in Togo. They have not told us that they are abandoning this mediation, but they now seem to be following another path: The Nigerian foreign minister announced in Cairo that there would soon be a summit between the Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, but we have not been told anything about this. And now they announce a referendum. We conclude that this is some sort of diplomatic and media agitation in order to sow confusion. Cameroon cannot take this agitation very seriously.
