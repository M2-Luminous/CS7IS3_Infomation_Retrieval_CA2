FR940920-1-00102 FR940920-1-00008 V. Rationale for the Proposed Guidelines for Fugitive Fly Ash/Bottom Ash Emissions The following discussion addresses the basis for EPA's decision to regulate fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from MWC facilities. The available technologies for controlling these fugitive emissions and the EPA's selection of MACT for these emissions are presented. A. Background Fugitive emissions from MWC's are emissions of dust from fly ash and bottom ash handling that are not confined (i.e., emissions that are not contained within a fully enclosed ash handling system). The fly ash/bottom ash dust consists of PM and various associated pollutants adsorbed to the PM such as Cd, Pb, Hg, and organic compounds (e.g., dioxins/furans). A study of MWC ash handling and storage facilities has shown that such facilities, when improperly controlled, can be sources of these pollutants through fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. Therefore, visible emission guidelines for fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions are being proposed to ensure that control equipment and operating practices are implemented to eliminate such emissions. Currently, more than 12 percent of existing MWC's use control systems to eliminate fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. B. Fugitive Emission Control Techniques Sources of MWC fugitive bottom ash/fly ash emissions include the ash storage facilities (including ash storage bins or piles), fly ash and bottom ash conveyors and conveyor transfer points, and truck or container loading facilities. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from conveyors can be controlled by totally enclosing the conveyors when they are not already inside an enclosed structure. Emissions from conveyor transfer points can be controlled by totally enclosing the transfer point and ventilating it to a control device if the transfer point is not inside an enclosed structure. Alternatively, maintaining adequate moisture in the fly ash and bottom ash can be used to control fugitive emissions from conveyors or transfer points. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash storage facilities at an MWC plant can be controlled by totally enclosing the ash storage areas and by ensuring that the fly ash and bottom ash have an adequate moisture content to prevent dust. Chemical stabilizers and binders may also be used in addition to or in place of moisture to prevent dust emissions from MWC ash for nearly all the activities described in this section. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from truck or container loading facilities at the MWC can be controlled primarily by the moisture content of the ash. Fly ash or bottom ash can be passed through a water-filled quench tank to wet the ash. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash loading facility at the MWC may also be controlled by enclosing the ash loading facility, fitting the truck bays with doors that can be closed, and discharging the vent air to a control device. Emissions can also be controlled by reducing ash spills during loading and by recovering any spilled ash through sweeping, vacuuming, or washing before the spilled ash can dry or be tracked out of the loading facility. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from moving trucks used for hauling ash from the MWC can be controlled by ensuring that the ash is moist and that the truck or container is properly sealed and covered during transit. Trucks can be covered with tarps, and truck tires can be washed prior to leaving the ash handling facility to prevent ash from being tracked onto roadways where it can later become airborne as fugitive dust emissions. Data collected at several MWC's indicate that when the control methods described above are applied in a consistent and conscientious manner, fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions can be controlled so that no visible emissions are observed from the ash storage facilities or from ash transfer points such as conveyors, trucks or container loading facilities, and trucks hauling MWC ash. C. Proposed Fugitive Emissions Guidelines An emission guideline level of no visible emissions of fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash storage facilities and transfer points is consistent with the determination that the controls described above represent MACT.
