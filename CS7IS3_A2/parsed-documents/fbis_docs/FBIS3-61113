The Year of Censorship"] [Text] It must be confessed that this kind of action from the television journalists was expected. Like Kim Il-song in spirit and form, national television has long since become just as exotic in our country as the picturesque canvases of the socialist realists. Who just in recent years has not "collided" with Ukrainian television, starting with Prime Minister L. Kuchma and ending with rank and file television viewers. But in vain! The reigning nomenklatura is guarding the stronghold of information supremacy and influence on the popular masses like the apple of its eye. But now, on the eve of the elections, the party in power, in the words of A. Lavrinovych, is trying to take the entire information space under its control, which is why political censorship is being toughened, but where its opportunities are limited--an economic noose is used. Patience ran out at the Gart youth studio. Incidentally, the same one to which we are obligated for the rare and really talented programs that appear on UT-1 [Ukrainian Television-1]. As a sign of protest, the collective of the editorial office last Friday came out with this announcement right on the air: "1. Censorship has been introduced on Ukrainian television. "2. In particular, the "Gart Youth Studio," which has always tried to speak to you honestly and frankly, became an object of pressure today on the part of the leadership of the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company. "3. At first, your right to receive full television information was taken away from you, and now our right to speak honestly from the screen is being withdrawn. "4. Recently, critical materials concerning the situation in the state were removed in the programs of our editorial offices--'Business Report' and 'Gart Youth Studio.' The program 'Fanton' has disappeared from the air. "5. `In a society in which the freedom of speech does not exist, it makes no sense to talk about any kind of other freedoms.' This is not our quote. "6. We are warning that everything is being prepared in state television and radio broadcasting so that the reform forces do not receive access to the air during the coming election campaign. The sad experience of our Gart is evidence of this. "7. Aware of what awaits us after going on the air (possible dismissal from state television), we are deliberately taking this step (going on the air with the announcement) as journalists who want to preserve the honor of their profession. "8. Therefore, the 'Gart Youth Studio' demands that the leadership of the State Television and Radiobroadcasting Company create conditions of work for the journalists that are generally accepted in a democratic society. "9. Everyone who watches and knows us--if you are with us--we are relying on your support." After this, materials came out on the air that were prohibited by the leadership of UT-1 from being shown. The journalists who were invited to the studio became witnesses to numerous telephone calls in which viewers expressed warm support for the courageous act of the journalists. They were joined by the employees of other editorial offices and services at 26 Kreshchatik Street. On the next day at a conference of the Independence journalists trade union, Viktor Pavlyuk, the editor in chief of the program for youth, said: "It is senseless to talk about freedom of speech on state television. The leadership is being arbitrary, taking refuge in the fact that Ukrainian Television is a governmental and presidential structure. We are deprived of the right to speak honestly and frankly from the screen. And we really envy our colleagues from the independent newspapers for whom the time of censorship is in the past. We have censorship--this is not only the removal of materials and episodes, it is contained in all of the organizational activity of the television company. If, for example, out of a dozen editorial offices of our television, each had had an opportunity to express its point of view on the GKChP [State Committee for the State of the Emergency], then the people of Ukraine would have heard at least several different opinions, but not disgraceful silence. Freedom for the editorial office and freedom for the journalists is all that we are trying to get." "We wanted our own hour on the air," said Dmitriy Tuzov, a Gart journalist, "to make it so that it would not be like UT-1. It is not for me to tell you what kind of television channel that is. You yourselves see: It is done in such an impotent way that, in principle, it is impossible to watch it without tears. However, this hour also stuck in the craw of the leadership." Yelena Prygova, the studio editor, was even more categorical: "We are not cattle, which the former party workers and the current leaders of the television company are trying to make us out to be. We created this television and are proud of our work. We are citizens, we are journalists, and we will stand to the end." There is no need to guess what the reaction has been of Messrs. Okhmakevych and Kulik, the leaders of the teleGULAG, to the demarche of those desiring freedom for the journalists. It has already been recommended to Viktor Pavlyuk that he write a resignation statement. There has been criticism of other Gart employees. However, it will hardly be possible on the sly to give short shrift to the "rebels" (the statement was signed by 18 persons; that is, almost the entire editorial staff). Speaking in support of the Gart protest against the violation of the freedom of speech in Ukraine were leaders of the executive committee of the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, well-known political and public figures--V. Yavorivskyy, V. Chornovil, A. Lavrinovych, L. Lukyanenko, O. Omelchenko--and the Fund for the Independent Press of Ukraine. Deputy Vorobyev spoke in parliament regarding Gart, and N. Spis, the chairman of the commission on questions of openness and the mass media, advised N. Okhmakevich not to adopt repressive measures. But the question is, what is left for the latter to do? After all, give journalists freedom, and it is hardly likely that any will voluntarily want to sing prayers of praise to the president....
