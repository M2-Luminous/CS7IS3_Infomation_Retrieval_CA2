SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Vaccines Background The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (the Fund) compensates individuals who are injured as a result of the administration of certain vaccines. Revenue for the Fund is provided by a manufacturers tax (section 4131) on these vaccines. The tax, as originally enacted, was in effect only from 1988 through 1992, but OBRA 1993 applied the tax to vaccine sales after August 10, 1993. OBRA 1993 also imposes a floor stocks tax, which does not appear in the Internal Revenue Code (Code), on these vaccines. The floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on taxable vaccines that were sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer on or before August 10, 1993, on which no tax was imposed by section 4131, and that were held at the last moment of August 10, 1993, for sale or use. The rates of floor stocks tax are equal to the tax rates for sales by the manufacturer, producer, or importer.
