FR940613-0-00049 FR940613-0-00015 Other comments considered, that did not result in a change, will be discussed at the end. Any heading not included in the discussion means that the information included in the SNPRM was accurate, and the same information has been included in appendix C as published by this final rule. Alaska OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: WEIGHT: The State DOT commented that the weight restriction discussion in the SNPRM for Alaska should not apply because the section 1023 freeze applies only to the Interstate System, and Alaska does not have Interstate System mileage designated under 23 U.S.C. 103, 139(a), or 139(b). The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the weight condition for each vehicle described has been revised to indicate that a carrier has to be in compliance with State laws and regulations and does not list maximum weight limit values. In addition, because LCV's, as defined in the ISTEA, do not operate in Alaska due to the lack of Interstate System mileage, the ``LCV'' notation previously included by the combination description has been removed. VEHICLE: The State indicated that the hours of operation for three trailing unit combinations are established by permit and not by regulation. Accordingly, this has been removed from the ``VEHICLE'' discussion. PERMIT: The SNPRM noted that permits were required for divisible loads. The State commented that this was incorrect. Permits are only required for nondivisible loads. OTHER COMMENTS: The CRASH stated that Alaska Administrative Permit Manual Section 11.6 provides that ``all oversize or overweight vehicles not in convoy shall maintain a minimum distance of 800 to 1,500 feet from any other oversize vehicle or vehicle with load and pilot car traveling in the same direction on the same highway in rural areas.'' Since Alaska is not contiguous to any other State this type of information would be of little use to any out-of-State trucker. Any vehicle requiring a permit would be subject to the Alaska permit rules which would be given to the driver when the permit was obtained. Therefore, in view of its limited usefulness in terms of general information, we will not add this provision to appendix C. Section 4006(a) of the ISTEA provides that Alaska ``may allow operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations which were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991.'' Verification has been furnished that ``Triples'' with trailers not over 45 feet in length were in actual operation under permit prior to July 6, 1991. The CRASH believes that the operation of ``Triples'' after June 1, 1991, was authorized only on an experimental basis as provided in 17 AAC 25.106(b)(4). However, the ISTEA allows the continued operation of any combinations put into service between June 2 and July 5, 1991, without further condition. Therefore, ``Triples'' may continue to operate, as indicated in appendix C. The State advised that under Alaska regulations, a truck tractor equipped with a dromedary box is defined as not being cargo carrying. Dromedary boxes do in fact carry cargo. However, for the reasons given above, the FHWA has decided for the time being not to list the cargo-carrying length of dromedary tractor-semitrailer combinations. The State indicated that an additional route, AK&hyph;1 from Palmer-Wasilla Highway Junction to Wishbone Hill Coal Access Road, must be added to Alaska's routes chart under the caption for ``Rocky Mountain Double-LCV'' (58 FR 11467) of the SNPRM. However, this is incorrect because the freeze on vehicle length is applicable only on the NN, and this is not an NN route. The State is free to regulate the size and weight of vehicles off the NN as it sees fit. ARIZONA LEGAL CITATIONS: The CRASH stated that Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.N should not be shown as authority for permitting overweight vehicles on the NN since it only covers the issuance of permits on other than NN routes. We agree, since the provisions of Section 4006 of the ISTEA apply only to vehicles on the NN. Therefore, ARS 28&hyph;1011.N has been deleted from the ``Legal Citations'' for Arizona in appendix C. OTHER COMMENTS: The CRASH stated that the legal size for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is 90 feet, and not 92 feet as shown in proposed appendix C contained in the SNPRM. Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.A provides that the Arizona DOT may issue oversize permits for vehicles exceeding otherwise applicable length limits on the State highway system. Further, the change in categories from those listed in the SNPRM makes this a moot point insofar as the final appendix C is concerned. The CRASH stated that the State may not issue ``verbal policy directives'' authorizing overlength vehicles. It adds that the State appears to be violating its own statutes. The question cannot be resolved in this proceeding but the FHWA will investigate the issue in connection with Arizona's certification of compliance with 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j). The CRASH also stated that weight limits for LCV's on US 89A and I&hyph;15 cannot be determined under ARS 28&hyph;1011.N. The FHWA agrees. Since the ISTEA freezes the weight of LCV's only on the Interstate System, we will not further consider weight limits on US 89A. The State indicated that the maximum allowable weight limits for all LCV's on the Interstate System is 111,000 pounds, except for ``Triples,'' which it said are subject to a maximum allowable weight of 123,500 pounds. The 111,000-pound maximum weight limits are specifically authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.M, and higher maximum weights may be authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.A on the State highway system. Since the State indicated that the highest weight authorized for ``Triples'' on or before June 1, 1991, was 123,500 pounds, that value is retained in appendix C. COLORADO LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: Appendix C in the SNPRM showed the cargo-carrying length for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' in Colorado as 85 feet, for ``Turnpike Doubles'' 95 feet, for ``Triples'' 95 feet, and for truck-trailer combinations as 78 feet. However, on June 1, 1991, the State actually allowed one of the trailing units in ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' to be up to 48 feet long and the other up to 28 feet 6 inches long, with not over 15 feet of hitch between the two units, or a total cargo-carrying length of 91.5 feet. The State also allowed ``Turnpike Doubles'' to have two trailers of approximately equal length, not to exceed 48 feet each, with a hitch not to exceed 15 feet in length. The resulting cargo-carrying length becomes 111 feet. Revised appendix C has been changed to reflect these values.
