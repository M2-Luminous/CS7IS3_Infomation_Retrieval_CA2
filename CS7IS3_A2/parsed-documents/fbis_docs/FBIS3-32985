FBIS3-32985 "drlat033__a94014" FBIS-LAT-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Brazil * Rio 92 Accords Approval Expected By End of February 94SM0213D Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 20 Jan 94 p 15--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94SM0213D Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:CSO [Text] Brasilia--Ambassador Rubens Ricupero, minister of the environment and the Legal Amazon, will ask Senate President Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Paraiba State] to act on an urgent basis to examine the biodiversity and climate change conventions that were approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday. The minister has already begun contacts with Pedro Simon (PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul), the administration's leader in the Senate, hoping to speed up the process of ratifying the two agreements. The government thinks these can be approved by the end of February, if Senate leaders concur. Advisers to Ricupero and Senator Pedro Simon are considering whether they might send the biodiversity and climate change conventions to the full Senate for passage without first submitting them to review by committees. In defending the idea of rapid handling of the international treaties, government experts argue that both agreements were exhaustively discussed in the Chamber of Deputies. Advisers from the Ministry of the Environment note that the conventions cannot be amended as if they were legislative proposals. An alternative way of handling them would be to send the texts to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense. The members of this committee would have 25 days in which to examine the agreements before sending them directly to the floor for a vote. "Here in the Senate there is no reason why those accords could not be handled speedily," commented Senator Jose Richa, (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party--Parana State], a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. "As far as I know, there is no resistance among the senators to take up the matter," Richa added. If it is confirmed that the accords will pass through the committee, it will be up to its chairman, Senator Alfredo Campos (PMDB, Minas Gerais), to appoint a rapporteur on the subject. "The chairman has asked that the examination of international accords be handled expeditiously, and these two will certainly get the same treatment," said an adviser to Alfredo Campos. As soon as the Senate approves the accords, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send the UN secretary general a communique reporting that the conventions have been ratified by Brazil. From then on, the Brazilian Government will be able to enjoy the international financial mechanisms created by the convention. The Ministry of the Environment has been negotiating for the release of $30 million from the World Bank's Global Environment Fund in order to implement the National Biodiversity Program. Also in the second half of this year, the countries that ratified the Biodiversity convention--now there are 36 of them--will meet to discuss additional mechanisms for the accord. On the agenda will be new rules for technology transfers and financing of environmental protection and conservation projects.
