Construction of the six-sq-km Changshan new area has been started. The officials said they plan to complete land leveling, roads, water and power supply projects within one year. According to the plan, the new area will be a complex of banking, office, shopping, entertainment and residential buildings. Administrating three urban districts and a suburban county, with a combined population of 700,000, the one-year-old city has been working hard to improve its infrastructures. In the past year, the city invested 523 million yuan in fixed assets construction projects, including five mid-sized berths for its port, a 6.7-sq-km landfill project, a 49-km highway, and telecommunications networks. In a few years, the city will have a new center on a piece of seaside wilderness stretching 30 sq km, the officials said.
