[De Lucena] I knew him by sight when I was serving in Juiz de Fora and he was working -- if I am not mistaken -- as municipal public works secretary. Now I know him better. I like him very much. He is an honest man, a very correct person. [ISTOE] Minister Mauricio Correa revealed that there was a group of military men who were determined to turn President Franco into a local Fujimori. Were you aware of this? [De Lucena] I was. At the time an anonymous document containing a project for a military movement appeared in circulation inside the barracks. [ISTOE] Did you read the document? [De Lucena] I looked it over quickly. I can tell you that within the Army no one paid much attention to the document. [ISTOE] Do you see any possibility of a Peruvian-style coup in Brazil? [De Lucena] No possibility at all. [ISTOE] In any case, someone wrote the "military movement" to which you are referring. [De Lucena] Everybody knows that there are dozens of groups, reserve officers' groups, behind these proposals. They are well-intentioned individuals, but they do not live the problems of those who are in the Army, as I do. These groups do not have any relevance. I usually say -- I insist on the matter quite often -- that we no longer have parallel or external leaders in the Army. The leaders today are those serving in the institution, or in the position of minister or commander. Anyone from outside trying to lead an internal movement will have to depose the minister first. I am not just bragging. What I say is based on the Constitution. [ISTOE] Will your leadership end when you leave the Army at the end of the government's mandate? [De Lucena] Yes. I will leave behind many friends. But I will no longer exercise any leadership function. [ISTOE] Many interpretations were made of a speech by General Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel in November, particularly about his remark on the "anger of the legions." What is the correct interpretation of that remark? [De Lucena] I do not think any interpretation is necessary. Gen. Leonel copied that phrase from an old Army book. The remark does not have any secret meaning. I have known Leonel since he was a cadet, and I can assure you he is as good a democrat as I. [ISTOE] What is the Army's situation today? [De Lucena] The year 1993 was a much better year than 1992. We can still hear complaints about salaries, which are really very low, but the Army achieved many things compared to 1992. We are purchasing some weapons, our schools continue to operate well, and we are pursuing our modernization programs. [ISTOE] Are you also optimistic about what is happening in Congress? [De Lucena] I am. I do not like to speak about that, but I believe in renewal and democratic improvement. I do not believe in tough regimes or dictatorships. I believe in democratic regimes, and I believe in people. [ISTOE] Have you experienced any particularly difficult moment as a minister? [De Lucena] As a minister, no. I had difficult moments when I was at the Eastern Military Command. We had to decide how to act if Congress did not impeach former President Fernando Collor. Would we go out into the streets to repress the people and defend a president who was clearly involved in corruption and who did not have the people's support? That was the worst moment for us, the military commanders. [ISTOE] Did you discuss the issue with other military commanders? [De Lucena] I did. We decided that if there was no impeachment, we were still obligated to defend the president. Fortunately, the theory that the impeachment process would not be approved by Congress was remote. All of us were quite aware of that. [ISTOE] For whom did you vote in the last elections? [De Lucena] I voted for Collor in both instances. He disappointed me very much. [ISTOE] Had you been aware of what was to take place, would you have voted for [Workers Party, PT, leader Luis Ignacio da Silva] Lula? [De Lucena] Absolutely. He was the other choice. Brazil comes first, does it not? [ISTOE] Your meeting with Deputy Aloizio Mercadante [Workers Party -- Sao Paulo] was much discussed. Do you empathize with the PT? [De Lucena] I empathize with Deputy Mercadante's father, General Oswaldo Muniz Oliva, who is in the reserves. I see no problem in meeting with a PT deputy. I also met with Deputy Jose Genoino [PT-Sao Paulo], and with deputies from other parties. The Army relies on Congress for many things. There are amendments, drafts that deserve our respect. I am interested in being on good terms with Congress. It is all part of the rites of a democratic regime. [ISTOE] Sir, do you believe that the anti-left hysteria within the Armed Forces has been overcome? [De Lucena] Yes, it has been overcome. There are only some reactions of little significance. [ISTOE] Who are responsible for these reactions? [De Lucena] People who have not developed, who have not witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. [ISTOE] Are there many such people within the Army? [De Lucena] No, not among those on active duty. I assess the issue in the following manner: There are two kinds of military officers in Brazil -- those who graduated from the Royal Military School, and those who graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy [AMAN] in Resende. I believe that the opening of the AMAN school in 1944 marked a change in the mentality of the Brazilian military officer. [ISTOE] Do you believe you represent a generation of military officers who have a different mentality, a different attitude? [De Lucena] I believe so. The generations that emerged from AMAN were trained in more open and modern surroundings. What fascinated us in our youth -- and many entered the Army because of it -- were the deeds of the Allies in World War II. We were fighting for democracy at the time. [ISTOE] Are you the first officer graduated from AMAN to be appointed Army minister? [De Lucena] No, the second. The first was General Carlos Tinoco Ribeiro Gomez, who was Army minister during the Collor administration. [ISTOE] The generation that emerged from the Royal Military School chose the Communists as the enemies of Brazil. Who are Brazil's enemies today? [De Lucena] As I said after I was installed, I believe that the worse enemy we must face today is poverty, because this is the root of all our evils. [ISTOE] Is the Army involved in other social assistance areas? [De Lucena] In the health sector, we assist in vaccination campaigns. In border areas, it is Army doctors who look after the local population. Our doctors and dentists are working in the Amazon region. The Brazilian Army is multifaceted. In the south, we have a more combatant, better trained Army. In the northeast, the Army is more involved in social assistance activities. In the northeast, we have engineering battalions who drill wells and build dikes. [ISTOE] Is the Brazilian Army well equipped? [De Lucena] We have made a great effort to modernize it. President Franco obtained some resources, and we will be receiving a lot of modern equipment by June. This is a good thing, because it motivates young officers and helps us to avoid those problems we faced in the past. [ISTOE] Will Brazil sign the missile treaty that the Argentine Government has just signed? [De Lucena] I have nothing against it. But all treaties of this nature are being reviewed by Congress. The Army is not in charge of conducting the negotiations. [ISTOE] The trend in countries such as the United States is to reduce the number of military troops and to have professional soldiers. Are you in favor or against mandatory military service? [De Lucena] Completely in favor. I believe it is a necessity, and I also believe it is good for the upbringing of young men. I usually say that the Brazilian Army is different. It cannot be compared with the American Army. The United States has world interests, and has to look after its capability and political power. The concept of the Brazilian Army is that which prevails in France: that of the citizen-soldier. A lot of money is spent to support a trained soldier. The Army must pay good salaries if it is to compete in the job market. This would not be good for us. Moreover, I do not believe we have a large Army. The Brazilian Army has 200,000 men. I believe this figure is compatible with our country's needs. [ISTOE] During the Geisel administration, the Army was alloted 16 percent of the national budget. Today it is alloted only 0.5 percent of the budget. What is your opinion of this? [De Lucena] I believe this is a ridiculous amount. The most serious problem is that concerning salaries. And it is not only within the Army. Today all officers are poorly paid. This month we will get a slight salary increase to compensate for last year's loss in purchasing power. We are not happy about it, but it helps. It is disturbing to see someone reach the end of his career without being able to support a child. [ISTOE] There are officers who want their salaries to be equivalent to that of personnel from the legislative and judiciary branches on the basis of the principle of salary equalization. What is your opinion? [De Lucena] I believe that salary equalization is a utopia. It does not exist. What is important is to implement a salary policy that reduces today's foolishness. [ISTOE] Many military officers who were involved in the 1964 revolution believed that corruption in Brazil was monopolized by civilians. What is your opinion? [De Lucena] I disagree. I believe that because of its own structure the Army is in a better condition to repress corruption when it arises. In the Army there is immediate punishment. In addition, the admission criteria for the Army are much stricter than those for Congress. Nevertheless, I do not believe anyone holds a monopoly on corruption. [ISTOE] Do you admire any civilian leaders? [De Lucena] I have always been a fan of good administrators. Carlos Lacerda was a great administrator. There are also some contemporary politicians whom I greatly admire, such as Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Deputy Roberto Magalahes, who was governor of my home state. [ISTOE] Does the Army empathize with current events in Congress? [De Lucena] Absolutely. I was disgusted when I learned that public resources, which could have been put to good use, are serving personal interests. [ISTOE] Are there people in the Army who still believe that all politicians are thieves? [De Lucena] Of course there are. But this is also true of civilians. Wasn't it Lula who said that there were 300 swindlers in Congress? That is right. But this is unimportant, because the guilty will be punished. [ISTOE] You referred to the extreme poverty issue. Is the Army also concerned about violence, particularly that in Rio de Janeiro? [De Lucena] Undoubtedly, but this a very delicate issue about which I would not like to comment. [ISTOE] Will the much discussed Army intervention in the hills [of Rio de Janeiro] ever take place? [De Lucena] No, unless either the governor or the president requests it. We cannot take on the fight against violence, because the Constitution does not allow it. A 19-year-old serving in the Army is not trained to climb the hill and fight drug traffickers. As I have said, this is a very delicate issue. What we can do is what is being done: support the Federal Police and the local state police forces. [ISTOE] Was the military regime good or bad for Brazil? [De Lucena] It was good because it built an infrastructure that the country lacked. That cannot be denied. But from the point of view of political progress, of course it was harmful. [ISTOE] Will you stay in government until the end of the Franco administration? [De Lucena] Yes, unless they kick me out before that. [ISTOE] Do you believe there may some antagonism within the Army regarding Lula's candidacy? [De Lucena] I do not think so. What I can guarantee is the following: Whoever wins, will lead. The Army will guarantee the installation of the next president in compliance with the Constitution, whoever is elected. [ISTOE] What do you intend to do after the Franco administration, when you leave the Army? [De Lucena] I am going to try to be a good grandfather.
