He pointed out that it is necessary to pay attention to equal development of all regions of the Russian Federation, and primarily, to the creation of a legal basis adequate to economic reform to enable it to go ahead. Viktorov is against radical changes and welcomes an evolutional development of society. According to preliminary reports, Viktorov will be in charge of economic issues in the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament. He came out in support of principally new relations expected to be established between the centre and the subjects of the federation in the second quarter of 1994 when regions begin to contribute a definite amount to the federal budget, spending the remaining funds on their own needs.
