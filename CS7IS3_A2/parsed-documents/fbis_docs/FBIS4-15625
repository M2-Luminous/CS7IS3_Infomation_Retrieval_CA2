In a conversation with ITAR-TASS on Friday, Kuznetsov pointed out that, besides the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's naval forces, around 50 thousand Ukrainian soldiers and officers are concentrated on the peninsula. The amount of military personnel located here was twice as small before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The presidential aide expressed his doubts in the necessity of maintaining such powerful military forces in the Crimea. Referring to operational information, Kuznetsov noted that the Ukrainian Defence Ministry "plans to increase its military presence in the Crimea". The recent sudden visit of Ukraine's military leaders to the peninsula caused sharp indignation in the area and a sharp retaliatory statement from Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. Similar steps by Kiev, Kuznetsov declared, are not only "a form of pressure, but possible training before future actions intended to change the situation in the Crimea".
