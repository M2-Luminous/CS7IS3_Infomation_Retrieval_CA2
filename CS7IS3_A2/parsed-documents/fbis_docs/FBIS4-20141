In view of such a dramatic development, is the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] still able to maintain its position -- that is, to reject an armed intervention, including Bundeswehr soldiers? [Wieczorek-Zeul] The situation is horrible. However, it is correct that so far, no party in Germany has demanded that German pilots fly air raids in the former Yugoslavia. God knows that military restraint in this region is appropriate for us. Any armed intervention would only exacerbate the situation even more. As a last consequence, the question arises for the United States and NATO whether they should enter a ground war that cannot be won or whether they should try -- with military pressure and ultimatums as well -- to finally achieve political solutions, for example, at an international conference, as suggested by Yeltsin and Clinton. However, I also want to point out one thing. NATO does not need to intervene in Turkey because it is already there. Nevertheless, it has been watching thousands of Kurds being massacred in eastern Anatolia over the years. In Rwanda, the United Nations need not intervene either because it is already there with blue helmets. It is now withdrawing them and leaving 25,000 people who fled to its refuge to their fate. There are terrible double standards here. I feel that the discussion on the former Yugoslavia is often only used as a pretext in the domestic policy discussion in Germany to prepare completely different employment opportunities for the Bundeswehr. [Knapp] One can also point out that the UN Security Council, not the Federal Government, resolved the missions in what remains of Yugoslavia. [Wieczorek-Zeul] The UN Security Council adopted the resolutions, but the question of how and by whom they are to be implemented is the sovereign decision of each member country -- that is, also the FRG. The resolutions authorize the countries to become active, but they do not commit countries to war missions. The constitutional side is a completely different business: Before the Federal Constitutional Court, we are above all interested in putting an end to the creeping development where it is tried to dissolve the limits set by the Basic Law. The Federal Constitutional Court took our complaints very seriously, as was shown by the hearing. The Bundeswehr can only be used for its own defense and the defense of the alliance partners -- that is, the NATO states. Those who want other employment opportunities must change the Constitution. The SPD has also made it clear how far it is prepared to change the Constitution. [Knapp] How far? [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are explicitly saying: the possibility of blue helmet missions and participation in blockades, which are definitely also an instrument of military constraint. However, it has to be ensured that the German Parliament decides on every individual mission. Things must not develop in the direction of soldiers and young draftees being dispatched all over the world. After all, German soldiers, young draftees, have to be able to serve on a safe constitutional basis. [Knapp] What if NATO resolves further bombardments in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of the UN resolution? [Wieczorek-Zeul] Germany's participation in bombardments in the former Yugoslavia would be politically wrong and not covered by constitutional law. [Knapp] Even after an amendment to the constitution that would be supported by the SPD? [Wieczorek-Zeul] The Bundeswehr should not be involved in warfare. [Knapp] It is rumored that, with your opinion, you no longer represent the majority within the SPD Executive Committee, at any rate not Rudolf Scharping. [Wieczorek-Zeul] I am presenting the position that the SPD formulated in its party congress decisions. On this basis, we also presented the draft of a government program, which also reflects my position. Rudolf Scharping also made it repeatedly clear that the Bundeswehr will not participate in worldwide combat missions under a government led by the SPD. If someone wanted to change the SPD line, he would have to be open about his dealings. As for the rest: Everyone who demands that German soldiers should go to war has to ask himself: Is he prepared to go himself or only prepared to send others? I am personally not prepared to send young German draftees and soldiers to war.
