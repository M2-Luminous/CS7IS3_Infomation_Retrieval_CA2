There is not only the accord with Norway which is still clashing with the fisheries dossier, but also the Twelve's inability to agree on a joint position with regard to the decisionmaking process in the expanded Union. The latter threatens to endanger the current timetable, in other words, to postpone enlargement beyond the planned date of 1 January 1995. The British and the Spanish, intent on a better protection of their national interests, want a blocking minority that can more easily be reached than today; the other 10 member states, including France, have an opposite viewpoint and want to avoid a more cumbersome decisionmaking process in the expanded Europe. The failure, which is indicative of EU [European Union] frictions, is not yet definitive: A new meeting has been planned on 15 March and, if the Twelve find back to path of compromise, everything may still work out well. This dispute, however, indicates how hazardous it is to pursue an enlargement of the Union without having previously defined its goals and operational procedures. This precipitance was deliberate on the part of the EU heads of state and government, who are not really inclined to foment a difficult debate at home until the contrary winds emanating from public opinion as a result of the Maastricht Treaty have dropped. The Commission did not have the courage to oppose this procrastination which plays into the hands of the opponents of a federal Europe. Thus, the British rather favor an enlargement -- including the four European Free Trade Organization countries today, and the central European countries at a later date -- which would virtually annihilate the political links provided for in the Rome and Maastricht treaties and thrust the Union into the direction of a free trade zone. France did not want to oppose enlargement. It first advocated institutional reforms to accompany the enlargement process, but it renounced them in face of its partners' opposition, thus giving the impression that it did not know where it was going nor even were it wanted to go. Thus, the playing ground is now open to those, especially in Germany, who do no longer believe in the possibility of a political union in Europe. For 40 years, the French have orchestrated European construction -- sometimes maybe in a way irritating others. Their current failure creates a malaise, all the more so since it is suspected to be due to conceptual impotence. Political determination is often necessary, and, as we have seen during the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia issue, no only at the implementation the level.
