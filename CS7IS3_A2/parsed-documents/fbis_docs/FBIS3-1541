This action reflects the warmongering, bloodthirsty, and unpopular nature of the Futungoland Creoles who have opted for a military solution to the conflict, despite the ongoing Lusaka negotiations. The command of the patriotic and revolutionary Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola in the northeastern region wishes to inform the Angolan and international communities that it will not tolerate the MPLA-PT's [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] armed provocations and will not be responsible for the consequences. UNITA is ready to negotiate, but will never give in to the MPLA-PT, a totalitarian, Marxist, and undemocratic party.
