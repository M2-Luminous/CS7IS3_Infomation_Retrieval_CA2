FR940906-2-00080 FR940906-2-00066 [Docket Nos. STN 50&hyph;528, STN 50&hyph;529, and STN 50&hyph;530] Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. 41, 51, and 74, issued to Arizona Public Services Company for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Units 1, 2 and 3, respectively, located in Maricopa County, Arizona. The proposed amendment would add the analytical method supplement entitled ``Calculative Methods for the CE Large Break LOCA Evaluation Model for the Analysis of CE and W Designed NSSS,'' CENPD&hyph;132, Supplement 3&hyph;P&hyph;A, dated June 1985, to the list of analytical methods in TS Section 6.9.1.10 used to determine the PVNGS core operating limits. Additionally, further administrative changes are proposed to the list of analytical methods. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards considerations, which is presented below: Standard 1_Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The proposed change simply adds an NRC-approved LOCA [loss of coolant accident] evaluation methodology to the list of analytical methods used to determine core operating limits. The proposed change does not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] accident analyses. Since the UFSAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed change. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change to Section 6.9.1.10 does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Standard 2_Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Accordingly, no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change to Section 6.9.1.10 does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Standard 3_Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed change is administrative in nature in that an NRC-approved LOCA evaluation methodology is being added to the list of analytical methods used to determine core operating limits. Since the core operating limits are still being established by an NRC-approved methodology and will provide adequate core protection, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
