However, in some places, it was tens of times the normal value and a hundred times the norm in subsurface waters. The sources of tritium contamination have not been determined.... At the same time, in the Chernobyl zone, over the last year, the content of strontium and cesium in almost all the water ducts has increased by a factor of between one and a half and two. In the water of the reclaimed land on [the Dnieper's] left bank, it is four times the admissible concentration. Over the last year, the transfer of cesium with Prypyat River water to the Kiev reservoir has increased approximately fivefold and of strontium -- sevenfold. Even though the content of these radionuclides in the drinking water of the towns of Prypyat and Chernobyl is below the norm, it has also increased by a factor ranging between one and a half and seven.... Incidentally, last year, just one and a half percent of the Chernobyl fund was invested in the decontamination of the land; this fund accounts for 12 percent of the state budget.
