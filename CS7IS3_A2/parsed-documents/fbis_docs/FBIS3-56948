These are not military equipment deliveries, but a commercial deal, he said and explained that North Korea had bought through a Japanese company several decommissioned submarines from Russia which had been completely dismantled and cannot be restored as means of warfare. "We view it as an ordinary trade operation. Russia concludes similar commercial deals with other countries as well", Karasin said.
