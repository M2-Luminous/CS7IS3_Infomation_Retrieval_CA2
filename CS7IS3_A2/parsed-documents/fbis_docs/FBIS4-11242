Speaking at Miraflores Palace, Dr. Roosen broadly outlined the complex situation for reporters. He said this pact is intended to clarify the issuance of financial instruments, which can help ease the situation by decreasing the issuance of zero-coupon bonds and, in place of these bonds, issuing Treasury bills of exchange that would be purchased by domestic banks. [Begin Roosen recording] In accepting this important duty, we intend to coordinate between the Finance Ministry, the superintendency of banks, FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund], and the Central Bank of Venezuela in every way possible in an effort to establish a solidarity pact to restore confidence in the financial system. We will do this by implementing programs that lead to the recovery of subsidized banks, gradually reducing the current gap between passive and active interest rates in the national market, and seeking ways to use the system's financial surpluses in the placement of Treasury bills of exchange or financial instruments other than zero-coupon bonds, which has been the only available mechanism to remove surplus liquidity from circulation.
