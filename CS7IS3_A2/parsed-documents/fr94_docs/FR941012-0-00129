FR941012-0-00129 FR941012-0-00011 Three commenters said that the proposed provision was too broad to be useful since they believed all felling activities are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). While OSHA agrees that it may not be possible to eliminate all hazards in a workplace, the employer does have the responsibility to prevent or minimize hazards the employer can reasonably anticipate. To comply with this provision, it is incumbent on the employer to train employees in proper felling work practices and to point out when employee actions or workplace conditions could create hazards for employees. Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) requires that the immediate supervisor be consulted before felling is commenced, whenever unfamiliar or unusually hazardous conditions necessitate the supervisor's approval. The final rule adopts the provision contained in the proposed rule. One commenter supported the proposed requirement (Tr. W1 85). He said that consulting supervisors when heavy accumulations of snow are present would prevent injuries. OSHA believes that unusual, hazardous situations may arise during felling operations and the supervisor should be involved in making decisions about the safest way to fell a tree. These situations may include, but are not limited to, felling very large or tall trees; cutting trees whose lean, location or structure make it difficult to fell in the desired or a safe direction. Adding the supervisor's knowledge, training and experience to the decision-making process should help to minimize the hazards to loggers. In addition, this consultation process is especially important when logging crews are relatively new and may not have dealt with such situations before. Paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of the final rule requires that no yarding machine be operated within two tree lengths of any tree being manually felled. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. Several commenters raised questions about or discussed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;67; Tr. W1 104, W2 197). None of the commenters denied that yarding machine operators may be endangered when they operate too close to manual felling activities. However, two commenters stated that the provision should be revised because, in some circumstances, the assistance of a yarding machine is necessary to assure that the tree is felled in the desired direction or to keep the area clear (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;67). For example, one commenter said that failure of yarders to clear an area of a build up of felled trees or logs can result in timber breakage or can pose problems for fellers working on slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;67). In general, OSHA believes that allowing yarding machines within two tree lengths of trees being manually felled would pose a risk of harm to both the machine operator and the feller. First, a manual feller who is cutting a tree is concentrating on that work activity and not on other logging activities in the area. If that tree were to fall on a yarding machine that is too close to a manual felling operation, the machine operator could be injured by the tree. Second, it also is important for their own safety that manual fellers work at a safe distance from yarding activities. Yarder operators and chasers and choker setters concentrating on slinging and moving logs could cause injury to the feller if a tree or log were to shift, roll or slide suddenly. Third, yarding machine operators are often working downhill from manual fellers. It may be dangerous for the operator to approach the feller because the falling tree could roll or slide into the machine. Fourth, the requirements of this paragraph can still be met even where the feller and yarder work as a team. After the feller has cut a tree and is moving on to size up another tree for cutting, the yarder can remove the felled tree before the feller begins cutting the next tree. The feller should check to make sure the yarder has removed the tree out of the work area before he starts cutting. Therefore, OSHA believes that its general rule that each work area be separated by at least two tree lengths should also apply to yarding and manual felling operations.
