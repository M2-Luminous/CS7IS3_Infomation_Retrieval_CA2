The Defense Agency [DA], which has placed itself on alert, is trying to collect information. The United States has provided the DA with information compiled on the basis of photographs taken by U.S. reconnaissance satellites. According to that data, trucks loaded with fuel and cranes are assembling at a launch site in northeastern North Korea, and the missile's test-launching process is under way. The DPRK was expected to test-fire the missile in early June, but the prevailing view is that North Korea will test-fire it on 7 June because of information indicating that North Korea needs a few more days to make final preparations for the launch. The missile to be test-fired is believed to be the Nodong-1, which has a range of 1,000 km and which was test-fired last May. The DA has put Maritime Self-Defense Force P3-C antisubmarine aircraft on a state of alert to ready them for patrols over the Sea of Japan. The Air Defense-Self Force also has placed YS-11E electronics reconnaissance aircraft and E2-C airborne warning and control aircraft on standby status. In this way, DA is making preparations to collect a variety of information on North Korea's test-firing of the missile.
