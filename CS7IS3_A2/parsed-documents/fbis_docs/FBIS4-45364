This comment was made yesterday by General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, retired, the Peruvian representative before the Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD) of the OAS, who said there is no official report from the U.S. Government on this issue. He added: "All we know is of a decision by the U.S. Defense Department, which is not the official position of the U.S. Government." Velarde said the lack of information on narco-planes over Peruvian territory hurts drug enforcement considerably "but the government's political will is very strong. Peru will continue to fight trafficking with or without this information by using its own capabilities." Velarde labeled the U.S. decision as unilateral and temporary, adding that it is "probably a decision made by the U.S. Defense Department."
