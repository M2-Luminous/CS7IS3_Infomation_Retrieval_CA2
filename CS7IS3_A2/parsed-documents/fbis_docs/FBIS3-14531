The sources said that the invitations have been sent to Israel and the other states participating in the committee's proceedings, in accordance with the tradition pursued in the Madrid formula, which stipulated that the invitation should be sent by the state hosting the meeting and the cosponsors of the peace conference (United States and Russia). The sources told AL-HAYAH that Israel has also been invited among a limited and select group of states to attend a preliminary meeting at expert level to be held in Muscat on 5 April. The sources pointed out that Israel was among the states that participated in the researches and proposals which the Sultanate of Oman had been assigned to prepare within a comprehensive study on ways of developing sea water desalination technology. The experts meeting will meet to discuss the stage the study has reached so far. The sources said that this "distinguished" participation by Israel and other states in the region, especially neighboring Arab states like Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians, is a natural thing because these parties are closely concerned with the issues to be discussed.
