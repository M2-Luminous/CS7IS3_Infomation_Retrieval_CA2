ACTION: Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This Order and Further Notice Proposed Rulemaking seeks comments on issues relating to the filing of applications for new Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) facilities, applications for major changes in existing facilities, and major amendments to pending applications.

The Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comment on how the Commission's Rules might be revised to enhance the efficiency of a window filing system. It also lifts the freeze on the filing of applications of major changes to licensed facilities. The Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking responds to the comments received in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding. DATES: Comments are due by August 29, 1994 and reply comments are due by September 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul R. Gordon, Mass Media Bureau, Video Services Division, (202) 418&hyph;1630.

Synopsis of Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 1. This OFNPRM further considers amending the Commission's rules to alter the procedures governing the acceptance of applications for new Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) stations, major amendments to such applications, or major changes in existing stations. We also seek comment on several additional proposals put forth by the commenters and on our motion intended to increase the efficiency and curtail potential abuse of our application processes. Finally, we modify the freeze on the filing of major change applications, which we adopted earlier in this proceeding, to permit the filing of major change applications and any competing applications thereto.
