FR940712-1-00061 FR940712-1-00012 Moreover, the Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule, with its fee schedule, affects only that segment of the communications industry operating on the public lands. There are 57 FM radio broadcast sites, 26 television broadcasting facilities, and approximately 3,200 other permits in effect on these lands. Available records do not indicate how many of these permits are held by small entities. The phase-in of annual fees proposed in this rule will allow any small entities that may be affected to adjust to the new fees over a period of time and thereby minimize the risk of adverse impact due to the magnitude of some fee increases under the rule. Because the rule will result in no taking of private property and no impairment of property rights, the Department certifies that this rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights, as required by Executive Order 12630. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
