Yesterday evening he had dinner with President Lennart Meri and this morning met with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik. The following has been transcribed and translated by Juri Arusoo and Mari-Ann Rikken of the Press and Information Department of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Raul Malk (in Estonian): Over the course of two days we have had good talks. There is nothing concrete to announce at this stage. We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as possible. And now I hope you hear about the same. Meaning from Mr. Churkin. Vitaliy Churkin (in Russian): This is my first press conference where I can't understand my colleague's language, but it is not a problem because I'll say about the same. First of all we are very satisfied with the atmosphere and character of the discussions which took place in Tallinn and which began a few days ago in Genevea. We are grateful to the Estonian side, and Mr. Malk. I had an opportunity as well to have a substantive discussion with the foreign minister and yesterday an informal, but long, interesting, and substantive meeting with President Meri. We are thankful to the Estonian side for providing such good conditions, for creating such an atmosphere of goodwill for these negotiations. It seems to me that we can say that we didn't talk only in a spirit of goodwill, but with a sincere attempt on both sides to solve as quickly as possible those questions which still remain, in order that we can turn the page, perhaps even finish an entire chapter in the history of our relations. To begin to write a new chapter starting with a new page, having solved completely those complicated problems which we have spent the last few months discussing. Now, however we have reached, as we hope, the final stage as concerns the understandings and agreements which were achieved by Russian Minister Kozyrev during his recent stay in Tallinn. ITAR-TASS (in Russian): What were the concrete problems which were discussed? Churkin (in Russian): The same which has been under discussion by the Estonian-Russian state delegations over a long period of time. First of all, the problems of the completion of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Republic of Estonia and here primarily the issues which are not yet agreed upon. The issue connected with military pensioners. Also the issue of dismantling the installation at Paldiski. Well, and we also touched on other questions -- general political questions which concern Estonian- Russian relations. Rhohtuleht, Ille Gruen-Ots (in Russian): What do you think, is the deadline August 31 realistic? Churkin (in Russian): I believe there is nothing unrealistic about it. But there must be a firm basis, there have to be agreements. And then we can energetically do that which is necessary to complete withdrawal. ITAR-TASS (in Russian): The Estonian side does not rule out use of force if the withdrawal is not completed by August 31. How do you react to this? Churkin (in Russian): I do not think it is so. Regarding Estonian positions, then we analyze and draw conclusions based upon statements by responsible individuals, Estonian state officials. And we do not have the slightest suspicion that the Estonian position consists of the need to solve problems politically, via negotiations. I want to emphasize that the official position of the Russian leadership position is exactly the same. These questions must be solved via dialogue, not in any other way. Q (in Russian): Did you discuss a possible meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Meri? Churkin (In Russian): Concretely this was not discussed. Rhohtuleht (in Russian): When will you meet again? Churkin (in Russian): Yes, we invited Mr. Malk and his colleagues -- thank you for asking this question -- to Moscow in the near future, as soon as this can be arranged. We believe that such a meeting may take place already next week. Baltic Independent, Tarmu Tammerk (in English): What kinds of agreements should there be on military pensioners between Estonia and Russia? Churkin (in English): I'd rather not go into details of our discussions because these are -- this is -- an on-going issue between us. We hope that this will -uh- be a realistic agreement which will remove any possibility of tensions in our relations and - uh- would also be up to the count very high international standards of human rights. Lisa Trei (in English): Can you be specific about what you mean by realistic agreement? Churkin (in English): No, I cannot. (Laughter) Tammerk (in English): Will it be the point of the pull-out agreement? Churkin (in English): I'd rather not be specific at this time. Thank you very much. In Russian: Thank you.
