Jerusalem believes Davos will not be the last station in the negotiations with the Palestinians. A member of the Israeli delegation to the Swiss talks forecasted last night that 'Arafat and Peres will not sign any agreement tomorrow. This evaluation is based on the reports from Cairo that the drafting team, headed by Uri Savir and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], did not reach understandings. Following two days of preparatory talks, the teams managed to produce only a document detailing the points of agreement and disagreement between the PLO and Israel. The two main points of disagreement are still the border crossings -- in particular Israel's demand to inspect suspicious-looking Palestinians passing through the crossings -- and Jericho's jurisdiction. Peres and 'Arafat will meet tomorrow, but they may hold preliminary talks today to try to overcome the points in dispute. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had a tete-a-tete meeting with Foreign Minister Peres last night prior to Peres' departure for Davos today. Rabin is firm in his opposition to any concessions or further flexibility on security issues. That is the position Peres presented to 'Arafat in Oslo, and although the atmosphere there was optimistic, the evaluations regarding Davos are more pessimistic.
