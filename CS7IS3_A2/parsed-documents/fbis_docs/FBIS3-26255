Today, referring to one of Shanghai's experiences in accelerating reform and opening up, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said: "Great vistas are one step ahead." Huang Ju had just arrived in Beijing to report on the work of Shanghai and had long talks with Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji. He left Beijing for Shanghai by train only yesterday (15 Jan) morning, and immediately convened a meeting for the Shanghai Municipal Government's senior officials. The meeting lasted an entire day and concluded only at dusk. At noon today, he met with this paper's responsible person and discussed Shanghai's accomplishments of recent years and future development with full confidence. "Vast vistas are one step ahead" was a summation of the province's experiences as well as the direction for future development. Support From the Central Authorities, Shanghai's Efforts To Bring Credit to China Huang Ju said that Shanghai had found good opportunities while undergoing great changes over the past two years and pointed out that that was an impetus to all of China as well as the consequence of the entire country's support in urging Shanghai on. Briefly, he generalized the situation into three phrases: The Central Authorities' concern, support from the entire country, and Shanghai's efforts to bring credit to China. Huang Ju revealed that, when Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai early last year, he offered encouragement with the following remarks: It is hoped that Shanghai will brave the wind and waves in the new year, advance with steady steps, and overcome difficulties to scale new heights. Huang Ju said that Shanghai had exerted efforts to bring credit to China by making some changes every year and effecting great changes within three years. In 1993, Shanghai actually made some accomplishments. Huang Ju said that he told the Central leading members that Shanghai's economic changes were not unitary, but were entirely directional. The primary change was that the economic growth rate was sustained, healthy, and rapid [as published] and the quality of economic operations scaled a new height. He indicated that Shanghai's growth rate in 1992 and 1993 (with an increase of 14.8 and 14.9 percent respectively) had doubled the growth rate of the 1980's. Particularly rapid development was seen in tertiary industry, which accounted for 38 percent of the GNP; it was originally planned that this industry would account for 40 or 45 percent of GNP by the year 2000, and now it seems that this could be achieved in 1994. Tertiary industry had already made great strides. Huang Ju stressed that, in development, Shanghai needed a market, quality, and economic returns. He said: "A good growth rate without a market will be ineffective; similarly, a good rate that is not backed up by certain progress in development does not reflect Shanghai's due status; and a satisfactory rate that does not produce economic returns is useless." He cited industry as an example. Last year, the output-marketing ratio was 98.8 percent, and the national average output-marketing ratio was between 92 and 94 percent. An output-marketing ratio of 97 percent is universally acknowledged as a healthy ratio throughout the world. He indicated that Shanghai's GNP growth rate was 2 percentage points higher than the nation's average, which was beyond one's imagination in the past; furthermore, the growth in financial revenues was higher than that of GNP. Last year, financial revenues increased by 30 percent -- 15 percentage points higher than GNP growth -- an unprecedented event in the history of Shanghai's development. Of course, that figure should not be too high, for it would not be normal. Recalling the three occasions of marcoeconomic regulation and control in the 1980s, Huang Ju said that, during the ups and downs at that time, the downswing was faster, had a wider scope, and was slower to turn around. We hoped that, in the 1990's, the downswing would be slower, would have a narrower scope, and would be quick in turning around, so that the negative effects of fluctuation on Shanghai would be minimized. Shanghai achieved this in 1993 as it benefited from national macroeconomic regulation and control. He said that the marked increase in Shanghai's financial revenues had its own peculiarity, which was related to the fact that Shanghai had built several large markets over the past three years, including the monetary, securities, and production materials markets. If we look at the securities market for example, we notice that the transaction volume in 1993 was 520 billion yuan. All this showed that the changes in Shanghai were not easily achieved. It would have been impossible had it not been for the principle of reform, the results of restructuring in the previous five years, and the support of the state's large markets. Such changes fall in line with the market trend. Regarding the people's living standards, the per capita income of Shanghai workers and staffers was 5,520 yuan in 1993, up by 30 percent from the previous year; taking inflation into account, the net increase was 8.2 percent. Between 1991 and 1990, prices rose 50 percent overall in Shanghai, and the wages of workers and staffers doubled. Per Capita Income Exceeded 5,000 Yuan Last Year Great changes have taken place in Shanghai's urban construction in recent years. Huang Ju said that the man in the street could observe this directly; some foreign businessmen have said that things had changed after being away from the city for three months, and some people have even exaggerated, saying that Shanghai is changing everyday. Huang Ju said that, last year, Shanghai pursued 46 urban construction projects, with an investment of 14.6 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of the total investment in urban construction in the 1980's. Shanghai had lagged far behind in construction in the past, because it had not undertaken any building projects for 40 years. Central leaders visited Shanghai and said that the city had changed. The current Shanghai Government accelerated construction on the basis of its predecessor; it was making up for the past and trying to avoid lagging behind once again in order to meet the needs of the new situation. According to Huang Ju, one of the characteristics of urban construction is to pay attention to housing construction; 5 million square meters of floor space was completed in 1992, and this figure reached 6 million in 1993. Hopefully, 7 million square meters of floor space will be created this year. Should the situation develop in this direction, by 1997 or 1998, Shanghai will have done away with all old houses that are not equipped with toilets and gas stoves. Huang Ju believed that Shanghai's urban construction embodied many aspects of the spirit of China's socialist construction; for example, urban construction should fall in line with the direction of market economic restructuring. Shanghai has primarily been pursuing installations that are urgently required for market economic construction; for example, the Yangpu Bridge was completed within two years, and Yanggao Road (Pudong's trunk line) was completed in 1992, the very same year that it broke ground. In capital construction, a strategy of focusing efforts on completing a project was adopted to embody the advantages of socialism, while observing international construction standards to ensure Shanghai's level, quality, rate, and economic returns. Huang Ju revealed that a U.S. expert had told him after a visit to Shanghai that it was impossible to do such things in such a short period. He called on the building industry to focus on building houses whenever funds were available to reduce effects on residents and to complete the project as quickly as possible once it broke ground. He said that, to reassure the public, there must be a notice which includes when the project would break ground, when it would be completed, and whom should be contacted if problems appear. Ordinary people were to be the ones who finally checked and accepted the houses, and prominent individuals involved in the construction would cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. Calling on the People To Be Well-Informed and Support Construction Regarding key projects in urban construction, it was required that ordinary people "should be well-informed and show understanding through support and participation." There were times, however, when some departments might fail to understand and give their support; under such circumstances, Municipal Party Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo would speak on behalf of the municipal party committee in support of the government's decision. There was a flood in 1991. It was a year of price reform, the year that restrictions were first lifted from vegetable prices, and it involved great difficulties. Some people believed that the mayor was too bold in conducting price reform. Through study, the municipal government believed it to be feasible; however, some people at the grass-roots level were not convinced. Again, Wu Bangguo expressed where he stood on behalf of the municipal party committee and supported the government's move to lift restrictions from vegetable prices. Consequently, by the end of the year, Shanghai had smoothly tided over the difficulties, and the market was reinvigorated. Huang Ju had been to Japan studying modern administration. He generalized some important experiences regarding the administration of China advancing toward a modern metropolitan environment. He said that Shanghai should go by the sequence of reform, development, and stability; namely, should put reform above all else and promote development with reform, for only development under the mechanism of reform was effective reform. Only stability at a new level achieved through reform and development was genuine stability. However, regarding specific reform measures, the sequence should be the other way round; namely, the growth rate and the scope of reform should be determined by the bearing capacity of stability. Otherwise, it would amount to twice the work with half the results. Launching Second Round of Reform by Taking Initiative in Shanghai's Own Hands Huang Ju stressed that, in leading economic work, it was necessary to seek truth from facts, adapt to local conditions, give categorized guidance, and comply with Chinese characteristics as well as the characteristics of the times and Shanghai. Huang Ju once said that "to be one step ahead, it is imperative to move one step sideways." When this statement became known, it changed into "Huang Ju does not want leadership." Huang Ju explained that this statement meant that, to be one step ahead in reform, it was imperative to take one step away from other fraternal provinces and municipalities, to the effect that Shanghai did not have to follow the nation's unified pattern in pursuing construction. He cited an example, saying that the Shanghai municipal government set out the need to do a good job of internal and external balance in accordance with Shanghai's actual conditions. Shanghai's practice, however, should not be presented to the entire nation, just like Shanghai could not copy Hong Kong's way of doing things. He said that China was too large a country, and conditions in various places are different; China opposed rushing headlong into mass action, breaking up in pandemonium, or requiring unanimity in everything. Huang Ju said that Shanghai had told the Central Committee where it stood; specifically, under the prerequisites of socialism, central unified leadership, and central unified macroeconomic regulation and control, Shanghai would not hand over a penny less than the central government required. Huang Ju said he might as describe it as "financing reform with self-raised funds, conducting reform by personally taking the initiative, and taking the lead in reform." He added that, during his most recent trip to Beijing, he expressed the hope that, under the prerequisites of central unified leadership, unified macroeconomic regulation and control, and the unified market of the whole country, Shanghai could be ensured of a market, quality, and economic returns, while conducting the second round of reform by taking the initiative in the city's own hand. Happily, Huang Ju said, the Central Authorities supported this idea, and he indicated that Shanghai presently enjoys the best opportunities, most favorable geographical position, and greatest support of the people since the PRC's founding. Shanghai citizens saw this point, too. Even though they might have some complaints about the municipal administration and aired their grievances, they do not really harbor anger in their hearts.
