Over the past several years, CYL organizations at all levels and the vast numbers of CYL members and youths in the province have taken an active part in the spring tide of reform and opening up, plunged into economic construction, strived to create a new civilized atmosphere, put all their energies into study with a view to becoming professional, and made great contributions to the province's socialist modernization cause. As a result, a large number of advanced and exemplary figures have come to the fore. The provincial CYL committee decided to choose some representatives from the fourth term of the province's new Long-March shock workers, shock brigades, and pacesetters and organize them as a team to make a circuit of some colleges in the province to give reports on their advanced and model deeds. When meeting with members of this team, Jiang Chunyun highly appraised the advanced deeds of the new Long-March shock workers and shock brigades. He said: You are advanced pacesetters of the youths in the province and representatives of shock workers. In you, we can see the image of the new-type persons being politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and disciplined, that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Your deeds have fully manifested the spiritual feature of the new-type persons, and thus you should be respected by the vast numbers of youths and by society as a whole. On behalf of the provincial party committee, I express my respect and extend congratulations to you. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the new situation of carrying out reform, opening to the outside world, and developing the socialist market economy, it is all the more important to carry forward the spirit of being politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and disciplined. As young people, we should be resolved to become professional and should have lofty ideals first. From a long-term point of view, the ideal of we communists is to realize communism. The fighting objective at the present age is to build China into a prosperous, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist country. Only with such a fighting objective, the ideal and faith will be provided with a spiritual pillar, and we will be able to work hard and forge ahead. Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should embrace a correct outlook on life and a correct outlook on value and should make clear for whom they should serve and work. China is a socialist country led by the CPC. All citizens and all youths should embrace the outlook of value of selflessly serving the people and the motherland rather than being bent solely on profit. Our personal value cannot be realized unless we make contributions to the party and the state. Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should improve their abilities and skills of making contributions to the party and the state. This is the only way to turn the strong desire of serving the people into reality and to yield the greatest results. Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that the young people will carry forward the pioneering spirit of hardworking, truly carry out the 64-character pioneering spirit set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin, and strive to become the youths who can accomplish something and who are needed by the party and the people. Jiang Chunyun stressed: To become the new-type persons being politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and disciplined, we should, what is most important, strengthen study, particularly studying well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, and should use this theory to arm our heads and improve our theoretical expertise so that we can stand high and see far. We should also study the basic knowledge on market economy and the knowledge on modern science. At the same time, we should be brave in practice and should strive to make innovations, absorb nutrition, and enrich and enhance ourselves in practice so that we can become people well trained in not only theory but also practice. Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the series activities launched by the provincial CYL committee on learning from advanced and exemplary figures and regarded the launching of these activities as a good method to educate and guide the vast numbers of youths. He called on CYL organizations to carry out the activities of learning from the advanced in a profound and sustained manner, and, through the advanced deeds of these exemplary youths, conduct a vivid, realistic, and convincing ideological education among the vast numbers of youths. He also encouraged the numerous youths in the province to make even greater contributions to the province's reform, opening up, and modernization drive.
