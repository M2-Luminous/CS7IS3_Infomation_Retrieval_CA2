The Western Transvaal farming town lies in the heart of an area that has seen at least 29 sabotage attempts on train lines, ANC offices, power pylons and private property in the past two months. [passage omitted] [see Selected Video Reports section for accompanying video footage] This week, intelligence sources said the rightwingers responsible for the sabotage campaign that has included targets in the PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] area, the Free State, and the Western Transvaal, had clearly modeled themselves on the IRA. Using cells of only one or two members, they are completely independent and operate without orders. ANC organiser Moses Mothupi said Wednesday's attack on the organisation's offices in Letsopa was a retaliatory raid for the distribution of ANC election posters the week before. Neighbours said they neither heard nor saw anything of the blast, though several residents had heard rumours of a mysterious white minibus cruising the township streets the night before. In Ottesdal itself, the townsfolk say it's too early to say who was behind he blast -- but they wouldn't be surprised if it was the ANC themselves. The police in the Western Transvaal say they have had no luck so far in identifying anyone in connection with the spate of blasts in the area. Intelligence sources said they doubted any arrests would be made "unless the police get lucky." Intelligence officers are combing thousands of files in an attempt to identify radical rightwingers, but they frankly admit there is little chance of stopping the saboteurs unless a cell can be infiltrated -- something that has proved difficult in recent months. The explosives used include home-made devices concocted from diesel fuel and fertiliser, but commercial explosives have also been used in several blasts. One intelligence source said outdated stock from mines was the main source. Security forces are desperate to put an end to the bombings -- but intelligence sources say the right wing has the capability to "completely disrupt this country -- and there is little we can do about it." "We don't have a plan to combat them, we are undermanned and our biggest problem is that everything we do gets leaked to them in advance," said one frustrated senior SADF [South African Defence Force] source, who believes the rightwing campaign will "get worse" as the election date nears.
