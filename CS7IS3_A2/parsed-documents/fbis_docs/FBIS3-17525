In particular, the allocation of plots of land until the end of this year's harvest campaign so as to not create turmoil during the field work. The request by the Defense Ministry to allocate them plots of land for farming has also been refused. Those attending the meeting found it reasonable if the military, instead of owing allotments, would cooperate with farmers and farms in the production of agricultural products. The government's meeting, which was chaired by Abbas Dzhumagulov, discussed all the suggestions of the commission on elaborating a resolution on the urgent measures aimed at carrying out the republican land reform in accordance with the president's decree. The commission has elaborated a precise document that will be used as a manual by the agricultural sector of the economy. In particular, the Minselkhozprod (?the ministry of agricultural products) can only address issues connected with land reform, and it is also made responsible for it. It will cooperate with ministries and departments. The agricultural committees on the sites will contribute to this. The document also specified tasks of educational, cattle-breeding, and seed farms, as well as some other issues. Special emphasis was paid to the role of the mass media in covering the land reform and ways of implementing it. The document is to be published in the press.
