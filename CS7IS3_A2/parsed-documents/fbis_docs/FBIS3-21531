A high ranking official of the Russian Space Agency (RSA) told Interfax that "members of the Russian state commission under RSA Director General Yuriy Koptev must leave for Almaty on March 1." He emphasized that "the drafts that were submitted by the Russian negotiators in Moscow at the end of January have been agreed on, only minor points have to be clarified." In his view, the Almaty meeting "is likely to finalize documents that will be signed by the presidents of the two countries in a near future." Baykonur, the largest space launching station of the former USSR and the world, became Kazakhstan's property when the republic won independent in October 1991. All its launching pads are still manned by the Russian Space Force which, in the words of Koptev, "wants to continue operating Baykonur for at least 15 to 20 years more." Experts say that most Russian space missions cannot be launched elsewhere. What is more, Russia has commitments to joint programs, in particular with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the U.S.A. it has signed a $400 Mn contract on construction of an international orbital station and commercial launches of western satellites by Russian Proton boosters which can be launched only from Baykonur pads.
