At the ceremony inaugurating the Republic of China [ROC] Anti-Drug Promotion Group, Ma said that the work against narcotics should be deeply rooted in people's minds, and that it depends on both government and civilian efforts. He said the anti-drug movement must be jointly pushed by both government and people, since the moet powerful weapons against illegal drugs are in the hands of citizens themselves. Executive director of the newly-established group Liu Chang-luen said he and group members will take concrete actions over a long period of time in line with Premier Lien Chan's policy of combining government and civilian efforts in a war against drugs. Those attending the inauguration ceremony at the Taipei international convention center included Vice Justice Minister Lin Hsi-hu, Legislator Rau Ying-chi, and National Assemblyman Tsai Chung-chi.
