These companies will send a letter to the law firm representing the U.S. Government before 25 March, the deadline set by the United States for a reply, and inform it of their rejection. Since the Japanese parties have come out clearly with the intention of contesting the claim, there is now a strong possibility that the U.S. Government will file a lawsuit. Nishimatsu, a second-tier general contractor, denied there was any inflation of contract fees through bid-rigging as claimed by the United States. It stated with confidence: "The profit (from the Atsugi Base construction work) was a few percent. We are still undecided about whether or not to respond to the lawsuit [sosho ni ojiru ka do ka], but if we compile the available data at that time to argue our case, we will surely win." Penta-Ocean Construction Company, Ltd., also said: "We will just state in a brief letter that we say `no.'" Maeda Corporation, which currently holds chairmanship of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, says "we cannot meet the demand." It will send out the letter of rejection on 24 March.
