Speaking at the airport upon his arrival last night, Hurd said he hopes to hear about the ongoing peace process, but he did not bring with him any new proposals. Dani Gur-Arye reports: [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd flew from Beirut to Ben-Gurion Airport last night for his first visit to Israel in three years. He was greeted by Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who said Israel is eager to brief Britain on the latest developments in the peace process. Secretary Hurd said relations between Israel and Britain had been strengthened over the last three years. He said the Middle East peace process had gained a certain momentum, and there was no going back on what had been achieved. Hurd was asked if he is bringing to Israel proposals to help get the talks with the Palestinians back on track. [Hurd] I don't wish to suppose or lead you to suppose that I have in my suitcase some bright ideas on these subjects. No, that is not our role; that is not our role. If from time to time we can facilitate....[pauses] I've just had a fascinating dinner in Beirut with the three Lebanese presidents [as heard], and I will discuss that aspect also tomorrow. Maybe from time to time one can facilitate understanding, but I wouldn't put it higher than that. On the economic side, of course we are very interested in how the Israel-PLO agreement develops and how it broadens out. So that side certainly, but I wouldn't certainly cast myself in any kind of role of intermediary. [Gur-Arye] Hurd also said he hopes to discuss other issues with the Israeli leaders, including Israel's trade policy with the EC. The British foreign secretary is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Rabin today. He said he would also meet with family members of Israel's MIA's. [end recording]
