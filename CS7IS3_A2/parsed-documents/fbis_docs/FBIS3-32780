A recent report from the Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union says the government fails to comply with international human rights norms in important ways, ranging from the way it treats Haitians to instances of interference with the freedom of religion -- passing through racial and sexual discrimination, police brutality, and other such things along the way. The two organizations carried out this study in the hopes of breaking down the cynical official posture that international law protects human rights only outside the borders of the United States. Other areas of concern are the systematic, deep-rooted discrimination against women in matters of education, employment, and salaries; overcrowded prisons; and abuse of the death penalty.
