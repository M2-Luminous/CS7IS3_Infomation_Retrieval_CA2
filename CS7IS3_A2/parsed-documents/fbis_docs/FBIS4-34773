FBIS4-34773 "drlat122_b_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Foreign Ministry: Senator Graham Persona Non Grata Foreign Ministry: Senator Graham Persona Non Grata FL2306215294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 23 Jun 94 FL2306215294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Haiti has energetically protested the thoughtless statements by U.S. Senator Robert Graham on the occasion of his visit to Cite Solel on Saturday, 18 May [date as heard]. His statements, the Ministry says, are contrary to all norms of international law and can in no way be tolerated by the government of the Republic. Mr. Graham's provocation is all the more unacceptable in his having taken advantage of the Haitian people's hospitality to threaten the sovereignty of this country and openly call for its invasion. There is no doubt that Mr. Graham's cynical statements lie within the scope of his electoral campaign. Following Mr. Graham's unspeakable behavior, the government of the Republic of Haiti declares him persona non grata and his presence no longer accepted on national territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Haiti takes this opportunity to invite foreigners to refrain from interfering in Haiti's internal affairs. It should be recalled that Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Port-au-Prince, came out in favor of a multinational military intervention in Haiti in case of failure of the international sanctions. He asserted that President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide was favorable to that as a necessary last resort.
