On the other Hand, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, pointed out at a recent all-Army meeting on fighting corruption and advocating clean conduct that the Army's anticorruption drive must uphold high standards. Since implementation in China of the polices of reform, opening up, and the market economy, the income gap between the Army and the local authorities has continuously widened, and the social status of soldiers has fallen. Some military units "are not content with lagging behind," so they try hard to make money. The Chinese Army already had the "tradition" of engaging in production and operation, so military units and soldiers have become increasingly active in business operations, to the extent that news has continued to arrive about the military using military equipment in smuggling activities. These phenomena not only lower the quality of the Army and hurt its image, but also shake the minds of soldiers. According to informed sources, the Central Military Commission already has decided to "maintain a clean and honest Army with high salaries," so as to combat corruption and reestablish the good image of the Chinese military. According to information, wages for officers -- from the level of Central Military Commission chairman to the regiment, company, and platoon levels -- will be greatly adjusted, and their wages will be higher than those of government officials at the same level by several times. For example, an officer at the division level will earn more than 1,000 yuan, whereas a public servant at the corresponding department or bureau level in the government will not earn more than 700 yuan, according to the new wage system. According to information, the chairman of the Central Military Commission will make more than 3,000 yuan, which is much higher than that for the premier. Informed sources said that the measure adopted by the Army is at least aimed at restoring the sense of honor and the relatively superior living standard and status of soldiers characteristic of the time shortly after the CPC came to power. In the 1950's and '60's, the pay of a soldier on the mainland was higher than that of a local government official at the corresponding level by two "administrative ranks" (about 30 percent higher). Some scholars in Beijing also have proposed that the Army should be strictly banned from doing business, that the Army must be maintained by revenues, and that the Chinese Army's traditional function of being a "production brigade" must be changed and that links between the Army and commercial activities must be completely severed. On the other hand, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed at a recent all-Army meeting on discipline inspection that the work to combat corruption and advocate clean conduct within the Army must uphold high standards. XINHUA quoted Liu Huaqing as saying that under the new situation, the Army shoulders a great historic mission and must provide a strong and forceful security guarantee to the country's reform, opening up, and modernization construction. The Army certainly has to do better in the building of party work style and honesty, which is an important aspect of the spiritual civilization construction. Party committees and leaders at various levels must uphold high standards, meet strict demands, and further enhance their awareness and sense of responsibility for anticorruption work and honesty. Liu Huaqing said that the senior cadres within the Army must have a sense of the overall situation and must strictly abide by political discipline. They must resolutely implement whatever things are decided by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, refrain from doing whatever has been banned by orders, and honestly do whatever is stipulated by systems, so as to really toe the party line politically, mentally, and practically. Leading cadres, especially senior cadres, must have deeds conforming to words in being honest and self-disciplined, and earnestly practice what they advocate. They must strictly enforce the various systems and regulations in the area of party work style and clean government building that have been stipulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, and must be a model in serving the people wholeheartedly and in enforcing discipline.
