FBIS4-52729 "dreas093_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 North Korea Foreign Media Condemn U.S. Acts Against DPRK Foreign Media Condemn U.S. Acts Against DPRK SK1205223294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1503 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205223294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign news media condemned the United States and its followers for kicking up a row of "nuclear suspicion" against Korea. The Syrian paper NIDAL AL SHA'B said the United States has schemed to open all facilities of people's Korea through the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and instigated the IAEA to put pressure on Korea to bring it to its knees. The paper exposed that the purpose of the row of "nuclear suspicion" by Washington that shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula is to make people's Korea kneel down, not to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. A Czech paper charged that even after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had sincerely implemented the agreed points reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York, the United States put forth an unreasonable precondition, spreading a rumour that North Korea is not only producing nuclear weapons but also intending to "attack" South Korea. The act of the United States is a laughing-stock of the world, said the paper. The Mozambican magazine TEMPO noted that it is a gross violation of the U.N. charter that the United States reversed the agreed points of the DPRK-USA contact in New York and brought the "nuclear issue" to the United Nations. The magazine stressed that the U.N. Security Council should refrain from violating the U.N. charter to follow the lead of the United States and the United States should withdraw all its Armed Forces of aggression including nuclear weapons from South Korea and take a sincere attitude toward the DPRK-USA talks.
