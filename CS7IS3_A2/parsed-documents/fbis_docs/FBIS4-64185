The predictions submitted by five of the six institutes are at the upper limit of the margin predicted by the government in January. You, Professor Jens, ought really to show some remorse here and clearly distance yourself from your polemical remarks which were marked by little economic understanding. We have the chance that actual growth this year could turn out to be even higher than predicted in the institutes' report. The current economic indicators, and I would ask you to take a look at them, point to a tangible improvement in the overall economic situation. Business expectations in west German industry, an important early indicator of future economic developments, have improved substantially, as IFO [Institute for Economic Research] shows. In the autumn of 1992 pessimistic responses outnumbered optimistic responses by 42; today the positive expectations outnumber the negative by eight. Incoming orders in the manufacturing sector were 2.5 percent higher in real terms during the first two months of this year than the same period a year ago. Incoming orders from abroad have risen 9 percent in real terms. At the same time, the construction sector has recorded an increase in orders of 8.5 percent, and housing construction registered growth of no less than 30 percent. Exports during January and February rose 2.5 percent compared with the same period last year, and industrial capacity utilization has been increasing tangibly since the third quarter of last year. In all, gross domestic product is likely to be substantially higher during the first quarter of 1994 than over the same period last year. Permit me to say with regard to eastern Germany, I can only advise the ladies and gentlemen of the opposition to gain an impression at first hand of the determination with which people are tackling things there. Statistics give only an abstract picture. The real picture is positive. Construction orders have risen 37 percent, and by 85 percent in housing construction. Building activity overall is up 20 percent. [passage omitted: Social Democratic Party Deputy Uwe Jens criticizes earlier predictions and says unemployment will continue to increase] I cannot agree with you, let me say that straight away. But your prayer wheel-like comments about poor economic prospects are refuted by the facts I have just described. When you talk of flourishing landscapes, the chancellor and all of us were wrong in terms of the timescale, and we have had to revise our estimates because we did not know the extent to which the GDR's economy had decayed and no one knew that the Soviet Union would not continue in its existing form. What we have achieved in eastern Germany over the last three years, in spite of assuming such a legacy, is something to be proud of and the people in eastern Germany won't let you talk as if it doesn't exist. They are confident, they know that things are getting better, it just doesn't suit you in political terms that things are getting better; it's as simple as that; you can talk as much as you like, but the people involved know better. [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not dispute the fact that we have huge problems on the labor market. We cannot sit back and relax as a result of the signs that the recession is over. No one would deny that strong economic growth is not sufficient to solve the structural problems of unemployment. I can only say we must initially keep a hold on things and the people of this country must also be aware that we have found our feet with regard to the economy, that interest rates are noticeably lower, that profits are rising again and thus conditions for investment have improved, and, particularly, that the unions and trade unions have more understanding, also with regard to the flexibility which is necessary. We have structured our economic policy in such a way that, due to the improved economic conditions, we will not hesitate and will not ease off in our efforts to get to grips with the structural problems which have grown, not only in our country but also due to world economic developments. As businesses and employers, and also as a state, we have to do a whole lot more in the areas of research, development, and innovation. We have to improve our presence on the booming markets all over the world. I have just returned from the Asian-Pacific conference, and if you can go and see what is happening outside Germany in this region, then you will return convinced that we will not succeed without additional stability, without additional efforts, without changes which will lead to an end to the paralysis. However, I am optimistic that we can achieve this. Ladies and Gentlemen: We have a number of aims to achieve, which we are constantly pursuing. We have -- I just mentioned this -- made mistakes in the areas of research, development, and innovation. The answer is not merely to put a few million marks more into large companies for research purposes. The answer can only be to change our education system to make it more efficient, introduce more interchangeability, and finally overcome the hostility to technology in this country, the skepticism, which you are increasing every day. [applause] The structural problems and thus unemployment can only be overcome when we finally get round to removing and simplifying laws and statutes, stop putting off deregulation, and put speedier processes in place in the towns and villages -- especially in the ones governed by you [Social Democratic Party] -- thus giving people the feeling that when they go to the administration the people working there are working for them, the citizens, and not the other way round. That is what we mean by deregulation. [applause] We want to continue privatization and believe we have made quite some progress on this score as a federal government. Not many states and local communities have done so; quite a lot still remains to be done there. We have already talked about the consolidation of budgets, Ladies and Gentlemen. The government's consolidation course will be continued rigidly and consistently. No one would deny that state borrowing is too high, and no one would deny that we cannot afford to let net borrowing go on growing as it has done in recent years. I would, however, like to ask, as others have done, for fairness. We would like it to be noted and appreciated why things have developed like this. We have had to tackle a task which no other country has had to tackle in these dimensions. We must now simply remain consistent. [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not one to deny that wage restraint affects incomes and influences demand in a negative way. Who would deny that? That is an economic truism. But we are in a situation where we must strike a balance between this fact -- the fall in demand -- and the fact of the burden on companies' costs. When I see that we cannot sell our products any more and others are producing just as high quality products at different prices in Asia, then I must give greater weight for now to the reduction of the cost burden on companies. That is simply the way things are. At another time and in another place we might talk about the effect on demand; no one will refuse to do that. These are fundamental economic truths which you [the opposition] do not appreciate because you do not have the competence. People can see that. [passage omitted] The high rate of taxation amd its high increase over the past few years was a consequence of reunification. I've already said that. We have to return quickly to the level of taxation we had prior to reunification and that is exactly the opposite of what you want in the SPD [Social Democratic Party]. The research institutes rightly stress that a high burden of taxation affects those who make a great contribution to the growth in the national product most. These are precisely the people that you in the SPD want to increase the burden of taxation on. The SPD's idea of getting additional tax revenue wholly from the so- called higher earners is not a medicine, it is poison for the economy and jobs. How can you promise your clients more milk if you want to take away fodder from the cows? [passage omitted] We do not need another redistribution in the way the SPD suggests, in which everyone is worse off in the end. What we need is a high degree of investment for new jobs and we need this over the next few years. A return to the sort of developments we were able to achieve in the 1980's is the aim of the German Government's economic and financial policy. In contrast to you, the government has the right concept and expertise for this. I would also like to tell Mr. Klose, who finished with a personal forecast, that your forecast will not come true as long as you paint a gloomy and pessimistic picture and as long as you talk down this location [Germany as a business and investment site]. This location is a good one, ladies and gentlemen, and we count on that location, on market forces, on our people, on our companies. We are counting on competitive conditions strengthening, on an improvement in those conditions. We are counting on a drop in costs, a reduction in over-regulation, we are counting on greater representation in the booming markets. We are counting on flexibility and we are counting on cooperation between the economy and state and trade unions in an industrial policy which we are pursuing every day, in a way that is correct -- namely, not by shifting responsibilities, but by achieving consensus, listening to people, and making concessions. That is our policy and you have nothing to add to it other than a taxation of higher earners and that is too little. People know this and for that reason this government, Mr. Klose, Ladies and Gentlemen, has the best possible chance of taking responsibility for the welfare of the Germans for a long time to come.
