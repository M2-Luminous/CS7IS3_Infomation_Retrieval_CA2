Security Council meeting to discuss its complaints against Israel, leading the council's failure to take any measure to denounce Israel. Local press reported the Lebanese permanent representative to the U.N. said in a statement that "Because of one of the Security Council permanent members which hindered any step to condemn Israel or denounce its aggressions on Lebanon, the Security Council has refrained from declaring it was against the violations of the international law and the basic human rights." He was referring to the United States. The representative said the Lebanese requests were understood and supported by most of the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council, but "after more than two weeks of consultations (since Lebanon lodged its first complaint) the Security Council did not take any measure." The statement added that the failure to condemn Israel could only lead to "encourage Israel to believe that it is above the law and it is absolutely free to commit other violations against Lebanon and its citizens." Lebanon filed its first complaint to the U.N. Security Council against Israel following an Israeli Commando raid deep into Lebanon on May 21 in which Israeli Air-Borne Troops abducted Lebanese guerrilla leader Mustafa Dirani. The second Lebanese complaint was lodged after Israeli warplanes attacked a training camp of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon and more than 100 people were reportedly killed or wounded in the air raid. Lebanon held intensive contacts with the member states of the U.N. Security Council in order to push it to condemn the repeated Israeli aggressions. The opposition of the United States for a Security Council meeting to debate the Israeli aggression on Lebanon has aroused criticism in Lebanon. Local press accused the United States of standing behind the Israeli aggressions in order to press Lebanon and Syria to give up their firm positions in the peace negotiations with Israel.
