FR941213-2-00105 FR941213-2-00061 10. Disclosure of Government Assistance and Identity of Interested Parties (Form HUD 2880). The PHA must submit the Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report (Form HUD&hyph;2880) in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 12, subpart C. IV. Field Office Processing of Applications A. Initial Screening 1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine whether all information and exhibits have been submitted; no qualitative evaluation will be made at this time. a. If an application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be advised in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the missing or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. For example, the PHA Narrative Statement must address each of the technical review factors under Section IV.E., the eligibility criteria under Section I.D. and the restriction criteria under Section I.E. of this NOFA. b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of the application, relative to the ranking factors. c. If Forms HUD 52822 (Application) or HUD 52825 (Budget) are missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively incomplete, and therefore ineligible for further processing. However, if other forms [for example, Form HUD 50070 (Drug Free Workplace Certification), Form HUD 50071 (Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreements), Form SF LLL (Disclosure of Lobbying Activities), if applicable, or Form HUD 2880 (Application/ Recipient Disclosure/Update Report)] are missing, or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature or the wrong signature on a submitted form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency. 2. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. Failure of the Field Office to identify and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of submitting an incomplete application. 3. An application that does not meet all of the NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency period will be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable. If the PHA fails to correct deficiencies or fails to submit missing forms or certifications, or any certification is incomplete or not executed by the appropriate person(s), or the PHA Narrative Statement fails to address each of the Section IV.E. technical review factors, and each of the Section I.D. eligibility criteria and the Section I.E. restriction criteria, the application will not be examined for threshold approvability. B. Application Threshold Approvability After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, applications for which all the information, certifications, and documentation required by the NOFA have been received by HUD will be examined for threshold approvability. Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable. Applications which successfully pass the threshold review (threshold-approvable applications) will, following Joint Review, be submitted by the Field Office to a panel(s) which will rate applications, using the criteria set out in Section IV.E. of this NOFA. All applications must meet the following thresholds to be determined threshold-approvable: 1. The MROP activities application must meet the eligibility criteria of Section I.D. and the restriction criteria of Section I.E. 2. The PHA may not have any litigation pending which would preclude approval of the application. The PHA must have the required local cooperation and be legally eligible to develop, own, and operate public housing under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and the application must have a properly executed and complete PHA Resolution (Form HUD 52471) referring to the need for front-end funding, if requested, and a Local Governing Body Resolution (HUD 52472) which approves the request for front-end funds, if front-end funds are requested. (NOTE: The PHA Resolution certifies to the PHA's intent to comply with all requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655); the accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 135. By executing the PHA resolution, the PHA also certifies that it will comply with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131), and its implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35.) 3. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability (as defined by Section IV.E.(1)(c)) to complete the MROP reconstruction activities and manage the resulting housing. The Field Office shall determine capability based upon the PHA's overall performance, which includes the PHA's total score under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), and the PHA's most recent fiscal audit. a. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no recent experience in developing or managing public/assisted housing. b. No application shall be determined to be approvable if the PHA has failed to return excess advances received during development or modernization, or amounts determined by HUD to constitute excess financing based on a HUD-approved Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) or Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC), unless HUD has approved a pay-back plan. 4. There are no environmental factors precluding the MROP activities. 5. The PHA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A PHA will be considered to be in compliance if (1) as a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights laws unless the PHA is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (2) there is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (3) there is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations; (4) there is no pending civil rights suit brought against the PHA by the Department of Justice; or (5) there is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the PHA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400. C. Joint Review In accordance with the designation of projects requiring Joint Reviews, the Field Office will conduct a (either on-site or off-site) Joint Review for each threshold-approvable MROP activities application as early as possible pursuant to the interim rule for the revised CIAP program, published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13916). The purpose of the Joint Review is to allow the Field Office to more thoroughly understand the goals of the proposed MROP so it can prepare written comments summarizing the results of the Joint Review; in contrast to the CIAP procedures, the PHA's MROP application shall not be modified as a result of the Joint Review in any way. D. Field Submissions For each threshold-approvable application, the following must be prepared and submitted by the Field Office to the panel(s): 1. Copy of each application, narrative description of the number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost area, funding required, metro/non-metro designation, results of the eligibility determinations made under Section I.D. of this NOFA and the restriction determinations under Section I.E. of this NOFA, as well as the results of the Joint Review pursuant to Section IV.C. of this NOFA; and 2. Review sheet summarizing critical information about the project, including a brief description of proposed MROP activities and their proposed cost including any management improvements and a statement of the determination made as to the extent such improvements are necessary to maintain the physical improvements resulting from the proposed MROP activities, the applicable total development cost limitation, a discussion of the relationship and approval date of any demolition/disposition or conversion, and the feasibility of MROP activities compared to demolition/disposition.
