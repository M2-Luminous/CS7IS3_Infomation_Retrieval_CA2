[passage omitted] On the ground, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF, did not want another UN peacekeeping mission. Nevertheless it is not greatly worried by the mission that has been announced. Here is Alain de Strael, RTBF's special correspondent, in Rwanda: [Begin de Strael recording] The RPF does not feel itself in any way bound by the different aspects of the Security Council resolution, and in any case, it is not worried about it. It was opposed to the sending of a buffer force that would compel it to negotiate with a government it refuses to recognize. But now the mission entrusted to the revamped UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] is basically a humanitarian one. The victims are the result of the chaos born of the war. First, there are the militias, against which the UN can do nothing. They are continuing to kill in the villages; we saw this even in the zones conquered by the RPF. This is why the people are fleeing. The second exodus is that of people fleeing the advance of the RPF, which is preceded with a reputation for massacring civilians - a completely unjustified reputation, as we also discovered on the spot, but one which is carefully fostered by government propaganda. So no UN resolution will change a thing on the ground: the only solution that might perhaps win through in the end is for the Rwandan Army, from a position of military weakness, to break ranks with the government, and to negotiate. That is what the RPF is expecting. [end recording] [passage omitted]
