A spokesman for the National Party, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said in a statement that this ignores economic realities. Mr. Errol Moorcroft of the Democratic Party described the statements as utterly irresponsible and said it is proof that the PAC is out of touch with reality. He said such a policy would destroy the economy and permanently damage South Africa's ability to feed its people. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] In Bloemfontein, the Orange Free State Agricultural Union [OFSAU] attacked the PAC over its land policy. The union said PAC President Clarence Makwetu's statement on the possible resumption of the armed struggle to ensure land redistribution is looking for trouble. [OFSAU President Dr. Piet Gouws, in English] I think it is about time that somebody says to Mr. Makwetu: Listen, the PAC and no other force in South Africa will force the farmers off their land. [as heard] [Van Zyl] Referring to voter recruitement among farm laborers, Dr. Gouws said he is aware of some Free State farmers who allow only a certain political party on their farms, while the African National Congress is prohibited. [Gouws, in Afrikaans] As far as I am concerned, it is totally immoral. One either allows every one to campaign or no one at all, for security reasons or whatever. But this is something we cannot condone at all. [end recording]
