This decision was made following a tour of eight Russian agrarian oblasts by the company's president, Sergey Muravlenko. The necessary quantity of petroleum products for the sowing campaign has already been dispatched to the regions. There is quite a serious subtext to this -- at first sight, paradoxical and populist -- decision. Around one month ago another oil giant -- "Lukoyl" -- resorted to the same step, lowering its prices for three months. The oil companies' decision is in many ways to be explained by the nonpayments crisis. The consumer debt to "YUKOS" already amounts to more than 500 billion rubles. The three biggest debtors are agrarians, metallurgical workers, and the military-industrial complex. [passage omitted] Contracts have been signed with agrarians on barter exchange -- petroleum products for agricultural produce. Companies require at least some kind of guarantee that their product will be paid for. Otherwise, if there is a repeat of last year's nonpayments crisis, the oil industry will be ruined. The threat of the breakup or reorganization of companies is compeling them to adopt various counter tactics. The spring price reductions are unexpected only at first glance. In the face of the threat of a return to the times of state monopoly and state control, oil companies are showing that the market mechanism allows one to act swiftly and flexibly in the oil industry too.
