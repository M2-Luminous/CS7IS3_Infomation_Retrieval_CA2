FBIS4-28365 "dreas111__a94039" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Higher Indirect Taxes for Welfare Spending Favored Higher Indirect Taxes for Welfare Spending Favored OW0806143194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 6 Jun 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0806143194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] "The Subcommittee on Pensions, Medical Care, and Other Welfare Work" [name as published] (chaired by Minoru Yanagida) under the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Committee [name as published] has disclosed the contents of its draft report on a vision for the social safety net and expenditures for the social net. The draft report says that under the current tax system, it is difficult to secure equitably obtained and stable financial resources for social security, which is necessary to create a welfare society. It says: "Basically, it is desirable to establish a fair revenue system through an increase in the ratio of indirect taxation." The draft report, however, expresses negative views on the introduction of a welfare tax. The subcommittee is entrusting to another committee the decision concerning by what percentage indirect taxes should be raised. The other committee will reach a conclusion at a 6 June meeting and then will submit its decision to the Tax Reform Committee. The draft report notes the need for realizing a stable pension system, streamlining medical care, and promoting quantitative and qualitative improvements in welfare work such as nursing for the future social security system. To create an ideal welfare society for the future, it proposes to promote the structural reform of a social security system to prepare for the aging and low-birthrate society. It also proposes that the "government" and the "private sector" cooperate in realizing a "high-quality welfare and equal- burden society." The draft report also stresses the need to urgently review a "10- year plan for the promotion of health care for the aged (gold plan)," which is effective from FY 1990 until FY 1999, and to formulate a comprehensive plan to support child rearing (angel plan). It then provides specific measures to support nursing and rearing. The draft report says it is necessary to flexibly consider appropriating some of the revenues from an increase in the ratio of indirect taxation for supporting nursing and child rearing. As for financial resources for pensions, the report draft says: "The social insurance system should continue to be maintained." Touching on a call by the Social Democratic Party of Japan that the ratio of the national treasury's burden for basic pensions should be raised (from the current one third) to one half in the planned tax reform, the draft report says, "This issue should be discussed separately from a tax reform," and "This will be studied as a mid- and long-term assignment."
