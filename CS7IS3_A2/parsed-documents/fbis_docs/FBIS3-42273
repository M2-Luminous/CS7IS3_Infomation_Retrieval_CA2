All of them are intifadah graduates who decided to renounce terror and join the fight against mounting crime in their community. [passage omitted] Fatah's "strike police" units began operating about three months ago. Their intentions may be good, but their methods are shocking. Their activities are primarily aimed at drug dealers. Lists of suspected drug dealers and places where deals are conducted can be found in its headquarters. The information is collected from informers and snitches. "Strike police" troops raid drug-dealing areas every night. People caught dealing drugs face a bitter fate: They are taken for interrogation in the organization's dungeons where they undergo excruciating torture in order to extract information from them. A man I encountered at the "strike police" headquarters smilingly told me: "Believe me, I have been arrested many times in my life -- by Israel Police and by the Shin Bet -- but what our interrogators do to their subjects is absolutely terrifying." Twenty-six-year-old Shakir, the commander of the "strike police" adds: "We interrogate them, and with our methods they talk, and talk fast. When the interrogation is over, we break one of their arms or legs, their nose, or even slightly fracture their skull. Then we explain to them that they are harming themselves and the public, and warn them that if caught again they will be eliminated." The "strike police" opens "criminal records" for suspects, as if it were a real police force, and plays the role of legislator, judge, and executioner. Shakir argues that his men do not restrict their operations to East Jerusalem, and chase Arab drug dealers into the boundaries of the Green Line. At least on one occasion, Shakir recounts, a drug dealer from the territories was spotted in Elat, where he had fled to protect himself from the "strike police." This dealer "was arrested and dealt with appropriately," Shakir notes. He showed us the weapons used by his men. These include batons, ice picks, knives, screwdrivers, ropes, and handcuffs. "We do not yet have firearms," he says. "Until three months ago our goal had been to fight you, the Israelis. However, from the moment 'Arafat and Rabin shook hands, our goal became to fight for a better and healthier society, both ours and yours." Shakir argues that his methods have proved themselves, seeing that the activities of drug dealers in the area has decreased considerably. According to him, many of them relocated their business to the boundaries of the Green Line for fear of the "strike police." "It is important that your police deal with them and not let them off the hook," he says. Shakir continues: "The heads of the Palestinian leadership apprised Abu-'Ammar (Yasir 'Arafat) of our activities, and we were told that he gave them his blessing and that he is pleased with them. I hope he will heed our request and give us financial aid. In future I definitely envision myself as an officer in the Palestinian police force, and I will be happy to cooperate with Israel Police to fight crime." The "strike police" has also undertaken the task of dealing with drug addicts. Any addict caught in the act is asked to enter a rehabilitation center voluntarily. If he fails to do that, such treatment is forced on him for four months. [passage omitted]
