Indeed, this is not a very original claim, since after all it was the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and its satellites in the Fatherland Labor Party who announced that Zhelev was traitor of the year in 1992. Even this was not very original. Similar accusations against Zhelev had been leveled even before the Vulkanov-Vodenicharov presidential election campaign. Zhelev had already been declared a traitor in the summer of 1989, so it could be said that the BSP is fully utilizing the experience of Mr. Zhivkov himself. There is nothing surprising in the accusations of the BSP leader. After all, the Presidency is the only institution in Bulgaria that functions to a certain extent, and its destabilization remains a strategic goal of the party, which still has members who participated in the 1963 and 1973 plenums, which wanted to turn us into the 16th USSR republic. Videnov, and not only he, should abandon once and for all these efforts to silence the president. The right to express his opinions on various matters is not only a part of his presidential prerogative, it simply is a human right that every citizen of a democratic state has. If Zhelev is denied this right, the turn of Videnov and all the rest will come soon. Indeed the BSP should finally understand that the existence of an anticommunist president has its good sides. It was the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that proved that Zhelev was responsible for all the evils in this world -- from the "Sliver" Plan [infiltrating the SDS with former communist agents] to increasing the price of electricity, and from the ozone hole above the Atlantic to the lack of fish in the rivers. If Zhelev did not exist, how could the BSP and all the rest account for their own blunders?
