Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the naval dockyard in Bombay today after commissioning the submarine INS [Indian Naval Ship] Shankul. The submarine has been built by the Mazagaon Docks Limited in collaboration with a German firm. Mr. Rao described the induction of INS Shankul -- the second indigenously built submarine -- as another landmark in maritime history of the country and its quest for self-reliance. The prime minister said the Indian Navy has been on the path of indigenization since the early 1980s and sustained, hard, and collaborative work has helped India reach the status of a submarine building nation. Mr. Rao said India's naval strength will essentially be for its self-defense and to protect its large offshore production assets -- fishing and exploitation of seabed resources -- in the exclusive economic zone. He said, we neither wish to control the ocean around us nor deny others their legitimate use or equitable access to the seas. The chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral V.S. Shekhawat, accorded the acceptance of INS Shankul into the navy. The Maharashtra governor, Dr. P.C. Alexander, and the state chief minister, Mr. Sharad Pawar, were among those who attended the function.
