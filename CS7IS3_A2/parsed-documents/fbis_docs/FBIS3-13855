Our Arab affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that last night's meeting between the sides, which was marked by a positive atmosphere, dealt with security arrangements in the wake of the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre, as well as with the resumption of the negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The sides did not deal with the demand to remove the settlers from Hebron. It is also possible that the Israeli delegation will meet with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross in Tunis. The delegation is scheduled to return to Israel tonight.
