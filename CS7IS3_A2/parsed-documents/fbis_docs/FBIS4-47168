Serebryannykov, head of the subcommittee of the fuel-energy complex of the commission for questions on the development of basic sectors of the national economy of the Ukrainian Supreme Council: "Energy Conservation: What Needs To Be Done in Order To Move From Talk to Action"] [Text] The question of energy conservation generates an extremely difficult situation, which continues to worsen, with respect to supplying the Ukrainian national economy with fuel-energy resources. The shutdown of enterprises and the reduction in the work week do not solve the problem, but only make it more complex. In addition, this leads to social tension in the labor unions of the enterprises, as confirmed by the multitude of their appeals to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The last of such appeals was an open letter from the collective of the Institute of Energy Conservation of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences [AN]. As the leading experts concerning questions of energy conservation, they emphasize in the appeal the absence of a guaranteed system for introducing economics in the use of energy and resources and responsibility for their inefficient use. Over the last 10 years, the Ukrainian economy was based on ineffectual waste of energy, which lead to an energy and economic crisis. The energy capacity of the gross domestic product is several times greater than in the developed countries of Western Europe. Prices for energy resources, which Ukraine imports, in fact, are approaching world levels, and this increase in practice has not influenced the use of fuel and energy. Enterprises almost automatically include the increase in price of energy inputs in the production cost of the finished product, totally ignoring the question of conserving energy resources. According to the Ministry of Energy, industry in Ukraine every year inefficiently wasted almost 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electric power and 6 million gigacalories of thermal energy. The energy usage per unit of national income during 1991-1993 increased by 25 percent, while electric usage increased by 41.1 percent, at a time when the volume of production during 1992-1993 decreased by 20.6 percent. According to the experts at the Institute of Energy Conservation, which is supported by the Commission of the Ukrainian Supreme Council for the problems of the development of the basic sectors of the national economy, one of the fundamental means for overcoming the energy crisis in Ukraine should be an active government energy conservation policy. Why should it be governmental? For all the nations of the world, even for those that have their own energy resources, the power industry is one of the primary factors in protecting the functioning of the economy and the social sphere. This is a guarantee of the strength of a government, and its independence from unfriendly external factors. That is why the administration of the power industry and the drafting of an energy strategy and policy are matters for the government. But, this does not simultaneously mean that the power industry should function as a government sector of the economy. It should be privatized, as in most of the developed nations of the world. World experience shows that the government's influence on this sector is secured through the path of development of strategy and policy for the development of energy, reinforced by corresponding legislative acts and, most important, with economic methods of regulation. Today, there are two principal directions for providing the energy requirement of the country: growth of the energy capacity for generation of energy, as was done earlier, during the existence of the USSR; and a significant increase in the efficient use of energy in all sectors of the economy, in other words, energy conservation. The first direction is absolutely hopeless and even desperate from an economic and ecological point of view. Under the conditions of a shortage of its own energy resources and the necessity of importing oil, gas, and coal at world prices, and in the extremely difficult ecological situation in Ukraine, energy conservation--this is the one possible and acceptable path to resolving the energy crisis. The experience of the developed countries of the world--of Japan, France, Germany, and others--which today consume markedly less energy per person than Ukraine and have a several times larger gross national product, supports the correctness of such an approach. As has already been noted, the potential for energy conservation in our country is enormous. Taking into account world experience, it can be asserted that not less than 65 percent of energy resources can be conserved (taking into account the state of the economy). One-third of the savings can come from no cost-based and low cost-based measures, which should be carried out by a strict deadline. The remaining measures need significant capital investment. Along with this, it is essential to take into account that the financial investments in energy conservation are 3- to 5 times more effective than investments in the growth of generating power. What is deterring the process of energy conservation in our country? First of all, the absence of a legislative base on this issue, which would untie these knots that have become tangled over the course of many decades, Second, and this is most important, the absence of equipment and instruments to measure energy use (thermal, electric, gas, etc.). Third, a dedicated, long-established organizational, technical, and technological effort in all spheres to increase the efficient use of fuel and energy. In practice, this means that energy conservation policy should have a legal status and should be proclaimed as Ukrainian government policy. The most "active" deputies are spreading the idea that the market will set the price of energy use, and that this will influence energy conservation. First, today we do not yet have a civilized and balanced market, and significant time will be required for its creation. Second, the experience of other countries shows that market prices by themselves do not regulate the use of energy. All of its outlays go into the production cost of goods, which steadily increases. This once again testifies that there should be government regulation of energy use--that is, a joint use of market mechanisms, methods, prices, and measures of an administrative influence, at least during the transitional phase to a market economy. Market methods by themselves are insufficient, they are unable to fundamentally change the situation. The government should establish the appropriate economic agreements, influence the activities of the enterprises in the sphere of energy, which would make it possible to raise the efficiency of their efforts and to reduce society's need for fuel. Society should not pay for the carelessness and the poor management of a few producers. Such a long-term government policy of energy conservation would without fail influence the state of affairs and would ensure: --a steady introduction of energy conservation and a reduction in the price of goods; --an increase in the competitiveness of production on the world market and broad possibilities for trade in this; --a sharp decrease in the outlay of money to pay for the import of energy and fuel for all spheres of commerce, enterprises, and the populace; --an improvement in the state of affairs in the social sphere thanks to a reduction in need for energy and prices, thanks to the production of highly efficient, domestic equipment (refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, etc.); --an incentive for the use of independent, untraditional sources of energy--particularly in everyday life--of small-power industry, energy-conserving electric lighting, and other measures of energy conservation; --the reduction of the technological load on nature, the improvement of the ecological condition in the country, and the increase of the life expectancy of the people. Already, the reduction in the use of fuel in the energy complex will provide a sharp reduction in the pollution of the environment. Considering the importance of the energy conservation question for Ukraine, its influence on the life of the population and the improvement of its welfare, and taking in to account the situation that is establishing itself in connection with the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections, because of which legislative solutions to energy conservation problems are put off to a later time, we feel that the Ukrainian president could undertake the matter and issue an edict in which energy conservation will be recognized as a government policy and, with its realization, organizational measures will be stipulated.
