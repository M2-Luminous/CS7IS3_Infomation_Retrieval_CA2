They discussed questions of interaction between the power structures and the parliament committee. There are practically no doubts that a single coordinated line on military policy will be worked out, Aleksandr Piskunov believes. One of the first priority tasks, in his opinion, is consideration of the military budget for 1994. The committee has already prepared a draft law on procedures for the participation of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations abroad. It seems that Mr. Piskunov will after all manage to come to agreement with the military department. In the former parliament he also worked on the defense committee -- as deputy chairman -- and therefore has extensive experience in dealing with the Defense Ministry, which looked good amid the general state of relations at the time between the executive and legislative branches. As a high-ranking official at the Defense Ministry told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, his department is counting on Aleksandr Piskunov, who is more sophisticated in military matters, than on Sergey Yushenkov, former professor at the Military and Political Academy, or Dmitriy Volkogonov, another representative of Russia's Choice in the Defense Committee, who is suspected of intending to pass a law on alternative service, seen by the army generals as undesirable, and also of being inclined toward various reorganizations in the military department. As for the Security Committee, the scheme of its interrelations with the power structures will apparently be different. Among the committee members are such prominent opposition figures as Aleksandr Nevzorov, Stanislav Govorukhin, and Yuriy Vlasov. With this composition, the committee chairman -- communist Viktor Ilyukhin -- is, according to a source in the Federal Counterintelligence Service, a man with whom one can talk. Furthermore, owing to his commitment to the idea of strong centralized state security bodies, Ilyukhin evokes secret sympathies among the hitherto untouchable KGB, tired of constant reorganizations.
