Ankara Is Still Against Equal Responsibility Principle"] [Excerpt] Parliamentary hearings held in Baku 22 April were devoted to a discussion of a new variant of the Russian plan for a peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Although no final decision on the question being discussed was made, the view of the majority of parliamentarians was one: the document presented by Russia does not defend the sovereign rights of Azerbaijan while, as one of the speakers stated, "it actually reserves for the Armenian side the right to continue the occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory." It is well known that should the Russian plan be approved, the Azeri Army would have to retreat 10 to 20 km from currently held positions, which would then mean leaving 35 percent of the country's territory out of the Azeri Government's control. Naturally, Baku officials affirm the unacceptability of such an approach to resolving the conflict. President Geydar Aliyev thinks that so far Moscow is not holding a sufficiently principled posture in the matter of settling the problem. He made such a remark while meeting in Baku on 23 April with Sergey Baburin, coordinator of the "Russian Path" deputy group, who arrived there in the capacity of Russian Federation State Duma delegation head. The unanimity with which the parliamentarians and the republic's government reject the Russian peace plan in its present variant is primarily attributed to fears about introducing Russian troops to Azerbaijan territory. The men in Baku think that the very presence of Russian troops in the region of conflict would hardly secure a stable cease-fire. The republic's diplomatic circles believe that the persistence with which Moscow proposes that the peace plan be approved is dictated first and foremost by the desire to take over complete control of the Azerbaijan-Turkey border, restoring thereby its military control over this Transcaucasus republic. Naturally, not only Azerbaijan but also neighboring Iran and Turkey do not conceal their worry over this kind of preparations by Moscow. [passage omitted]
