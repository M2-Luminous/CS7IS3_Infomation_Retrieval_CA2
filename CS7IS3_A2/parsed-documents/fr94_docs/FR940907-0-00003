FR940907-0-00003 FR940907-0-00001 2. For the months of September 1994 through August 1995: In the first sentence of §1137.12(a)(1), the words ``from whom at least three deliveries of milk are received during the month at a distributing pool plant''; and in the second sentence, the words ``30 percent in the months of March, April, May, June, July, and December and 20 percent in other months of'', and the word ``distributing''. Statement of Consideration This action suspends certain portions of the ``pool plant'' and ``producer'' definitions of the Eastern Colorado order (Order 137). The suspension will make it easier for handlers to qualify milk for pooling under the order. The suspension action was requested by Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), a cooperative association that has pooled milk of dairy farmers under Order 137 for several years. Mid-Am requested the suspension to prevent the uneconomic and inefficient movement of milk for the sole purpose of pooling the milk of producers who have been historically associated with the order. For the months of September 1994 through February 1995, the restriction on the months when automatic pool plant status applies for supply plants will be removed. For the months of September 1994 through August 1995, the touch-base requirement will not apply and the diversion allowance for cooperatives will be raised. These provisions have been suspended in prior years to maintain the pool status of producers who have historically supplied the fluid needs of Order 137 distributing plants. The marketing conditions which justified the prior suspensions continue to exist. Mid-Am asserts that they have made a commitment to supply the fluid milk requirements of distributing plants if their suspension request is granted. Without the suspension, to qualify certain of its milk for pooling it would be necessary for the cooperative to ship milk from distant farms to Denver-area bottling plants. The distant milk would displace milk produced on nearby farms that would then have to be shipped from the Denver area to manufacturing plants located in outlying areas. There are ample supplies of locally-produced milk that can be delivered directly from farms to distributing plants to meet the market's fluid needs without requiring shipments from supply plants. Also, neither the elimination of the touch-base requirement for producers nor the increase in the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by a cooperative should jeopardize the needs of the market's fluid processors. This suspension is found to be necessary for the purpose of assuring that producers' milk will not have to be moved in an uneconomic and inefficient manner to ensure that producers whose milk has long been associated with the Eastern Colorado marketing area will continue to benefit from pooling and pricing under the order. It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest in that: (a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who have historically supplied the market without the need for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; (b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective date; and (c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. One comment supporting the suspension was filed. No opposing views were received. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the Federal Register .
