Tanba expressed a negative view about the binding power of the secret accord even if it actually exists. He said: "The Japan-U.S. Joint Communique signed by then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon was a political document on Okinawa's reversion to Japan. It is unthinkable that they also issued agreed minutes to the communique. Even if such documents exist, they are not binding because they were not compiled by administrative organizations in accord with law." Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also stressed that the government's policy of "refusing reentry of nuclear weapons to Okinawa or other parts of Japan" would not change even if an emergency does take place. Both Tanba and Hata made these remarks in answering questions from Japan Communist Party members Koichiro Ueda and Yoshinori Yoshioka. Referring to the allegation in a book authored by Kei Wakaizumi, Ueda asserted that it is now evident that the secret agreement was signed, saying: "Can't you still deny (the existence of the secret agreement)? I want the government to investigate the allegation because this is an issue that affects the fate of the nation." In response, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: "Negotiations on Okinawa's reversion were made through official diplomatic channels and as a result, the two governments agreed on the reversion. There were no private channels." He added: "Granting that there were private channels, I do not think they affected the final result of the negotiations." In a question related to this issue, Yoshioka asked "whether the secret agreement, made in the form of agreed minutes, would be binding on Japanese cabinets." Treaties Bureau Chief Tanba and Foreign Minister Kakizawa answered his question on the assumption that the secret agreement exists. Tanabe said: "Its secret nature does not invalidate the agreement. At any rate, (the agreed minutes in question) were not made in accord with law." Kakizawa also stressed: "The agreement is invalid, so you do not have to worry." In answering a question on the need to investigate the allegation and ascertain the facts about the secret agreement, Prime Minister Hata said: "Former Prime Minister Sato is already dead. So I have no idea about how we should investigate." Asked about the need to notify the United States of the invalidity of the agreement, Foreign Minister Kakizawa said: "It is unnecessary because the government does not admit its existence."
