They were carrying large quantities of drugs. The nationality of the traffickers is not known yet but it is known that some 500 vehicles and 1,500 persons were searched and 50 traffickers will be appearing before a Rotterdam court this week. Seemingly without any connection to the above, some 315 kg of hashish was found concealed in the house of 39 year-old loan Covaci in Salistea de Sus, Maramures County, in the Iza valley. Placed in several hundred packages wrapped in tin foil, labeled in Italian, put in packages and then in cloth bags, it was buried in the ground in burlap and polyethylene sacks. A large quantity of empty burlap sacks were ready for use in packing. In another Maramures locality, Dragomiresti, also in the Iza valley, a machine, made in the Netherlands, for packaging drugs, in bulk form, by vacuum method, was found under the kitchen floor of a countrywoman, M.M. In the same hiding place, a number of plastic and polyethylene bags were found, along with boxes with various foreign inscriptions. The criminal investigators discovered a whole network of drug traffickers. As of now, it has been established that four more Maramures citizens -- from Salistea de Sus, Bogdan Voda, and Baia Mare -- are involved in the operation of processing and clandestinely transporting large quantities of hashish which were shipped to the port of Constanta from Lebanon. After a short stop at the Dutch packaging machine in Dragomiresti, the drugs were sent to the Netherlands. They crossed the border in trucks, nestled among crates of apples and bottles of wine. It is believed that about 5,000 kg of hashish was delivered to the Netherlands alone, in three trailer trucks. The activity of breaking up the ring of traffickers continues, with the arrest of some of the persons implicated. In the meantime, we have learned that 18.5 kg of heroin was discovered at the Giurgiu customs inspection point on 25 March. It was hidden in the doors and on the floor of a "Scania" 38-HT-657 truck belonging to the Tekin Uluslarasi company from Turkey, which was transporting packages of cot ton thread. The driver, 31 year-old Yesil Erdojan, and his assistant said that they were delivering the "goods" to a citizen in Innsbruck, Austria. Both are being interrogated by the police and the procurator.
