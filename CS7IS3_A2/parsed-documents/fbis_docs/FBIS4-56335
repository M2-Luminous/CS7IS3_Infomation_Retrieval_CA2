We have Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata from the Armed Forces Information Directorate on the phone. Good morning, colonel. [Medina] Good morning, Mr. Nielsen and the same to your kind viewers. Mr. Nielsen, first, I would like to thank you for this chance you have given us to keep the people informed about the deployment of armored vehicles from the 2d Cavalry Regiment headquartered in Cerrito. The deployment's purpose is to bring our material closer to the capital city so as to be able to comply with any order to help out the National Police if they are overwhelmed by violent actions related to ongoing events. The purpose of this information is to assure the citizenry that the Armed Forces will leave its barracks only if ordered to do so and only if it becomes absolutely necessary. [Nielsen] Was this deployment part of the plans drawn up in advance to deal with today's situation? [Medina] That is correct; the Armed Forces are always ready and prompt to help re-establish public order -- provided, I repeat, they are ordered to do so -- and help out the National Police if they are unable to carry out their mission because they are overwhelmed. [Nielsen] For the time being, you are not contemplating having to deal with disturbances bigger than those that have been taking place so far? [Medina] From what we could see and hear through the news media, no serious disturbances are taking place. For the most part, they seem to be rather unimportant. Thus, we believe that everything that is taking place is in keeping with the law, but this does not mean that we should not be ready and prepared to help -- if ordered to do so -- the National Police. [Nielsen] Thank you very much, colonel, for this official information, the first we have had since the deployment of armored vehicles was first spotted this morning. Thank you for your kindness. [Medina] Thank you, Mr. Christian Nielsen.
