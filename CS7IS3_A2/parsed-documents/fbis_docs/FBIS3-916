The party's vice-president, Aleke Banda, said at a press briefing that his party was quitting the National Consultative Council after failing to block a new constitutional provision barring politicians with criminal records from standing in the presidential and parliamentary elections in May. The provision appeared aimed primarily at the front's president, Bakili Muluzi, who has been tipped to win the presidential election but who served a six month prison term 20 years ago. "This is wrong, there is no reason why such a rule should be build around an individual" Banda said. The council, grouping Malawi's eight political parties, was formed to manage the country's transition to political pluralism after decades of rule by President Kamuzu Banda.
