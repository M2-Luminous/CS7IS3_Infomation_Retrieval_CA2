The draft directive is aimed at the markets for such activities as provision of FSAT services, MSS services and SNG. A major change from previous proposals from the EC is the addition of a one stop shopping procedure in the directive, replacing the concept of a single community license issued by the Commission. This reflects what has actually happened at national level over the last two years. Whilst the Commission clearly wants a mechanism which provides licenses that are harmonised and fully recognised by all member states, the transitional one stop shopping procedure reflects the reality that this will be slow and difficult to implement. It also appears to reflect a shift of power away from DG XIII to CEPT and national level. The Commission hopes that the transitional concept of one stop shopping will be replaced over time by "appropriate harmonisation conditions". The document is largely silent on the issue of direct access to Eutelsat and Intesat -- "As concerns the discussions in the International Satellite Organisations... on improvements to the access conditions to the space segment capacity of their respective intergovernmental satellite systems, this proposal builds on the progress of these discussions and in particular the recent decision by the Eutelsat Assembly of Parties to propose the Member States options for improved and broadened access either through the installation of a national Signatory Affaire Office and/or through the so called multiple access option in which access to the capacity can also be sought via Signatories other than the national one. The proposal foresees that both options shall be implemented and recognised." The position is a significant shift from the 1990 Green Paper which explicitly called for EC action to ensure direct access to Eutelsat and Intelsat. However, the EC says that the draft directive now "further builds on the discussions and decisions taking place within the International Satellite Organisations and in particular those within the Eutelsat framework." An indication of just how slow the Commission has been in this sector is that the Green paper was issued (after much delay) in November 1990. The final directive is planned for implementation no later than 1 October 1995. Trade sources suggest that this is a tight timetable given that European Radiocommunications Office (see later) has other greater priorities than satellite communications; it is unlikely that the Commission will have its act together until well into 1995. Power to CEPT The draft directive calls for a major CEPT role in implementing the harmonisation of licensing conditions for satellite services as distinct from the interim one stop shopping set up. CEPT represents all European countries, not just the 12 members of the European Union. The draft calls for two CEPT bodies to have a role, the European Committee for Telecommunications Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA) and the European Radiocommunications Committee/Office (ERC). "As a first step, ECTRA may be mandated by the Commission to elaborate the technical basis for harmonised licensing conditions, based on the expertise of ECTRA and ERC, in the wider European context, and as such appropriate to satellite communications. The technical basis could include matters such as arrangements for the coordination of frequencies or for site approval, verification of space segment access arrangements, issuing of network numbering schemes, practical arrangements which facilitiate contacts with prospective licensed satellite network operators in case of an emergency, practical adherence to specific national conditions in conformance with Community law etc." "As a second step, the Commission will test the provided technical basis against Community law and policies, in particular telecommunications policy; after which common licensing conditions will be adopted. In accordance with the responsibilities conferred on the Commission by the Directive." One Stop Shopping Timetable Fairly tight timetables are set down for the issue of licenses under the one stop shopping arrangements. When a service or network provider files with a national organisation for a license, that organisation must notify national regulatory authorities involved within seven days. The national regulatory authority responsible for issuing the license must take a decision and inform the applicant within six weeks of receipt of application. LEO's The draft also addresses the issue of new service categories for which harmonised Community licensing conditions have not yet been agreed, such as services from non-geostationary satellites and in cases where certain satellite services might not be covered by any of the established service categories due to the uniqueness of the service for which a license is sought. Under such circumstances, applications for mutual recognition can be dealt with under transitional one stop shopping until harmonised conditions for the service category in question have been elaborated. The Community Telecommunications Committee (CTC) The EC intends to use the CTC as the vehicle to implement the directive at Community level. The CTC is composed of representatives of national regulatory authorities of EU member states. However, most of the major tasks of implementation of the directive will be taken at national level. The CTC will also be used as a conciliation body when appeals are made to the Commission. Bad News for the USA The Directive will give rights to satellite service providers or network operators only if they are owned through a three quarters majority ownership by member states and/or national of member states. "That means that a US owned SNG operation, for example, could be forced to continue to obtain licenses at national level and have a separate license for each of the 12 member states. In practice it looks to be more of a vehicle to keep U.S. common carriers out of the European marketplace. Indeed, European organisations are currently specifically prevented from obtaining common carrier licenses in the USA. The draft directive states that the protectionist measures "will remain to be applied until satisfactory completion of bilateral or multilateral agreements which allow a more balanced developments, or until the developments of the satellite sector requires a review of these provisions...." Essentially this is a GATT services issue covered in last month's final meeting or the Uruguay round. It appears that the clauses are likely to lead to a lot of lobbying by US interests.
