Bastiaans, head of the UN military observers in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Marjon van Royen in Zagreb on 27 April: "`Muslims Provoked Attack on Gorazde,' Netherlands UN General Says"] [Text] Zagreb, 27 Apr -- "It was the Muslims who provoked the Serbian attack on Gorazde. The Serbs perhaps reacted `excessively.' But ultimately it was the Muslims who pushed the Bosnian Serb Army to the bloodbath of the civilian population of Gorazde with continual provocations." This was said by Netherlands Brigadier General G.J.M. Bastiaans in his office in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] headquarters in Zagreb. General Bastiaans is the head of the UN Military Observers (UNMO) in the former Yugoslavia. After the limited air strikes on a number of Serbian tanks around Gorazde, 50 of his observers were taken hostage in the area by the Bosnian Serbs. But that is not the reason, Bastiaans said, why he had so many questions about the eagerness of calls for tough action against the Serbs in recent weeks. "Dropping lumps of iron has consequences. The Serbs really do not think: Let us just accept this. Air strikes change the relations. They end the possibility of further negotiations. Anyone who had thought that this was not true, really is not of this world," Bastiaans said. The general is convinced that there was a "propaganda campaign" around Gorazde by the Muslims. Everyone, including NATO, had walked into it with open eyes," he said. "They used all the parties," Bastiaans continued. "The Muslims provoked the Serbs with shootings and harassment to such a point that they had little option other than using the heavy weapons." When asked whether he thought that action should be taken in Gorazde, Bastiaans answered: "That is perhaps what public opinion in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world wants. But you must not forget the role played by the Muslims in the conflict. Looking at it in purely military terms, the Muslims have superiority of numbers and a lack of heavy weapons. With the Bosnian Serbs, things are the other way around. Small arms fire, as used by the Muslims, does not appeal to public opinion. However, big bangs ringing in the ears of the civilian population certainly do. If, as was also the case in Sarajevo, you then ensure that the Serbs come under fire from within a city, they will respond. In so doing, you can be sure that some of the civilian population will be hit. That can then be filmed later on. And it is not very nice to look at. When it comes down to it, the problem with the Serbs is that they overreact, that they do not dish out one big bang and then say that things are settled. As a result they play right into the hands of the Muslims." [van Royen] What did the Muslims do to "provoke" the Serbs so acutely? Surely they are the injured party? After all, they are the ones shut up in the reservations we call "safe areas." [Bastiaans] Yes, but the party on top can also be threatened. By and large, the Serbs have respected all agreements pretty well. It is just that time and time again they lose their cool whenever they are challenged. Not for nothing does the NATO communique contain that little sentence saying that the Muslims must also stop shooting. Officially, the Muslims in the safe areas must surrender their weapons. However, apart from in Srebrenica, this has never happened. Besides military and political considerations, the Serbian attack on Gorazde is also tinged with a little bit of frustration. The Serbs offered to negotiate with the Muslims, but their offer was rejected. In the strip of no-man's land two km around Gorazde, the Muslims have been digging like mad. They are extending their trenches through that strip so as to gain as great an advantage as possible. That is one of the methods that is being used. You do not always have to start shooting to provoke someone. So if you now suddenly draw just a 20-km line, behind which the Serbs must pull back their heavy weapons, then militarily speaking you have done everything to benefit the Muslims. Compared with the situation as it was before, however, the Muslims now have actually surrendered some territory. On the other hand, you must not give the Serbs the impression that the Muslims have won out in all respects.
