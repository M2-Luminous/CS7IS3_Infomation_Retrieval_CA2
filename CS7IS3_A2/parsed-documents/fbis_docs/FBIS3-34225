As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this issue to the attention of the related authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented. But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all internationally accepted current norms and principles, and demands from the authorities of that country to seriously refrain from the repetition and continuation of such interference which will have grave consequences for and negative impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries. Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such interference.
