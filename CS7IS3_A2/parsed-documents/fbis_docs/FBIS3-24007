Here are some data reflecting the status of the corresponding public opinion as of the beginning of 1994. Some 1,677 persons aged 18 or over were polled by the interview method in Kiev and 102 other cities and urban-type settlements of all 24 oblasts of Ukraine and Crimea. These persons were selected by methods which ensure highly representative levels of data--with a relative error at the level of +/-3.2 percent. One of the questions was as follows: "Had the election campaign been already completed, and the elections held today, would you take part?" Some 52 percent responded in the affirmative, 33 percent in the negative, and 15 percent had not made a determination. Therefore, for now almost one-half of the voters in the cities of Ukraine have no firm intention of turning out for the elections. Meanwhile, under the law elections are considered valid only if no fewer than one-half of the citizens who are entitled to vote take part in them. Thus, the question "Will the elections be valid?" is not rhetorical at present but rather genuinely problematical. For this reason, it is worthwhile to analyze which social attributes and views on contemporary problems distinguish those who intend to turn out for the elections, those who do not, and those who are hesitating. The relevant analysis indicates that voters who intend to vote in the elections are encountered with equal frequency among men and women (52 percent). The proportion of such voters increases with age: They account for only 43 percent of voters aged under 30, 47 percent of voters aged between 31 and 45, as many as 58 percent of voters aged 46 to 60, and 62 percent of voters over 60. Therefore, there are almost 1.5 times fewer young people than elderly who are disposed to take part in the elections. The proportion of such voters is appreciably greater among people with a higher education (58 percent) than among those with a secondary education (49 percent); it is also higher among managers (62 percent) and specialists (55 percent) than among clerical employees (48 percent) and workers (48 percent). Besides this, voters who intend to vote are relatively more numerous among believers (56 percent) than among nonbelievers (49 percent), and among Ukrainians (54 percent) than among Russians (48 percent). To be sure, there are considerably fewer such voters among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (50 percent) than among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (60 percent). Voters who make the position of abstention dominant (who intend to refrain from participation in the elections) are more frequently encountered among women (35 percent) than among men (29), and among people under 35 (39 percent) than among the people aged 36 to 55 (31 percent) and over 55 (27 percent). The proportion of potentially abstaining voters is higher among voters with a complete secondary education (35 percent) than among voters with an education below secondary (32 percent) or with a higher education (27 percent). It is also relatively higher among clerical employees (36 percent) than among managers (29 percent) and specialists (28 percent). Besides, such voters are more numerous among nonbelievers (35 percent) than among believers (31 percent), and among Russians (38 percent) and other ethnic minorities (38 percent) than among Ukrainians (30 percent), including Russian-speaking Ukrainians (30 percent). Voters who have not yet decided whether or not to turn out for the elections are almost 1.5 times more numerous among men (19 percent) than among women (13 percent); they are also more numerous among young people under 30 (18 percent) than among the elderly over 60 (12 percent). Other age brackets occupy an intermediate position on this score: The proportion of voters who are not sure comes to 16 percent among people in the 31-45 and 46-60 age groups. The degree of readiness to participate in the elections is also quite different among residents of various regions of Ukraine. The results of an analysis of the heterogeneity of political orientation of the electorate of Ukraine that were obtained in our previous research indicate the feasibility of characterizing the Western, Central, Southern and Eastern Regions separately, if we place, respectively, Transcarpathian, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Khmelnitskiy, Ternopol, Lvov, Volyn, and Rovno Oblasts in the Western Region (22 percent of the voters of Ukraine); Zhytomir, Vinnitsa, Kirovograd, Cherkassy, Kiev, Chernigov, Sumy, and Poltava Oblasts and the city of Kiev in the Central Region (30 percent of voters); Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Odessa Oblasts and Crimea in the Southern Region (26 percent of voters); and Kharkov, Donetsk, and Lugansk Oblasts in the Eastern Region (22 percent of voters in Ukraine). An analysis of the regional breakdown of answers by respondents to questions concerning readiness to take part in the elections indicated that potential abstainers are the most numerous among the urban population of the Southern Region--37 percent. They account for 32 percent of the urban population of the Eastern and Western Regions, and 30 percent in the Central Region. The Eastern Region has the greatest reserve of electoral activity: The proportion of voters who are not sure whether to turn out for the elections comes to 21 percent there. This is almost two times more than in the Western Region, where such voters account for only 11 percent. The Central and Southern Regions are in an intermediate position on this score: They have, respectively, 14 and 16 percent of such voters. Voters prepared to take part in the voting are the most numerous among the urban population of the Western and Central regions--they account for 57 percent in each. Such voters account for less than one half of the urban population in the Southern and Eastern Regions--47 and 48 percent, respectively. During the last elections, the percentage of voters who turned out to vote was not much greater (or not greater at all) than the percentage of respondents who responded in the affirmative to the question of their intentions concerning participation in voting. For this reason, the percentage of such responses registered in the Eastern and Southern Regions prompts us to evaluate the likelihood of the failure of the elections in a significant proportion of urban electoral districts in these regions as quite high. This is particularly the case with the section of the Southern Region including Kherson, Nikolayev, and Odessa Oblasts and the Crimea. There, the proportion of urban voters who intend to take part in the elections comes to only 36 percent +/-6 percent at present, with 0.95 probability. If the propensity of voters to take part in voting grows as the date of the elections to the Supreme Council draws nearer, the projection for holding the elections will be favorable. However, if the abstention sentiment mounts (as has been the case over at least the last six to eight months), the projection will naturally be unfavorable. Which variant of the projection is probable? This has to do with the fact that the propensity to take part in the elections (which depends on many factors) is also quite closely associated with the assessment of the general state of affairs in Ukraine. Among those who believe that things are moving in the right direction on the whole, 73 percent of voters intend to vote, whereas among those who believe that they are moving in the wrong direction, only 50 percent intend to vote. There are no optimistic expectations as of now. Thus, the unfavorable projection concerning the completeness of the holding of the parliamentary elections is more probable than the favorable one. Therefore, the question arises: If elections are not validly held in many districts, what is the number of elected deputies at which the elections will be considered to have been validly held in Ukraine as a whole? That is to say, what is the number of newly elected deputies at which it is possible to consider that a new composition of the Supreme Council has emerged to which the current Supreme Council should yield its powers? Perhaps not at any number? For example, should it surrender its powers if deputies are elected in less than 50 percent of the districts? The Law "On the Election of People's Deputies" does not provide an answer to this question. It regulates establishing the results of elections only in an individual electoral district. For this reason, taking into account the unfavorable projection with regard to holding valid elections in a considerable number of electoral districts, would it not be worthwhile for the Supreme Council to regulate the establishment of election results in the entirety of electoral districts of Ukraine as a whole ahead of time in order to prevent a situation in which the legitimacy of both compositions of the Supreme Council--the current and the newly elected--is called into doubt?
