A ministry official, briefing reporters, said the quarterly business survey indicated "signs of a gradually recovering economy." The survey covered 23,053 companies capitalized at 10 million yen and more, and excluding financial institutions and insurance companies. The number of respondents came to 19,366 companies, or 84.0 percent. Combined pretax profits for the quarter fell 5.8 percent from the previous year posting the 15th consecutive decline, but the yearly decline slowed from the October-December quarter's 6.2 percent and the July-September period's 21.6 percent, the report said. Sales rose 0.8 percent after falling for seven quarters in a row as sales of non-manufacturers rose 3.0 percent after declining for six straight quarters. Capital investment shrank 11.7 percent for the ninth straight decline, but the rate of decline slowed from the previous quarter's 16.8 percent and the July-September period's 15.8 percent. In reflection of improving earnings, the officials noted progress in inventory adjustments as capital stocks at manufacturers rose a scant 0.8 percent compared with a 2.8 percent gain in the previous quarter. The official said, "recovering domestic demand is apparently starting to contribute to corporate earnings." Manufacturers saw their pretax profits fall 12.2 percent on 4.4 percent lower sales, improving from the previous quarter's 16.5 percent drop in profits and 4.5 percent decline in sales. The official said the improvements reflected their cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts. For non-manufacturers, pretax profits fell back 1.9 percent from a 3.9 percent rise in the previous quarter, despite the rebound in sales. The official attributed the profit decline to falling prices at the wholesale level amid a discount trend among consumers. But he said the trend was yet not evident at the retail level. On an industry basis, pretax profits jumped 108.3 percent among food makers, reflecting improved consumption, and 8.9 percent among petroleum product makers thanks to lower crude oil prices on the higher yen. Electric machinery and equipment makers enjoyed a 13.3 percent rise on buoyant demand for semiconductor devices at home and abroad and for household appliances from continued strong housing investment. Also buoyed by housing spending, construction firms saw a 4.4 percent rise in their pretax profits, and real estate firms were 4 billion yen in the black from the previous quarter's pretax losses of 133.1 billion yen. Steel Makers suffered 123.8 percent lower profits, and wholesalers and retailers faced a combined decline of 16.7 percent. Capital investment by manufacturers fell 20.6 percent, almost unchanged from the previous month's 20.0 percent drop, and that by non-manufacturers improved to a 7.4 percent decline compared with the previous decline of 15.2 percent. The official said bright signs were seen among manufacturers, with a 2.2 percent rise in capital investment by electric machinery and equipment makers after eight consecutive quarters of decline.
