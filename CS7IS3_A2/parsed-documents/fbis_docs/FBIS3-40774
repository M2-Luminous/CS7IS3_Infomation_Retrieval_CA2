The EU countries are Belgium, Denmark and Greece. An agreement was signed by Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Commissioner for developing countries of the EU, Mr Manual Marin, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. The agreement will also facilitate India to have better access to the European Union technology and promote commercial exchanges. The 30-article agreement provides for setting up of a joint commission to establish priorities in relation to the objectives and examine ways and means of enhancing the partnership in almost all spheres of economic, technical and industrial cooperation. In a joint statement following the signing of the agreement, the two sides expressed their resolve to reinforce and intensify their mutual relations in the political, economic, technological and cultural fields. The EU is India's largest trading partner with a share of 25 percent of Indian exports and 33 percent of its imports. The two sides attach importance to the principles of respect for human rights and democratic rights. Article I of the agreement states "respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for the cooperation between the contracting parties." Under the agreement, the two sides committed themselves to improve the access for their products in each other's market. The acceleration of the pace of India's economic development by supporting its efforts in building up its economy would get priority. Another area was the development of existing and new forms of economic cooperation to facilitate exchanges and contacts between the business communities of the two sides to encourage investment. Support of environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources would be a focal area. The agreement has two main parts--economic and development cooperation. Under the agreement economic cooperation is structured to encourage the private sector with the expectation of resulting multiplier effects. It will involve three broad fields: --Improving the economic environment by facilitating access to European knowhow and technology. --Facilitating contacts between economic operators and other measures designed to promote commercial exchanges and investment. --Reinforcing mutual understanding of their respective economic, social and cultural environment as a basis for effective cooperation. The agreement covers cooperation in several specific fields--energy, telecommunications, electronics, and information technology, agriculture and fisheries and tourism. The agreement recognises India's need for development assistance. To contribute to India's own efforts in achieving sustainable economic development concrete projects and programmes under development cooperation will be targeted towards the poorer sections of the population. Particular attention will be given to rural development, promotion of employment in rural towns, role of women in development with an emphasis on education and family welfare and primary health care. The joint statement which was issued after the agreement underlined the commitment of contracting parties to safeguard peace and establish a just and stable international order in accordance with the United Nations charter. It suggested political dialogue at ministerial level between India and the EU trioka. The ministerial meeting is expected to be held in near future at Brussels. The ministerial meeting will exchange information on foreign policy decisions. It would also contribute to consolidating and developing the political dialogue between the parties. "European capital and technology could combine well with India's natural and human resources to cater to the growing markets in India and elsewhere in Asia," Mr Mukherjee said.
