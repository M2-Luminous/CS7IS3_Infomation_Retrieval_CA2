We express our hope that in concordance with the efforts made by the international community to strengthen the current juridical instruments and institutions set up to prevent the spreading of mass destruction weapons, all other nuclear powers will take measures similar to those adopted by the U.S. party, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
