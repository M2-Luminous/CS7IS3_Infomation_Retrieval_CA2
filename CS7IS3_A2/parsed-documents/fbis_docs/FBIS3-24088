The relative stability in the Republic of Tatarstan and its capital has become a fact, a phenomenon against which many regions of Russia are "measuring themselves." But a "slice of life" from the economy shows that positive tendencies have been achieved in far from all spheres and, moreover, the picture has many contrasts. What has brought this about? An in-depth analysis confirms that results are achieved in places where an active role is assigned to the city's executive team. In other words, we are speaking about possibilities--legal and financial--of pursuing a strong municipal policy. And, conversely, where our positions have been weak--weak from the standpoint of power of the authorities and instruments of administration--there the situation remains difficult. I have in mind above all, of course, the capital's industrial sector. We have always been proud of the fact that Kazan is a large industrial center, a city whose economy is deeply integrated into the economy not only of the republic, but also of the USSR, which is now a part of the past. And now this situation is a kind of heavy cross which the city has to bear. Suffice it to say that the financial situation [part of text missing]. Searches for the most effective model for combining market relations with state regulation of the economy have been under way for a whole year. And although stability has not come to the industrial sector, certain positive strides cannot but be noted. The results of 1993 show that the decline of industrial production, as predicted, has slowed somewhat, amounting to 14 percent of the 1992 figure. This is somewhat better than in the republic as a whole, where the decline was 14.9 percent and for the Russian Federation, where it reached 16.2 percent. We are very alarmed by the way 1994 has begun. According to the January results, industrial enterprises have allowed production to drop by 21.6 percent. It does not help much to know that the major and deepest-seated reasons lie beyond our reach. They include a narrowing of the sales market, a sharp reduction of state orders, the lack of a reliable mechanism for mutual settlements, etc. Suffice it to say that as of 1 January 1993 consumers owed enterprises of Kazan 304.6 billion rubles [R]. This sum is no more or less than about three times the monthly production volume. Naturally, this did not simply exacerbate the financial position of the enterprises, it dealt a blow to their capabilities. If there is nothing with which to buy raw and processed materials, there is no production and no final product. For the city this means a decrease in tax revenues. Such is the vicious circle. Incidentally, almost half of the debt is from orders from the Government of Russia that have not been paid for. And if we throw in the money that has slipped out of the budget of Kazan, we are looking at a figure of R100 billion. With this kind of "makeweight," we could cover all of our shortfalls. This pertains particularly to the question of why we should go to the Russian elections and whether we need defenders of our interests in the legislative assembly of Russia. As you see, we need them, and not so much from a political as from a pragmatic perspective! The crisis is being felt especially strongly by "defense," which accounts for about half of all the fixed capital of the city's industry. And the record decline of production--22.7 percent--naturally had a painful effect on the economy of the city as a whole. This is where we felt the full measure of what it means to be one of the capitals of the military-industrial complex! The republic and the city have unilaterally tried to ease the crisis here too. They have developed the concept of structural transformations of the economy. We have seen the first--so far modest--experiment in competitive enlistment of the potential of the military-industrial complex to solve the problems of the agro-industrial complex, public health, and the construction complex. From the fund for structural rearrangement under conditions of targeted preferential credit the enterprises of the city were allotted more than R6.7 billion in 1993. The situation was eased considerably by the bill of exchange from the National Bank of the Republic of Tatarstan, which made it possible to make one-fifth of the mutual settlements. It should be stipulated that we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of using purely cost-oriented mechanisms. Project and business plans of enterprises must meet the requirements of both economic expediency and the possibility of recoupment. In the summer of 1993, on the initiative of the administration, the first trade fair, called "Entrepreneurs and Production," was organized in the city. Participating in it were 84 entities of the nonstate economy. In so doing they managed to generalize and bring to the enterprises of the military-industrial complex, which were experiencing an extreme shortage of orders, a whole package of proposals from entrepreneurs of the "new wave." Last week, from the 24th through [text missing] which received a positive response from both industrial and trade enterprises. Displaying their products at the exhibition were 91 enterprises with various forms of ownership not only from the city but also from other regions of the CIS. For the first time, broad masses of the population had an opportunity to see peacetime products from the city's converted enterprises, since Kazan alone was represented by 22 enterprises and organizations of the defense complex. The preliminary results show that during the course of the exhibition, its participants scheduled the conclusion of about 350 agreements for a total of more than R20 billion. About R30 million worth of goods was sold to retail trade. Thus, the results of the exhibition show the expediency of taking such measures. As I have already said, all these measures were unilateral in nature. And, undoubtedly, such a counterbalance is not capable of halting the decline of state orders for the military-industrial complex, which has gathered immense speed. Thus, while in 1991 the Government of the Russian Federation reduced orders for "defense" by 22 percent, in 1993 the volume of the state orders here engaged less than one-fourth of the capabilities of our enterprises. Now, after signing the agreement with Russia, we have the hope of a civilized solution to such collisions. The more so since the federal government, judging from everything, has followed Tatarstan to the conclusion that the course of the reforms in this stage require not weakening but strengthening of the state's role. If we listen, we will hear that Moscow is starting to speak our language. State authority must be strengthened, and the economy requires control in the transition stage. But the main thing is that the agreement is already producing concrete, positive results: The federal government has begun to pay its debts, and the process of granting credit for conversion has started. Enterprise managers who have visited Moscow share the impression that there has been a sharp change in the attitude toward Kazan's initiatives, and the atmosphere in the high offices is fundamentally different. As concerns the relatively narrow scope of the municipal policy, its object has been and still is to produce goods that are useful to the people. A careful selection of objects for financing, in-depth expert appraisal of business plans, strict control over the expenditure of target funds, and other instruments are gradually proving their effectiveness. Thus, the Tochmash Plant assimilated the output of more than 40 items in barely three years. During the same period, Elekon assimilated the output of more than 50 new items. The most promising and significant of them are various kinds of laser equipment and instruments for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the areas of dentistry, cardiology, and gynecology. They have been supplied to the first laser center in the CIS, which was created on the basis of the association's polyclinic. At the present time the helicopter association has developed and introduced about 20 kinds of consumer goods. Among the latest innovations of the engine construction association are synchronized electric motors to be used for various purposes. The Terminal Association is producing equipment for counting banknotes, money accounting machines, strongboxes, computer equipment, anti-hijacking devices, and a broad assortment of consumer goods. In conjunction with the Medinstrument scientific production association, they are producing a mobile pneumatic drill for dentists. As a result, 11 percent more goods have been produced with the trademark of the military-industrial complex than in 1992. True, in the city as a whole, according to the results of the year, the volumes of output of consumer goods has decreased by 4.9 percent. [Text missing] the decline was twice as great. The condition of the industrial "knights in shining armor," including the flagmen of the military-industrial complex, undoubtedly has a painful effect on the economy of the city as a whole and on its social microclimate. The downsizing of production leads to a reduction of the tax base and, consequently, to a reduction of budget capabilities. All that is fair. At the same time, the practice of reform forces us to pay more and more attention to microeconomic processes. And because of their nature and position, the local authorities are responsible for precisely the "trivia of life." The picture, briefly, is as follows. The production of foodstuffs in 1993 as a whole increased by 11.9 percent. Here is the breakdown of the growth for individual groups: sausage items--7.8 percent, fatty cheeses--40 percent, butter--almost 1.5-fold, and confectionery items--17.2 percent. Note that this is not a decline but actually growth. And in the high echelons of power they have heard this assessment, expressed with relief: Kazan is finally working independently in the area of the food policy. On the whole, the results of the year make it possible as a minimum to maintain the existing level of consumption of the main food products. Consequently, we need not speak about a crisis of the food complex. As for rumors about famine among the people, let these discussions remain on the conscience of failed politicos. The agrarian sector of the republic, in which we are also investing a good deal, is becoming a field for studying experience. The Government of Russia has expressed a readiness to make large investments in our food complex. And here, as we see, the seeds of the agreement are already beginning to sprout. Of course, a strong food policy comes with its own price tag. Stable provision of food products was achieved through active state support of the commodity producers. The budget took over half of the costs for increasing the fertility of the land, and building enterprises of the food and processing industry; there are still significant subsidies for grain and milk, etc., etc. The money for a strong food program, naturally, does not grow on trees; it has been earned and collected, including on the territory of Kazan. Thus, we have every reason to say that the city is responding adequately to the condition of the food market. On the Situation of the Construction Complex Runaway inflation, which has made long-term investments disadvantageous, and the state's investment policy, which is growing weaker and weaker--these two factors are quite enough to lead the construction complex to ruin. And in Kazan this means 118 construction organizations and 17 enterprises of the construction industry, which employ more than 33,000 people. Thus, radical steps were necessary in order to preserve the capital's construction potential. And the basic regrouping of the client forces became such a turning point. Thus, while in 1991 enterprises and departments accounted for 70 percent of the construction of facilities of the social sphere, and the local soviets--only 30 percent, and this was largely with capital of debtor enterprises, now the ratio has changed to exactly the opposite. Namely, the municipal order has grown to 70 percent. And it must be noted that the solutions to all the problems related to the development of the city, which used to pass through numerous departmental channels, is now fully our responsibility. During January-December 1993 R77 billion in capital investments were made in construction of facilities of the social sphere. It is clear that when the city administration was the main client, it was possible to change the ratio between facilities for production and nonproduction purposes in favor of the latter. As compared to the previous year, 1.5 times more accommodations for schoolchildren were introduced, polyclinic accommodations--4.2 times, and seating in public catering facilities--double. At the same time, there were arrears in municipal services networks--by 20 percent, and trading areas--by 40 percent. It must also be noted that for the first time in many years not a single children's preschool institution has been released in turnkey condition, although they are being constructed, and the same is true of consumer service enterprises. Little consolation is provided by the fact that because of the higher prices there has been a sharp decline in the demand for municipal services, and the number wishing to attend kindergartens is not increasing but decreasing. As before, the most burning problem is housing, which is aggravated even more by the problem of Kazan slums. The program for resettlement of residents from damaged, dilapidated, and flooded buildings must reach the mark of releasing 500,000 square meters of new residential space per year. In 1993, of the overall volume of nonproduction capital investments, 57 percent was used for housing construction. The result was 361,300 square meters, which is 100.4 percent of the projection. I can say unequivocally that construction workers are far from reaching the limit of their capabilities. One of the reasons lies within the complex itself. This is the poor effectiveness in the organization of construction. In 1993 construction organizations with all forms of ownership introduced fixed capital valued at R41.8 billion, which is R64.5 billion less than the amount of capital investments utilized. For each ruble of invested capital, there are only 39 kopeks (in the republic as a whole--46 kopeks) in fixed capital that is introduced, while back in 1985 this indicator reached 82 kopeks. Thus, as compared to 1985 the effectiveness of the introduction of fixed capital has decreased by half. Market mechanisms in capital construction have not yet been fully set in motion. As before, most of the introduction of facilities comes at the end of the year, the construction front remains extremely broad as before, and capital investments are being dispersed among a large number of construction projects. On the other hand, one cannot but recognize that a strong investment policy requires full-fledged financial support from the client. And the city has been catastrophically short of money, especially recently. Thus, our debt to the construction workers as of today is about R24 billion. Problems of finances and the budget as a whole will be discussed later. Here I shall limit myself to the remark that the administration is placing a certain amount of hope on housing auctions. We laid the groundwork for this new mechanism back in the middle of last year, when we took out credit for the construction of a building. Today at least two sections are ready for sale "on the block." At the same time, there is no doubt that the proportion of alternative investments in housing should increase. In particular, individual housing construction is being increasingly developed. While five years ago 11,900 square meters were introduced, this figure has now doubled. But serious problems are standing in our way here. As a rule, individual construction is done on vacant areas of urban settlements or in the suburbs. Thus, "mini-cities" appear, which have to be provided with all the necessary facilities for social and cultural-domestic purposes, that is, all the amenities, it is necessary to build roads [text missing] public health, etc. All this social infrastructure requires large additional expenditures and is one more burden that the city must take on itself--there is nobody else. Even cooperation with the funds of individual builders can provide for the construction of only an individual facility, and it can in no way handle the project of comprehensive building development. On the Condition of Branches of the City Economy With the breakdown of the previous system of branch management, the disturbance of economic ties, and other changes in our society in recent years, there have been serious contradictions and disproportions, which have entailed a considerable increase in problems of developing branches of the urban economy. In order to make it easier for these branches to exist under market conditions, throughout 1993 the city administration worked to transfer all branches of the urban economy to municipal ownership of the city. All of the following have been accepted for municipal ownership: 25 public health facilities, 36--public education, 300--trade, 57--public catering, 2 sports facilities, 12 movie theaters, 8 housing and municipal services enterprises, and the housing supply of the local soviets. The State Committee on the Administration of State Property notes that Kazan is still the only region in the republic where municipal ownership is fully formed. The basis of the economy of any city is the reliable functioning and further development of its municipal services, which determine the degree of architectural development of the housing supply, the provision of water, gas, heat, the discharge of waste waters, etc. The housing supply of Kazan as of the beginning of this year amounted to 16.9 million square meters. One should note, however, the alarming tendency toward ever-increasing wear and tear on the housing supply. Over 10 years the volume of capital repair has decreased almost threefold: from 182,000 square meters in 1983 to 70,000 square meters in 1993. The delivery of water into the network, including for the population and for municipal needs, increased more rapidly than did the housing supply and the number of city dwellers. This, of course, is gratifying. Something else is alarming: Every sixth (!) cubic meter of purified water in 1993 was wasted, being reflected in the indicator "leakage." Another problem of the water and sewage works, which is typical, incidentally, of other public works systems as well, is the wearing out of the water and sewage systems, which exceeds 40 percent and is increasing every year. The city is still using systems that were built in the last century--35 percent of the water mains and 25 percent of the city sewage systems are completely worn out. The wearing out of mains is especially great in Baumanskiy Rayon, where 68 percent of the water mains are completely worn out. As a result, over five years the amount of damage has increased threefold, which, in turn, disorganizes the work of city transportation, causes appreciable economic damage, and leads to millions in expenditures on repairing them. For the sake of illustration, allow me to give just one figure: In order to fill the gaps in 1993, Vodokanal spent R138 million. Obviously, it is impossible to refurbish all the existing mains in a short period of time. So we must provide for control of the condition of existing collectors without excavation. We need new equipment--special machines with remote control. And among the many [text missing] this problem should be priority. When it comes to the city's energy supply, here one can clearly see a course toward increasing the amount of gas used in households. During the past five years, street gas networks have been extended by 35 percent and the number of apartments supplied with gas has increased by 20 percent. As for heating, the development of this area is somewhat behind schedule. The balance of heating capacities and the load from consumers on centralized sources is developing today with a deficit of heat in a number of rayons of the city, above all Leninskiy and Moskovskiy. The city administration has recently adopted a number of decisions regarding this issue, and measures are being taken to stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, the problem is exacerbated to a considerable degree by the increased losses of heat in the systems. During the past five years, they have increased by 17 percent, and consequently, reserves for economizing exist here too. As of today almost all branches of the urban municipal economy are operating at a loss, requiring an annual subsidy of up to 40 percent of the city budget. Today the city administration is taking measures to adapt the branches to the new management conditions. Versions of an economic plan for their functioning in contractual relations with the city administration are being worked out. In order to maintain the necessary level of reliability of fixed capital, it envisions a transition to economically substantiated rates and other decisions. Ultimately it will be proposed that all municipal services get away from subsidies and earn their own money in keeping with the quality of their service. Trade A most important role in the life support for the capital of Tatarstan is assigned to branches of trade, public catering, and the sphere of services. The stability of the operation of the aforementioned branches determines the standard of living of the population. Despite certain difficulties of the transition period, the situation in the consumer market remains relatively stable, with a tendency toward activation. The aforementioned branches are actually switching to market relations. An ever greater role in the activity of the branches of trade, public catering, and consumer services is being played by the nonstate sector, whose proportion of the commodity turnover last year amounted to about 5 percent and, according to predictions, will increase to 25 percent this year. Market relations have promoted a considerable expansion of the assortment of the goods offered to the consumer, but at the same time the growth of prices for goods and services has significantly limited the consumer demand of the population. The situation on the food commodities market is improving somewhat. The supply of bread, flour, cereal, sugar, and meat and dairy products last year was normal, for the most part. As early as the second half of 1993, the city was able to abandon the system of norm-setting for the main kinds of foodstuffs. Unfortunately, at the present time the consumer market is being filled to a considerable degree through purchases from abroad. Some directors of local enterprises that produce foodstuffs have already begun to complain about the domination of goods from overseas. But the market is the market, and its laws cannot be changed. Prices in the stores have come very close to prices in the markets, and for certain products, such as sugar, they are even lower on the market than in state trade. Thus there has been a steady tendency toward saturating the market with goods, expanding their assortment, and toward the possibility of improving the art of service [text missing] ends up with more stable prices. It is intended to continue working in this direction. The main thing under these conditions is to clearly analyze the tendencies in the development of the branch, promptly correct mistakes and omissions, and achieve more complete satisfaction of the demand of the population. The experience of many regions of Russia where the level of privatization of trade is much higher than in Tatarstan, for example, shows that an unregulated, "savage" market has led to partial elimination of self-service in trade and to interruptions in the sale of small and unprofitable goods (matches, salt, bread, and milk). Hence, our task is to start in our policy not from theory, but from practice, from the realities of the day. There is a serious lag in the republic industry for the production of industrial goods. Because of this, and in order to saturate the city consumer market, goods valued at R17.4 billion have been purchased outside the republic. Problems of getting started, naturally, are reflected in prices. So far, they are still somewhat higher than, say, in Moscow. But when this mechanism is developed and stabilized, when signs of saturation or a certain surplus appear, and the levers of competition begin to function among producers and in trade--then the price mechanism will be regulated. A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the economic reforms in the republic. On the Course of Privatization Privatization is an indispensable part of the process of creating competitive market relations during the course of the implementation of the economic reform. A detailed analysis of the state of affairs in this area of our activity will be presented in the report from the Committee on Management of Communal Property. Therefore, I shall discuss only certain aspects, which cannot but be noted when evaluating the socioeconomic and political situation. As of today, what are the results of privatization in the city of Kazan, and what is the dynamic of this process? From the standpoint of numerical indicators, they do not really satisfy us. But something else gives us hope: We have laid a reliable foundation for further work. During the course of privatization, we have revealed many problems that have demanded solutions and have naturally directed all of us toward increasing the efficiency of the operation of enterprises. What percentage of the shares should remain under state ownership for now, how should "gold shares" be introduced and where, and what should be done so that facilities for social and cultural purposes do not suffer? The results of privatization in 1993 are practical experience whose study will enable us to avoid a number of mistakes and blunders in the future and also to carry out the process of privatization in the city more fruitfully and at accelerated rates. By the beginning of this year, 13 industrial enterprises of the city had been converted to joint-stock companies. After January, their number had increased to 28. Among them are such giants as Organicheskiy Sintez, KMPO, KVPO, and others. Although it must be noted that the results of the production activity of joint-stock companies has still not produced the desired effect. As of 1993 the decline of production volumes at their enterprises amounted to 18.5 percent, which is higher than in the city as a whole. During January the reduction of production volumes at them amounted to 26.7 percent. Of course, conclusions here would be premature; the joint-stock companies are only at the beginning of their path. At the same time, it is clear that the creation of joint-stock companies in and of itself is not [text missing]. When speaking about the course of so-called small-scale privatization, one should note that its main areas have been the spheres of trade and public catering. At the present time 26.9 percent of the stores turned over for municipal ownership have been privatized and six trade facilities have been sold at auction. In the sphere of public catering, three enterprises have been privatized and seven facilities have been sold at auction. Of the consumer service facilities, eight enterprises have been privatized, as have two in the sphere of municipal housing. And although the rates of privatization still lag behind those earmarked, all the conditions for speeding this work up already exist. We are disturbed more by another aspect of privatization--not quantitative, but qualitative. We understand quite well that the administrative-vertical system of administration, at least in the sphere of service, has run its course. But it is also impossible not to manage, while bearing responsibility to the population for assortment and for working conditions and for the quality of services. Still, the economic and legal levers are very, very weak so far. Actually, it is now impossible to dissolve a leasing agreement or to take away a license or to force trade in what the population needs and where it needs it. This means that it is necessary to have laws on administrative liability for violation of the rules of trade and service and on trade and state trade employees. There is also a need to create a department for protecting the rights of the consumers, and thus the administrations of the city and rayons will have the possibility not only of controlling the process of privatization, but also of influencing its components in the interests of the population. One of the most important elements of the process of redistribution of the property is the privatization of the housing fund. Preparations for this began long before the adoption of the law; a unified city automated information system was created, and it is already on-line. As of 1 March 1994, in Kazan 9,522 applications had been submitted from citizens wishing to gain ownership of their apartments and 4,698 families, or 1.7 percent, have already become owners of housing, while more than 7,000 contracts have been prepared to be issued to citizens. Foreign Economic Issues One of the important areas of concern under the conditions of the transition to the market should be the attraction of foreign investments. We regard the activity of foreign capital in the city's economy as one of the factors contributing to making economic life more active. Foreign investments may be made through granting credit, buying shares in enterprises of the city and real estate, and also through having foreign firms create their own and joint enterprises. At this stage, foreign investments are made mainly through creating enterprises with foreign investments. As of today there are 78 of these in the city, which make up 67 percent of all the joint ventures of the Republic of Tatarstan. There are also 23 representative offices of foreign firms operating in the city. Active work for attracting investors to the city economy is continuing. Thus, for example, in order to develop a base for the construction industry, the creation of the Plastbau joint venture is now being completed. The plant opening is scheduled for 31 March. The enterprise's main task is to produce construction elements according to Italian technology for 1,000 cottages or apartments per year. The amount of the investments from the foreign partners was 7,200,000 [text missing] The bidding for reconstruction of the Kazan airport, which was summed up this past 22-23 February, resulted in a victory for the French firm Bouygues, which proposed the best plans and financial arrangements for the reconstruction work. Additionally, this same firm, getting its stride, is taking on the reconstruction of the Kazan Hotel. The project is estimated at $68 million, and the French are investing $54 million, or 80 percent. The example of the construction of a modern pavilion on the area of the VIKO [expansion not indicated] (the former VDNKh [Exhibition of the Achievements of the USSR National Economy]) is curious and instructive. The German firm was unable to return to the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan the credit it had taken out, and as a result the pavilion became our property. Let us note that we have managed to invigorate foreign economic activity with practically no legal base, no laws, and being bound hand and foot. But now, since the Moscow "summit," the Iron Curtain has been lifted. One of the first examples: The grand joint Russian-Tatarstan project has gotten off the ground--the Kazan Logistics Center. The TASIS (Technical Assistance to the CIS) Committee in Brussels has approved the program for technical assistance to the Russian Federation from the European Union, one of whose points is the plan for the creation of a logistics center. The next stage will be for the corresponding EU Commissions to hold bidding for designing the center. In order to regulate the legal, organizational, and economic principles of foreign economic activity, the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan adopted the law "On Foreign Investments." A program for attracting foreign investments is being prepared at the city level, and incentive funds will be created for them: land, real estate, and financial. For those foreign financial groups that will be investing money in branches that are priorities to the city and thus contributing to solving the city's crucial problems we intend to grant tax and other benefits. Social Policy Our entry into the market has generated quite a few previously unfamiliar problems, whose solutions require additional expenditures. Thus, the stratification of the society according to income has defined that part of the Kazan residents who are now faced with the problem of survival. And today we are all disturbed by the question of how to organize social protection for people who need it and make it more active. Targeted protection of the population is undoubtedly the radical solution that practically everyone today regards as a complex of timely state measures capable of if not balancing out then at least easing the pressure of market forces. In order to solve this problem, the city has created a unified service for social protection of the underprivileged strata of the population, and the organization of an information bank based on the official passport of the individual is in the stage of completion. Card files have been created of orphan children, disabled persons, families with many children, elderly couples who are living alone, participants in the cleanup after the disaster of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and other categories of the population who are in need of our increased attention. Today we include among them more than 115,000 Kazan residents to whom just last year material aid in the amount of R29 million was given out of the city fund for social support. The sum not so [text missing] of the entire complex of work conducted on this plane. Designating 1 October as the Day of the Elderly has become a good tradition in the city. In spite of certain difficulties, 17 Veteran stores are continuing to function in the city, emergency social assistance departments have been opened up in two rayons of the city, and work is being done to create a network of medical-social facilities. The city social rehabilitation center for disabled children was opened up in December 1993, and work is being done to create facilities to stay overnight and a center for comprehensive service for pensioners. Questions of a stage-by-stage transition to payment for housing in an amount that provides for reimbursement for outlays, taking into account benefits for certain categories of the population, are in the stage of being developed. The market is the market, but today we cannot let city dwellers go without our attention and assistance. On the Condition of the Fight Against Crime The fight against crime remains one of the major areas in the activity of state administrative organs of the republic and city. The law "On Extraordinary Measures for Fighting Crime" has become the basis that enables us to step up our attack on crime even more. The reinforcement of the city militia personnel is continuing; in 1993 it increased by 1,200 people. This year it is planned to introduce an additional 1,000 staff units. It was proposed to the leaders of the seven largest enterprises of the city that they create on their territories on a contractual basis militia divisions for protecting the facilities belonging to them. These subdivisions have been created at the imeni Gorbunov Kazan joint-stock production association, the Orgsintez joint-stock company, the Polimerfoto plant, the KVPO, and others. In order to prevent apartment burglaries during 1993, 1,636 apartments were equipped with burglar alarm devices. Proposals for financing and additional material and technical support for all rayon internal affairs administrations and the internal affairs administration of the city of Kazan were taken into account when compiling the budgets for 1993-1994. For financing the municipal militia and measures of the "Complex of Immediate Measures for Fighting Crime in the City of Kazan During 1993-1995" during the report year, R1.4784 billion was allotted from the budget of the city of Kazan, including for financing the program--R841.3 million. From the city budget, R840 million was allocated for acquiring automotive transportation, supplies, and equipment for the Patrul-Kazan ASU [automated control system]. The main thing that law enforcement organs have gained is confidence in their forces; they are filled with resolve to curb the flow of crime, which has threatened to become uncontrollable. According to the results of 1993, the solution of crimes has risen from 53.9 to 63.8 percent. The courts received 3,314 cases more than in 1992, and this is very important. People regard the work of law enforcement organs primarily from the standpoint of the inevitability of punishment, and we must do everything possible. On Execution of the Consolidated Budget The city budget is becoming a basic and ever more decisive instrument of our socioeconomic policy. Today I could not name a single municipal problem that could not be solved if we had enough monetary resources. The year 1993 was marked by exertion of all forces to mobilize incomes. Tax, financial, inspection, law enforcement [text missing] rayon administrations for the first time collected R245.5 billion in revenues on the territory, 55.7 percent or R137 billion of which, in keeping with existing normatives, went into the city budget. The over-fulfillment of the revenue part of the budget amounted to R89 billion (or 265 percent). At the same time, because of price factors and other well-known reasons, budget expenditures have grown at even more rapid rates. In essence, the city administration has come up against the problem of choosing to cancel certain municipal orders or continuing to work while increasing municipal debts. I can say definitely that the latter path was chosen, because otherwise it would have been impossible to avoid the threat of the collapse of such a complex as the construction complex and services so necessary to the city such as the association for urban planning. This is why the city's carryover budget indebtedness for 1993 for the various branches of the municipal economy amounted to more than R28 billion. The system of strict financial discipline I have introduced, which presupposes strictly specified expenditure of funds, pushes us toward the objective inevitability of such a factor as indexation. Compare. Unprecedented amounts have been spent on capital repair and current maintenance of roads and other facilities for outside urban development--R16.2 billion. As a result, 1.718 million square meters of roads and sidewalks have been repaired. And almost the same amount--R15 billion--was spent to increase the wages of workers in the social-cultural sphere. For the development of housing and municipal services enterprises, R25.1 billion were allotted from the budget; for capital repair of the housing supply and landscaping the areas around buildings--R3 billion. At the same time, because of the application of regulated rates, housing and municipal services enterprises were allotted R19 billion just in the form of reimbursement. Analysis shows the city's need for funds for indexation of expenditures amounted to R170 billion during the year. Republic organs reimbursed the Kazan budget for only a small proportion of the funds--no more than 15 percent. As a result, practically all of the extra revenues collected--more than R80 billion--went precisely for indexing expenditures and increasing wages. Work done for capital construction (a large part of which is free housing) cost the budget R50.5 billion. On compensation for housing construction collectives, R2.6 billion was spent. Such is the price, in the first place, of inflation, and, in the second place, of a socially oriented economy. In addition to this, the city budget was formed and executed far beyond its capabilities. At the same time, it is possible arbitrarily to separate the problems that are within our reach from those that are completely beyond our capabilities. The payment discipline of the departments remains one of the most crucial problems. According to data for 1 March of this year, the arrears on one of the leading taxes--on profit--amounted to more than R4 billion for the city. The second most important is the income tax from citizens. The steady increase in the untaxed minimum wage--generally a good thing--leads to a narrowing of the base of this tax. Moreover, the decline of production, or rather, its consequences, have a negative effect, as do the reduction of the staffs and the work week, forced administrative leaves, etc. In a word, the income tax is shrinking like shagreen leather. Against this background it is quite [text missing] negligent attitude toward the budget and financial discipline. Unsatisfactory supervision on the part of the Gorelektrotransport association led to a reduction of the volume of paid transportation. It transported 25 percent fewer paying passengers than last year and failed to receive a total of R138 million in revenues. The production association Kazgorzhilkhoz is not taking the proper measures to reduce defaulted indebtedness on apartment rent and municipal services. As of 1 January 1994, this amounted to R35.8 million or 22.7 percent of the monthly amount. Defaulted indebtedness is especially great in Baumanskiy (40.1 percent) and Vakhitovskiy (35.5 percent) rayons. As a result of reducing the volumes of bathing services by 25.4 percent and laundry services by 12.2 percent as compared to the corresponding period of last year, the Kombytservis leasing association failed to receive R88.6 million in revenues. Inspections conducted by financial organs of the city established cases of unauthorized use of funds allotted from the budget for the development of housing and municipal services amounting to an overall sum of R34 million. Under the conditions of the transition of the city economy to market relations and the critical shortage of financial resources for solving the city's problems, questions of local taxation become crucial. Local taxes are still an unutilized reserve for Kazan. In essence, in a situation with a critical budget deficit, we have indulged in an impermissible luxury by introducing only 12 local taxes and fees of the 20 that are envisioned by legislation. The mistake that was made must be rectified here. In this hall, at this session. The more so since the situation has become even more severe. The financial organs--federal and republic--henceforth will regard local taxes as reserves that have not been taken into account and will predict them in the revenue part of the city budget. And, in particular, all of our appeals "to above" with one or another financial initiative will be rejected, referring to the seven unutilized sources. Actually, local taxes and fees make up a relatively small proportion. Their essence lies elsewhere; everyone must learn to live within their means and fill the treasury from their own sources.
