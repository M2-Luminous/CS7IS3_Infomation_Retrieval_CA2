In a press statement today, Hawatimah said PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat should learn a lesson, cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and return to national unity and consensus in accordance with international legitimacy. Hawatimah said escalation of the intifadah to topple the Oslo and Cairo agreements opens the door for a political settlement based on withdrawal, the end of settlement construction and massacres, and securing the right to self-determination and independence. In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has come after the PLO and Israel signed the Gaza and Jericho agreement, which provided the enemy with a cover for its repeated crimes. A statement issued by the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces said the atrocious crime is but the bloody fruit of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and a product of 'Arafat and his team's policy which submitted to all Israeli conditions. The statement, issued following an extraordinary command meeting of the alliance, emphasized that the Gaza-Jericho agreement entrenched the Zionist occupation and accepted the continuation of settlements and settlers on our land and among our kinsfolk in order to kill and destroy.
