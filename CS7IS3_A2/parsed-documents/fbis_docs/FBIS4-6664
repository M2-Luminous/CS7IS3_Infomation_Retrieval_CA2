For the exercise, Highway 104 was closed for the fourth time this year. A notice by the USMC says the three-day exercise will be continued until 22 April, using three gun platforms in the training field. The prefectural government said the exercise is the 146th since March 1973. Kin just elected a new mayor on 17 April. Commenting on the exercise held in the wake of his inauguration, Mayor-elect Katsuhiro Yoshida stated: "U.S. exercises should be stopped. I am planning a field trip to inspect the areas adjoining the training field to learn about the actual problems of U.S. bases." Early in the morning of 22 April, local leftist groups gathered around the training field and repeatedly shouted: "Stop the firing exercises!" About 30 people joined a rally held by The Security Repeal, Livelihood, and Democracy Protection Okinawa Prefecture United Action Liaison Council [Toitsuren] starting at 0700 [2200 GMT]. At the rally, Chairman Hiroaki Yoshizawa of the Anti-Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Council Okinawa Branch [Ken-Gensuikyo] stressed: "The live-fire exercise is held in the wake of a series of aircraft crashes on Kadena Air Base and Futenma Air Station. We must jointly oppose such brutal practices by the U.S. Forces." Meanwhile, the Okinawa Peace Campaign Center also held a 100-man rally on a hill in Igei District starting at 0800 [2300 GMT]. Chairman Zenshun Arakaki stated: "U.S. Forces conduct various exercises almost daily, as if Okinawa is a battlefield. We must be persistent in opposing such practices in order to stop them someday."
