Ukraine is as dependent as some other CIS countries on Moscow for energy. However, unlike Armenia, our payments were not in diamonds or gold, but in sugar, meat, our fleet, nuclear weapons and, now, by renting out our territory. On top of that, our former premiers and vice-premiers responsible for this state of affairs pose as Ukraine's saviors. For example, Fokin claimed to have secured a direct source of gasoline after visiting the Tyumen oil fields, a promise that turned out to be as ephemeral as Fokin himself. Yuliy Yoffe also disappeared after promising rivers of Iranian oil, and is now working in the USA. Leonid Kuchma did not let a day pass by without talking about Russian altruism. What that meant was that Chernomyrdin gave Ukraine a drop of gasoline as a birthday present for Kuchma! After the drop, agriculture and transportation came to a standstill and power stations were starving for fuel. Water transport suffered and the economic solutions advocated by Kuchma brought Ukraine into subservience to its northern neighbor. Now the Russian energy monopolists have developed an unquenchable appetite for Ukrainian pipelines, and ordered a so-called Ukrainian government delegation to Moscow. `Ukrainian' in name only since Vice-Premier Landyk, who headed the delegation, recognizes only Russian as the official state language. The personages accompanying him, and who were also disinterested in Ukrainian national interests, were as follows: Mykhaylo Kovalko, Director, Derzhkamnafthaz; Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM; Volodymyr Novytskyy, First Deputy-Minister of Industry; Anatoliy Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy; and Viktor Hladush, Deputy Minister of External Economic Relations; as well as an entire cohort of lower-ranking ministerial minions. The Russian side, represented by Rem Vyakhirev's stock-company GAZPROM, immediately went on the attack! They demanded that Ukraine pay its energy debts within a month or fuel deliveries would stop. True, they made a concession and allowed last year's debt to be paid in cash and industrial goods. But this year's debt, they insisted out of sheer friendship, has to be paid in either Russian rubles or American dollars. Furthermore, beginning with April 1st deliveries will depend on prepayments and the Ukrainian industry was accused of `stealing' Russian gas from the pipelines. The first attack was immediately followed by another: Vyakhirev demanded that Ukraine immediately turn over its pipelines, refineries and other fuel supply facilities in Western Ukraine, as well as port facilities in Odessa and Illichiv to GAZPROM and that Russians have exclusive control. Those are conditions for "taking pity" and agreeing not only to resume gas deliveries in full but also to make up for 80 percent of the lost Turkmen deliveries. Even Rem Vyakhirev gloated before Moscow journalists that "This agreement is not to Ukraine's advantage!" The Landyk team was shown to be completely ineffective; the only remaining unresolved issue is who is to have the final control over the Ukrainian fuel supply network. However, one doesn't have to be a politician to realize that our northern neighbor, pretending to make concessions, continues to press his own interests. Ukraine and the other `near abroad' countries are of vital importance to the Russian gas interests. It is through Ukrainian territory that Russia exports 90 percent of its gas to Western Europe at a considerable profit. Russia cannot enter the European market without Ukraine, although plans are being made to go through Belarus and Poland. But that will cost a lot and GAZPROM doesn't have the resources. Even so deliveries to Bulgaria and Turkey will have to go through Ukrainian pipelines. Can you image the hue and cry in Moscow if the Khokhols [derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians] suddenly emulated the so-called older brother's power play by demanding remuneration for transit rights in hard currency? This is not something that I advocate, but in an extreme situation it might become necessary if we are forced to it. What prevented the Ukrainian emissaries from responding in kind to this type of one-sided pressure? Surely we have the right to look after our own interests. Unfortunately, Landyk gave in and agreed to joint oversight over Ukrainian pipelines, and wherever you have two bosses you are going to have problems. At present we have neither the dollars nor the rubles to pay Russia for energy. But that does not mean that we have to sell our territorial rights. Our debts could be covered by a rational economic reforms but for the failure of our present and past governments to act in a responsible manner. The second round of negotiations will take place in Moscow on April 10. Russia won't back off and will continue to demand a controlling block of shares. Belarus is already on her knees for the 21 billion cubic meters of gas that GAZPROM promised to provide for a 51 percent share in the BILORUSTRANSHAZ concern. Ukraine needs almost five times as much gas, and this need is playing into Russia's hands. How do our specialists feel about Landyk's position? Taday Mykhalevych, chairman of the Joint Dispatching Administration of UKRHAZPROM, has stated that "We cannot give Russia Ukrainian pipelines on the basis of a forced, one-sided agreement... Suppose we pay our present debts this way. Then what of the future? Will we sell our remaining gas pipelines?" Our officials should listen to Mr. Mykhalevych, who has risen through the ranks in UKRHAZPROM from an operator to chairman of one of its main administrations. Mykhalevych suggests that Russia cover some of the construction costs of the Urengoy-Pomari-Uzhhorod pipeline. We could also help Russia develop some of its resources in its northern regions, but all of this would have to be on the basis of fair financial arrangements. Today such financial arrangements cover the cost of only 23 percent of the gas we need, and the rest has to be financed from other sources. Last year we used over 100 billion cubic meters of gas, a figure suggesting that there is considerable room for greater efficiency. This problem was previously addressed by academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy who pointed out that gas use could be reduced by at least 25 billion cubic meters. A more rational approach to efficient utilization of our resources, exploratory efforts, strict regulation and legal sanctions against wasteful practices could improve our situation considerably. In addition, the best exploratory equipment should be obtained from abroad in combination with appropriate political and diplomatic initiatives. Unfortunately, the government generally relies on administrative sanctions, and its efforts have been limited to construction of a new, semiprivate terminal near Odessa. Search for new gas fields is in disarray. Half of the boreholes remain unused because of lack of special pipes, and only three of 12 new gas fields scheduled for production this year are being developed. Because of lack of funds geologists have almost stopped exploratory projects. Exploitation of the Sea of Azov and Black Sea shelves lies in the distant future. The reserves of the available fields are too small and production is too costly because the fields are too scattered. On paper everything looks fine, but in practice the national energy program has too many holes in it and Russia is using this knowledge to her advantage. What will our delegates do at the next meeting in Moscow? I could get no answer despite making every attempt to get such information from the ministries and departments that are involved in these negotiations. Kovalko, the director of Derzhkamnafthaz, on returning from Moscow immediately repaired to Poltava for pre-election campaigning for a parliamentary seat. Yevhen Sukhin, his first deputy, didn't have a minute to spare for me for a telephone interview. Viktor Hladush, Deputy Minister of External Economic Relations, was also conscientious in avoiding me, and a fierce secretary blocked my access to Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM. Anatoliy Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy, escaped through a side door. Their assistants -- heads of various administrations and departments -- angrily rebuffed me with "We will not give you any information! We have received no instructions on this score; we don't know what course of action we will take!" So what are the conclusions? Basically, we see a repetition of last year's story with the Black Sea fleet which Ukraine agreed to give up to Russia and the current defense minister finds it an acceptable solution. I am certain an analogous outcome awaits the `gas talks' if Ukrainian interests are betrayed. The pipelines should have only one owner! Russia is demanding prepayments from us, and we should demand prepayments from Russia for using our distribution networks.
