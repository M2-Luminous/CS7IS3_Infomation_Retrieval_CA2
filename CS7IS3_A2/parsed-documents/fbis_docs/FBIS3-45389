"This year will see the highest degree of reforms," said Hong Hu, vice-minister of the state commission for restructuring the economy, adding that the greater the degree of reform, "the stronger the social impact will be." "Governments at all levels will act in accordance with the overall arrangement of the central committee and the State Council," he said at a news conference. "We will deepen the reforms and maintain stability," he added. Beijing decided in November to speed up liberalisation of the economy, particularly reform of state enterprises, banking, real estate, and the taxation and price systems. Hong said the reforms were necessary to establish a socialist market economy, but were risky as China was facing inflationary pressure from the previous year. But, he added, "we are confident of keeping inflation under 10 percent" in 1994. In 1993, the economy grew at 13 percent, with the cost of living climbing 14 percent, despite an austerity plan imposed during the second half of the year. Last year's overheated economy was aggravated by the inability of the authorities to fully control provincial development, and Beijing knows future economic liberalisation has to be controlled to prevent chaos, Chinese and western experts said. One of the most dangerous reforms socially is the transformation of state enterprises, making them responsible for their own losses and profits. "It is the most difficult area", said Hong. One third of state firms suffered losses last year, with another third encountering financial difficulties, according to government sources. These reforms have to be accompanied by a stricter application of bankruptcy laws, and could cause millions of lay-offs. For the time being, the reforms will be applied in the 100 largest companies. "The most important (thing) is to improve and reinforce macro-control," Hong said.
