According to diplomatic reports, these commanders are planning to deal a crushing blow to the pillars of the regime in Algeria. Approximately 40 percent of the Algerian Army's equipment and weapons has reached the hands of Islamists between November of last year and this February. A recent report by the U.S. State Department affirms that the Islamists' control of the Algerian regime would shatter stability in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Arab Gulf regions. The report expresses extreme concern at the prospects of the Islamists' reaching power in Algeria, particularly because the Algerian Army has proved to be extremely weak and divided before them. The report stresses that the Algerian Army will fall under the control of the Islamists in the next six months. The report does not rule out the possibility that the Islamists could rule Algeria by next year. The report stresses the need for rapid intervention to rescue Algeria from the "fundamentalists" and giving the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean specific prerogatives to monitor the situation and intervene immediately should conditions become unfavorable to the government. Accordingly, reports indicate that the U.S. Defense Department (the Pentagon) has been instructed to prepare a plan on the various political and military possibilities in Algeria in the coming stage and the U.S. role to deal with them. The U.S. report stresses that the Islamists' control of the country will be harmful to U.S. security in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and the Arab Gulf. [passage omitted]
