Consequently, Anhui has made remarkable strides in economic contruction; various social undertakings have made new progress; the socialist spiritual civilization drive has been further intensified; and favorable trends for vigorous development have appeared across Anhui. Meanwhile, Anhui has earnestly implemented the guidelines of the double-support work meeting held in Yanan; has upheld the policy of "consolidating, developing, and improving military-civilian ties"; has concentrated energies on developing social productive forces and on raising military fighting capacity; has conscientiously promoted double-support activities; and has continually consolidated and developed new relations between the military and the people, whereby "their hearts are linked togehter and beat as one, and they share a common destiny." Anhui has made progress in expanding the scope and content of double-support work; and has improved the overall standards of the activities. Therefore, the general situation has been very good. Speaking at the meeting were responsible comrades from Military Unit No. 80302 garrisoned in Anhui, from the Hefei City Government, and from the Anhui Military District.
