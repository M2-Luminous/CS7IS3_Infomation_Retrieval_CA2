Hong Kong's political battlefield provides fertile ground for China to employ this powerful political weapon in place of more violent means to impose its will on the political system. Hong Kong entered a new era of political pluralism after the signing of the Joint Declaration. But the concept of pluralism was carried too far as democratic parties sprouted like mushrooms. The union of the two parties is not only a pragmatic response to China's divisive strategy, but a rare move breaking the cultural myth that Chinese people are hopeless in standing united together. It would only be too natural for Beijing to read this unprecedented development in Hong Kong's short democratic history with an eye of suspicion. Lee and Cheung yesterday came out as winners, although the leader of the new party will not be decided until a party election in October. The appeal for others to join the union was directed to other equally influential politicians like Christine Loh and Emily Lau, both independent legislative councillors. If they heed the appeal, it will not only soften the male-dominated image of the new party, but harden its political muscle by showing voters that the new party is equipped with some of the most forthright pioneering personalities who will contest the 1995 election. This, in turn, will be balanced by the relatively moderate and intellectual former members of the Meeting Point. One of the losers is Frederick Fung Kin-kee's Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL). The ADPL's image was tarnished seriously when one of its founding members, Law Cheung- kwok, raised his hand mistakenly to agree to a motion proposed by some Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last month in Beijing to urge the Chinese government to disband the three-tier councils after 1997. Since then Fung's party has been at pains to explain that it has not been opportunistic and sycophantic in its relations with China. The formation of the new party will only further embarrass the ADPL as it becomes marginalised. Relations between the ADPL and some United Democrats have been cool since 1989. Some veteran United Democrats, like Szeto Wah, view the ADPL with a mixture of contempt and jealousy for its limited communications with Beijing. Fung says he has a sense of deep respect for Szeto, claiming that his party was only following Szeto's old teaching of using the carrot-and-stick ploy to deal with China. Its differences with the United Democrats as a whole are less easily glossed over. In fact, it seems that Fung has no choice but to unite his party with the new Democratic Party, by way of a rite to cleanse itself of the Law's appalling sin. Indeed the ADPL is already knocking timidly on the door of the honeymooning newly wedded political couple by "welcoming" the merger, asking if there is still room for it to join the threesome. Other parties yet to form an alliance are Allen Lee's Liberal Party and Tsang Yok-shing's Democratic Alliance for the Betterment (DAB) of Hong Kong. They, however, make a much less well-matched couple than the United Democrats and Meeting Point. Their only common ground is that neither wants to upset Beijing and the electorate at the same time. Some Liberals see the idea of uniting with the DAB, being the party with a clear pro-Chinese birthmark, as a suicidal move that will kiss goodbye to Liberals' chance of getting directly-elected in 1995. Xu Tzemin, a local member of China's National People's Congress, has tried to be a marriage broker, dying to see the newly-formed adulterous "anti-communist alliance" contained by a united counterpart. It is unlikely there will be another wedding party soon. It looks like an ironic retribution that Hong Kong's democrats have stolen China's secret recipe of the "united front" to form their own real united front.
