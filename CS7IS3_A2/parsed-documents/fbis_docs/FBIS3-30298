FBIS3-30298 "dreeu021__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Trade Unions Criticize Draft Budget AU2701181194 Sofia BTA in English 1655 GMT 27 Jan 94 AU2701181194 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- The Podkrepa Labour Confederation (Podkrepa) thoroughly disapproves the draft budget proposed by the government, mainly because it has provided no guarantees for the collection of revenue, Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, president of Podkrepa, said at a briefing today. The budget version submitted to parliament has been proposed by the cabinet off its own bat without even showing it to the trade unions, Dr. Trenchev said. According to him, the draft budget assigns health care, education and culture the role of beggars. The Podkrepa Coordinating Council is categorical that the state will by no means be able to do well with such a budget in 1994, Dr. Trenchev stressed. One of the demands made by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) on the government is that the budget be revised after the first half of the year, Prof. Krustyu Petkov, president of KNSB, said at yesterday's briefing of the other influential trade union amalgamation. In his opinion, the budget update is necessary because on the one hand the draft budget framework is artificial, and the government has done nothing to match projected expenditure to actual requirement on the other. Further on, there is nothing to guarantee that the collection of revenue would be most successful than last year; in addition, the projections of parties, trade unions, the government and the International Monetary Fund concerning this country's financial prospects are entirely different, the KNSB leader said. Following the budget update, income policy negotiations should be opened again. Otherwise the whole system of incomes adjustment to inflation will collapse and the KNSB will have to resort to forcing methods, the trade union functionary said. The people of the miners federations may use "unconventional methods" of protest to defend their very biological survival, Dr. Trenchev told the participants in today's briefing. Podkrepa is not inclined to accept, as a member of the National Council for Tripartite Cooperation (comprising representatives of employers, trade unions and the government), a rise in electricity prices before the government signs the general agreement with the trade unions on salaries in the state-financed sector and other social issues which has been worked on since December last year (when miners staged nation-wide strike actions), he said. Podkrepa may decide to launch new strikes, but the government is on the wane anyway and will probably fall by the end of February, the trade union leader said. If Prof. Lyuben Berov's cabinet ignores the KNSB stand on the government-proposed increase of the prices of energy sources, at its meeting on February 3 the KNSB Coordinating Council will adopt a decision for nation-wide protest actions, including civil boycott of the new prices, KNSB President Krustyu Petkov told journalists yesterday. "I don't like those threats in the least," he said, commenting on yesterday's statement by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev who said that the government would not tolerate any civil disobedience and would sue instigators. The cabinet may fall, but the KNSB will not contribute to it, being concerned over the possible consequences for the population, Prof. Petkov stressed. No political force is interested in new elections at the moment, Prof. Petkov said, commenting on Prime Minister Berov's statement of January 25 that if the budget was not passed by mid-February, early parliamentary elections would be inevitable. However, the KNSB would be compelled to agree to the holding of early elections by purely economic considerations, the KNSB leader said. A caretaker cabinet can blow up political life in the country, Dr. Trenchev observed at today's briefing. The Podkrepa leader believes that parliamentary elections are the sole democratic and reasonable way out of the present situation in the country.
