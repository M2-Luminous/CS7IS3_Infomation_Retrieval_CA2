Roger Grijalva, a JS leader from Masaya, said the decision was made because "there was an absolute void in the organization's national leadership; we were isolated." Nevertheless, doubts immediately emerged concerning the political and legitimate validity of the decision. According to JS sources who were at the session, the questions that have been raised mainly involve the absence of two departmental delegations at the session, the close margin by which the dismissals were approved and the likelihood -- which has not yet been proven -- that votes were cast by activists who are not members of the organization. Bayardo Arce, a member of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] National Directorate, was quite surprised by the National Council's decision. Arce said he suggested that the plenum stop focusing on internal matters and discuss youth problems such as "the reversal of the revolution's achievements at high schools, growing drug addiction, and the Atlantic coast elections. I am going to inform the National Directorate so that through our Secretariat an investigation can be carried out to determine if the decision was legitimate and in accordance with FSLN and JS laws and regulations," Arce said. According to Arce, "the National Council should, at any rate, have held an extraordinary National Assembly to reach a decision." The vote was sheltered by an article in the JS charter which gives the National Council the power to fire any leader. Of 86 members who were present, 45 voted in favor of the dismissals. Grijalva, however, said the vote was 59 in favor and 23 against the dismissals. Sandinist Assembly member Rafael Henriquez, who was invited to the session, questioned the propriety and validity of the mechanism used by the National Council. "I do not know for sure if the article calls for a qualified vote or if the Council has the power to fire leaders appointed by the National Assembly." According to Maria Ramirez, a member of the Sandinist Assembly who was invited to the JS National Council session, "the problem is political. At any rate a decision like this should have been made by the National Assembly that elected them. The difference of two votes indicates a lack of consensus in the decision. Problems are not resolved this way." According to Henriquez, "none of the arguments I heard constituted grounds for dismissal. The problems of the JS and its leadership are obvious and anyone who attempts to resolve them will encounter the same difficulties." Henriquez, a former leader of the JS and UNEN [National Union of Nicaraguan Students], said "there was an undeniable problem with the leadership of Astorga and Delgado, but it would be way too much to blame them for the organization's problems." According to JS sources consulted by BARRICADA, the delegations from Rivas and Esteli did not attend the session and two other departmental delegations withdrew following the vote. "The delegations from Chontales and Chinandega did not protest or explicitly express opposition during their withdrawal, but their action was clearly a form of protest," the source said. Grijalva argued that the delegations left for reasons of time. One person who attended the meeting said "this had been brewing for months; it was a maneuver involving trends. The real problem is that Astorga and Delgado had not sided with any trend; they had their own perspective." An FSLN source explained to BARRICADA that the crisis began in 1993 when the JS leadership in Managua, headed by Vladimr Soto, raised serious questions about the leadership of Astorga and Delgado and attempted to break away. "The National Directorate had to intervene and there was nothing the people in Managua could do but go back together." According to our sources, JS leaders from Managua, Masaya, and Matagalpa led the vote in favor of the dismissals. While preparations are made for the election of the organization's top leaders, the JS National Council has temporarily appointed a coordinating commission headed by Enrique Pilarte and formed by departmental secretaries Francisco Guzman and Roger Grijalva, with Gustavo Alegria as an adviser. Astorga defeated Alegria in the JS directorate elections in 1992.
