ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes the average fuel economy standard for light trucks manufactured in model years (MY) 1996&hyph;97. The issuance of the standard is required by Title V of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. The (combined) standard for all light trucks manufactured by a manufacturer is 20.7 mpg for both MY 1996 and MY 1997. The agency also refers interested parties to an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), addressing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006, published in today's Federal Register . DATES: The amendment is effective May 6, 1994. The standard applies to the 1996 and 1997 model years. Petitions for reconsideration must be submitted within 30 days of publication. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration should be submitted to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Orron Kee, Office of Market Incentives, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;0846).

Department of Energy Review I. Background In December 1975, during the aftermath of the energy crisis created by the oil embargo of 1973&hyph;74, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Congress included a provision in that Act establishing an automotive fuel economy regulatory program. That provision added a new title, title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act (the Act). Title V provides for the establishment of average fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. Section 502(b) of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy standards for each model year. Standards are required to be set at least 18 months prior to the beginning of the model year. The Act provides that the fuel economy standards are to be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In determining maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required under section 502(e) of the Act to consider four factors: technological feasibility; economic practicability; the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy. (Responsibility for the automotive fuel economy program was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976)). On October 8, 1991, NHTSA published in the Federal Register (56 FR 50694) a questionnaire concerning fuel economy standards for MYs 1995&hyph;1997. The comments received in response to the questionnaire are available in Docket No. 91&hyph;50.
