FR940622-2-00081 FR940622-2-00062 [Docket No. 50&hyph;348] Southern Nuclear Operating Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;2 issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company (the licensee) for operation of the Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, located in Houston County, Alabama. The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 3/4.2.3 to change the nuclear enthalpy rise hot channel factor (F delta H) from equal to or less than 1.65 [1 plus .3(1&hyph;P)] to equal to or less than 1.70 [1 plus .3(1&hyph;P)] where P is a fraction of rated power. The amendment would also revise the action statement to reflect guidance contained in the improved standard technical specifications. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Will the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed increase in [F delta H] for Vantage 5 fuel does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the Farley Final Safety Analysis Report. No changes in the mechanical design of the fuel are necessary for this [F delta H] increase. No new performance requirements are being imposed on the fuel or any system or component because of this change. Vantage 5 fuel contains several features that provide increased margin to core limits. The proposed increase in [F delta H] is utilization of this margin with no violation of any acceptance criteria. Subsequently, overall plant integrity is not reduced. [F delta H] is not an accident initiator. Therefore, the probability of an accident has not significantly increased. The radiological consequences of all accidents, including the fuel handling accident, remain within the previous appropriate acceptance limits as well as those included in 10CFR100. Therefore, the radiological consequences to the public resulting from any accident previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report has not significantly increased. 2. Will the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed specification change to the [F delta H] limit does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report. No new accident scenarios, failure mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced as a result of the increase in [F delta H]. Any accident using the revised analytical assumption has been evaluated or reanalyzed and it has been determined that there is no adverse effect on, or do not challenge the performance of, any safety-related system. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident, is not created.
