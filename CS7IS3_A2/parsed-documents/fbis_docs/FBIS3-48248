[Asahina] In your opinion, what are the merits and demerits of postwar bureaucracy? [Ishihara] No doubt, there are more merits than demerits. The status of government officials has become stable under the postwar public service law, thus creating the administration's stability. The cabinet system has its own merits as each ministry takes its own part in carrying out important policies with responsibility and competing with one another. However, if the competition becomes excessive, it causes jurisdictional disputes among the ministries creating various harmful effects on the bureaucracy. Working for the prime minister's office, I have had many opportunities to observe such undesirable aspects. Frankly speaking, importance tends to be placed on the profit of a particular ministry rather than on national profit. [Asahina] How do you attempt to lead them? [Ishihara] My most important duty, after all, is to persuade the ministries to avoid competing for power, to avoid jurisdictional issues, and to make them carry out policies even if the policies are not necessarily welcomed by them. I think the Structural Impediments Initiative [SII] that took place at the time of the Kaifu cabinet was a good example. Although there was serious resistance by the ministries as the tasks required by SII were all disagreeable to them, we were finally able obtain their cooperation. I make it a rule to remind a newly appointed administrative vice minister that, while he represents a particular ministry, he is also representing the country as a whole. In that sense, I highly appreciate the behavior of the vice ministers and councilors of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in dealing with the recent rice issue. I really think they, as high-ranking officials, acted in a most desirable way. [Asahina] They gave priority to national profit. Is that what you mean? [Ishihara] They are most familiar with the rice growers' present conditions. And they were in agony as they also had the best knowledge as to what was happening in Geneva where the Uruguay Round was taking place. For the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the easiest path was to stick to the standpoint of protecting the farmers. But such an attitude would have put the country into trouble. While faced with a dilemma, they gave priority to the profit of the country as a whole. It was also the administrative vice ministers who made the final decision at the time of SII. [Asahina] Do you think more than half of the administrative vice ministers obtain passing marks? [Ishihara] Well, I am not sure if the number is half, but I know there are a number of vice ministers who have made excellent choices while faced with hard situations. [Asahina] Are there many of them? [Ishihara] Yes, and I am sure because I have been working with them for six years. [Asahina] Are there certain vice ministers who take different attitudes? [Ishihara] Definitely, yes. They persist in following the standpoints of their own ministries. Though they may be praised for their efforts by their seniors and juniors within the particular ministry, they cause trouble for the country. If such a situation occurs, I try to talk directly to the administrative vice minister to give my advice. [Asahina] What is your opinion of the practice of amakudari [landing a well-paid job in a semigovernment or private corporation] among government officials? [Ishihara] I think criticism of the practice of appointing the officials to chartered corporations is reasonable, to a certain extent. I think the practice should be changed gradually, using the change of political regime as momentum. We hear the same opinion voiced within the coalition government. We also hear the view that senior positions should be open not only to senior officials, but also to people in the private sector and to staff members who have given loyal service to the corporation. It is necessary to reconsider the share held by each ministry. [Asahina] We also hear criticism of the practice of sending a number of officials from the central government to the local government to hold executive posts. [Ishihara] A person who has working experience with various self-governing bodies sometimes proves extremely useful. It is very important to have a staff member with experience of doing things in a different way. It is not desirable to either shut out central government's officials or to hold too many of them. The best idea is to maintain a mixed personnel structure. [Asahina] The number of prefectural governors who are former officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs is increasing. What would you say if asked to give advice to your juniors? [Ishihara] People who have been bred in the field of administration tend to be ignorant of the feelings of the general public. Though there are minimal differences between employees of large enterprises and government workers, workers at medium and small enterprises generally work under the uncertainty that their company might go out of business. People who run private enterprises or shops, or who work in agriculture etcetera, are in the same position and we should make every effort to listen to their opinions and take their feelings into consideration. I have the experience of working as director of the commerce and industry division of the Okayama prefectural government, and I learned very good lessons in that position by talking to the owners of medium and small enterprises. I feel, however, that although a governor can appear fresh and initiate new policies for up to three terms, he tends to fall into a rut once he enters his fourth term. [Asahina] I understand you yourself are expected to become governor of Tokyo? [Ishihara] I cannot comment on that. Please allow me not to make any comment about myself.
