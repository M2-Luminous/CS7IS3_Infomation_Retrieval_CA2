In the concluding session of the 11th Islamic Christian dialogue which was organised by the Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research in cooperation with the Vatican council on promoting relations with other faiths, Prince Hasan said such an insitute would contribute to crystallising thoughts and ideas promoting the cause of peace in the region. Conveying to the participants in the dialogue the greetings of His Majesty King Husayn, Prince Hasan stressed the need to expand the participation of youth in inter-faith dialogue and to make such meetings include the participation of all segments of society other than the elite only. He said that he believes university and college curricula should include ideas and concepts affirming the importance of inter-faith dialogue. Statements issued by the Vatican condemning the occupier and aggressor at any time and in any place had contributed to shedding light on the tragedies of many people, including the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Prince said. The Crown Prince proposed making the Mediterranean Sea linking the Arab World and Europe instead of being a sea splitting the two. "Some people are ignorant about the essence of the Islamic message and accuse it of extremism at a time when 80 per cent of the world's refugees and displaced persons are Muslims," Prince Hasan said. Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican council on promoting relations with other faiths, also addressed the gathering held at the Royal Court, saying the two-day conference signified the depth of understanding between the followers of Islam and Christianity, who represent more than half of the world's population. "We should all work for the good of humanity to create a better world and make a brighter future for all people," Cardinal Arinze said. "Providence had brought us here and facilitated the holding of this dialogue at the present time in history to work together seriously to achieve this goal through the exploitation of all available means, including the media, which as we have seen in the past, had the greatest influence in making it easier for us to achieve our goals." The cardinal voiced hope that this meeting will be an incentive for the participants to be more prepared for the next meeting which will be held in 1995 in Rome under the motto: "Religion and the Environment." The Vatican official voiced admiration of the special relationship between Muslims and Christians in Jordan and commended the Islamic-Christian joint culture which represents the accumulation of centuries-old relationships distinguished for justice and peace. The cardinal presented Prince Hasan with the Arabic translation of old scrolls as a token gift.
