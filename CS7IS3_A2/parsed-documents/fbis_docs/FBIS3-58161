"Those who wish to join have much work to do, with our assistance, to prepare themselves," he told a summit of the leaders of existing NATO members in Brussels. Mr. Major said the main challenge facing the alliance was deciding what relationships to develop with the new democracies in East Europe. Extending NATO was a process only now just beginning -- "an evolutionary and transitional process without a predetermined end result," he warned on the first day of the two-day meeting which will shape future defence strategy for the whole of Europe. The governments of Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, worried by the surge of right-wing extremism in Russia, want early NATO membership, with firm security guarantees. But even as the summit got under way, hard-line Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy warned that incorporating former Soviet bloc states into the alliance could lead to World War Three. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned that expanding NATO at present could play into the hands of his country's nationalist extremists and destroy democratic reforms. The summit will set out NATO's determination to accept new members in an "evolutionary process" and make clear that no country, including Russia, has a veto -- but will not specify criteria for membership or set a firm timetable, effectively shutting out new partners for at least four more years. Mr. Major told the summit: "It must be our objective to consolidate democracy in all of the countries to the east now embracing it, to develop a closer partnership with them and to help to enhance their security and stability." But there would be no single blueprint for future links. "These countries are not all alike and NATO's relationships with them will differ," he said. He welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative launched by U.S. President Bill Clinton, saying: "The process could clearly lead to the admission of new members. The door is open. We cannot yet define who will be able to meet the obligations of membership, or when." The Poles, Czechs and Hungarians were in the front rank, but there must not be a new dividing line in Europe which would re-create opposing blocs. "We must show that NATO is a genuine partner for democratic Russia, not an opponent. It is therefore essential for NATO to build a closer relationship with Russia which acknowledges that country's special status," Mr. Major said. NATO's success as a cornerstone of post-war European security could not be taken for granted, and maintaining a security "insurance" required a continuing commitment. Today the summit was battling with real conflict on its doorstep as well as preparing for longer term security -- Bosnia hung like a black cloud over the plaudits for NATO's past successes. Mr. Major was adamant that NATO had so far worked efficiently in the former Yugoslavia, supporting the United Nations, enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic, carrying out air operations and planning for a peace implementation operation. But he admitted that, as Bosnia struggled through another winter of war, the allies faced serious questions which the summit could not resolve.
