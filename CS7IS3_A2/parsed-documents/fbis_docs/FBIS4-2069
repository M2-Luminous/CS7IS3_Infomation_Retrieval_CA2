Official sources here said four million workers of some 20,000 enterprises and government organs, i.e. about four-fifths of the city's entire workforce, are now covered by the pension insurance. Whereas pensions were paid to retirees solely by their employers under the old retirement system, the new premiums for pension insurance are shared between the government, employers and retirees. This is believed to have saved a huge sum of pension money for those old state-owned enterprises with many retirees on the rolls. The city had about 1.66 million retirees at the end of 1992, requiring a payment of 4.27 billion yuan in pension a year. While this number of retirees already is equal to 32.5 percent of those in employment, it is predicted that the city's pension budget would have to face a sharp rise in retirees in the coming 20 to 30 years. The new system also makes pensions adjustable by the previous year's living costs index, thus reducing the risk of inflationary effects, the sources said. From April 1 last year when the new pension system began to prevail, each retiree in Shanghai got 21.5 yuan a month as a compensation for price rises, which has resulted in total pensions in 1993 increasing by 19 percent over the total for 1992. The new pension system also removes or reduces an obstacle in changing jobs, for in the old days, since the length of employment was a primary factor in deciding one's pension money, job changing often risked pension decreases. The premiums for pension insurance are now calculated at three percent of one's monthly salary in the previous year, the sources added.
