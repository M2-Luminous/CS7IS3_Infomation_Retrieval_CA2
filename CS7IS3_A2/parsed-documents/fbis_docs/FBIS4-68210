Rozhkov] [Text] A mobile system developed in the United States for receiving fuel and issuing it to subunits under field conditions which approximate combat conditions to the maximum presently is in the inventory of NATO armies. As a rule, system equipment includes the following: six Uniroyal soft rubber-fabric reservoirs with an overall capacity of 227,100 liters (37,850 liters each);[.sup]1[/] two pump units (each with a 1,330 liters/min feed rate); and two separator filters (each with 1,330 liters/min capacity). In addition, it includes a rubber-fabric pipeline 500 m long overall for connecting equipment with each other and with the reservoirs; adapters; valves; and distributing cocks. The system (see figure) permits receiving (discharging) fuel into soft reservoirs from three tanker trucks simultaneously and issuing it from the reservoirs into tanker trucks (fueling trucks), canisters, barrels, and vehicle fuel tanks over six lines, and into Sealdrum soft containers over two lines. Flow diagram of fuel receiving The set of equipment can be divided depending on the situation, setting up two systems on the terrain with a capacity of 113,500 liters each and using them for receiving and issuing different kinds of fuel. The set of equipment weighs 3.2 t and its volume in a form packed for transportation is 11.3 m[.sup]3[/] (the set is air-transportable). According to standards, it takes a team of eight persons around 4 hours to set up or take down one system. Rear subunits which deploy and operate the fuel receiving and issuing points included in fuel supply points are equipped with such systems. Thus, a company which organizationally is part of the supply and service battalion is the main subunit in the U.S. Army corps logistic support area whose personnel and equipment deploy fuel supply points. The company's structure and technical outfitting permit it to deploy up to four supply points in the corps logistic support area. The standard time for a team of 33 persons to deploy one is 8 hours, and to take one down it is 6-7 hours. In addition to the receiving and issuing point, each supply point includes a fuel storage sector (five 190,000 liter soft reservoirs), a helicopter and ground vehicle fueling point (two 1,900 liter containers), a sector for fuel storage in barrels and cans, and a sector for cleaning and washing containers. The main tasks of the supply points are to transfer oil products necessary for rear subunits of divisions and for separate supply and service companies which supply fuel to units and subunits not part of divisions, and to keep army corps fuel reserves at a given level. A division fuel supply point is established in the division logistic support area. Its basic elements are a fuel receiving and issuing point, a field pool of fuel tanker trucks, two fueling points and a laboratory. It is deployed and operated by the supply and service company, which organizationally is part of the logistic support battalion. Fuel receiving and issuing points included in corps and division supply points are outfitted with mobile systems which are deployed on the terrain, usually according to the scheme shown in the figure.
