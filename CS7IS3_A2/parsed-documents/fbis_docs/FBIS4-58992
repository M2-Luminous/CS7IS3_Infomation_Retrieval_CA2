The commerce minister stated in the Rajya Sabha when members drew the attention of the house to the reported U.S. threat of invoking Special 301 provision of its Trade Act. Replying to a question, Mr. Pranab Mukherji ruled out granting product patents with retrospective effect and said these can be considered only after the World Trade Organization agreement comes into force. He said the government intends to set up an expert group to suggest changes needed in the Indian Patents Act. He made it clear that all patents are to be granted under our own legislation and not under the provisions of the global agreement relating to Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights.
