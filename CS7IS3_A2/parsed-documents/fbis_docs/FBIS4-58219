Representatives from Norway, Denmark, and Italy are due to arrive in Israel on Thursday [5 May], and they will be stationed in Hebron by Sunday. The document was signed by Yohanan Bein, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director general, and Zuhdi al-Tarzi, a foreign policy adviser to Yasir 'Arafat. Bein, talking to No'omi Segal about the observers responsibilities: [Begin recording] [Bein] Their job is exactly defined, and that is to help promote stability and an appropriate environment conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of the Palestinians in Hebron and their economic development; and to monitor the efforts to restore safety of the Palestinians and events effecting it, and the return to normal life in the city of Hebron. [Segal] Will the observers be armed? [Bein] No, they will not be armed, although in the original agreement they may be armed with pistols for their self-defense. But it was agreed among the three participating countries -- Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- that they do not want to be armed. [Segal] What is Israel's response to that? Do security forces feel that in addition to being responsible for the security of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Hebron, they will now also have to be responsible for the observers? [Bein] Well, there is no question about it that the only ones responsible for any security aspect in the area is Israel. That is very clear, we are there and the Civil Administration and the military authorities are responsible for security. But these countries feel that those observers walking around with white uniforms and with arm bands and in cars which are clearly marked, they will be safer without pistols than with pistols. [Segal] How can their presence deter any kind of clashes between Jewish settlers and Palestinians there? Do you have any assurances that those sides will respect their presence and that they will be a factor in preventing any kind of clashes? [Bein] Well, their presence cannot prevent clashes. For that there are security forces there, and they are going to prevent it. What they are going to do is to report on any incident, and that's the only job of an observer. He reports, he doesn't interfere. Mainly the Palestinians, but we too, believe that the very presence of some observers, and clearly when they are with a white uniform, standing there with binoculars, and maybe with a camera, and writing down the details, the very presence of people like this in the area might induce tranquility.
