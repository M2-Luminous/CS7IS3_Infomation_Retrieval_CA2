Workers Party (PT) leader Lula da Silva, 48, is the favorite in the upcoming presidential elections. After meeting Alexander Watson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, in Washington on 11 May, Da Silva said: "It is very important that a country such as the United States maintain the impartial position President Bill Clinton has been postulating regarding the Brazilian elections." The Socialist presidential candidate will return to Brazil today, after a five-day visit to Washington, New York, and Boston. During the trip he met officials of the U.S. executive branch and Congress, and gave several lectures at Harvard and other universities. Da Silva told Watson that he opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba because it punishes the Cuban people. He added that he also opposes the choice of Miami -- where most anti-Castro Cubans live -- as the venue for the summit of American chiefs of state convened by Bill Clinton for 9 and 10 December. The PT leader has defended the idea that Cuban President Fidel Castro, who has not been invited, should participate in the summit.
