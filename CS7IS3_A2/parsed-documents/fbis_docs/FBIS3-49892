He also said that the Hungarian language enclave to the south of Nitra was reminiscent of Nagorno Karabakh. Whereas in 1990 7 percent of Hungarians in southern Slovakia advocated political autonomy, in September 1993 this had increased to 45 percent, and the latest polls indicate that this percentage is growing. "If the Government of the Slovak Republic acts without a concept in its ethnic policy, without talks, and irrationally, a political ghetto and a scarcely controllable situation will arise in southern Slovakia, which will ultimately evolve into an irredentist movement. The borders of this irredentist movement were mapped out in Komarno on 8 January," Frantisek Miklosko declared.
