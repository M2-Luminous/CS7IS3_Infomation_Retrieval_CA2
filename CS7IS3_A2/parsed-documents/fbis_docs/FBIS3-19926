The objective of his visit was to step up work for the realization of the Greek-Greek Cypriot joint defense doctrine through concrete measures. The timing of Arsenis' visit was important. It coincided with the final stage of the result-oriented work on the package of confidence-building measures. The international community believes that the matter has been resolved. Many people and officials are convinced that a historic and peaceful step is about to be taken in Cyprus. However, the frenzied activities planned with Arsenis in south Cyprus indicate that maintaining hope and optimism for the future is impossible. The fact that Arsenis is well-aware of the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's intentions and objectives and the frenzied activities the Greek Cypriots embarked on in the past clarify the meaning of the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's irresponsible behavior. Obviously, they wish to outline the fact that they "do not intend to participate in the search for peace." How long will the Greek Cypriots, who have joined hands with Greece, be able to maintain the ugly manifestations of their sick and crooked communal approach? When will they abandon their stubborn behavior, which may lead to tragic developments? When will the Greek Cypriots act with reason? Those questions are closely related to the agenda on Cyprus, questions that have caused a significant state of uneasiness. The Greek Cypriots have deceived the world into believing that they are trying to find a durable solution to establish peace in Cyprus. Meanwhile, they have added a new dimension to their armament campaign and offensive preparations. Obviously, they are rehearsing for their final onslaught, which will be a frenzied action on their part. How long will they continue to mock the world? The fact that has become obvious is as follows: While we mark the 30th anniversary of our resistance in Ghaziveran and Camlikoy [Kalokhorio], our sacred values, which our noble martyrs shed their blood to safeguard during our national resistance, still need to be protected with our life and blood. That is the only conclusion we have drawn from developments in the Greek-Greek Cypriot front.
