Exercising strict management over the armed forces and strengthening discipline are ancient yet realistic issues. We say these are ancient issues because all philosophers and far-sighted militarists in the past stressed that "discipline is the lifeblood of the armed forces" and explained the basic law of armed forces formation from different perceptions. We say they are realistic issues because our armed forces are in a period of peace and are experiencing the test of reform in the great tide of economic construction. The prolonged peaceful environment and colorful social phenomena are affecting the armed forces through various channels and are causing soldiers to slacken their vigilance and loosen their discipline. In recent years, the class status of personnel in the armed forces has changed a lot. Soldiers had different qualifications before they joined the armed forces and cadres and soldiers have many employment options after demobilization. All these affect their minds, concepts, and behavior. There are all sorts of frictions between an open society and the armed forces' strict disciplinary restrictions and authority. Therefore, some comrades mistakenly think that since the state has implemented many open policies, it is no longer necessary for the armed forces to exercise strict management. Guided by this idea, some units have lowered their criteria and requirements for implementing discipline, and some have even taken the wrong approach of "counteracting" the higher authorities' regulations, decrees, and rules. As a result, some units have relaxed their management and slackened their style and discipline. This situation suggests that the more peaceful the environment and the more open the policy, the more necessary it is for the armed forces to exercise strict management. This is an objective demand for the improvement of the armed forces in peacetime. In exercising strict management over the armed forces in this new situation, officers and soldiers of the entire armed forces should cultivate this clear idea: Discipline must be enforced to the letter and acting willfully is not permissible. Discipline is a behavior rule all members of the armed forces must strictly observe and is an indispensable condition for the armed forces to survive. As special armed organizations, only by observing strict discipline can the armed forces shape their personnel and complicated equipment into a strong combat collective and build individual and scattered forces into a powerful entity. The Chinese Army's Disciplinary Orders explicitly point out: "Under all circumstances, all soldiers must strictly abide by discipline, and no violations of discipline whatsoever are allowed." We may say that a basic demand on soldiers is strictly and thoroughly implementing discipline. Our armed forces must be able to stand the test of a prolonged peaceful environment and must always preserve the Red Army's tradition of being strict in discipline; at no time should they slacken their vigilance. Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed: "Strict management must be exercised over the armed forces. It is necessary to use orders and regulations to standardize the armed forces' behavior." In exercising strict management over the armed forces, it is necessary to strictly implement orders and regulations to strictly implement discipline and to strictly apply the principle of reward and punishment. Orders and regulations are the codes for exercising strict management over the armed forces and serve as the basis for implementing discipline. Whatever situations appear in armed forces management in this new period, we must unflinchingly implement orders and regulations; use orders and regulations to standardize officers' and soldiers' words and deeds, as well as units' war preparedness, training, work, and life order; and cultivate officers' and soldiers' concepts about orders and regulations, as well as their mentality of obeying orders. All commanders and soldiers in the armed forces are equal before orders and regulations. In implementing discipline, "the higher level should set a good example for the lower level to follow," and the practice of "counteracting the policies of the higher authorities" must be overcome to ensure the smooth relay of government and military orders. Strict management will yield good results and loose management will cause faults. As long as all armed forces units use orders and regulations to train officers and soldiers in strictly observing organizational discipline and following orders and prohibitions, this glorious People's Army of ours will establish stricter discipline, cultivate a fine style, and create the brilliant image of a majestic and civilized army.
