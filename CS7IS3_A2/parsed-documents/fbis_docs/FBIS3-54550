Flag-waving, slogan-chanting activists of the youth wing of India's ruling Congress (I) party took part in the demonstration, which police stopped on an avenue leading to the mission, witnesses said. The police sprayed the protesters with water cannon when they knocked down barricades. Some demonstrators were physically lifted and flung back but no one was seriously injured. The clash came after a small Youth Congress (I) delegation left for the US Embassy with police permission to present a letter of protest to the mission, located in the high-security diplomatic enclave. "Bill Clinton, down down," chanted the estimated 3,500 demonstrators who gathered on a call by Maninder Singh Bitta, a Sikh politician and Youth Congress president. "America, come to your senses," they shouted. The protest was provoked by a letter written by the US president to a group of US Congressman who sought US intervention to stop alleged human rights abuses by police battling a waning Sikh militancy in India's Punjab state. Clinton said in the letter that he wanted a "peaceful solution that protected Sikh rights" in Punjab, where "abuses still occur." The Youth Congress leader denounced "constant meddling" by Washington in the internal affairs of India, noting US utterances on alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir as well. Bitta, who last year survived an attempted assassination by Sikh militants, said the United States had tended to "totally gloss over the issue of terrorism" while voicing concern for human rights. Clinton's concern was unwarranted because "Punjab is witnessing peace and prosperity again after a decade of terrorist violence" and the Indian constitution protects the rights of all religious minorities, he said. Sikh separatist lobbies are active in the United States, campaigning for Congressional support for their cause and helping fund the Punjab militants. Separatist violence in the rich farming state has fallen dramatically over the past year, with hundreds of militants killed or captured.
