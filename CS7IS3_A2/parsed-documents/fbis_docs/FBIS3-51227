The demonstration, set to begin at 1000 GMT, was delayed a half hour because of the amount of people joining the procession which began under a cold drizzle from the Place de la Republique to the Place de la Nation. It was expected to last until the end of the afternoon. Hundreds of buses had arrived in the capital overnight Saturday carrying teachers from the provinces and the state railway system had also scheduled dozens of special trains. [passage omitted] Several union and political leaders headed the procession Sunday including Socialist leader Michel Rocard and Communist leader Georges Marchais. Union officials said they wanted some "serious negotiations" with the government and that they would ask Balladur to pass a law setting up a special budget for education. The demonstrators carried banners that read "Republic, public schools," and shouted the same slogan. Several placards demanded the resignation of the minister of education, Francois Bayrou, who had pushed for the private schools financing law and has since come under strong criticism. Union leader Marc Blondel said Bayrou was obviously a partisan of private schools. "No one has the right to say that we provoked this, it's not true," Blondel said. "It's Bayrou who provoked it." Several opposition members also did not hide the fact that they would use the issue to try and mobilise support for their cause especially after the crushing defeat suffered by the socialists during last year's legislative elections.
