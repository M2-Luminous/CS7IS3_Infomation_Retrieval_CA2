Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-30MAR94-JAPAN Shipbuilders Seek Coexistence With ROK Counterparts Confronted by a significant expansion of South Korean shipbuilding capacity, Japanese shipbuilders are reportedly opting to coexist, rather than compete, with South Korean shipbuilders through technological cooperation and division of labor. According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japanese shipbuilders are seeking to expand cooperative relationships with the South Korean shipbuilding industry, which surpassed Japan in 1993 in the tonnage of shipbuilding orders received. The Japanese firms' current overtures--coming on the heels of a recent deal between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries--reportedly mark a ''major change" in the business strategy of Japanese shipbuilding companies. In the past they had sought to dissuade South Korean shipbuilders from increasing production capacity in order to avoid a worldwide plunge in ship prices. Now, with capital investment by South Korean shipbuilders having increased to a level that even Japanese shipbuilders cannot match, Japanese companies have reportedly decided to adopt a new strategy to cooperate and share work, rather than compete with their South Korean counterparts. According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the strategy of the leading Japanese shipbuilding firms is now focused on forming an international shipbuilding consortium. To this end, the paper reported, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) has asked Samsung to join a group composed of IHI, Sumitomo Heavy Industries and an Italian shipbuilder to participate in the bid for a fifth Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tanker for the Korean Gas Corporation. The paper also reported that IHI hopes Samsung's participation will increase the group's heretofore low chance of winning the bid. In return, IHI has offered Samsung technological assistance in building LNG tankers, it added. (AUTHOR: INNES.
