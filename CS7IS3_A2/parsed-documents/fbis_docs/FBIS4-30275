Speaking to reporters upon arriving at Don Muang Airport from a visit to South Korea, Chuan said leaders of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations) countries will convene a meeting next month and will discuss the issue. Chuan he said the tension would ease now that South and North Koreas had agreed in principle to conduct a meeting over the issue. The United States has accused North Korea of using its nuclear programme to produce weapons, a charge Pyongyang has denied. A growing international crisis over the nuclear programme eased after North Korea promised to halt the programme in return for a resumption of high-level talks with the United States. On Friday, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said a meeting between President Clinton and North Korean leader Kim ll-song was possible if North Korea's behaviour merits it.
