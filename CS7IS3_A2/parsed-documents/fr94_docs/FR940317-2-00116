SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The IFLNN program is authorized by the Freedom Support Act of 1992 and funded under the Foreign Appropriations Bill of 1994. Pursuant to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs' authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Overview The American Institute at the IFLNN will expand the pool of Russians qualified in English and familiar with Western business practices, finance, management, commercial transactions, and the American political and economic system as an environment for business. This program will provide up to $500,000 to support an institutional linkage with the IFLNN for three (3) years; start date for the program should be September, 1994, with faculty in place in Nizhniy Novgorod not later than October 1, 1994. The U.S. partner institution will assist with the development of faculty and curriculum in the fields of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), business, and American studies. Program activities will include faculty and post-graduate student exchanges (post-graduates must be on a ``faculty track,'' involved with teaching at participating institutions), and some outreach to the U.S./Russian business communities to involve them in developing appropriate business curricula. The U.S. partner must dedicate significant staff and faculty time to the project. The program will be implemented primarily through a grant to an accredited four-year U.S. post-secondary institution or consortium of accredited institutions and scholarly/professional associations. Nizhniy Novgorod has been the setting for key economic and democratic reform in Russia. U.S. presence in the area is growing, including Peace Corps volunteers, U.S. business interests, and visiting USG officials. The focus of the U.S. effort has been to build a ``critical mass'' for reform among regional and local government officials, business leaders and educators. One element of this critical mass includes English language training for Russians which can be used in their professional fields. To this end, the IFLNN program will help train a pool of language-qualified professionals, enabling them to take advantage of expanded opportunities for technical assistance, bilateral exchanges, other government and private sector training programs, and commercial relations. Program Objectives The IFLNN program has three principal objectives: (1) To focus additional resources in support of democratic and market reform in Nizhniy Novgorod. English language teaching and American studies will be used as vehicles to teach business English and American business practices, and American forms of government. (2) To establish a training center for faculty from other institutes of higher education. IFLNN's program will ``train the trainers,'' emphasizing curriculum development, teacher training, and educational testing.
