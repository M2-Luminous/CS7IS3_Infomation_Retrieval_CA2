In an interview in WELT AM SONNTAG, Germany's most senior military officer says "cuts are now being made that will lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to achieve the degree of operational readiness that its mandate demands." It is true that the Defense Ministry is still in the middle of the assessment process, but, the general says, its initial assessment has been "that we will no longer be able to achieve today's level of operational readiness in 1994/95 in many sections of the Army." Units will experience staffing shortfalls.
