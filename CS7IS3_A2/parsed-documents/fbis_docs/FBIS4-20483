The institute also established purification facilities that have 46 percent recovery rate and have capability of fermenting 10 liters of genetically-engineered bacteria. The purity of gamma-interferon produced by the plant reaches WHO standard. The transformation of its genetically-engineered bacteria into a clinically-useful drug by the institute has led China to a new approach to industrialize its biotechnology products.
