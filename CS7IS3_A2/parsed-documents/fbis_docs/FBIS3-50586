This was the first time Gaviria has commented on the arrival of the U.S. Engineers Battalion on 27 December and 2 January. According to the government, the U.S. soldiers will build a school, a clinic, and a road in an area on the Colombian Pacific coast. Since the U.S. Embassy announced the soldiers' arrival at the beginning of December in Santa Fe de Bogota, the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia has caused a big uproar in the country. Referring to the presence of the U.S. soldiers in the Colombian Pacific area, President Gaviria said: "It is absolutely clear to the government that the soldiers' arrival has an explicit civic objective." The Colombian president made those statements to a group of journalists in the town of San Basilio de Palenque, near Cartagena de Indians, on the country's northern Caribbean coast. Gaviria added that the government has no reservations or problem with any type of "citizen control" observing that the "Marines'" work is totally "humanitarian." "While their presence is of a humanitarian nature, I do not understand why it would cause concern," the Colombian president said, after denying any possibility that the soldiers are attempting to build a military base in national territory. "Such a project cannot be carried out behind the people's backs," the Colombian head of state said. The U.S. Embassy has reported that the U.S. military engineers would participate in an exercise program with the Colombian Armed Forces in an area of the Pacific Ocean, in the southwestern Department of Valle del Cauca. According to diplomatic representation, the program is called "Strong Roads Colombia 94," and the "Marines," who belong to the U.S. Southern Command stationed in Panama, will remain in the country until the end of February.
