[passage omitted] In a statement today, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert called on all political and social organizations to mobilize overseas in order to exert pressure on the Albanian Government to free the six Greek Albanians, who are being held unjustifiably and illegally. The Greek Government should deal with the indictment of these Greek Albanians in a strong manner through diplomatic avenues, Evert stressed. The opposition leader also stressed that the Foreign Ministry should mobilize all Greek ambassadors and international organizations to this effect. In conclusion, Evert underlined that next week New Democracy deputies will go to international organizations related to human rights to brief them and inform international public opinion.
