Speaking at the funeral service of his former co-accused and fellow Robben Island prisoner Elias Motsoaledi in Soweto, Mr Mandela said delivering on the ANC election promises was the best tribute to the victims of apartheid and its stalwarts. The RDP programme came under criticism this week, with experts predicting it would cost between 80 and 90 billion rand, more than twice the initial ANC costing of 39 billion rand over five years. He said the ANC-led government of national unity was constituted by people from different backgrounds, with genuine and well-meaning white colleagues not used to huge expenditures to meet the needs of African people. Defending the RDP, Mr Mandela said the ANC leadership came from a background of squalor and misery and understood the deprivation of black South Africans better than their white colleagues who had had a wealthy and comfortable upbringing. "Delivery on the RDP should not threaten the property of minorities and their living standards, but have to meet the expectations of people within a reasonable space of time. "There are minorities in this country who believe the implementation of this programme will lead to falling living standards." But he added that a balance had to be maintained between uplifting the black majority and not destroying the wealth the country already had. While there was broad agreement, the ANC leadership would have to take the initiative for delivering quality education, electricity and water in urban and rural areas, he added. Mr Mandela took off time from his tight schedule to share his experiences with Mr Motsoaledi during their long spell of imprisonment on Robben Island. Paying tribute to a comrade and their long friendship, he said Mr Motsoaledi had helped ordinary people regain their pride and dignity and had inspired hope. "We are honouring a man who helped to end South Africa's isolation." "Motsoaledi was a non-conformist. He did not agree with ideas unless he considered them carefully. "He was a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (the ANC's armed wing) and was crucial in recruiting and sending young people out the country for military training." He said Mr Motsoaledi's experiences should inspire young people to know that an ordinary person without education could pull himself up by his bootstraps to assume the stature of a national figure. Among those gathered at the stadium to pay their last respects were former prison mates Pan Africanist Congress President Clarence Makwetu, ANC stalwart Walter Sisulu, First Deputy Preisdent Thabo Mbeki and human rights lawyer George Bizos.
