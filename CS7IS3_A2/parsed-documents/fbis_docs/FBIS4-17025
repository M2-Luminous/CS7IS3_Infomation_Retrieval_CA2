A recent sitting of Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium proposed to hold repeat elections to the Ukrainian Parliament at the same time as the second round of local elections, that is, on 10 July. However, the Central Electoral Commission has calculated that this period would not be long enough for all the stages of election envisaged by the electoral law: Nomination and registration of candidates, election campaign, etc., of which it has informed Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium in writing.
