The purposes of the (enlarged) plenary session are to implement the spirit of decisions adopted at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the 14th CPC Congress' guidelines; to put forward tasks and ideas for the region to accelerate the reform and development and to safeguard the unity and stability in line with the target of establishing the systems of socialist market economy; and to mobilize all Communist Party members as well as the cadres and people of various nationalities across the region to unite as one, to wage arduous struggles, and to concentrate their thinking and energy on accelerating the reform and development so that they can greet the new and crucial year and create a new situation with the mental attitude of emancipating minds and daring to pioneer and to try to promote the sustained, accelerated, and healthy development of the region's economy. During the plenary session Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, delivered a report entitled "Reinforce the Strength in Reforms, Accelerate the Economic Development, Vigorously Create a New Situation for Establishing the Systems of Socialist Market Economy." Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional people's government, presided over yesterday's plenary session, which was also attended by Qian Fenyong and Bai Enpei, deputy secretaries of the autonomous regional party committee; as well as Geroletu, Yang Enbo, and Wuyunqimuge, members of the autonomous regional party standing committee. Comrade Wang Qun's report includes the following five parts: 1) The brief summation of 1993 work; 2) Efforts should be made to apply the spirit of "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and to enhance the people's morale in line with the grand target of "being the advanced"; 3) Efforts should be made to promote the sustained, accelerated, and healthy development of the national economy and to ensure the fulfillment of the two periodical targets within the given date; 4) Efforts should be made to promote reform in an overall way, to make breakthroughs in key fields, and to accelerate the pace of establishing the socialist market economy system; 5) Efforts should be further made to enhance or improve the party's leadership and to unswervingly implement the principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them." Wang Qun said: Over the past year the concept of socialist market economy has been accepted by an increasingly large number of people. In particular, leadership at all levels has greatly upgraded their understanding on the socialist market economy. Reforms conducted in line with the target of establishing the systems of socialist market economy have achieved new progress. The economic structure has been further improved under the guide of markets and of macro readjustment and control. Both urban and rural productive forces have been emancipated or achieved development in the course of reform and opening up. Their specific manifestations are as follows: The reform in rural and pastoral areas has achieved new progress and a bumper harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry has been obtained in the disaster-plagued year. The industrial and commercial enterprises have steadily deepened their reform and their economic results have somewhat increased. The activities of introducing foreign advanced technologies and setting up technical and economic associations with domestic localities have taken a new step. The pace in building the basic industries of energy resources, communications, telecommunication, and raw materials, as well as in building infrastructures has been quickened. Township enterprises have fostered a trend of doubling their output value and privately owned enterprises have achieved faster development. The principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them" have been further implemented, new achievements in party building and in the construction of spiritual civilization have been scored, and the political situation of unity and stability has been further consolidated. Wang Qun said: While fully acknowledging the achievements and the main stream in the current situation, we must also analyze by seeking truth from facts the difficulties and problems cropping up along our advancing road. We should also note that along with gradually deepening the reform and developing the undertakings of modernization, it is possible for us to gradually deal with these problems and difficulties. In his report Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should apply the spirit of the "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and enhance the people's morale in line with the grand target of "being the advanced." He said: The decisions adopted at the third plenum represent an important policy decision, a grand blueprint of turning the old economic system into a new one, and a guiding principle of leading the entire party and the people of various nationalities throughout the country to accelerate the reform and development in a timely manner. By regarding the implementation of these decisions as a sign, we can be sure that our country's programs of conducting reform among the economic systems and of carrying out economic construction have entered a new development period. At present, a good job should be done in emphatically dealing with the following problems: 1) Efforts should be made to adopt a correct attitude toward the region's strong points under the conditions of socialist market economy and to enhance the confidence in quickening development; 2) Efforts should be made to smash the fetter of old thinking and concepts developed under the system of the planned economy and to foster the new thinking and concepts of socialist market economy; 3) Efforts should be made to firmly foster or to always uphold the criterion of "three advantages" and to apply this criterion to analyzing the new situation, new problems, and new things cropping up in the course of establishing new systems as well as to measuring the failure or success cropping up in reforms. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to correctly deal with the relations among reform, development, and stability and successfully deal with the relation between the whole interest and the partial one, as well as the relation between the immediate difficulty and the distant view of development. He said: In 1987 Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out in his speech: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is endowed with vast grassland and has a small population. It is possible for the region to be advanced in development in the future. This judgment represents his ardent hope for the region and his scientific foresight and the people of various nationalities throughout the region should regard his judgment as a spiritual motive force. The grand target of "being the advanced" shows the region's glorious prospects in economic and social development and conforms with the fundamental interest and common desire of the people of various nationalities throughout the region. By judging from the development of both domestic and foreign situations, from the tendency of the state macroeconomic policies, and from the region's existing foundation and development potential, it is possible for us to realize the grand target through a longer period of arduous struggles. We should regard the grand target as a banner and guide the people of various nationalities throughout the region to have lofty ambitions and to make unswerving efforts to realize the target. In his report Wang Qun said: In order to realize the grand target, it is imperative to fulfill in a timely manner the two periodical targets put forward at the sixth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth autonomous regional party committee; to become better-off by the end of this century; and to reach the level that is little higher than the national intermediate level in this regard. This is the second year in fulfilling the first periodical target and a failure or success in economic development has a vital bearing on whether we can realize the first periodical target on schedule. Therefore, we should adopt every possible way and means to successfully conduct the economic work in 1994 and to achieve faster progress in economic development. In line with the current situation in the region's economic development, the region's gross national product may show a 10 percent increase in 1994 and we should strive to show a 12 percent increase. In order to realize the increasing speed, it is imperative to work out a new way with economic results as a center for developing the economy. A good job should be done in emphatically grasping the following tasks: 1) Efforts should be made to actively consolidate the structure of agriculture and animal husbandry and to further accelerate the economic development in rural and pastoral areas; 2) A good job should be done in emphatically encouraging enterprises to show an increase in both speed and economic results and to take up the work of switching losses to profits to improve industrial production across the region to a new level; 3) A good job should be done in continuously establishing pillar industries and in building key projects to add actual and reserve strength to the region's economic development; 4) Efforts should be made to vigorously develop township enterprises and to enhance the actual strength of the banner-county economy; 5) Efforts should be made to let the society continuously have a free hand in developing publicly owned enterprises. Wang Qun said: A fundamental way to accelerate the economic development in the region lies in seizing the opportunity of reforms, reinforcing the strength in reforms, and quickening the pace in establishing the systems of the socialist market economy. Proceeding from the region's reality, a good job should be done in realistically grasping the following reforms: 1) Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in enterprise reform by regarding as an orientation the establishment of modern enterprise systems and regarding the task of straightening out the relations among property rights as a breakthrough; 2) Efforts should be made to further deepen the reform in rural and pastoral areas by emphasizing the task of establishing or improving the socialized service systems of agriculture and animal husbandry; 3) Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace of fostering and perfecting the market systems by emphasizing the task of establishing the markets of essential factors for production; 4) Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace of conducting reform among organs by emphasizing the task of shifting the governmental function; 5) Efforts should be made to ensure the implementation of measures for conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control by emphasizing the task of conducting reform among the systems of finance and tax, banking, investment, and planning; 6) Efforts should be made to accelerate the reform among the systems of public security by regarding as a breakthrough the method of the society making overall arrangements for severance pay; 7) Efforts should be made to further deepen the reform among the systems of science, technology, and education to meet the needs of reform, opening up, and economic construction; 8) Efforts should be made to open the region in an overall way to localities both at home and abroad by regarding as a breakthrough the task of vigorously bringing in foreign advanced technologies and vigorously setting up economic and technical associations with domestic localities. Wang Qun pointed out: In order to win a victory in directing these unprecedented and pioneering undertakings, we must realistically enhance the party's self improvement and provide a strong and effective political guarantee for reform, opening up, and modernization. We must unswervingly and persistently carry forward the strategic principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them" and create a good social environment for accelerating the reform, opening up, and economic construction. Wang Qun urged that in enhancing the party building, it is most important for us to apply the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Efforts should be made to enable the leading body to become a strong and effective core of political leadership, which is leading the masses to establish the new systems of socialist market economy. A good job should be done in realistically building socialist spiritual civilization by regarding as a target the task of training new successors in conformity with the "four requirements" and by following the principle of regarding construction as an important point and regarding upholding as a precious point. Efforts should be made to successfully conduct the party's united front work in the new historic period, to enhance the work involved in nationalities' affairs and religious affairs, and to bring all contributing factors into play. By earnestly implementing the central arrangements, efforts should be made to steadily deepen the struggle against corruption.
