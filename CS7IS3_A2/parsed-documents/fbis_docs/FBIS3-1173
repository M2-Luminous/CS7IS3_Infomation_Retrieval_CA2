Anglo American and De Beers have for years been regarded as the DP's most important business backers. Mr O'Dowd is chairman of the Anglo and De Beers Chairman's Fund, while Mr Sunter is the head of Anglo's Scenario Planning Department. DP leader Zach de Beer said he would not comment on whether or not Anglo and De Beers continued to back his party. "That is for them to say," he added. And DP Transvaal leader Tony Leon dismissed the Federal Party, saying it would have as much effect as "a sneeze in a thunderstorm". Mr Sunter, whose "high road, low road" scenario sketch largely coincided with the views of the DP and its predecessor, the Progressive Federal Party, said he was in favour of the FP's policy of decentralisation of power. "I haven't seen the (FP's) manifesto, but I'm betting on the lady. Frances is an outstanding person with a lot of spunk," he said. In a statement released through the FP, Mr O'Dowd said: "I firmly support the constitutional proposals of the new FP. They are not wildly idealistic, as their critics will claim, but are based on the long experience of some very successful countries. Although the FP is obviously not going to form a government, I believe it is well worth voting for." Miss Kendal said this week her party was aiming for five percent of the April vote.
