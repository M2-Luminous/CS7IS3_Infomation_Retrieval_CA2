The management of the plant denies that this shipment ever took place. The Central Engineering Board has given assurances that it had never granted permission for any shipment to Iraq. [Reporter] British journalists say they received information about the Polish shipment of arms to Iraq from very reliable sources which they cannot disclose. [Chris Mitchell, Channel 4 journalist, in English with superimposed Polish translation] "We got the information at the beginning of the year. We were told that 16 gray, unmarked containers would leave the Lucznik plant in Radom. We were told that they depart for the Black Sea coast, to Varna, and we were told they would be shipped onto Akaba via Cyprus." [Reporter] Journalists saw only eight containers leaving the plant but they think some could have been sent earlier. They have not seen their contents but they think the very fact that sewing machines are being sent to the Middle East in unmarked containers confirms their suspicions. [Mitchell] "But what was very striking was that the information we had received corresponded to what we saw later and to what Mr. Szwonder told us." [Reporter] The former Lucznik manager and presently the Democratic Left Alliance senator has told GAZETA WYBORCZA daily that he only spoke to British journalists about legal exports of arms to Yemen. The current management of the plant also denies the British journalists' accusations. [Bronislaw Kilian, Lucznik manager] "This event which is supposedly described by the British television program has not taken place. It is some kind of mistake and in my opinion yet another provocation." [Reporter] "Provocation by whom?" [Kilian] "Well, certainly not by our side." [Reporter] "By whom do you think?" [Kilian] "Well, it is in someone's interest." [Reporter] Polish authorities which supervise the arms trade think the story told by the British journalists is not specific enough. [passage omitted] The British journalists' program will most probably be screened on Channel 4 tomorrow.
