"They can solve problems not only locally but on a wider scale too," he said in an interview with INTERFAX on Monday, after a traditional Victory Day ceremony of laying wreaths at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He said several new military districts and defense areas had been formed. One of them is the Kaliningrad Defense Area, where the Baltic Fleet commander is in charge of all locally stationed naval, land and air forces, which thus form a single powerful military unit, he said. The North Caucasus Military District is also ready for combat, and, "by dividing the Volga-Ural Military District into two separate districts, we made forces deployed in that region more mobile," Grachev continued. "Apart from that, for the same purpose in many districts we replaced armies by brigades or corps. At the moment, the creation of mobile forces and the replacement of air defense forces with air and space defense forces is nearly over." But forces structure in Russia's Far East has remained unchanged, the minister said. "After a close analysis of all life and service conditions of the armed forces in that region we came to the conclusion that we won't change anything. We'll most likely be able to take the final decision only after some exercises in the Far Eastern region. Then it'll be clear what system of armed forces we need in the Far East of Russia," he said.
