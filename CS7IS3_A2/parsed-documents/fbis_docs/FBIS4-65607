Ritzau news agency said he complained about "excuses and reservations" among the UN Protection Force command in Bosnia which had occurred many times in recent months. "It is not for the fun of it that the Danish commanding officer on the ground asks for NATO planes to intervene," Haekkerup said. "He is within his rights to have that backing when the life of his soldiers is in danger." The minister announced the protest after the head of parliament's foreign affairs committee Peter Duetoft called for such a move to protest lack of protection for the UN force's Nordic contingents.
