FBIS4-13250 "drnes075_m_94014" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 JORDAN Lebanese Parliament Speaker, Team Pay Visit Lebanese Parliament Speaker, Team Pay Visit Prime Minister, Officials Meet Birri JN1704144094 Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic 1100 GMT 17 Apr 94 JN1704144094 Amman Radio Jordan Network Arabic BFN [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received at his office at the Parliament today Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, and the delegation accompanying him. At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-Majali asserted that this country's approach has always been Arab and Islamic. Jordan's eagerness to promote Arab causes is equal to its eagerness to promote its own interests, al-Majali added. He went on to say: We view Lebanon as a fraternal Arab state. We support its causes and issues, especially given the calamities and attacks to which southern Lebanon has been exposed. We hope that Lebanon will recover and remain a strong country, a strong foundation contributing to the Arab nation's strength. Dr. al-Majali also addressed the issue of peace, and Jordan's position toward peace efforts, as explained by His Majesty King Husayn. He reasserted that the solution must be just and comprehensive on all fronts. He added that any solution must ensure the restoration of all Arab rights. He went on to say that Jordan has pursued contacts and coordination with all concerned Arab parties, including the PLO, which is the representative of the Palestinian people, to help form a unified Arab stand that will help to achieve peace on the basis of justice and equality, a peace that will be accepted by future generations. Dr. al-Majali underscored the need to close Arab ranks and unify Arab positions, since this would promote the Arab nation's standing and enable it to cope with its own problems and issues. He added that Jordan views all Arab brothers as a part of this nation. Besides, Jordan has been directly and effectively involved in problems. The most recent evidence of this is Jordan's accommodation of some 300,000 refugees in the aftermath of the Gulf war. He indicated that this, given Jordan's capabilities and resources, constitutes a heavy burden. Nonetheless, Jordan believes that their presence here is the outcome of difficult circumstances created by the Gulf war. For his part, Nabih Birri underlined Jordan's honorable positions under His Majesty King Husayn toward all Arab and pan-Arab causes. He also underscored Jordan's support for Lebanon in the years of its ordeal and Jordan's help in coping with this ordeal. He added: Our prime concern in Lebanon is to achieve security and stability, which we are beginning to see. The Lebanese Government has drafted a plan to rebuild the infrastructure damaged during the internal strife. Moreover, there is a focus on rebuilding southern Lebanon, which has continued to come under constant Israeli attacks. The meeting was attended by Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives; Dr. Khalid al-Zu'bi, minister of state for legal and parliamentary affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in Beirut; and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman. Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi met with the speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies and his delegation at the Parliament earlier in the day. House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri attended. At the outset of the meeting, al-Lawzi noted that Lebanon has always provided a haven for the nation's thinkers. He noted the commonalities in the two countries, particularly in terms of their history and their efforts to establish true inter-Arab cooperation to promote inter-Arab integration in all spheres. He reaffirmed the importance of the role the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies can play to safeguard Lebanon and its unity to help it return to the forefront. He also called for honoring international legitimacy and implementing the UN resolutions pertaining to southern Lebanon, asserting Jordan's strong faith in true peace, peace that will restore rights to their rightful owners. He added that there is no alternative to a just and comprehensive peace that will end massacres and occupation. He noted that it is Israel which is sponsoring terrorism, and that it was Israel which occupied Arab lands and perpetrated killings, displacement, and settlement activities throughout the occupied Arab territories. He called for an end to these practices so that peace can be achieved in the region. For his part, Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, expressed his thanks and appreciation to His Majesty King Husayn, the Jordanian Government, and the Jordanian people. He underlined the strong Jordanian-Lebanese relations in all spheres. Nabih Birri added: Jordan does not need to absolve itself of any alleged terrorism, particularly since everybody is well aware of His Majesty King Husayn's moderation, patience, shrewdness, wisdom, and intelligence. Everybody is well aware that Jordan has paid a high price for terrorism. He wondered: Is the person who acts in defense of his territories, homeland, and rights an extremist terrorist? By contrast, can the party that occupied another's territory by force, and displaces its population and owners be called a non-terrorist? Birri continued: It is no coincidence that Israel is perpetrating terrorism in southern Lebanon and accusing Jordan of terror. He recalled the killing of innocent civilians at the Ibrahimi Mosque, wondering: What can this be called? Was it a premeditated act, planned a long time ago? What is the daily shelling of Lebanese cities and the displacement of their residents called? Birri asserted that we are engaged in acts of self-defense, whereas the Israelis have fostered terrorism. He indicated that without a just and comprehensive peace in the region, the phenomenon they call terrorism will spread. He wondered: How can you blame me when you push me too far? Birri urged the Arab nation to unify its ranks. He indicated that the current Arab state of affairs is the result of its weakness and disunity. He reiterated that the pressure put on Jordan and the threats made against its stability and security are designed to make it conclude a unilateral deal so that it may be dissociated from Lebanon and Syria. The same goes for Lebanon and the attempts to make it sign a unilateral deal with the Zionist entity. He reaffirmed the seriousness of concluding such unilateral deals, because this would undermine the inalienable legitimate rights of the parties concerned. At the end of the meeting, which was attended by members of the Lebanese and Jordanian delegations, the two sides held a lengthy discussion on the current Arab state of affairs, issues of common interest between the two fraternal states, and mutual coordination. They said that the pressure applied to Jordan does not frighten us, particularly since similar pressure has been applied in the past. The Jordanian and Lebanese sides reaffirmed the importance of national unity, indicating that it is the most effective means of resistance. During the meeting, the two sides discussed the issue of forming a Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary committee that could be expanded in the future to include other nations. The purpose of this committee would be to examine the potential of current developments.
