FR940728-0-00020 FR940728-0-00007 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: AD 94&hyph;13&hyph;03 The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;8943. Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;25&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, ␣F&hyph;28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, equipped with tail rotor spindle (spindle), part number (P/N) 28&hyph;150064&hyph;11 or 28&hyph;150064&hyph;13, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the spindle, loss of directional control and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Before further flight, visually inspect the spindle for cracks using a 5-power or higher magnifying glass in accordance with paragraph 5.2 of The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. (b) Before further flight, whenever tail rotor (T/R) vibrations occur that cannot be corrected with track and balance procedures or track and balance procedures are required more than once within a 5 hours' TIS period, inspect the spindle teetering bearing bores for cracks using a dye penetrant method in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. (c) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD) and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS from the last inspection, without removing the tail rotor from the helicopter, inspect the spindle teetering bearing bores for cracks using a dye penetrant inspection and visually inspect for scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. (d) If neither a crack nor any scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities are found that exceed the tolerances specified in paragraph 5.3.4 and 5.3.5 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, during the inspections required by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this AD, return the helicopter to service in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph 5.3.5 of the SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, and the applicable maintenance manual. (e) If a crack is found, or scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities are found that exceed the tolerances specified in paragraph 5.3.4 and 5.3.5 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, remove the spindle before further flight and install an airworthy spindle in accordance with the provisions of the appropriate maintenance manual. (f) Within the next 100 hours' TIS or, on or before reaching 1,200 hours' TIS, whichever occurs later, remove spindle, P/N 28&hyph;150064&hyph;11 or 28&hyph;150064&hyph;13, from service and replace it with an airworthy spindle in accordance with the appropriate maintenance manual. (g) Installation of a spindle, P/N 28&hyph;150074&hyph;11, constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. (i) Except for the inspection required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD, special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the other requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (j) The inspections shall be done in accordance with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin No. 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies may be obtained from The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation, Twin County Airport, P.O. Box 490, Menominee, Michigan 49858. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (k) This amendment becomes effective on August 12, 1994. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on June 14, 1994. Eric Bries, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
