Let me first draw your attention to the fact that we have agreed with the parliamentary groups that we will have a detailed debate on the objectives of Germany's European Union [EU] presidency here on 29 June. This means that my government statement today will not concentrate on that topic. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in just over two weeks, on 12 June, voters in the 12 EU member states will elect the new European Parliament, which will then be in office from 1994 to 1999. These will be years full of dramatic changes, years that will bring decisive steps forward for the EU. This year's European Parliament election is of special importance, because the European Parliament has been given numerous new rights and additional powers under the Maastricht Treaty. In my report following the Maastricht negotiations I pointed out that we, the Federal Government, would have liked to extend the rights and strengthened the powers of the European Parliament even further. But during the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty our position did not win a majority. I would, however, like to point out that we continue to aim at an expansion of the European Parliament's powers, particularly in view of the 1996 conference. [applause] I am confident, together with you, that Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will very soon join the EU as new members, after the necessary referenda have been held in these countries. And they will then also be represented in the European Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity, also in view of the enlargement negotiations, to thank the foreign minister very much for his enormous efforts during these talks. [applause] There have been one or two critical voices abroad, saying that the Germans were trying too intensely to achieve the admission of these countries. I think it is in line with our common policy that we wanted enlargement, and it is right that the foreign minister also made exceptional efforts on behalf of the Federal Government and myself. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.... I do not know, you can applaud here, the enlargement is also in your interest.... I do not think that party politics can go so far as to obscure everything that is sensible here. [applause] I think you have a lot to catch up with regarding applause for colleague Kinkel. You can make up for that today. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; several days ago, on 8 May, we remembered the end of World War II 49 years ago. At that time, Europe was in ruins, and the situation of the people in Germany was desperate. For many, it seemed to be hopeless. Those who experienced that time know how much we have achieved since then in Germany. Seen this way, the progress we have made on the road to European unity is a great success. The vision of the best people in Europe is about to materialize. One cannot stress clearly enough that the consistent continuation of this policy of European integration is of crucial importance. [applause] There is no responsible alternative to the policy of European integration. This insight has decisively marked the policy of all federal governments under Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Willy Brandt, and Helmut Schmidt. The goal of firmly anchoring Germany in the process of European unification has determined the actions of all democratic parties in Germany since the war, and I am quite sure that this will remain so. [applause] Anchoring the Federal Republic of Germany in the European Community was the decisive basis for the restoration of German unity in peace and freedom with the consent of all our neighbors. Without this policy in the decades preceding 1989-90, our European neighbors would never have agreed to German unity. [applause] In 1950 Konrad Adenauer said that a reunited Germany would not have lasting peace, if it were not firmly anchored in a united Europe. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; peace and freedom are not a foregone conclusion, and we have seen that they must be ensured anew every day. European unity is the most effective insurance against the reemergence of nationalism, chauvinism, and racism, including in our part of the continent. Seen this way, the success of the process of European integration is in the final analysis a matter of war and peace. It is the decisive prerequisite for peace and freedom also of the Germans in the 21st century. We have all seen the terrible pictures from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. In this conflict in the former Yugoslavia, we have seen that the limits of possible options regarding the prevention and solution of crises have been brutally revealed. For two years now, we have seen these pictures every day. To a high degree, the credibility of European democracies is at stake, and in many countries, including Germany, efforts to end the conflict will not be considered sufficient. I can only say that, if what we have started in Maastricht -- which is not nearly completed -- had been possible much earlier, we would have had much better opportunities to meet European responsibility in this respect, too. In view of these terrible pictures in the region, many people, including in Germany, are asking themselves why the European Union and NATO are not doing much more to end the conflict. I think we all understand these questions. However, we should remember how much this civil war is marked by hatred and irrationality -- hatred that has partly developed over the centuries. We must stress here that the international community must again and again make every effort, even in almost hopeless situations, to bring about a comprehensive peace solution. Such efforts have been increased in recent weeks and months. There are no ready formulas for solving this conflict, but I think there are the beginnings of better hopes that a solution can be brought about. However, ladies and gentlemen, we Germans should be particularly careful regarding advice to others. We do not have the moral right to demand that responsible politicians in other countries should do more than we ourselves can do and are ready to do. [applause] Rather, we should make use of every opportunity to show our respect and sympathy to other nations' young soldiers, who risk their lives there, and their relatives. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; when I took over as federal chancellor in October 1982, the slogan of Eurosclerosis was the most used term in connection with European policy. Who would have thought at that time, following the unsuccessful Copenhagen summit in December 1982, that despite all the difficulties and many imponderables, Europe would make a decisive step forward 11 years later when the Maastricht Treaty went into effect. Let us remember: Since those days, the European Community has undergone an unprecedented, successful development -- ranging from the solemn declaration of Stuttgart, to European Union in July 1983, the accession of Spain and Portugal on 1 January 1986, the Single European Act, the single market program, and the Maastricht Treaty. It was 11 years in which we gradually came closer to European unification. Germany and France, France and Germany have made a decisive contribution to this success story. With numerous joint initiatives, President Francois Mitterrand and I tried again and again to move Europe forward. We did not do it because of the idea we are sometimes accused of having, that is, that we want to advance others by hegemonic thinking; we did it because of the special and historical responsibility for the development of Europe that the French and Germans, of course, have to point out again and again. [applause] I think that France and Germany have reason to be proud of these opportunities that we have made use of. Looking back at these years, I am pleased to take this opportunity to thank Hans-Dietrich Genscher for his personal contribution to the process of European unification. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; Europe is also essential for the future development of the German economy. European unification has had a decisive impact on the upswing of the German economy in these decades. European unification has made a key contribution to employment, growth, prosperity, and the inner stability of Germany. I want to cite a few figures to illustrate this. In 1957 German exports valued at 14 billion German marks [DM] went to the 12 countries of today's EU. Last year, our exports to Europe were worth about DM300 billion. With more than 370 million people, the future Europe of the 16 will be one of the most important economic areas of the world, in addition to NAFTA with 360 millions and the ASEAN area. One has to realize what this development means for the future of Germany in detail. Millions of jobs in Germany depend on our exports to the EU. Economically, we Germans benefit greatly from the EU. With a view to the present 12, one can say that we benefit most from the EU. It is clear that we have reached the upper limit of what we can pay to the EU. It it right that we, as economically the strongest country, pay most because we benefit most. However, it is also true that the future financing concept in the Community has to be oriented far more on per capita income of the individual countries. It is our objective that other member states with a comparable per capita income assume more financial responsibility than in the past. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the mark is the most important currency in Europe. In the past decade, it developed into an anchor of stability in monetary policies. The stability of the mark is a great good for the Germans. The experience of our people in two periods of hyperinflation in this century, with the loss of capital assets and the profound deformation of the social structure of our country, has made it clear that a stable currency is always and above all a guarantee for political stability. Therefore, our course continues to be aimed at the stability of the mark. [applause] I believe we have every reason to be happy today when we take note of the information that the rate of inflation has fallen to 2.9 percent, that is below 3 percent. [applause] In the Maastricht Treaty we succeed in having it accepted that the future European Central Bank will virtually correspond to the model of the German Bundesbank. This means that there will only be a joint European currency if it is as stable and of the same quality as the mark. We will stick to the criteria agreed in the Maastricht Treaty for the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union without any ifs and buts. I would like to repeat it once more [applause], we by no means want to postpone dates. Realistically, however, I have to say once again that the order must be that the stability criteria come first and the question of the calendar come second. This must be clearly said. [applause] The decision in favor of Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the future European Central Bank is a mark of the confidence of our partners and friends in Europe, also for our stability policy. It is a great success, and it is a sign of everyday life in Germany that this important decision is only taken note of to a limited extent. This decision means that in a few years, or decades, in the next century, Frankfurt will be the third great international financial center beside New York and Tokyo. Anyone who considers this can work out what this means for the German economy. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, in domestic and legal policy we can no longer solve the problems that we are facing on a national level alone. Although many people still do not want to believe this, we need even closer cooperation with our European neighbors. You will know that the Federal Government would have liked to go beyond what we achieved in these questions at the Maastricht negotiations. Back then, we did not succeed in this because of our partners' resistance. I am sure that now that a few years have passed since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty and that the signals and problems are emerging everywhere, the chances are becoming much better for including these problems to a greater extent. I hope very much -- and this will be our aim -- that 1996 will bring more comprehensive agreements. What is of very great importance for our domestic security is closer European cooperation in fighting the drugs mafia, organized crime, and illegal arms trading. The Maastricht Treaty and the Schengen Agreement contain the first solutions, on which we will have to base our future efforts. Ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago there was a news item going around the world. It said that the experts expect $250 billion, yes billion, in dirty money from such dealings to come into Europe this year. No one should think that we will be able to tackle this problem with the traditional ways of cooperating in Europe. This is in no way a criticism of our own police authorities. It is a completely new challenge to which we will have to find the right answer. [applause] The opening of borders, which we are all trying to achieve, must not lead to giving international crime more room to act. Let me, therefore, repeat once again that the establishing of a European police authority, Europol, is long overdue. It could be similar to an authority such as the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in our country. We will do everything that we can to improve agreement in this respect. What is also important for us and for everyone else in Europe is that we work out a common asylum policy. We want to distribute the burdens more evenly, as we in Germany are currently taking on the main influx of refugees and asylum-seekers. It is in our very own interest that we are surrounded by stable and sound economies in Central and East Europe. That is why we will consistently expand the European Union's relations with the states of Central, East, and southeastern Europe. At the suggestion of the Federal Government, we promised them clear prospects of membership at the European Council in Copenhagen. These will now have to be realized step by step. Nice words are not enough in this respect. We must offer these countries opportunities, even if it may be difficult for some people here to familiarize themselves with this idea. We have to offer them the opportunity to sell their products on our markets, our EU markets, under fair conditions. [applause] This also includes direct assistance. The FRG has been supporting the young democracies in Central and East Europe with enormous amounts both on a bilateral level, and within the European Union and the G-24. We took on our responsibility at an early stage and have made by far the greatest contribution of all the G-7 states toward the Central, East, and southeastern European reform process. Our bilateral contributions and promises to the successor states of the former Soviet Union had amounted to just under DM90 billion by the end of last year. Another DM37 billion has been allocated to the states of Central, East, and southeastern Europe. And this does not include the enormous sums that we have paid via international organizations, the EU, and the G-24. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take this opportunity to point out once again that we have now reached the limit of our capacity. Others who are able to do so should now commit themselves financially to a larger degree. [applause] We are aware that what we are doing can only be help for self-help. Economic aid, credits, advice alone cannot lead to success. No one can take over responsibility from these countries and successfully complete the reforms they have started. In this context, I stress that the Federal Government has always emphatically pointed out the insufficient safety of nuclear power plants in some Central and East European countries. The measures that have been taken are not sufficient, and I am not satisfied at all with the way this matter is being dealt with, and at the European Council meeting in Korfu and at the World Economic Summit in Naples, I will therefore once again urge a solution to these problems. [applause] But, ladies and gentlemen, in view of criticism voiced in our country, we must also say that every reasonable help for self-help is also a chance for a happy future of Germany. If the reforms in Russia fail -- to mention just an example -- and if this large country, our most important neighbor in the East, were to relapse into old structures, no matter whether they are communist structures or a military dictatorship, the consequences would cost the West, including Germany, much more. We do not want to deploy missiles again, we want there to be peace and freedom everywhere in these regions. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the European economy, including in Germany, has passed through a far-reaching recession and structural crisis. We in Germany are also suffering from the consequences of this cyclical slow-down. Fortunately, the orders received and many other indicators show that we are now getting out of this cyclical crisis -- not only in the forecasts, but also in real life, where recovery has set in. [applause] We stand a good chance that the 1.5-percent growth rate of GNP predicted by the Federal Government in January will be achieved. Those who mocked us should at least tacitly admit that development is going in this direction. But, ladies and gentlemen, there is not the slightest reason to sound the all-clear. Now that we are possibly better able to learn from the mistakes that were made over many years in the past, we must do everything to secure Germany as an industrial center, safeguard Germany's future, and carry out improvements. Much has been possible in this connection. I specifically mention the pay settlements, the larger chance to make the labor market more flexible, and many considerations to improve the competitiveness of Germany as an industrial and export nation. We must continue this course. It is above all important for our most important goal to combat unemployment and preserve jobs. We, the Federal Government, have drawn the necessary conclusions by adopting the program for safeguarding Germany's future and the action program for more growth and employment, and things are developing well. However, they are only developing, and much remains to be done. In the European framework, the Federal Government has actively supported the proposals contained in Commission President Jacques Delors' White Paper, because safeguarding Germany's future is inseparably linked with safeguarding Europe's future. It is our goal to combat unemployment at the national and European levels. Many suggestions made by Jacques Delors correspond to our own goals. Let me mention just some of them: Increasing flexibility on the labor market, reducing ancillary wage costs, creating new employment opportunities, and taking special measures against youth and long-term unemployment. Translated into German conditions, this means concretely that we must do everything in our power to make sure that youths in the new laender who want to have an apprenticeship get an apprenticeship and good training, if they are willing and able. [applause] Another example is the construction of trans-European networks in the field of transport, energy, and telecommunications. An outstanding example of this is the expansion of the East-West railroad connection. We want to build a fast rail connection across the continent as quickly as possible, from London, via Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Warsaw, to Moscow. This is also an important aim of Russian policy, as President Yeltsin pointed out during his recent visit to Germany. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a vision of the future. What was possible in terms of railroad tracks at the end of last century must also be possible to achieve with the means of the late 20th century, if only we want to achieve this together and see the importance of such a connection. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; open markets and free world trade are in Germany's, and Europe's, very own interest. A decisive step in this direction was the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round at the end of last year. With this, we passed the most comprehensive package of the past few decades liberalizing world trade. We on the German side did everything we could to help bring this important pact about. A federal Europe has been and will be the aim of Germany's European policy. We want unity with diversity. We do not want a centralized European state that makes regional, national, cultural traditions, and historic experiences disappear. In a unified Europe, in the European house that we want to build, we will remain Germans and French, keeping our identity. The terms home country, fatherland, and Europe do not mean contrast to us, but are the threesome of the future for us. Ladies and gentlemen, anyone wanting a Europe of the citizens must reject all tendencies toward European centralism. That is why we have included the principle of subsidiarity in the Maastricht Treaty; and this means that only those things shall and may be decided on a European level, in Brussels, that cannot be better decided on a national or regional level. I would also like to add to the German debate that by regional level I do not only mean the laender, but also our cities and municipalities. [applause] For me, federalism does not only mean the relationship between Brussels and Bonn, or between Bonn, Dusseldorf, and Munich, but also between Dusseldorf and Cologne, and between Munich and Nuremberg, to define this clearly for everyone. [applause] If we want to take subsidiarity seriously, this also means that we must be courageous enough to examine regulations and directives to see whether they are still appropriate. In some cases this may give rise to the question whether they have ever been appropriate. [applause] Let me add to your applause, on a self-critical note.... I know, you have never been spoilt with too much applause, but I think this morning we want to see a bit of common ground with regard to Europe, and I hope you agree. You do not have to applaud when I am saying on a self-critical note that many of the criticisms of Europe and Brussels have not been completely free of hypocrisy, because many national interests, including economic ones, are taken there and then acted out in politics. And this also needs to be said in this debate. [applause] Plainly speaking, we must not try -- and this holds true for all groups, including in Germany -- to push through in Brussels what we cannot implement at the national level. That is not very fair policy. [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; it is the goal of Germany's Europe policy to make 1994 also a year of success for European integration and continue the successes and experiences of recent years. As I said earlier, we will have a detailed and intensive debate. I personally will face the discussions in the responsible committees and bring in the Federal Government's proposals. What we can do we will do in the months following 1 July when Germany takes over the presidency. Let me add that it is my goal to implement or at least try something that we were unable to carry out in the past. We will try to reach agreement with our French friends on certain problems, so that what we start in our presidency can be continued in the subsequent French presidency, because everyone knows that the time of six months is tight for making decisions. We will consistently make use of every opportunity. Ensuring and continuing European integration is not any problem, it is the fateful problem of our continent, and for Germany's future, it is the prerequisite for peace and freedom. Konrad Adenauer said in 1950 that German unity and European integration are two sides of the same coin. This statement has proved to be visionary and right in political life. We, the Federal Government, will contribute our share to create the decisive conditions for building a weather-tight European house and to allow future generations to live in this house in peace and freedom. [applause]
