FBIS TRENDS-25MAY94-Ukraine Donetsk Voters Demonstrate Strong Anti-Kiev Sentiment Donetsk Voters Demonstrate Strong Anti-Kiev Sentiment SUMMARY The overwhelming Communist Party (CPU) victory in the Donetsk Oblast election of Ukrainian Supreme Soviet deputies appears to reflect a groundswell of anti-Kiev public sentiment rather than just orchestration by the pro-communist oblast leaders, auguring serious trouble for the Ukrainian Government. Donetsk leaders themselves did not appear to control the election and, despite their connections to the CPU, did poorly. The Donetsk public's alienation from Kiev was especially clearly demonstrated in the vote on referendum questions on the Russian language and on joining an economic union with Russia, all of which passed by over 10 to 1. Donetsk's pro-communist sentiment did not extend to the neighboring oblasts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, however, where communists won few seats and a strong, well- financed campaign helped industrial and agricultural leaders predominate. END SUMMARY The Communist Party of Ukraine was virtually the only winner in Donetsk. Of the 43 seats settled by the election (four are still vacant), the CPU won 23 (22 CPU and one joint CPU-Socialist- Labor), while in eight other districts the CPU candidates came in second (getting into the runoffs but losing). CPU First Secretary Petro Symonenko won on the first round in district 150. In addition, seven deputies from parties close to the CPU won (three Socialist Party (SPU), two Labor, one Peasant Party (SelPU), one Civil Congress of Ukraine), according to Post-Inform (Post-Postup News Agency) identifications. Other than the CPU, no party or group or category elected many representatives: -- Government officials lost about as many races as they won, suggesting that officeholding did not translate into control of the elections and that prominence and name recognition did not by themselves help much. While the winners included Deputy Chairmen of the Donetsk City Executive Committee Volodymyr Shcherban (nonparty) and Yuriy Boldyrev (Civil Congress of Ukraine and, according to Donetsk Television on 3 April, one of the initiators of the referendums), deputy chairman of the Kramatorg City Executive Committee Pavlo Kuznetsov (CPU), and chief of the oblast agriculture administration Anatoliy Petrenko (SelPU), losers included oblast soviet chairman Vadym Chuprun in district 147, deputy Donetsk City Soviet Chairman Burikh in district 118, deputy oblast administration chief Hennadiy Molodan (Liberal Party) in district 110, and deputy presidential representative V. Nakonechnyy, who failed to get elected in district 152 because of insufficient turnout (Post-Inform, 11 April; Holos Ukrainy, 27 April). -- Even the prominence of Acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk, both formerly important figures in Donetsk, did not bring them easy victories, and both won only in runoffs. In particular, zvyahilskyy, who was a local mine director and Donetsk city mayor before being named first deputy premier in June 1993, demonstrated little local popularity. In the first round he ran second to a CPU candidate (Vechernyy Donetsk, 5 April). An article in the 17-24 March Post-Postup reported that the independent union at his old mine had opposed the mine's nomination of Zvyahilskyy. Zvyahilskyy's son-in-law, Volodymyr Vechirko, running in district 109, lost when neither candidate won a majority in the runoffs (Post-Inform, 11 April). A 15-21 April Post-Postup article asserted that Landyk and Shcherban won votes by having clerks identified with them sell food at cutrate prices in key precincts and that Boldyrev and zvyahilskyy were aided by local officials who barred outside observers at voting precincts and appeared to add ballots. -- Incumbent Supreme Soviet members did badly. According to the 25-31 March Post-Postup, 14 Supreme Soviet members ran for reelection. Only four were among the winners and two of them ran on the CPU ticket--Oleksiy Shekhovtsov, Anatoliy Khunov (CPU), Oleh Panasovskiy (CPU), and zvyahilskyy--while even one of the most prominent leftist-conservative deputies, Oleksandr Charodeyev (running as nonparty), lost in district 116. -- Industrial and enterprise leaders did better, but "red directors" did not appear dominant. The winners included Chairman of the State Committee for the Coal Industry Mykola Surhay (nonparty), head of the Donetsk Railway Oleksandr Kozhushko (nonparty), President of the Aton Corporation Yevhen Shcherban (Liberal Party), mine director Volodymyr Ampilohov (non-party), deputy plant director Borys Kozhevnykov (CPU), chief of a mine construction trust Valeriy Pudryk (CPU), coal construction trust official Anatoliy Tatarynov (nonparty), farm enterprise head Oleksandr Shamaryn (CPU), and power station director Oleh Panasovskyy (CPU). But metallurgical combine deputy director M. Khromov lost in 134, and mine director Teslenko lost in district 144 (Post-Inform, 11 April). -- Almost no union leaders won, despite the importance of unions in Donetsk and the miners' political activism and repeated strikes. While one minor union official won (Anatoliy Khmelyovyy, head of a union at a locomotive depot), Cochairman of the Donetsk Strike Committee Mykola Krylov lost in district 113 to a CPU candidate, chairman of the trade union at the Azov Steel Plant (Azovstal) lost in district 137, and a rayon trade union head lost in district 151 (Post-Inform, 11 April). Factors in Victory Donetsk's pro-communist tide appears to reflect longstanding communist strength in the oblast and public dissatisfaction with Kiev's economic policies and its ptomotion of Ukrainian nationalism. An article in the 25-31 March Lviv weekly Post- Postup discussing reasons for the communist victory argued that the Donetsk CPU organization, one of the biggest in the old Soviet Union, is still strong and was able to put up far more candidates than other parties (52 in the 47 districts). The article also maintained that Donetsk has an especially high number of pensioners, who are inclined to prefer the past and who are inclined to go out to vote, while young people were simply ignoring the election. Local Leadership The Donetsk leadership is close to the CPU, even though it did not do as well as the CPU itself in the election. The local government leadership consists of many of the same individuals who ran the oblast before the overthrow of the communist system in 1991. The top Donetsk leader, Presidential Representative Yuriy Smirnov (who did not run for the Supreme Soviet), was CPU oblast first secretary and then oblast soviet chairman before being chosen by President Leonid Kravchuk for the top local government post when Kravchuk created this new post of presidential representative in early 1992. The No. 2 man in the province, Oblast Soviet Chairman Chuprun, had been CPU oblast secretary until succeeding Smirnov as soviet chairman. He was defeated by incumbent Supreme Soviet deputy and CPU candidate Panasovskyy. Chuprun recently renewed his membership in the CPU, and a 26 April Donetsk CPU conference nominated him for reelection as oblast soviet chairman (Post-Inform, 29 April). Moreover, the top Ukrainian republic leaders from Donetsk were also part of the party or government establishment there. Acting Premier Zvyahilskyy was elected Donetsk City Soviet and Executive Committee chairman in the fall of 1991 (Nezavisimost, 21 July 1992), while Deputy Premier Landyk was director of a prominent Donetsk enterprise. Present Ukrainian Communist Party First Secretary Symonenko was Donetsk CPU second secretary in 1990 and founded the new CPU, now the Ukraine's biggest party, in 1993. Donetsk Leadership 1990 1992 1994 Communist Party: Oblast first secretary Mironov (CPU banned) Oblast second secretary Symonenko Oblast secretary Chuprun Government: Presidential representative --- Smirnov Smirnov Oblast soviet head Smirnov Chuprun Chuprun City soviet head Makhmudov Zvyahilskyy (apparently vacant) eot Public Attitudes The local leadership, sympathetic to Russia and the old system, has pressed for autonomy from Kiev and closer ties to Russia and took advantage of the election to put on the ballot referendum questions designed to promote a course opposite from Kiev's. In mid-1993 the oblast soviet had passed a resolution calling for regional autonomy and expressing no confidence in President Kravchuk (Rossiyskiye Vesti, Izvestiya, 16 June 1993), and on 22 February it adopted a decision to put questions on the 27 March ballot on making Russian, in addition to Ukrainian, the official language, either in Ukraine as a whole or at least in Donetsk (Donbass, 25 February). Also added to the ballot were questions on having Ukraine join the CIS economic union and on changing the Ukrainian Constitution to provide for a federal system that would enable Donetsk to become autonomous. The results of the referendums reflected the strong public alienation from the Kiev government, its promotion of Ukrainian nationalism, and its conflicts with Russia. Donetsk voters clearly backed more use of the Russian language, closer economic ties with Russia, and autonomy for Donbass to pursue its own policies, judging by the results reported in the 1 April Vecherniy Donetsk: Yes No Should the constitution make Russian a state language in Ukraine along with Ukrainian? 2,430,821 238,017 Should the Russian language be the "language of work, business, and documentation and also education and science" along with Ukrainian in Donetsk Oblast? 2,455,949 191,791 Should Ukraine become a full member of the CIS economic union and parliamentary assembly of states? 2,481,981 190,907 Should the Ukrainian Constitution establish a federal system? 2,227,538 419,794 eot Opinion Polls Opinion polls in Donetsk have also suggested antagonism toward Kiev and President Kravchuk. A mid-April poll of Donetsk voters on support for presidential candidates showed 38 percent for Kuchma, 21 percent for Kravchuk, 8 percent for reform economist Volodymyr Lanovyy, 5 percent for Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch, 4 percent for CPU leader Symonenko, and 3 percent for SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz (Post-Postup, 29 April-6 May). Another such poll showed Kuchma with 24.1 percent, 20.7 percent for Symonenko, and 13.8 percent for Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil, while Kravchuk got only 3.4 percent, falling behind them and also behind Zvyahilskyy, New Ukraine leader Volodymyr Hrynyov, and Moroz (Aktsent, 30 April). (See Note 1) Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok on 23 April cited a recent poll by the Ukrainian Center for Political Psychology showing that in Donetsk and Luhansk only 40 percent support Ukrainian independence now while 37.1 percent oppose it--less than half the 83 percent who voted for independence in December 1991 in both these oblasts (Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 December 1991). (Note 1) In an effort to boost his sagging popularity, Kravchuk in mid-May visited Donetsk and delivered a speech to industry leaders supporting "the broadest regional independence" and recalling his recent decree allowing four eastern oblasts to conduct an economic experiment. He also called for postponing the presidential election and won support for this from others at the meeting (UNIAN, 17 May). Role of Press The local newspapers, although calling themselves independent of the oblast leadership, have appeared to promote the communist cause and the position of local leaders. The oblast paper with the biggest circulation, Aktsent, on 18 March argued that Kiev's bureaucracy is draining and holding back Donetsk and that the oblast needs economic independence to extricate itself from economic crisis. The same paper on 1 April enthusiastically lauded the communist victory and ridiculed the nationalists' poor showing and declared that "for the communist majority of voters and in general for this region the very word 'liberal' . . . is a swear word and 'bourgeois.'" Some papers appeared to have ties to some establishment candidates. The weekly Donetskiy Kryazh, according to a 17-24 March Post-Postup article, promoted Zvyahilskyy's son-in-law as a "talented doctor and active public figure" who is developing a "super-modern" medical center to aid invalids and pensioners. Vechirko leads the scientific-industrial firm Interbis, which also happens to be one of the sponsors of the paper. The 17-24 March Post-Postup article by Serhiy Furmanyuk also asserted that city executive committee deputy chairman Volodymyr Shcherban, who heads the stock company "Delo Vsekh" (Everybody's Cause), shortly before the campaign became a publisher of the popular local paper Gorod, "thereby reliably protecting his candidacy from any press criticism." Furmanyuk, who worked for the paper Gorod, was subsequently fired by its chief editor for trying to discredit Shcherban and impugning the honesty and independence of Gorod (Post-Postup, 8-14 April). Donetsk City's paper Vecherniy Donetsk did not provide much coverage of the election or candidates but did appear to give special coverage to a few selected candidates--Zvyahilskyy (16 March, 8 April), Ampilohov (23 March, 7, 8 April), and V. Shcherban (25 March, 6 April), and it also carried a 1 April report on a press conference by the victorious CPU. Contrast to Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk The pro-CPU tide in Donetsk was also evident in neighboring Luhansk and Zaporizhzhya, where the party took 18 of the 23 seats settled and 7 of 16, respectively, but anti-Kiev sentiment did not translate into communist victories in neighboring Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, where the CPU was seriously outspent by industrial-agricultural forces. In Dnipropetrovsk the CPU won only one seat of the 21 settled and in Kharkiv only six of the 24 settled, based on identifications in the list of winners in the 21 April Uryadovyy Kuryer (see table). Although these oblasts also oppose Kiev's nationalistic policies and economic decisions, they elected mainly industrial and agricultural leaders, rather than CPU candidates. Thus, Kharkiv elected nine such industrial and agricultural officials (three of whom were also CPU candidates) of their 24 elected, and Dnipropetrovsk elected eight of its 21. The fact that the main winners in these oblasts were industrial- agricultural forces at least partly reflected the efforts of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) organized by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov to compete with the leftists. While it is hard to assess MBR successes because its winning candidates usually identified themselves as nonparty or members of the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU), the 15-21 April Post-Postup reported five MBR candidates elected in Kharkiv City, and Post-Inform on 11 April reported three MBR candidates elected in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In Dnipropetrovsk the MBR appeared to put on a strong campaign and spend large sums of money the leftists could not match. The MBR ran many ads in the local paper Dneprovskaya Panorama listing a ticket of candidates in 13 districts plus support for five independent candidates, and seven of these won, judging by the list of winners in the 12 April Dneprovskaya Panorama. A 15-21 April Post-Postup article argued that leftists simply could not compete with the big money of the MBR and industrialists and quoted one SPU candidate complaining on television that the MBR was spending enough on the election to feed the whole population of Kharkiv for one year. By contrast, the MBR appeared inactive in Donetsk. The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk's complete list of candidates for Donetsk City's 10 districts included no MBR candidates. The industrial-agricultural leaders, although presumably broadly reflecting the establishment, appeared to include some reformers and democrats. MBR leader Hrynyov is clearly an economic reformer, and one of the MBR candidates spoke of MBR's candidates as "marketeers" (rynochniki), according to a 5 April Dneprovskaya Panorama article. The party representatives elected in the three contrasting oblasts, judging by official identifications in the list of winners in the 21 April Uryadovyy Kuryer, were: CPU SPU Labor SelPU Civil PDVU Nonparty Congress Dnipropetrovsk 1 1 2 3 0 1 13 Kharkiv 6 2 0 0 1 1 14 Donetsk 22* 3 1* 1 1 0 15 *Post-Inform identifications differed slightly, listing 22 CPU winners plus one joint CPU-SPU-Labor and two Labor. Two winners listed as nonparty in Uryadovyy Kuryer were listed as Labor and joint CPU-SPU-Labor, respectively, by Post-Inform on 11 April. eot Implications Ukraine's biggest oblast is at sharp odds with the government in Kiev at least partly because of widespread public sentiment hostile to Ukrainian nationalism and the prospect of economic reform. Its deputies in the Supreme Soviet will probably play a key role in organizing a bloc against reforms, and President Kravchuk will have difficulty winning much support in Donetsk in his bid for reelection. Fortunately for Kravchuk and reformers, pro-communist sentiment is not dominant everywhere in the east, as the success of the strong, well-financed campaign by MBR- industrialists demonstrated in the nearby provinces of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk.
