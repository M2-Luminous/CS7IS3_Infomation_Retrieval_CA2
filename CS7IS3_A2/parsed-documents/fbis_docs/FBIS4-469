FBIS4-469 "drafr070_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Chiefs Reportedly Planning Mass Action Chiefs Reportedly Planning Mass Action MB1104141894 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 11 Apr 94 p 1 MB1104141894 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY English BFN [Report by Billy Paddock] [Text] Zulu chiefs are believed to be considering a mass action campaign over the election period which would require their subjects to attend the campaign, preventing them from going to polling stations. A senior Inkatha source said at the weekend he had heard this speculation, but denied it was an Inkatha plan. He said Inkatha wanted to prove that the constitution was unacceptable by ensuring its members backed an election boycott. Traditional chiefs might take action to frustrate the Independent Election Commission's (IEC) efforts to ensure free elections. The rumoured mass action campaign was one of these actions. He also denied rumours that Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had called on all kwaZulu public servants to report to Ulundi on April 27 in an attempt to prevent them from going to polling stations. He said it had become clear that government and the ANC were prepared to bulldoze the election regardless of opposition. "(ANC president Nelson) Mandela keeps saying that the elections cannot be postponed because the people will be too angry and will revolt. Well, the fact is that the majority of people in this region are angry that the elections are going ahead and their concerns are being ignored."
