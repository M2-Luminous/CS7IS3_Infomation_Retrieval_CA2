Border violations are intolerable, whoever commits them, Aleksandr Panov, Russian deputy foreign minister, told Interfax. He admitted the existence of a territorial dispute between the two countries and emphasized that Russia did not refuse to discuss it. "If one party says a problem exists, the other cannot say it does not," Panov observed. In his words, the territorial issue will be one of the items on the agenda of the Russo-Japanese working consultations to be held in Moscow on February 21 and 22 under the joint chairmanship of Hiroshi Fukuda, Panov's counterpart, and himself. The deputy minister also said that the Russian negotiators would raise the issue of Japanese ships crossing illegally into Russian waters. "We will insist that the Japanese authorities take the necessary steps to prevent this," Panov said. The meeting will discuss "a wide range of issues" around the wording and signing of a peace treaty. "We do not expect any dramatic or sensational decisions or recommendations. It will be a usual working meeting," the diplomat said.
