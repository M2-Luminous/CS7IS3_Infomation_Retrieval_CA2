FR940223-2-00141 FR940223-2-00089 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records_Means Test Verification Records_VA (89VA161) AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Notice of new system of records. SUMMARY: The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)) requires that all agencies publish in the Federal Register a notice of the existence and character of the systems of records. Accordingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published a notice of its inventory of personal records on September 27, 1977 (42 FR 49726). Notice is hereby given that VA is adding a new system of records entitled ``Means Test Verification Records'' (89VA161). DATES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding the routine uses in this new system of records. All relevant materials received before March 25, 1994, will be considered. All written comments received will be available for public inspection in Room 170 of the address given below between Monday through Friday (except holidays) until April 4, 1994. If no public comment is received during the 30-day review period allowed for public comment or unless otherwise published in the Federal Register by VA, the routine uses are effective March 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed routine uses may be mailed to the Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs (271A), 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20420. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Celia Winter, Program Analyst, Income Verification Match Program (161B/IVM), Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420, (202) 535&hyph;7437. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 99&hyph;272, the Veterans Health Care Amendments of 1986, as amended by Public Law 100&hyph;322, established two categories of eligibility for VA health care: ``mandatory and discretionary.'' In order to determine the category assignment of nonservice-connected veterans, new eligibility assessment procedures, including the means test, were developed. The means tested is based on income information provided by the nonservice-connected veteran. It was developed to ensure that the most needy nonservice-connected veterans would be placed in the mandatory care category based on limited family income. The law provided VA no legislative authority to verify the self-reported income. In November 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), provided VA the authority to verify income data reported to VA by nonservice-connected veterans with income records obtained from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Section 602, Public Law 102&hyph;568 extended VA's matching authority through September 1997. The law has three requirements for VA: (1) Notification to veterans that means test financial information report to VA is subject to verification with IRS and SSA records; (2) No steps may be taken to terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce any benefit or service until appropriate steps have been taken to independently verify the information received; and (3) Development and implementation of a VA income verification matching program be funded from the VA Compensation and Pension appropriation. The Income Verification Match (IVM) Center was developed to conduct and administer the computer matching of Veterans Health Administration income data with IRS and SSA income records. Due to stringent IRS security regulations and codes, the process of matching the income of the veteran will be accomplished through a stand-alone automated data processing program with verification activities centralized at the IVM Center. The IVM Center is located in Decatur, Georgia. Matching agreements have been established between the Veterans Health Administration and the IRS and SSA for verifying income of nonservice-connected veterans for appropriate years. The IVM Program will adhere to require VA security and reporting requirements in accordance with Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, and other Federal regulations, as well as 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Privacy Act, and 26 U.S.C. 6103, the Internal Revenue Code. This new system of records is being established for IVM records to identify the types of information being extracted and utilized for IVM and means tested verification, how the data will be used and to describe he limited access to this data. Approved: February 8, 1994. Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
