During the deliberations, the Guangxi NPC deputies discussed and formulated a new blueprint for Guangxi's economic growth in light of the region's realities, exchanged views on a series of national issues, and pledged to make concerted efforts to grasp each and every opportunity to deepen reform and develop the economy. Zhao Fulin [secretary of the regional party committee] said: Premier Li Peng's work report embodied the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, realistically summed up the country's work over the past year, and laid down encouraging tasks for this year's work. Since the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the people of all nationalities across Guangxi, like people in other parts of the country, have unremittingly taken as a guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly adhered to the party's basic line, and grasped each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform, with the result that Guangxi has enjoyed an excellent situation with respect to nationality solidarity, social stability, and economic growth. This year, the central authorities are expected to unfold a series of reforms. We are bound to encounter a host of difficulties and problems in this process. In view of the situation, we should show concern for the country's overall interests, observe discipline, and work harder in a down-to-earth manner. Zhao Fulin stated: In order to implement the spirit of the current NPC session to the letter, it is imperative to make a success of the following three aspects of work: 1) Deepening reform -- In order to make a success of reform in 1994, we should further emancipate our minds, transform ideological concepts, properly handle ideological issues among cadres and the masses, and resolve all types of social contradictions, thereby making ourselves more adaptable to the new situation. 2) Working with one heart and one mind -- To this end, the higher and lower levels should share weal and woe, and should forge ahead jointly by braving wind and wave in the interests of the whole country. The whole country's economic development and growing economic strength definitely will push Guangxi's economic development ahead, and will raise the Guangxi people's living standards as well. To develop the economy, we should build more communications and energy projects, establish more overseas trade links, construct more infrastructure facilities, improve the investment environment, readjust the industrial structure, make more use of advanced science and technology, and invigorate enterprises, as well as increase economic efficiency. 3) Strengthening unity within leading bodies, enhancing nationality solidarity, intensifying comprehensive social order management, persistently furthering the anticorruption struggle, successfully carrying out propaganda and ideological work, and stepping up legal system building. Cheng Kejie [chairman of the regional people's government] stated: Reviewing last year's work and looking forward to this year's development, I am convinced that our party and country are still full of hope. Last year, the whole country enjoyed rapid economic growth, social stability, and improved livelihood -- thanks to good leadership, correct policies, and stronger efforts. This year, we are going to build more construction projects in Guangxi. In view of this situation, apart from redoubling efforts in this regard, we should conscientiously study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three; arm our minds with, and update ideological concepts according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory; unify understanding; enhance a sense of urgency; treasure and seize each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform; improve the investment environment; readjust the industrial structure; and provide more assistance to poverty-stricken areas; thereby pushing ahead with Guangxi's economic growth and social progress. During the deliberations, Ren Xianchun and Xia Baofang, as well as other Guangxi NPC deputies, also spoke one after another in light of their respective local realities, putting forward work proposals for this year and views on Premier Li Peng's work report.
