It was the third time for him to investigate the electronics industrial trade. He pointed out: The electronics industry conforms to the special characteristics of Beijing. Thus, the municipal government should vigorously support the development of the electronics industry. Enterprises should have accurate ideas, foster lofty ideals, enhance internal strength, and strive to make the electronics industry become Beijing's pillar industry. Li Qiyan and other leaders inspected this plant's videocorder production line, general outfitting workshop, and showroom; cordially talked with workers and technicians; and asked them about the production, technical, and marketing situation. [passage omitted] Li Qiyan said during the talks: As the capital of a country with a population of 1.1 billion, Beijing, under certain conditions, should make faster development and stride forward toward the orientation of building itself into an internationally large, modern city. Beijing should bring its role as a political and cultural center into better play. To develop the economy, Beijing should develop high technology as well as products without contamination and with less energy consumption so as to suit the special characteristics of the capital. The electronics industry, conforming to the special characteristics of Beijing and being listed as one of the municipality's three major pillar industries, will become increasingly important in the future. Li Qiyan said: Beijing has the conditions for developing the electronics industry. Beijing's electronics industrial trade, with a good foundation, made great contributions to the country in the past. This trade has a comparatively powerful science professional and technician contingent and an appropriate equipment foundation. In particular, plant directors and the broad masses of staff members and workers have a good attitude. With confidence and prospects, the leading body of the municipal electronics industrial office is able to undertake the task for rejuvenating the electronics trade. We should stand higher, widen the field of vision, foster higher aspirations, and make Beijing's electronics industry stand among the best in the country and march toward the world. We should use this target to encourage the leading bodies and the staff and workers. Li Qiyan stressed: The key to tiding over the electronics industry's difficulties and rejuvenating the electronics industry is to have accurate ideas. We should further emancipate the mind and change ideas. Targets should be higher and attainable. In the next one or two years, we should specifically make efforts, do solid work, and solve the problems one after another. We should treat the money-losing enterprises by looking into both their root causes and symptoms and make real efforts to resolve their problems. It is not easy to eliminate the root causes of the problems. To eliminate them, we must make several years of effort. We should also pay firm attention to eliminating the symptoms and appropriately solve the problems related to the livelihood of the staff and workers. Li Qiyan said: The transition from the planned economy to the market economy is a great transformation. So, it is impossible to smoothly realize this transition. There will be enterprises with vitality and ones with deficits through this transition. The municipal government and various overall departments should help enterprises overcome difficulties and solve problems, and push enterprises to markets. We should vigorously help rejuvenate the electronics industry, try every possible means to create a good environment, appropriately provide preferential policies, properly inject working funds to the production enterprises with markets and efficiency, and give them necessary assistance. We should give awards to the plant directors with good performances and the specialists with contributions so as to bring into play the functions of intellectuals. Enterprises should have good leading bodies unite with the science professional and technician contingents and guide all staff members and workers. Simultaneously, the electronics industry should make efforts, work hard to enhance its internal strength, and make itself actually become Beijing's pillar industry. Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and Fan Yuanmo, secretary general of the municipal government, joined the investigation and study activities.
