In the national park of Plitvice, which was occupied and devastated by the Serbs, an agreement on joint activities of the intelligence and counterintelligence services of "all Serbian countries" was signed. Translated into normal language, this means that intelligence services from the Serb-occupied regions in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are now connected with their principals in Yugoslavia. According to this agreement the joint intelligence service would have four divisions: for foreign contacts, for analysis and research, the operative division, and the external security division. The headquarters will be in Pancevo, which was in the former Yugoslavia known as the center for education of intelligence officers. There will be "branch offices" in Banja Luka, Pale, Knin, and Petrinja. The so-called "branch offices" will consist of groups of about 12 officers: a commander, a coordinator, and an adviser for artillery, infantry, and air force. Each of the "branch offices" will be led by a coordinator, whose task will be to cooperate with the "headquarters." There will also be a joint coordinator who will at the same time be the leader of the intelligence services of the "Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of the "republic of Serbian Krajina." Bosko Kelecevic obtained the position of coordinator in Croatia. Only several days before the meeting in Plitvice the representatives of SVR, the newly established Russian intelligence service, allegedly visited Knin. According to the protocol about joint activities between the intelligence services, it was decided to reorganize the intelligence service in order to "efficiently achieve short-term and long-term strategic and safety interests as well as the internal and external security." The agreement was signed in the presence of General Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, the head of the military intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Radenko Radinovic, his assistant for the counterintelligence service. Generals Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and Milisav Gagovic also participated in the meeting. This event, about which some Belgrade and Slovene (!) newspapers published short reports, means that the reorganization of the Belgrade intelligence services, which have been shaken by many scandals and internal conflicts between Yugoslav and Serbian officers, has been completed. The victory of the "hard" line is confirmed by the fact that General Bosko Kelecevic has been appointed head, in other words the "main intelligence service coordinator" between the so-called "Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and "Serbian Krajina." Kelecevic Moved to Slunj The newly established "boss" of all Serbian spies, Mr. Bosko Kelecevic was born 42 years ago in Bosanski Aleksandrovac, a small place between Banja Luka and Bosanska Gradiska. After having completed the education for noncommissioned officers, he continued his education at the Military Academy in Belgrade. He specialized in artillery. He spent the major part of his military training in Krizevci, Croatia. He is married to a Croatian national and has twin sons. In 1971 he entered KOS, the intelligence service of the former Yugoslav People's Army (this is the abbreviation, but the full name of the service was The Security Department of the Federal Ministry of National Defense). He became the head of the Security Department in the Fifth Military Region in 1987. His activity covered Slovenia and almost all of Croatia. At the beginning of the aggression against Croatia he participated in numerous negotiations with Croatian authorities. Together with the majority of the commanders in the Fifth Military Region he moved with his family from Zagreb to Slunj in May 1991. His boss, General Zivota Avramovic, joined him there somewhat later. He performed the same tasks in Slunj. In October 1991 he moved to Mrakovica, on the Kozara Mountain, and then to Sarajevo at the end of 1991. In Sarajevo he joined the Second Military Region led by the notorious General Kukanjac. At the time when the army of Bosnian Serbs was being formed, in April and May of 1992, he was appointed chief of staff of the First Krajina Corps, which was led by Momir Talic. The corps was situated in Banja Luka. He was promoted to the general rank. Boss -- A Typical Noncommissioned Officer Those who met Bosko Kelecevic during his service in Zagreb say that he is a typical noncommissioned officer, a man thoroughly loyal to and indoctrinated by the ideas of his superiors. The word of his superiors has the power of law for him. His activities in the war against Croatia are vague. He did not distinguish himself anywhere except in the region of Bosanska Posavina, where he fought for the preservation of the corridor there under the command of Talic and Lisica. People who know him well say that he is a better artillery man than an intelligence officer. They claim that he substitutes a lack of intelligence skills by his excellent feeling for organization and exceptional energy. His greatest success in the intelligence war in Croatia is considered the development of a widely spread network of intelligence officers. He infiltrated them by issuing journalists' cards for them, a well-known method. Although he has not gone through all necessary stages in the training of intelligence officers, his promotion was very quick. This is explained by his good connections to the former first man of KOS, Mr. Aleksandar Vasiljevic. The information from the meeting in Plitvice is opening a new chapter of questions about the intelligence war waged in occupied Croatian territories. Three intelligence organizations from Belgrade are active in the occupied Croatian territories: The Intelligence Service of the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia General Staff, the Department of the State Security of the Army, and the Department of State Security of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia. Well-trained officers work in these organizations, they have a long tradition and are well equipped. Some of the officers are distinguished professionals, such as Radenko Radinovic and Mr. Dimitrijevic, who learned their profession through all the stages of education at the Security Department. In the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia there are professionals such as Jovica Stanisic, the head of this service, and Franko Simatovic-Frenki, the officer in charge of connection with the occupied territories in Croatia. Their main task is to decode the Croatian Army movements and to collect data necessary for taking actions. Work Among Muslims The fact that Serbian intelligence officers became united -- regardless of how dangerous this might seem at first sight -- is nothing new. The main "coordinator" is still situated in Belgrade, so that the alleged conflicts among the local bosses in the occupied Croatian territories are in fact only a tactic of the Belgrade intelligence services, which still have full control of the so-called Krajina. In the last two years, during the war between Croatian and Serbian intelligence officers, there have been many struggles which mostly resulted in Croatian victories. The final outcome will, however, depend on who has the larger number of professionals and better organization and equipment. The greatest Serbian success is considered the infiltration of Serbian intelligence officers into Muslim circles who allegedly contributed to the war between Bosnian Muslims and Croats. There is the impression, however, that the formal merger of all Serbian intelligence services primarily has political rather than professional, "spying" functions. After this merger, there followed the monetary union. According to some information the armies of "all Serbian countries" should become united in March 1995. Is not this yet another proof of Serbian sincerity when it speaks about the normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia?
