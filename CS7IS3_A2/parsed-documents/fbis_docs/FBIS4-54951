Agnes Pap reports: [Pap] The Smallholders are satisfied with the first round of the elections and are expecting the position of the parties in third and fourth place to change on 29 May, in other words that the FKGP will overtake the MDF and will be one of those to stand on the podium, [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef Torgyan said. The party chairman stressed: They will in any event conduct politics in opposition. There can be no question of joining an eventual government made up of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and such a government is possible, in his opinion. The FKGP does not want to conclude an all-embracing election alliance with any party for the second round, he said, recalling the bad experiences of the second round of the 1990 elections. However, Jozsef Torgyan did not exclude the possibility of concluding one-off agreements with the parties on the national side, or that they might step back in favor of one another. Mrs. G. Nagy, nee Agnes Maczo [FKGP deputy chairwoman], said she can imagine this at most in connection with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] because, she stressed, there is no reason to change the existing decisive opposition approach to politicizing with the MDF.
