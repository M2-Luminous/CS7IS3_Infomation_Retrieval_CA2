These are the four themes which have given birth to the "pact of permanent consultation" signed by the three parliamentary groups to which 213 progressive deputies belong. The document, launched by the left-wing groups with the intention of setting up a common opposition on the topics of greatest importance, was presented yesterday at a press conference at the Chamber of Deputies by Luigi Berlinguer, Famiano Crucianelli, Giorgio Bogi, Gianni Mattioli, Diego Novelli, and Fabio Mussi. The progressive deputies "commit themselves in the form of a permanent consultation pact aimed at common parliamentary behavior on questions of: votes of confidence and no-confidence, government finance and the budget, constitutional and electoral reforms, and parliamentary appointments." When it comes to "questions of conscience" and matters relating to ethical subjects and religious convictions, the pact permits "freedom of behavior" for each individual parliamentarian. The accord's signatories, freely inspired by the "joint declaration of intent" signed between the progressive allies at the time of the 27 March parliamentary elections, undertake in the document to "ensure the growth of, to consolidate, deepen and extend this unity." With the "pact," the progressive deputies also undertake to maintain and strengthen the joint electoral committees in their respective constituencies, which will be linked by regional or constituency-level coordination committees. Additionally, permanent coordination bodies and working groups will be created in the parliamentary committees. This document shows, Luigi Berlinguer, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] floor leader in the lower house, stated, that the progressive's united path has not ended, even if three distinct parliamentary groups have been born. We will present an opposition without adjectives, firmly, and without agitation. Communist Renewal floor leader Crucianelli presented the document as an instrument "to give life to a united battle by the opposition on contents, taking into account that an attempt is being made to set up a system," and indicated as the first joint engagement the national manifestation on schools on 29 May. For Giorgio Bogi, the pact is a "gesture of loyalty toward the electorate," while for Greens deputy Gianni Mattioli the agreement is the fruit "of a strong united effort coming from the periphery."
