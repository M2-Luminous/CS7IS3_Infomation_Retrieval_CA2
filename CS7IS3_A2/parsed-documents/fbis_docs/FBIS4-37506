The establishment of a command aiming to stop 'Arafat, the calls for his assassination, the Jerusalem Municipality tax collectors' move against Orient House, as well as Shim'on Peres' stuttering, legislative initiatives aimed to curb PLO activities, and the invitation extended to King Husayn to pray on the Temple Mount -- all these have served to divert attention from the main problem: The traditional Israeli stand on the Jerusalem issue does not correspond with the political reality that took root after the Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed and the PLO was recognized. In this sense, right-wing spokesmen are right in assailing the government for permitting the peace process to lead to concessions on the issue of Jerusalem, and the government cannot justify its stance by hiding behind hallowed formulas on the status of Israel's indivisible and nonnegotiable capital. No matter how frequently government spokesmen declare their allegiance to the traditional stands, once the Palestinian national community was acknowledged and willingness to negotiate the implementation of its national objectives was voiced, that community and its collective link to Jerusalem became legitimate. The approximately 200,000 Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem (but are not Israeli citizens) have the right to feel an integral part of the Palestinian collective, and after the DOP, their right to organize their community life and to rally around their national symbols and authoritative institutions can no longer be denied. Indeed, the traditional Israeli stand concerning the residents of East Jerusalem has been that the demarcation of the annexation borders severed the city's Arabs from the other West Bank residents, making them an inseparable part of the State of Israel. And yet, with the exception of Central Bureau of Statistics releases, in which East Jerusalem residents feature among the totals for Israeli Arabs (designated as "non-Jewish"), no one has ever considered East Jerusalem residents Israelis. Israel annexed the territory of East Jerusalem but not its residents. They have remained aliens, deprived of basic civil rights, devoid of municipal services, and exposed to every kind of discrimination. Even the attempts to cultivate a minimum of coexistence expired with the onset of the intifadah, and Israeli Governments learned to accept the fact that East Jerusalemites cannot be separated from the great body of the West Bank population and that they must not cling to the illusion that East Jerusalem can be wrenched away from its province and made into some sort of new "mini-Triangle." It was the intifadah that established Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem -- most notably Orient House -- and every Israeli Government put up with their existence. The DOP imbued these institutions with a new significance, and it is that with which the Rabin government is trying to deal. The government decided to differentiate between "governing institutions" and "voluntary institutions" dealing with social and community activities. This distinction, which is equal to the illusion of cutting East Jerusalem off from West Jerusalem, is only a fantasy and is unbecoming of people who grew up in Israel's pioneer days and know how voluntary institutions -- such as the Histadrut labor federation -- can become the cornerstone of the "nascent state's" voluntary governing system. The truth is that the continued existence of Jewish voluntary institutions with "governing characteristics" is responsible for the legal experts' inability to propose legislation restricting the activity of the Palestinian institutions. As long as the Jewish National Fund is situated in the western part of the city, its Palestinian parallel can hardly be banned without risking an appeal to the High Court of Justice that will discuss the petition on the basis of Israeli legislation and basic laws. The attempts to harass the East Jerusalem Palestinian institutions will be as successful as the closure, which supposedly cut the city off from its surroundings, although it is no secret that anyone can enter it. Nonetheless, the government is tackling the institutions exactly as it did the closure: It would like to keep up appearances in order to discourage public debate. It may be able to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from coming to Jerusalem, but it cannot move Arab Jerusalem to Jericho. Israelis who believe in the unity of Jerusalem will also have to accept the continued existence of central Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. They would do well to remember the postannexation years, when the Government of Israel made every possible effort -- all of which failed -- to move the Palestinian institutions to Ramallah. East Jerusalem is the West Bank's economic, political, and social center, and it is the hub of the Palestinians' religious and national life. This fact can be neither obfuscated nor forcibly changed. The sooner the Israelis accept this, the faster will the root of the problem be discussed. The debate will then focus on the search for new formulas to resolve the Jerusalem issue -- formulas that will correspond to the new political situation and will not be based on illusions and wishful thinking.
