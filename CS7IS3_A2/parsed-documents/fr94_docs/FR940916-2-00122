SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that the Notice of Intent (NOI) published on July 15, 1993, for a project from SR 182 at Orange Beach to Baldwin County Road 95 is revised to include the segment of the route from Baldwin County Road 95 north to I&hyph;10. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe D.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, is preparing two (2) Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) for Alabama Project MAOA&hyph;0200(‚ê£). The proposal is to construct a multi-lane, limited access facility from Alabama State Route 182 near Orange Beach north to Interstate Highway 10. The project length is approximately 40.23 kilometers (25 miles). The new highway will serve as a proposed hurricane evacuation route for Orange Beach and surrounding communities to Interstate 10 facilitating faster and more efficient evacuation during emergencies. A Notice of Intent for Alabama Project MAOA&hyph;0200(6), the portion of the proposed hurricane evacuation route from Alabama State Route 182 near Orange Beach north to Baldwin County Road 95 including a bridge across Wolf Bay, was published on July 15, 1993. It is now intended to circulate the draft EIS's for the portion contained in the July 15, 1993, NOI and the portion from Baldwin County Road 95 north to Interstate Highway 10 concurrently with an executive summary of cumulative impacts. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Alternate route locations, (2) a no action alternative, and (3) postponing of action alternative. Early coordination has been initiated with Federal, State, and local environmental agencies and officials. Public involvement meetings were held on November 16 and 17, 1992, at Orange Beach and Eleanor, respectively. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to FHWA at the address provided above.
