[Schroeder] I have done that several times and even effusively for me. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you share our impression that your election victory was not exactly celebrated enthusiastically by the national SPD? [Schroeder] They are all very businesslike people. They are incapable of enthusiasm, because in the past there was hardly any reason for it. Something like that has to be relearned. [DER SPIEGEL] The party chairman warned his friends against holding their noses so high that it rains in. Was that aimed at you? [Schroeder] No, there is no danger of that with me. I can say in all modesty that people will be able to judge the political implications of our election result correctly only when they can look back six months. In Hamburg, the SPD lost almost 8 percentage points. We actually gained a little and won the absolute majority of seats. That must be repeated in the coming elections. All SPD representatives have direct electoral districts. We did not have that before here. [DER SPIEGEL] In the party headquarters in Bonn, your comrades were not at all happy with the fact that in the final phase of the election campaign you suddenly issued the catchword "absolute majority." [Schroeder] That is what I heard too. [DER SPIEGEL] They were for red-green not just in Lower Saxony. In the contest for the party chairmanship, you recommended this alliance as a model for Bonn as well. [Schroeder] In the first place: coalitions are always second-best solutions. When a party like the SPD that can gain a majority of its own--and mine was within reach according to the polls--does not formulate this ambitious goal, it gives up a piece of itself. In the second place: at the time of the membership polling, I said that anyone who wants to do something in Bonn must specify a power-transfer alternative to the current coalition. Mine is red-green and I stand by that. The party decided against me and against my strategy. And now it must be done by the one who was chosen by the party. [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping must finally say how he wants to come to power? [Schroeder] I will not give Rudolf Scharping any public advice on his strategy to come to power. I was annoyed by recommendations and by the statement from the federal business manager Guenter Verheugen that it was dumb of me to strive for the absolute majority. [DER SPIEGEL] If you had failed to reach your election goal, the chancellor candidate would also have suffered. [Schroeder] One cannot abandon an achievable goal out of fear of failure. The trouble with politics is that very few are still willing to take a risk. [DER SPIEGEL] When Johannes Rau propagated his "own majority" in 1986, you were among the critics of his strategy. [Schroeder] The election goal must be achievable and it must remain realistic. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider it realistic that the SPD wants to postpone the question of a coalition in Bonn until after the election? [Schroeder] Whether that can be done depends on at least two preconditions. The first is the discipline of the party leadership, which must not force a debate on the chairman. And the second is whether people like you, that is, the media, will permit such a strategy. I cannot judge either one. [DER SPIEGEL] But you are familiar with both circles. [Schroeder] I have read that three Bundestag representatives have publicly advised Rudolf Scharping to bet on red-green. It would have been better for these honorable people to have done this internally. But once a member of the party leadership starts such a debate, Rudolf Scharping would have a problem. I do not want to give him one. [DER SPIEGEL] What has now changed about your assessment of a red-green coalition? [Schroeder] For me personnaly only one thing has changed, namely that Rudolf Scharping is party chairman and chancellor candidate and not I. For this reason, he alone has the right to set the strategy publicly. [DER SPIEGEL] The SPD received only 33.5 percent in the 1990 election and gives the impression that it could come to power through its own strength. Is this credible? [Schroeder] Even if you dig through the cellar, you will get nothing from me. It is a matter of the strategic orientation of the candidate and his specific credibility. And if he is not allowed to do what he has conceived, then he cannot fight the way that someone must fight who wants to remove Kohl from his chair. He is literally heavy in his armchair. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not afraid that sometime you might be accused of failing to help Scharping? [Schroeder] That is a theme that is relevant in criminal law but it plays no role in politics. Moreover you are underestimating the strategic mental capacity and the intelligence of the party chairman if you think that he himself would not do what is necessary at the right time. If it were otherwise, he would not have won against me. [DER SPIEGEL] In Lower Saxony, you began as a reform government with the Greens four years ago. Is red-green at all attractive at the national level if they are really just seeking crisis management there? [Schroeder] It is a mistake to believe that crisis management per se must have nothing to do with reform policy. Crisis management relates, after all, to the overcoming of the economic crisis. And besides the conventional instruments there are always those that go farther. We in Lower Saxony never forgot the ecological dimension in large projects of industrial policy--I admit that from time to time I personnally had to put them through against the Greens. It is still that way in the new SPD government as well. [DER SPIEGEL] You reject the speed limit that was originally included in the first SPD draft for a government program. That will certainly not be interpreted in your favor as an ecological accomplishment. [Schroeder] That is right. But for me reform policy does not mean that one constantly drives old horses through the arena. I am against a general speed limit. Where a speed limit is necessary, we do that in Lower Saxony as well. Besides, Scharping sees that the same as I do. [DER SPIEGEL] You also oppose a further increase in the mineral oil tax? [Scharping] If driving a car in this country becomes something that only the upper half or even the upper third of the income pyramid can afford, then something is wrong. Certainly the mineral oil tax has an ecological dimension but it also has a social dimension. In an extensive land, one can never organize the local public transportation of passengers so well that the worker in eastern Friesland who drives 80 km or more to Volkswagen in Emden can get along without his car. This consideration of the broad strata of the working population in plants and management has brought about our election success--naturally along with the first-class national policies of the SPD.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...that wants to increase the mineral oil tax. [Schroeder] It was increased by just 16 pfennig. We cannot go any higher. Besides the mineral oil tax, the contributions for health insurance and for retirement have also increased, the value-added tax has been raised, the municipal taxes and rents are rising, and we are imposing a supplementary levy instead of the social surcharge. How can the people bear it? And then we come along and tell them that our reform policies are adding something to that. That cannot go well. [DER SPIEGEL] It was relatively simple for you to push for jobs in the election campaign: you left the ecological part to the Greens. Is such a double strategy also suitable for the election campaign for power in Bonn? [Schroeder] I am not giving any recommendations for Scharping's strategy in this respect. The SPD must not forget the ecological dimension. I know that is difficult. Once in power, the SPD itself must come up with a rational concept for coordinating economy and ecology. [DER SPIEGEL] What benefit can the opposition leaders in the Bundestag or the chancellor candidate derive from the successful formula of the Lower Saxon minister-president? [Schroeder] This is the reason why it is sensible for an acting minister-president to be chancellor candidate. He can show competence and a capacity to act at the land level for a sector of politics. He will say: now I want to do on a large scale what I have already done on a small scale. He has the task of taking the ideas from the laender and putting them into effect credibly as our concept at the national level and to expand it beyond himself and Lafontaine. [DER SPIEGEL] You are a public symbol of a successful red-green policy. In reality, you achieved your election victory with a policy that could have come from a trade union chairman in Lower Saxony. [Schroeder] You are right as far as industrial policy is concerned but you are wrong with respect to ecology. [DER SPIEGEL] The Greens have taken care of that. [Schroeder] We had our part in it too. Nothing could have been done against us. But it is quite clear that the Greens have had a major role in setting the ecological questions. [DER SPIEGEL] The conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE writes that Lower Saxony red-green has "truly lost all of its terror." Nevertheless Chancellor Kohl is continuing to foment fear of this combination. [Schroeder] He will fail, because, in the first place, Rudolf Scharping and the SPD--we are once again in the midst of a coalition debate--will not let themselves be tied to this coalition.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...because they will not follow you.... [Schroeder] ...and second, because this question does not frighten anyone anymore. [DER SPIEGEL] The radical resolutions of the Greens on withdrawal from NATO, the Bundeswehr, and nuclear energy ought to suit the plans of the chancellor candidate: in this way, the Greens graze on the left fringe and the SPD can become indignant and take some votes away from the Union. After 16 October, the votes will be counted together. [Schroeder] I do not want to put myself in Scharping's role out of respect for the party chairman's prerogative to make decisions. [DER SPIEGEL] You are not otherwise averse to mental games. [Schroeder] That is true but this mental game is especially dangerous, not so much for me as for Rudolf Scharping and the SPD. If it were dangerous for me, it would have an appeal, even a different appeal than just to think about it. But one cannot deal with these matters so tactically. All of these games can arise out of a certain situation but it cannot be planned. [DER SPIEGEL] The second red-green alliance in the country, in Hesse, is approaching an early end. [Schroeder] I believe that especially in a red-green coalition, as in no other, the SPD must make it clear how it stands for work and male and female employees. Secondly, it must be clear who is leading: Who is the dog and who is the tail? And the SPD must not want to be greener than the Greens in important parts of the land party. The fascination will then come by itself. [DER SPIEGEL] You won the election with economic policy themes. Are you resigned to the fact that the economy and finances are being determined only by axis powers Scharping and Lafontaine? [Schroeder] That is the result of the party's decision last summer. [DER SPIEGEL] Will you remain silent if your leaders Scharping and Lafontaine say that between the so-called key planks--no tax increase and no additional debts--there is no place for aid to the aircraft industry, but there probably is room for coal subsidies? [Schroeder] No, by no means. Then the danger of losing the election with such policies would be too great. Imagine that we refuse to subsidize the shipyards for high-tech products and support hard coal with 11 billion annually--that would be a strange economic program. [DER SPIEGEL] The axis must not harm your terrain. [Schroeder] It will not make any decisions that are obviously irrational. But you did select a nice example. [DER SPIEGEL] No one believes that you have already fulfilled your political life goals in Hannover. [Schroeder] I know those who would prefer to have me with the United Nations. [DER SPIEGEL] How much longer will you be satisifed with Lower Saxony Land? [Schroeder] I know a soccer coach who is still uncommonly successful, Franz Beckenbauer from Bavaria Munich. He always says: "Let us take a look and we will see." [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, we thank you for this conversation.
