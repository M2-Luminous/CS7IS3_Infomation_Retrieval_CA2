Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's destruction of its chemical weapons. Peslyak begins by recapping Russia's international commitment to destroy its chemical weapons and to discontinue their production. He reports on the debate on this topic in the State Duma on 24 March. The main problem was storage of the weapons until they could be destroyed. The video shows the Duma being addressed by Major General Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense troops of the Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand that we cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves. Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have. That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast." Peslyak says that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, identified by caption, who says: "The means of eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be decided upon. The sites where the destruction of the chemical weapons is to take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see from the hearing, the settling of these matters with local authorities and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running into considerable difficulties." Peslyak points out that a factory in Chapayevsk equipped with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it could be used for destroying chemical weapons. Video shows the exterior and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped in plastic sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, he says; it is difficult to know just how much toxic material there is to be destroyed, saying there could be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 tonnes."
