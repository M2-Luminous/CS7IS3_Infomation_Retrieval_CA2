"According to what I know of the investigations, Klaus Steimetz has a watertight alibi for the time of the deed," Zuber told the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag on Friday [22 April]. The attack in spring 1993 caused material damage of about 130 million marks. Concerning reports about the discovery of traces of explosives in the car of the liaison man, who became known in connection with the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen in June 1993, Zuber said that, according to experts, the substance is also used in other compounds. If only very small amounts are available, one can hardly distinguish between traces of explosives and traces of pharmaceuticals. Stienmetz put the authorities on the track of suspected Red Army Faction terrorists Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, who were caught during the failed police operation in Bad Kleinen. Grams was killed during the action.
