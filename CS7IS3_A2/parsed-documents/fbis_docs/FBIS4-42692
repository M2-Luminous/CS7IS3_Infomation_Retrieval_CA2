His audience of government officials, academics and industry representatives murmured assent, but could have spent hours disagreeing with each other over what the statement meant. It might have been possible to thrash out an agreed definition of "Achilles heel"; "social policy" would have presented greater difficulties. Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union [EU] social policy has traditionally been dominated by employment-related issues. Alongside these, however, a clutch of policies concerned with the poor -- or, in the EU's preferred term, the "socially excluded" -- has grown in significance. Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe for initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU involvement in this area of social policy is about to collapse. Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is currently sifting through hundreds of responses to a green paper on options for the future of social policy, before presenting final proposals to the Commission in a white paper next month. The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the dangers of excluding large sections of Europe's population from a reasonable share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug abuse, racism, political extremism and social unrest were, it said, all likely to result. Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a background of high unemployment, job creation would "dominate the whole agenda" arising from his white paper. He emphasised his opposition to the emergence of a "dual society" of advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to attack long-term unemployment. With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at between 50 million and 70 million, antipoverty organisations regard the idea of relying on labour market policies alone to tackle "social exclusion" as wishful thinking. The green paper itself concedes that a return to full employment is "unlikely in the foreseeable future" without significant policy changes. Europe created 9 million jobs between 1985 and 1991 but unemployment fell by only 3 million. The European Antipoverty Network, which represents voluntary organisations in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of rules requiring poverty and its social consequences to be taken into account in all EU policies, in the way that environmental factors are considered. But campaigners' fears that their efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs that the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under threat. Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual states, the EU supports experimental projects aimed at changing the lives of the poor. Poverty 3, its current five-year programme, ends this month, and last year Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be followed by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to ECUllO million (85m pounds). But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the Federal Government and laender over responsibility for running antipoverty programmes, has blocked the introduction of the initiative. Behind the dispute are wider reservations, shared by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the appropriateness of EU involvement in this area of social policy. Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- without success. Unless there is an unexpected breakthrough at a meeting of social affairs ministers on June 22, there is little chance of the programme being launched during the six-month German EU presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams that worked on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the uncertainty, this could mark the end of the programme. The resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to doubts about the future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with the elderly. Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss of the programmes -- budgets have never been big enough to relieve much poverty. But Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for former prisoners in Italy, itinerant families in Ireland, narcotics addicts in Greece single parents in Bristol. A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it had led to work which would not otherwise have been done, relieving poverty and starting to "rebuild the economic and social lives of some severely deprived communities." Although the invigoration of local economies was beyond the capacity of small projects, the committee said it was "impressed by the determination and ingenuity" shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in creating limited numbers of new jobs. The local government centre at Warwick University, which has co-ordinated and monitored the UK projects included under the Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a series of small but significant practical achievements. They include a scheme to train black people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a new childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool city council's policies to encourage the employment of local labour. But supporters say the programme's most significant contribution has been its direct involvement of needy and deprived people in efforts to rebuild their communities. The encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag flying over little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much as the money. Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust, says Poverty 3 has provided a local test bed for national urban aid policies. Warwick University researchers say it has enabled people to "participate in the process of change, rather than becoming resentful objects of it." Europe's antipoverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons such initiatives, the dangers of that resentment being expressed in the dark forms described in its green paper will come at least a little closer.
