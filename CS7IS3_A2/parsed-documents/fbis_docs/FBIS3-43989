Yesterday, the Ivorian authorities and an IMF delegation, which arrived 10 days ago, "positively" completed a first series of discussions on the letter of intention by which Cote d'Ivoire has called on the IMF to benefit from its resources, he stated. "This first and very important stage, which has been passed, augurs well for the next ones," the IMF representative stated, adding that the letter of intention would be conveyed to Washington for "consideration and approval" by the fund management. The IMF delegation, composed of five members and led by Christian Francois, senior adviser at the Africa Department, is expected to continue "in the days ahead" the negotiations with the Abidjan authorities on a "global document" taking stock of the country's economic situation and prospects. This document will be examined by the IMF management "in the weeks ahead," Mr. Dessart continued. Neither the commitments made by the Ivorian authorities nor the amount of the resources requested were made public.
