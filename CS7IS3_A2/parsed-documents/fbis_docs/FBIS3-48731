The joint Korea-Canada Economic Committee, in its second meeting, Wednesday and Thursday discussed ways to cooperate in several economic groupings, including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Son Chun-yong, assistant foreign minister for economic affairs, headed the Korean committee members, and Howard Balloch, assistant deputy minister for Asia and Pacific in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, led the Canadian side. The Canadians said they will actively study ways to extend the period of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for Korea. They also said that the reduction of tariffs for Korean-made automobile parts decided early this month was not temporary and Canada will deal with anti-dumping regulations on some Korean goods fairly. Balloch expressed an interest in the opening of Korea's agricultural market and said that Canada will actively study Korean demands, including exemption of short-stay visas and shortening the period for issuing visas to resident businessmen. Son explained the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations, plans for implementation of the results, the opening of Korea's financial market and efforts to improve the environment for foreign investment before asking for increased Canadian investment in Korea. The next committee meeting will be in Canada in the first quarter of 1995.
