After a busy morning by the negotiating sides, observers and UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, this afternoon the government and UNITA delegations met unexpectedly. Our correspondent Alves Antonio reports: [Begin Antonio recording] Everything happened unexpectedly. Although the press knows nothing concrete, it is presumed that the government and UNITA negotiating teams to the Lusaka peace talks have reached an agreement on issues relating to specific principles and ways of implementing the presidential elections. As the public knows, the general principles on this point were approved and signed on 15 April. However, there are still strong differences on specific principles. Today's tete-a-tete is by itself a positive sign, since by late this morning the UNITA delegation was still intransigent and irresolute on its early positions in view of the document presented by mediator Blondin Beye. Should an agreement be reached on this issue, a plenary session will be held to approve the aforementioned document, otherwise the mediators will try to approach the government and UNITA negotiating teams as they have been doing. Afterward it will just be a matter of concluding the document on national reconciliation, as well as reaching an agreement on ways to implement the approved principles which include delicate issues, such as the status of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
