In the letter they are asking whether UNPROFOR is going to do anything to prevent Muslim infantry units, currently being moved from Sarajevo, from taking part in the offensive against the Croat areas in central Bosnia. The Muslim infantry is no longer needed in Sarajevo and they are already moving into central Bosnia, with the aim of occupying Croat areas, the letter says.
