FR940324-1-00031 FR940324-1-00009 40 CFR Parts 85 and 600 [FRL&hyph;4854&hyph;7] Air Pollution Control: Amendments To Regulations Governing the Importation of Nonconforming Vehicles AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to amend 40 CFR part 85, subpart P to permit the importation of certain motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines from Canada without obtaining a certificate of conformity from EPA. Such vehicles will be allowed entry into the United States provided a commercial importer proves they are identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle certified for sale in the United States. EPA is proposing this change because it believes that many vehicles produced by manufacturers for sale in Canada are identical to their United States certified counterparts. In addition to the changes in subpart P which affect commercial importers of vehicles produced for the Canadian market, this proposal also addresses other issues relating to the importation of nonconforming vehicles. EPA is proposing to: Formalize a longstanding EPA policy regarding the importation of individually owned vehicles that are proven to be identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle certified for sale in the United States, establish new emission standards applicable to imported nonconforming vehicles, clarify the regulatory language at 40 CFR part 85, subparts P and R, which concern the exclusion or exemption of motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines from meeting Federal emission requirements, and provide several minor clarifications to the existing regulations. EPA is proposing that implementation of these regulations take place 30 days after publication of the final rule. This preamble is abbreviated from a larger supplementary document which expands upon the issues discussed here and which may be found in the Docket No. A&hyph;89&hyph;20 described below. DATES: If requested, EPA will conduct a public hearing on this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on April 25, 1994. The hearing will convene at 10:00 a.m. and will adjourn at such time as necessary to complete the testimony. Written comments on this notice will be accepted for 30 days following the hearing, until May 23, 1994. Any party desiring to present oral testimony for the record at the public hearing, instead of, or in addition to, written comments, must notify EPA by 5:00 p.m. EST on April 8, 1994. If no party informs EPA that it wishes to testify, no hearing will be held and EPA will address only written submissions. ADDRESSES: The hearing, if requested, will take place at the EPA Education Center, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Any person wishing to attend should call the EPA contact person listed below to determine if the hearing will be held. Materials relevant to this rulemaking are contained in the EPA Air Docket LE&hyph;131, Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;89&hyph;20, located at the Air Docket Section, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Room M&hyph;1500, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 telephone (202) 260&hyph;7548.
