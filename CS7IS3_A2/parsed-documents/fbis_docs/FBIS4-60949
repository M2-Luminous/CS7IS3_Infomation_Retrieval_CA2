According to it, "Moscow representatives who hold the key posts in Moldova seriously injured our national interests and undermined Moldova's independence and unity" with this new agreement between Chisinau and Tiraspol. The April 28th declaration implies official recognition of the "Dniester Moldovan Republic" which is considered synonymous with Moldova. The declaration says that the presence of the CSCE mission at this meeting mars the prestige of this international organization and makes "it an advocate of Russian imperial policy." The FPCDM "considers that the deal on April 28th aims at annulling the national unified state and jeopardizes the nation's fundamental right to self-determination," concludes the declaration.
