Yet the territory has reason to be thankful Mr Clinton was prepared to brave the domestic fall-out from his U-turn for the sake of the larger economic and geostrategic advantages of continued "engagement" with China. The President said there were 150,000 American jobs at stake supporting trade with China. Hong Kong's far smaller economy stood to lose at least 75,000 jobs -- the rough equivalent in U.S. terms to putting two million out of work and an immediate loss of earnings equivalent to more than four per cent of its Gross Domestic Product. In the longer term, there would have been some reinvestment in manufacturing here, as industrialists pulled out of China, but the overall picture would have been even bleaker. Hong Kong's economic lifeblood comes from its role as a trade, services and finance hub for China. Remove that role, and it loses its engine of growth and prosperity and the importance to the industrialised world that has kept it in the international eye for so long. Realistically, the separation of trade and human rights which MFN renewal represents means Hong Kong could hope for little material support from the West if future Chinese rule proved oppressive. Yet revocation of MFN would have set Hong Kong on the way to economic and political irrelevance. If that happened, support from the U.S. would be equally limited. But if Hong Kong has something to be thankful for, many will also join human rights campaigners in expressing scepticism at Mr Clinton's commitment to using engagement to lay the basis for what he called "long-term sustainable progress in human rights and ... the advancement of (America's) other interests with China". The programme he spelled out -- maintaining the post-Tiananmen sanctions; banning the import of guns and munitions from China; increasing Radio Free Asia [as published] and Voice of America broadcasts; and boosting support for non-governmental human rights bodies -- falls far short of the comprehensive diplomatic engagement he promised. He made no mention of a human rights commission, whether bilateral or unilateral, to monitor Chinese abuses and bring them to the attention of the authorities. He was vague about the kind of dialogue with Beijing leaders that would be effective in boosting human rights. It would be sensible to wait before announcing such measures to consult China and to try to involve it in working out the detail, rather than engaging in counter-productive megaphone diplomacy. But Mr Clinton cannot expect to continue indefinitely without a discernible programme of engagement on human rights issues. Separating human rights and MFN should not mean abandoning all commitment to bolstering human liberties under what remains a repressive regime.
