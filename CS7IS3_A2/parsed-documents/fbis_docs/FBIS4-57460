This statement was made by the Andean Center for Popular Action (CAAP) in the course of an investigation that brings us closer to an understanding of the scope of this worrisome phenomenon. According to the CAAP, "commissions" absorb about 6.9 percent of the state budget -- almost 7 percent -- and the regulation process has reached a point at which "both those involved and careful observers know exactly what amount or what percentage of `commission' must be paid out or received by a bureaucrat for any given type of procedure." At the same time, there are "bureaucratic rings" -- veritable bribe approval-payment-acceptance chains -- without which the system could not function. The CAAP says it is interesting to note that as of December 1993, there were in the nation's prisons only 42 inmates convicted of crimes against the public administration and 38 convicted for embezzlement. But corruption is not found among government employees alone. The percentages of taxes evaded by private businesses are also "regulated." As the CAAP sees it, the impoverishment of broad sectors of the population of Ecuador is expressed and can be measured by three new parameters. They are crime (which we analyzed yesterday), corruption, and the growing lack of respect for human rights. The challenge involves finding a way to combat corruption on both the public and private levels. On the initiative of the vice president of the Republic, the government has contracted for the services of a business called "International Honesty," with a view to the launching of a plan to combat corruption. However, whenever an effort is made to resolve a structural crisis by means of a morality campaign, limitations appear, according to analysts who deal with the dramatic subject of corruption in Ecuador. Can the monetary sum being absorbed by corruption in our country be calculated? The CAAP has decided that it can. It has, therefore, using the incipient institutionalization of this phenomenon seen in recent decades as a basis, made a study of the magnitude of the sums involved in corruption on the public and private levels. Starting with the clear "rules of the game" governing the processes of corruption today, the CAAP study considered the state budget figures for 1993. The expenditure categories were used to measure the corruption in the state apparatus, while the income categories made it possible to calculate the extent of corruption on the private level. Government Corruption According to the CAAP study, 6.9 percent of the general budget of the Republic "drains" through the hands of unscrupulous bureaucrats within the state institutional apparatus and/or the private sector. In order to reach this figure, the investigators established first of all what would be called a "useful base for corruption" made up of the various expenditure categories (salaries, services, supplies, etc.) in the codified budget, which was taken to be the total volume vulnerable to corruption. Secondly, the national average for the "commissions" absorbed by government employees and officials out of the national budget, by category and ministry, was determined. According to the CAAP, three conclusions can be derived from the above. - The simple average of the commissions that must be paid to the bureaucracy for various purposes, or in other words the "diversion rate," is estimated to amount to about 15 percent of the budget. - Where the commission percentages by expenditure category are concerned, that for "services" proved to be the largest (33 centavos for every sucre of expenditure vulnerable to diversion), followed by "supplies" (20.6 percent), "construction" (16.2 percent), purchases of "goods and chattels" (15.5 percent), "purchases of furnishings" (13.3 percent), "transfers" (9.8 percent), "remuneration" (one percent), and public debt (2.3 percent, for the foreign debt). - Provisionally, the ministries believed to have the highest average commission rates are Education and Agriculture, with averages exceeding 18 percent. Once these aspects have been reviewed, it is possible to calculate the amounts diverted to the personal accounts of a myriad of bureaucrats. To this end, the amount in each expenditure category is multiplied by the "commission rate," and by the percentage that in practice is vulnerable to diversion. By means of this procedure, the investigators came to the conclusion that 291.3368 billion sucres (about $155 million) were drained off in this way from the expenditures originally planned and approved in 1993. In relative terms, this amount is equivalent to 6.9 percent of the total budget, and to 1.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1993. "Up to the present, obviously, public corruption has taken into account only the monies incorporated in the state budget proper. Thus the sums derived from the private sector that go to fill bureaucrats' pockets have not been included. It is, as yet, impossible to make a quantitative determination of this total, since it involves commissions ranging from payments to a policeman in order to avoid a fine, through the corruption of judges, all the way up to Christmas gifts," the CAAP investigators have explained. The Private Sector Although it is generally believed that the greater part of the existing corruption is to be found in the public sector in our Latin American countries, there is no doubt that this practice, and immorality in general, play a major role in the private sector of our economies. The CAAP investigation in this sector was limited to the issue of tax evasion, and the figures provided by high-ranking government officials themselves (in public statements) were used. The researchers began with the tax income collected throughout 1993, and this was compared with the income that would have been collected by the government had this mass tax evasion not occurred. According to the CAAP, if the values that were not taken into account, but which can be estimated roughly, were added in the course of this operation, the result would be an approximate total for corruption equal to 9.5 percent of the GDP, including the estimates that were not realized.
