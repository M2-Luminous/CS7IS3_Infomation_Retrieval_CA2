A Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman considers this agreement to be important and a new qualitative phase on the road to a just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East issue, which takes into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their sovereignty, and their right to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. The Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman adds that Algeria, which renews its complete solidarity with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, is of the view that the peace process in the region necessarily requires the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
