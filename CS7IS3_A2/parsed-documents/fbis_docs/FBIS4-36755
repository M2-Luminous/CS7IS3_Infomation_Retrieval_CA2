Thus, the number of suspects from the so- called al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [the Islamic group] has risen to 145 terrorists, who represent the basic echelon from which terrorists are assigned tasks in assassinations and explosions in greater Cairo and the Upper Egypt governorates. The State Security Detective Agency conducted a series of significant security operations, storming terrorist hideouts in the governorates over the past days. This group, whose members had participated in numerous terrorist attacks, primarily the assassination of the secretary of the State Security Detective Agency, Major General Ra'uf Khayrat, was tracked down in complete secrecy. All the suspects were arrested alive and the security authorities obtained important confessions from them on the circumstances of the crime and the monitoring and financing operations for which terrorist Tal'at Hammam and many of his partners, both in and outside the country, were responsible. At the hideouts they raided in the governorates, which number more than 20, the authorities found automatic rifles, pistols, explosive charges, and other equipment, plus many organizational documents indicating foreign funding sources and the organization's planned targets. About half a million pounds and $80,000 were seized in the operation.
