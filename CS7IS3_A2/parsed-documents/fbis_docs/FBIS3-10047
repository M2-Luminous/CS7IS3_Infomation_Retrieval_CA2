"Charro" and "Northiel" will be fought in spite of the efforts by Jose Angel Talavera, alias Commander "Chacal," to gather the troops of these two rebel chieftains and demobilize them together with the 3-80 Northern Front. The EPS confirmed yesterday that "Charro" and "Northiel" refused to attend a meeting between the government and the 3-80 Northern Front in Caulatu, Quilali, where both parties signed an agreement that will bring peace in northern Nicaragua. Charro's troops two days ago attacked the town of Mulukuku, where the police had to flee when they could not fight them. According to police sources, there were only five law enforcement officers in this town. Mulukuku was attacked a second time by the recontras under the command of "Aguila Negra," "Arandu," and "Alacran," all of them subordinates of "Charro." In the first attack in February 1993, three policemen were murdered. According to journalist Aurora Leyton Morales -- our correspondent in Matagalpa -- the 19-year old Daniel Ochoa Castro was killed in this attack when the rearmed men tried to kidnap him. The following persons who had demobilized from the Nicaraguan Resistance received bullet wounds: Rosario Suarez Guido, 24; Miguel Angel Fernandez, 30; Justo Ortiz, 27; and Gregorio Sanchez, 44. Charro's troops also looted some shops, bars, and restaurants. "The peace agreement exclusively protects the 3-80 Northern Front. "Charro" and "Northiel" do not belong to that group; they form part of another organization that has mixed political and criminal connotations, Lt. Col. Wheelock pointed out. "Nonetheless, the political banners being waged by `Charro' and `Northiel' are disregarded because they refuse to demobilize. They will be fought by the Army, just like it fights criminal bands," Wheelock emphasized. Wheelock also referred the agreements signed yesterday in Caulatu. After making a summary of the same, he reported that the EPS yesterday sent food for 400 men, and that the Health Ministry sent a medical brigade to treat the wounded from the 3-80 Northern Front. That is all part of the agreements signed yesterday at Caulatu. He added that the EPS, CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS], and the rebel group will keep in contact and will coordinate actions to prevent any incidents in the future, and that "when we have to enter the enclave, they will be informed first." He confirmed that the 3-80 Northern Front will demobilize in three stages, beginning on 2 March when 100 men disarm. The second stage will begin on 16 March, when 50 percent of those remaining will demobilize, while on 8 April, the rest of the fighters and the Council of Commanders of the 3-80 Northern Front led by "Chacal" will rejoin civilian life.
