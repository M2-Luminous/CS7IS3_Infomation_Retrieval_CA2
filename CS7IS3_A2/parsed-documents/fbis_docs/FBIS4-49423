The National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Committee today submitted its draft decision on punishing copyright infringements to the Seventh Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee for examination. At the request of the meeting of the NPC Standing Committee chairman and vice chairmen, Gu Angran, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Committee, explained the draft decision at the session today. Gu Angran said: Ever since the Copyright Law was drawn up in 1990, it has played an important role in protecting authors' copyrights and their copyright-related interests, in promoting the development of socialist culture and science, and in promoting socialist ethics and material progress. However, certain lawless elements, in order to reap huge profits, have acted rampantly in pirating books, audio and videocassette tapes, and computer software. Their piracy not only has seriously infringed on the rights and interests of the authors and copyright holders but also has upset the normal order of the market of socialist culture and economic activities and has disturbed the development of the nation's economic relations and trade, as well as cultural and scientific exchange and cooperation with other countries. Such serious copyright infringements must be punished as a crime. GATT also demands that domestic laws must have provisions for punishing infringements of intellectual property rights. Gu Angran said: Under this draft law, the following serious copyright infringements are considered as crimes: First, they fall under any one of the following copyright infringements for purposes of making profits, and the amounts of unlawful income are quite substantial, or the case is serious in some other respects: 1) reproducing the copyright holders' works without their permission; 2) publishing others' copyrighted books; and 3) reproducing audio and video products without their producers' permission. Second, marketing apparently pirated products mentioned above for purposes of making profits, and the amounts of unlawful incomes are quite substantial. This includes exporting or importing and marketing apparently pirated products mentioned above, and the amounts of unlawful incomes are quite substantial. As for penalties for copyright infringements, Gu Angran said: Because copyright infringements are primarily for unlawful economic interests, the infringers, in addition to being deprived of their personal freedom, must also be harshly penalized economically. Based on Chinese law's penalty for the infringement of industrial property rights as well as foreign countries' criminal sanctions against copyright infringements, the draft decision provides that infringers shall be sentenced to prison for up to five years, criminal detention, and/or fines according to the amounts of their unlawful incomes or the seriousness of their cases. The draft decision also provides that all the pirated products, unlawful incomes, materials, tools, equipment, and other assets used by units or individuals for copyright infringements shall be confiscated. If a unit has been found guilty, the unit shall be fined and its administrators and other personnel directly responsible for the crime shall be punished according to the aforementioned regulations.
