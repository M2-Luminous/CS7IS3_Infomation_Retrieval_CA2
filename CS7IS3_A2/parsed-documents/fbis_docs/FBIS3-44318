The bill sets out the new corporation's powers and the controls which the government will exercise over it. Its purpose is to reconstitute the provisional airport authority as a permanent government-owned entity known as Airport Corp. Hong Kong has decided to gazette the bill despite failing to reach agreement with China on funding arrangements for the 21 billion dollar project. A Chinese spokesman for the Joint Liaison Group, which handles transitional issues with Britain, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that experts will study the draft bill for up to two months before commenting on its contents. "It (the white bill) is not a big problem," the spokesman said. "The British side had already made the bill available to us." "Publication of this white bill is an important step forward in the process of preparing for the new airport at Chek Lap Kok," said Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu, in a written statement. The aim of Airport Corp. is to balance commercial viability with necessary government controls to protect the public interest, Siu said. "This is a delicate balance to strike between commercial freedom and accountability to government," he said. The bill's public consultation period will run until February 28. The new company will be loosely modeled on Mass Transit Railway Corp. which operates Hong Kong's domestic railway.
