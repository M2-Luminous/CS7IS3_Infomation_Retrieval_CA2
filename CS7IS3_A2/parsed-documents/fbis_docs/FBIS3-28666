The 10-day exercises, directed jointly by Japanese and U.S. military officials, involved some 3,400 Japanese and 3,200 U.S. participants, the USFJ reported in a news release. Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council of the Self-Defense Forces, said the exercises gave the commanders a "comprehensive assessment of the ground, navy, air, joint and combined operations." In addition to operational capability, the exercise also "enables us to develop the very comprehensive and capable logistics and support functions we will need to win the war," Nishimoto said. USFJ Commander Lt. Gen. Richard Myers said the simulator "proved its ability to realistically test procedures and logistics support for simulated air, land, and sea operations, and in doing so, increased the training value of the exercise for both the U.S. and Japanese participants." "This exercise was a great test of the U.S. and Japanese military staffs' ability to conduct crisis action planning and to practice commanding and controlling the simulated movement of equipment and forces," said Myers. "I am absolutely confident both staffs are now able to do a better job of defending Japan should the need ever arise," he said.
