['Urayqat] Actually, what halted the negotiations was Rabin's government. The Palestinian side was willing to continue the talks, despite the deep differences, but the Israeli Government decided to stop them last week. Now they have decided to resume negotiations, and we hope that the aim of these negotiations will not be merely for the sake of negotiating. In other words, we hope that the resumption of talks will not be an aim in itself. [Al-Miliji] The Palestinian and Israeli sides must have agreed on common points on which the talks can begin. ['Urayqat] The differences are not linked to specific details of the crossings issue or other topics. Instead, the issue is related to the concepts involved. Israel's concept, as was apparent when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was in Cairo and met President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], is that Rabin is trying to reorganize the occupation through the Declaration of Principles, even though the accord stipulates the implementation of Resolution 242, which means ending the occupation. This is where the problem is. As we noticed, the Declaration of Principles stipulates Israeli-Palestinian coordination of the crossings. It mentions the Jericho area, not Jericho City, and stipulates a withdrawal. But, as we notice, the Israeli Government is trying to say that they should have full control over the crossings and roads and so forth. Such issues delayed the negotiations from the start and led to the failure to implement the accord on the scheduled date, 13 December. We hope that the Israeli Government is now ready to enter negotiations on ways to implement the withdrawal. [words indistinct] the accord to succeed are two elements. The first is that the accord combines both the transitional and final phases with regard to the withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip and redeployment in other areas. The second is that President Abu- 'Ammar has declared that he is committed to the accord's provisions. Therefore, we hope the Israeli Government will adhere to the letter and spirit of accord so that we may be able to implement its provisions on the ground. [Al-Miliji] Have the two sides agreed only on the resumption of the talks, or have they agreed on a groundwork from which negotiations can be launched? ['Urayqat] I believe it is premature to say that an agreement has been reached before the start of the talks. The return to the negotiating table is a positive measure--because we need to implement the accord on the ground--but it is too early to say whether there has been an agreement prior to the talks. I would rule out such an agreement. [Al-Miliji] No doubt efforts have been exerted by parties other than the Palestinians and Israelis to resume the Palestinian autonomy talks. Will you talk about these parties? ['Urayqat] Actually, there were no other parties. In our recent meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, we asked for their assistance. He said they would not intervene. The only party that threw its weight behind the resumption of the talks is Egypt. As we noticed, Egyptian diplomacy did everything it could to resume these talks. When he visited Jordan, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa--contrary to Rabin's talk about an earlier agreement in Cairo--said there was no agreement, there were proposals. I believe that the resumption of talks next week shows the success of Egyptian diplomacy in this regard. [Al-Miliji] The Israeli side claimed that a memorandum of understanding was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli sides at the recent talks in Cairo. Does this mean that there should be a third party at any Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? ['Urayqat] I believe that the presence of a third party is very important and fundamental at this stage. As we noticed, the Israeli side claimed there was an agreement, but 'Amr Musa's denial of this agreement decided the issue before the world. Rabin thought the world would believe him and not the Palestinian side, but Musa put an end to the issue. There are sponsors of this process--the first being the United States and the second being Russia. Russia is preoccupied with many of its own problems, and the U.S. side is not intervening at all. The only side now intervening as a third party is Egypt. As Palestinians, we believe that Egypt is our partner in the peace process, not an intermediary. Egypt's efforts enabled these negotiations to continue, despite numerous Israeli obstacles. [Al-Miliji] With the talks on the implementation of self-rule due to resume Monday [10 January], what is the Palestinian side looking for? ['Urayqat] We are looking for a [word indistinct] and genuine implementation of the accord. The accord literally stipulates a withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip. Withdrawal means withdrawal. Regarding other areas, the accord stipulates the Israeli forces' withdrawal from populated areas and a redeployment of the forces. As for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, the accord stipulated a withdrawal. The Palestinian side is looking forward to the sincere beginning of the Israeli withdrawal in accordance with the Declaration of Principles.
