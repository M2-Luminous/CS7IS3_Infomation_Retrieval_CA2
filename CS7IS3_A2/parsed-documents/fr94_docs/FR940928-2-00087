FR940928-2-00087 FR940928-2-00066 Public Workshop To Exchange Information and Lessons Learned in Site Characterization for Decommissioning of Radioactively Contaminated Sites AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of public workshop. SUMMARY: This notice is to inform the public of a workshop to exchange information and review lessons learned in the characterization of radioactively contaminated decommissioning sites. The workshop will discuss the NRC draft guidance on site characterization for decommissioning and address generic issues related to NRC's decommissioning sites, such as characterization of sites and associated environmental media, types and extent of contamination, and environmental impacts. DATES AND LOCATION: The workshop will be held on November 29&hyph;30, 1994. The first day sessions of the workshop will begin at 8:30 a.m. and continue until 5:30 p.m. The sessions will be held in the main auditorium located at the NRC Headquarters Building, Two White Flint North (TWFN), 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;2738, telephone (301) 415&hyph;5811. It should be noted that parking at the TWFN building is very limited. The second day sessions will begin at 8:30 a.m. and continue until 5 p.m. These sessions will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 1750 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852 (1 mile north of TWFN). For a reservation at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, call the toll free number 1&hyph;800&hyph;638&hyph;5963. Rooms have been reserved at a special group rate (Group GLB) at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza and will be held until November 8, 1994. Background In 1990 the NRC developed the Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP) to identify and resolve issues associated with the timely remediation of radiologically contaminated sites. In April 1992 the NRC developed an ``Action Plan'' (57 FR 13389) to ensure timely remediation of SDMP sites. In the action plan, NRC staff identified inadequate site characterization as one of the technical issues that has delayed the timely approval and implementation of site-specific decommissioning actions. The main objectives of the site characterization for decommissioning include: •To quantify the physical and chemical characteristics of radiological contamination and to assess the extent of contaminant distribution including the rate(s) of migration. •To quantify environmental parameters that significantly affect potential human exposure from existing and potential future radiological contamination under unrestricted use conditions.
