Approved by the bloc's heads of state and government, it is now its official policy. But the program is not only of interest and importance to NATO. It speaks of the basis on which the NATO countries' new relations with those known in the West as the "newly independent states" -- the countries of East Europe and the former Soviet republics -- will be built. The "partnership" idea has already been discussed for six months, but had thus far lacked any "content" -- but the specific proposed actions and avenues for cooperation are turning a slogan into a program of action and, in this instance, cooperation. The picture has now been clarified to a certain extent. From the time it was announced as a slogan for future partnership between the NATO countries and their former enemies in East Europe and the USSR, the central question worrying the world public has been the possibility of quantitative growth and the expansion of the NATO alliance and its expansion as a military-political bloc. There have been stormy debates in the European and trans-Atlantic capitals on the pluses and minuses of such prospects. This problem has also been actively discussed in Russia. We can assume that it was no secret that Washington did not immediately reveal the nature of its proposals. It cannot be ruled out that the U.S. leadership was launching a trial balloon, wanting to see the reaction both from its allies and from its future "partners" to its plans, to hear the political thunder and lightning about the program (which did indeed occur) beforehand and take account of them in President Clinton's official report, and only then to firmly state that membership of the NATO bloc is not the starting point for the plans to build partnership but the ultimate goal. As U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin noted, participation in "Partnership for Peace" will not be a clear run [propusk] into NATO. It would be more correct to see it as a certain trial period, during which current NATO allies will have to be convinced of the new partners' reliability, and the latter will have to demonstrate the sincerity and practicality of their aspirations by their actions (the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have already stated their aspirations officially, and other East European states are also prepared to do so). NATO members intend to organize concrete cooperation with each of the applicant states individually. Although the overall framework has already been generally defined. This will take the form of mutual consultations on military problems, the training of military cadres, the embracing of NATO approaches and standards in planning and organizing combat training measures for troops and staffs, and the holding of joint command-staff and field training exercises. "Partnership for Peace" assumes that states seriously aiming to join the West will be given the status of so-called associate members. This has not been completely defined, but is seen as something higher than the status of member of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. At the same time, it differs substantially from the position of a full NATO member -- the bloc takes no responsibility for the collective defense of partners' territories, while nonetheless gaining the right for the NATO Joint Armed Forces to assimilate the associate members' infrastructures. Each state's contribution to the overall peacekeeping effort in situations such as the Yugoslav conflict will be taken into consideration. In other words, it is not a question of what NATO can do for the new partners, but of what the latter can do for the bloc. It is clear from President Clinton's Brussels speech that, apart from purely military joint contacts, the partners will also have opportunities to organize cooperation in spheres such as peacekeeping activity, search and rescue operations, humanitarian aid operations, and environmental protection efforts. None of these areas is anything new; the first steps have already been taken in all of them -- some successful, others not very. The alliance's headquarters obviously believes that these operations will be more effective and timely under NATO rather than UN auspices. Despite the NATO (and, particularly, U.S.) leadership's reluctance to accept new members into the bloc in the immediate future, the states east of the former "iron curtain," the situation within them, and their political policy are at the center of attention of Brussels and Washington. As NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner admitted, "it is obvious that the United States cannot prosper amid chaos and conflict, and the United States needs the alliance as a most important tool for exercising American influence and leadership in Europe." Needless to say, an expansion of NATO would also mean an expansion of America's potential in this sphere. The principles on which these ambitions would be realized is another matter. Washington currently admits that it is impossible to allow a few of even the best-prepared states into the bloc -- it would very much smack of the formation of a some kind of new anti-Russian coalition (particularly given the regrettably tense relations between Russia and a number of its former allies). It would also hardly be sensible to let all comers join NATO at one fell swoop -- the sharp growth in numbers without any careful qualitative preparation for such a step would essentially destroy the bloc and make it an unimportant organ similar to the CSCE. The gradual, drawn-out process proposed by Clinton at the NATO Brussels session makes it possible to avoid sharp confrontation -- above all with Moscow -- although it leaves many questions open. One of the most obvious questions, whose dangers we have to face even now, is whether the NATO membership will become a kind of instrument of blackmail. There is a very great temptation (and not everyone is currently capable of resisting it) to use the power of "big brother" -- the role which NATO plays -- to attempt to pressure the Russian leadership. This may be simpler than organizing or, rather, reestablishing a normal working dialogue, but it is hardly any more effective. All the more so at a time when Russia is building a good and constructive relationship with most NATO countries on a bilateral basis and gradually at bloc level. Following the official announcement of the "Partnership for Peace" program and its adoption by the NATO leadership, we can expect efforts to implement it not at a level common to all, but in certain areas. During President Clinton's current tour of the states of East Europe this will undoubtedly be discussed in Prague, Kiev, Minsk, and Moscow. Bill Clinton arrives in the Russian capital 12 January. U.S. sources report that no new "historic initiatives" should be expected -- the top-level talks will focus on perhaps more prosaic but nonetheless extremely important problems. These are U.S. support for the reform processes in Russia, and the steering of that support toward easing the social tension engendered in our country above all by the painfully difficult transformations in the economy. The Russian and American leaders will also examine how successfully the accords on U.S. assistance reached back in Vancouver are being implemented -- whether they are working, where the obstructions are if there are problems, how to accelerate the transition from fine declarations to routine but productive action. In Minsk, Kiev, and Prague the emphasis during talks will be different. And this is logical. The same Americans, in the words of General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and until recently commander in chief of the NATO Allied Armed Forces, clearly see a difference of approach to partnership with Russia and, for example, the Czech Republic, countries with differing potential, different possibilities, and dissimilar starting points. Furthermore, in the last two-three years some areas of cooperation have already been mapped out, and weak points along this path have also emerged. They need to be eliminated on a reciprocal basis. The main point is that Russia is ready for equal partnership for the sake of strengthening security in Europe and throughout the world. And it hopes to be shown the same attitude by our potential allies.
