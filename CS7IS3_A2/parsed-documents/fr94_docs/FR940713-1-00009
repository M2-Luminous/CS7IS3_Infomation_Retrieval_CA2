FR940713-1-00009 FR940713-1-00001 The relative risk of nonconformances would be the same for each poultry class. Because the comparative risk between categories is not known, the new nonconformance categories would be weighted equally (each having a weight factor of one). This change would also eliminate any tendency to correct only those nonconformances with higher weights. Elimination of Feces From the Nonconformance Categories One goal of the FPS program would be to ensure that poultry carcasses are free of feces. To emphasize the Agency's determination to enforce the ``zero tolerance'' for such contamination, feces would no longer be listed among nonconformance categories. Any finding of fecal contamination during an FPS check would require an immediate line speed reduction. On-line processing control by the establishment is necessary to exclude fecal contamination from product ready to enter the chilling system. There are two operations in the slaughtering process where there is a greater chance for carcass contamination. These operations are evisceration and viscera harvest. Under this proposal, FSIS inspectors would be stationed after each of these operations to ensure only non-contaminated carcasses proceed down the line. Elimination of Post-Chill Testing One goal of the proposed FPS reinspection test would be to ensure that the establishment keeps its evisceration process under control with emphasis on preventing fecal contamination from entering the carcass chilling system. All carcasses would be subject to sampling using the proposed FPS test, which includes a modified extraneous material category, prior to entering the chill system; therefore, these defects should not enter the chill system. The current FPS post-chill test focuses on the detection of extraneous material nonconformances too late in the slaughtering and dressing procedure to provide information that could be used to improve evisceration controls. Setting Tolerances at the Same Level for All Poultry Classes It is reasonable to set one tolerance to provide a uniform standard for evaluating all poultry carcasses after slaughter and dressing since ready-to-cook (RTC) requirements and the same nonconformances apply to all poultry classes. Established tolerances for poultry carcasses are already approaching uniformity. The current FPS pre-chill trim nonconformance limits for young chickens and turkeys are already the same. The FPS pre-chill processing and post-chill nonconformance limits for young chickens and young turkeys are almost the same. Ideally, if optimal processing controls were maintained, poultry would be nonconformance-free. Nonconformance-free product may be theoretically achievable but is not likely to be commercially feasible. A reasonable tolerance would allow for the presence of a few accidental nonconformances incidental to the process and, at the same time, define acceptable quality levels. Establishing a new tolerance for all poultry classes along with changes in the testing rules would encourage continual improvement in processing control. Periodic re-evaluation of these limits would be essential to encouraging the trend toward the production of poultry that is free of nonconformances. The current FPS tolerances and action numbers are based on data collected in 1983. The Agency is now offering for comment the modifications of these standards that field inspection experience has shown to be necessary. Even so, the Agency will be especially attentive to comments addressing the proposed FPS standards. Currently, the FPS upper limit of acceptability of a 10-bird test sample is called the subgroup absolute limit. The subgroup absolute limit is defined by the tolerance number plus 5 (T+5). The ``plus 5'' is the expected normal variance in a process under control. In the proposed FPS program, the need for the subgroup absolute limit (T+5) is eliminated by incorporating normal process variability within tolerance. Following the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method, the process variability exceeding tolerance is recorded. The proposed FPS program uses CUSUM to determine when the process is out of control and to identify product requiring rework. Tolerance levels for nonconformances would ensure appropriate corrective actions at the control points. In recent years, a zero CUSUM has been achieved consistently by establishments under the current FPS program_evidence that nonconformance process control has improved. A zero CUSUM over time is not expected. Because of process variation, a certain number of tests are expected to exceed tolerance and cause an increase in the CUSUM. The FPS tolerance numbers for nonconformances were set at such a level that one test in 20 would be expected to exceed the tolerance number plus 5. Under the present FPS program, exceeding the subgroup absolute limit (T+5) is usually the only cause for corrective action or testing. Maintaining a zero CUSUM does not encourage further improvement in process control.
