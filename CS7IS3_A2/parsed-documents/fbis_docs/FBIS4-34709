He said he hopes to conclude negotiations with creditor banks by the end of the year, and has great expectations over the amount by which the debt might be reduced. He explained that commercial banks have taken several provisions to prevent losses in Peru, and that consequently the government hopes to make a good deal. Peru owes international commercial banks approximately $6 billion, 50 percent of which is overdue interest. Camet said Peru should be given favorable treatment on payment of overdue interest. "We will obviously be granted a big discount on capital and interest," he said. The minister noted that the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) should conclude its investigations into the alleged irregularities involving the Mantaro and Pachitea ships in order to expedite negotiations over the foreign debt. Talks with Peruvian creditors have been delayed pending a resolution by the Chemical Bank and American Express, which granted $37 million in credit for buying the ships. Camet explained that the Peruvian Government does not intend to return to the international capital markets soon. "Instead of borrowing to repay our debt, we must arrange to repay it over a long period. Peru has enough reserves for one year of imports. Besides, we must repay our rescheduled debt," he said. The minister attended a conference sponsored in London by the International Herald Tribune and by the Inter-American Development Bank. In his lecture, he said that Peruvian economic reforms are irreversible, and that the result of the presidential elections scheduled for April 1995 will not affect them.
