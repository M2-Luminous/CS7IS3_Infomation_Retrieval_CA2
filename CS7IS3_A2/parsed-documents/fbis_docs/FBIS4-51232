The announcement came following a Tuesday public hearing called by legislator Cheng Chien-jen, in which several Central and South American ambassadors called on the government to encourage more local investment in their countries as the best way to promote bilateral ties. Ambassadors from El Salvador, Paraguay and the Dominican Republic said that although the performance of the Republic of China's [ROC] agricutural and fishery missions stationed in Central and South America have won high praise there, countries in the region need more foreign investment to boost and upgrade their economies. They also advised the ROC to act to counter the diplomatic offensive launched by Mainland China to develop links with those Central and South American countries with which the ROC maintains formal ties. Ministry officials said the government would continue to do its best to stimulate more private-sector investment in the region, particularly in those countries that are friendly to the ROC.
