[Redondo] Good evening. [Announcer] Good evening Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, top leader of the Workers' Commissions. [Gutierrez] Good evening. [Announcer] To use in an orderly manner the time and your live contribution here on Radio Nacional, for which we thank you, I would like to ask you for a brief assessment of what has happened today in Spain. Mr. Redondo?. [Redondo] Well, I believe that the figures speak for themselves, don't they? And what's more, this strike has been visually apparent. We have seen empty roads, we have seen the situation in a perceptible form. The foreign media -- CNN and other media such as those in Britain, Italy, or France -- acknowledge the success of the strike. All the same, it's rather odd how this country has to be different, because [words indistinct] to realize the truth than the foreigners. But having said that, no one doubts the success of the strike -- huge support from [words indistinct] and very considerable support from society. Therefore we are highly satisfied. Millions of people have taken part in this strike and the appropriate conclusions must be drawn from that. [Announcer] Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, is the success of the strike first and foremost? [Gutierrez] That's right, I believe that it is an unquestionable fact. That the immense majority of working men and women and of those who may be workers in the future -- young people, students, or otherwise -- have supported this strike on such a large scale, convinced that it was just, that it was necessary, and also quite determined that this strike should be very beneficial for the country and for the workers. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Mr. Gutierrez, what are the terms of the letter you have sent to [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez asking him for negotiations? [Gutierrez] Well, the truth is that out of basic responsibility and courtesy, we do not wish the exact contents of the letter to be known to the media before he receives it. But, summing it up briefly, what we convey to him is that following the success of this strike, which gives a lesson in democracy and civic conduct and shows up those who have spread alarm about possible violence and all that, we ask him for a meeting so that the government can respond as soon as possible to this demand to change -- by means of negotiations -- labor reforms. Because the stubborn ones are those who, in spite of the proof of this widespread rejection, in spite of the proof of the failure of their economic and social policy, stick to the same line. As Nicolas says we are in no way stubborn. What we do is reflect, reflect positively, on what is happening and offer negotiations. We are not saying that the revealed truth of the trade unions must be accepted here 100 percent. It seems that it is the government that has maintained such a position until now, not us.
