Speaking in the European Parliament, he said: "We cannot block decisions by our partners (in the EC and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)." Pangalos was speaking at a plenary session of the Euro-Parliament on behalf of the current Greek presidency of the E.C., which ends on June 31. Greece has made clear it is opposed to military intervention in Bosnia, including the use of air strikes against Serb positions around Sarajevo. Pangalos reiterated the Greek position, but said Athens would not stand in the way of its partners which are poised to give the green light for air bombing of the Serb positions. The Greek minister said all the countries in the neighbourhood of the Bosnian conflict were against military intervention, except Turkey. He was speaking as NATO ambassadors in Brussels met to decide on an ultimatum to the Serbs, that they cease their siege of Sarajevo and withdraw their artillery from around the Bosnian capital or face NATO air attacks. NATO decisions need unanimous support, which means also the backing of Athens. Greece accepted a decision of E.C. foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday that the EC should use all possible measures, including air attacks, to break the siege of Sarajevo. The Euro-MP's were generally supportive of NATO military action. French Socialist Euro-MP Leon Schwartzenberg said: "If we don't want to act, let us at least give the (Moslem) Bosnians the means to defend themselves." Liberal Dutch Euro-MP Jan Willem Bertens said the arms embargo of former Yugoslavia should be lifted, and the Bosnian Moslems armed to defend themselves, if the Serbs did not accept a cease-fire in two weeks.
