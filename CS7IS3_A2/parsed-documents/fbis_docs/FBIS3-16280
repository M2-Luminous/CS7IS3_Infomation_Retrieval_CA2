Shokhin described some peculiarities of the economic reform in Russia at a press conference following the meeting. Acceptance of "the debts of the former Soviet Union, the burden of Russia's "donorhood" in regard to other CIS member states" make economic transformations in the country peculiar. In this connection, he confirmed that the government intends "to go ahead with reserved financial policies". "On the one hand, the cabinet succeeded in getting the inflation rate down to an all-time low of 9.9 percent, on the other - the slump in production continues to grow, which results in a drop in efficacy of tax extraction as a whole," Shokhin said as he described contradictory nature of the current situation in Russia. According to Shokhin, the government will "find it hard to keep within the planned limits of the budget deficit", unless it takes "extraordinary measures and looks for new sources of income". When working out the draft budget, "several expenditure items should be specified, including national defence expenses", Shokhin said.
