The chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council stated this on 30 May at the news conference when he characterized the present composition of the parliament. "I know that it will not be easy for me, but my election to the post is an optimal variant in the given situation," Oleksandr Moroz pointed out. He said that the Supreme Council intends to prepare a package of radical measures aimed at stabilizing the economy. In his opinion, "Ukraine must, in the near future, resolve the question of currency regulation, remove other money from circulation inside the state, and revise the taxation policy as well as the utilization of credit resources." He also pointed out that "for many people, these measures do not seem to be welcome, but there is no other way out, if we want to overcome the crisis." According to him, the restructuring of the economy "must be started from the military-industrial complex," and also "with an extensive integration with Russia." However, Oleksandr Moroz is categorically opposed to Ukraine's joining the ruble zone. Touching upon the issue of the state's nonnuclear status, Oleksandr Moroz emphasized this: "The compensation for Ukraine for the withdrawal and destruction of nuclear weapons must not be looked upon as alms to a poor orphan, but must be the payment for the well-being of many countries of the world." That is why the chairman of the Supreme Council believes "assistance for Ukraine amounting to several hundred million dollars is humiliating for the state." At the same time, the chairman of the Supreme Council is sure that the signing of the Trilateral Agreement could not be avoided, because "Ukraine is unable to maintain nuclear weapons." "If I had been president, I would have also signed the agreement," said Oleksandr Moroz, "but, perhaps, I would have also made those radical steps that would be more advantageous for Ukraine." Answering the question on Western investments, the Supreme Council chairman said that "Ukraine is ready to accept them, and our reforms will promote the influx of foreign capital." "The essence of the reforms," he pointed out, "will be based upon market relations regulated by the state." "No doubt," continued the head of the parliament, "many investors would like to know whether private ownership of land will be introduced in Ukraine." In his opinion, land must not become a subject of purchase or sale. It will be a crime against the people and the future generations.
