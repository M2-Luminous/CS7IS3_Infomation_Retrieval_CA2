According to the Palestinian sources, who are close to the Cairo talks, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will personally head this authority, which will be announced at a later date. The sources, who wished to remain anonymous, linked the announcement on the formation of this authority to the achievement of fundamental progress that ensures the Palestinians the beginning of the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The Palestinian sources told QUDS PRESS that "Israel's procrastination and its non-adherence to dates on which agreement had been reached forced the Palestinian leadership to postpone the announcement on the national authority's formation." The Palestinian sources refused to provide details on the formation of this body but said that it will comprise 18 members, 11 from the diaspora and seven from the occupied territories. The distribution of the authority's diaspora members will be as follows: Seven from the PLO Executive Committee, two from the Fatah Central Committee, and two independents. The Israeli Government had called on the Palestinian leadership to announce the self-rule authority, but the PLO rejected this demand as premature. The Palestinian sources expressed the belief that the announcement on the formation of the authority might provoke internal conflicts, especially as there is no Palestinian authority inside the occupied territories to impose the law.
