Confusion continues regarding the signing of this agreement. The Vatican denied this information, while the minister of foreign affairs of the provisional government asserts that this agreement had been signed with a Vatican representative, and that the 75 tons of wheat which were promised will arrive in September. Rothschild Francois filed a report: [Begin recording] [Francois] There is still confusion regarding an agreement that was reportedly signed between the Vatican and the Jonassaint government for a supply of wheat to Haiti. After the government in Port-au-Prince announced this information at the beginning of the week, the Vatican authorities formally denied the news on Tuesday [14 June]. The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, asserts that no Haitian political representative was received in the Holy See. In Port-au-Prince, the minister of foreign affairs of the provisional government confirms the signing of this agreement with a Vatican employee. In an exclusive interview with Radio Metropole, Charles David specifies that the 75 tons of wheat, worth U.S. $35 million, would arrive in Port-au-Prince in September. Mr. Minister, did you really sign this agreement? [David] Certainly I signed this agreement. I do not wish to enter a war of denial which seems to nourish subtleties of Vatican diplomacy. I agreed to talk to you. I do not intend to hold a news conference or to send other messages. What I can tell you is that the wheat is coming. For the rest, serious people will get to understand the exact reality of things. [Francois] When is the wheat coming? [David] The wheat will arrive, according to the terms of the agreement, beginning on 30 September 1994. I signed this agreement with a representative of the Vatican state secretariat. That is all I want to say because I do not intend to nourish rumors or gossip, especially since one denial leads to another denial and to counterdenials. In brief, each person takes pleasure in this kind of tactic. One should not forget that this country is in crisis. It is the first time I have spoken. I make it a point to say that. I do not intend to speak often. I have work to do. I do it. [Francois] Regarding the relations between the Vatican and Haiti, it should be noted that on 18 May, apostolic Nuncio Bishop Baldiceri renewed his support for the resigning government of Robert Malval. Questioned on the policy of Judge Jonassaint in diplomatic matters, the minister of Foreign Affairs told us that he maintains some contacts abroad. Charles David explained that he is working for the nation's interests. [David] I am certainly not idle. Right now, it is true, there is the loneliness of the long-distance runner. But at least, let us be serious. You are right to think that contacts were made. I do not have to say it aloud. Let me give you an example. For many years, China was not recognized by the United States, by the big powers. Contacts were made however. In short, things moved forward quietly. What we want to say is that we are trying to build a policy first, to protect the Haitian people from the invasion, the occupation. [Francois] Questioned about the Montreal press' criticism of him, Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles David replied he has accepted this post because of the threats weighing on Haiti and specifies that he is above all, Haitian.
