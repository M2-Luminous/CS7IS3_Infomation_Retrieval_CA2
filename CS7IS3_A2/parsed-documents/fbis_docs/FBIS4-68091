The government has informed the deputies about this in its report on the security situation for 1993. Klaus's cabinet did not register any direct signal last year concerning terrorist activity being prepared against Czech citizens, foreigners, or objects in the republic. Some time ago, however, Stanislav Devaty, head of the Security Information Service, communicated exactly the opposite to the deputies of the left-wing parties in the Chamber. According to the findings of the secret service, terrorist groups were preparing to attack these politicians. Although the government does not expect any direct military or any other external threat to the republic, it does expect terrorist actions here because of the political development in former Yugoslavia. It is particularly because of the constantly deepening conflicts between ethnic groups and religious cultures in Africa, in the Middle and Far East that there are risks that might threaten our security in the future, the report reads. The report also discloses that in 1993 not only did the number of crimes committed increase from 350,000 to 400,000, but the violence of the perpetrators is also growing, and they are more frequently using firearms. The Interior Ministry wants, therefore, to enable citizens who are concerned about their property or can prove to the police that their health or lives are threatened to obtain handguns through a law on arms and ammunition.
