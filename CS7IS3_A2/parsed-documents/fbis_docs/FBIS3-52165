Reporter Amy Rhodes asked Peres for his reaction to the Jordanian press report that King Husayn had threatened to make a separate peace with Israel unless Yasir 'Arafat cooperated with him more closely. [Begin recording] [Peres] I am for having a comprehensive peace with all parties, but I am for arriving at the comprehensive peace on an individual basis, because if we shall try to have comprehensive negotiations, so the ones who are usually late, or reluctant, or hesitant will hold back the negotiations. [Rhodes] Will the Taba talks resume tomorrow? [Peres] I am afraid not. [Rhodes] What is the reason that it will be delayed? [Peres] The talks in Taba need a common basis, need an understanding. The two faxes that we have received on Friday created a sort of a doubt about what is the basis for the talks in Taba. [Rhodes] How do you plan on going about reaching another agreement such as the one that was reached in Cairo but not accepted by the Palestinians? [Peres] To be true to the agreements that we have reached in Oslo and in Cairo and to reject anything that tries to annul it. [end recording]
