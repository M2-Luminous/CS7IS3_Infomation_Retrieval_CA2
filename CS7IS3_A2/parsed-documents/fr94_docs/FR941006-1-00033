FR941006-1-00033 FR941006-1-00008 (7) Section 344.8(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months. Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case, that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that such settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering until the assessment is paid. (8) Section 344.9(b)_The Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program activities in Parkersburg, WV. This section would allow for sending of the notice of redemption by facsimile or by other carriers. The notice must show the account number and the tax identification number of the subscriber. Under this proposed section, the notice must be received at the Bureau of the Public Debt by 1 p.m., Eastern time, one business day prior to the requested redemption date. Subpart D_Special Zero Interest Securities To give investors flexibility in investing certain proceeds that may become subject to yield restrictions, a new special zero interest security was offered for the first time with the 1989 rule. Under the terms of this offering, subscribers are not required to certify that as of the date of investment all the proceeds subject to yield restrictions are being invested in State and Local Government securities. With exceptions, this offering is the same as that for time deposit securities. Proposed changes from the 1989 rule are as follows: (1) Section 344.13_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference to wire as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV, address is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. In addition, the section would allow for sending of the notice for redemption by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must be received no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to provide as much notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. Under this proposed section, notice is to be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption date. Procedural Requirements It has been determined that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, an assessment of anticipated benefits, costs and regulatory alternatives is not required. Although this rule is being issued in proposed form to secure the benefit of public comment, the rule relates to matters of public contract, as well as the borrowing power and fiscal authority of the United States. The notice and public procedures requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) do not apply. The collections of information contained in this regulation have been previously reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget, in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 1535&hyph;0091. The principal purpose of the proposed rule is to change the address of the receiving entity. The revision would not impose a new collection of information requirement.
