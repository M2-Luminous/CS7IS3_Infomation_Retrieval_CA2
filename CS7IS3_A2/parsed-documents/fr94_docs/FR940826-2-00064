FR940826-2-00064 FR940826-2-00052 [Docket No. AB&hyph;362 (Sub-No. 3X)] Texas and Oklahoma R.R. Co._Abandonment Exemption_In Foard and Wilbarger Counties, TX Texas and Oklahoma R.R. Co. (T&O) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon a 16.81 mile portion of its rail line between milepost 480.19 near the Texas-Oklahoma State Line in Wilbarger County, TX, and milepost 497.0 near Chillicothe, TX, in Foard County, TX. 1 1 The line segment sought to be abandoned here is included in the 156.49-mile rail line which was proposed for abandonment in Texas and Oklahoma R.R. Company_Abandonment Exemption_Between The Oklahoma-Texas State Line And Orient Junction (Sweetwater), Texas , Docket No. AB&hyph;362 (Sub-No. 2X), (ICC served Mar. 25, 1994). That request was denied because the Commission was unable to reach a majority. T&O's petition for reconsideration in that proceeding is pending before the Commission. T&O has certified that: (1) no local or overhead traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (3) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 2 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 2 The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis has allowed T&O to meet the foregoing requirements based on the environmental and historic report submitted in the Docket No. AB&hyph;362 (Sub-No. 2X) because the conditions relating to the line segment involved here have not changed since the previous report was submitted. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen , 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on September 25, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 3 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 4 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 5 must be filed by September 6, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by September 15, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 3 A stay will be routinely issued by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines , 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 4 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist. , 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 5 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representatives: Richard H. Streeter, Barnes & Thornburg, 1815 H Street, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . T&O has filed an environmental report in Docket No. AB&hyph;362 (Sub-No. 2X) which addresses the effects of the abandonment, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue a revised environmental assessment (EA) by August 31, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: August 22, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Anne K. Quinlan, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21098 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
