The mayor of Jerusalem believes that 'Arafat would not be coming to pray, but to make declarations. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that Olmert made these remarks in a special meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Mr. Rabin summoned the meeting following complaints about a lack of communication between him and the mayor. The two men agreed to go on meeting in the future to promote various issues, including the development of the city. In a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier today, Rabin said that the government was looking for every possible way to expand the Jewish population of Jerusalem. However, Rabin noted, it is difficult to locate land and the government is awaiting the High Court of Justice ruling on the issue. Meanwhile, Jerusalem Municipality sources told our correspondent that they have been holding legal deliberations with regard to illegally built houses in East Jerusalem and their possible demolition. The sources noted that two such houses in East Jerusalem, over which legal proceedings were completed, were demolished in the last two days.
