Today for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, this celebration is threefold. First, the number of subscribers to our newspaper has increased by a factor of 12 and its print run has hit 600,000. This makes ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI one of the country's most popular publications, and puts it among the top five Russian newspapers. Second, you see before you the first 16-page issue -- the next stage in the development of our newspaper, which is constantly expanding its topics and volume. Third, this is one of the first issues of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in its capacity as a publication independent of the organs of power. We needed three years to acquire freedom. We consistently upheld the idea that the press in a democratic state cannot be a "tool" of government, but that it must be an instrument of society's monitoring of all branches of power. Our move is not a strategic maneuver, nor is it an attempt to stand in opposition to the government, which has enough opponents today without that. On the contrary, we will fairly and thoroughly report the government's efforts to reform the national economy, promptly inform readers of the essence of the decisions being adopted by it, and publish the most important decrees and commentaries on them. We want to help our readers to evaluate government actions correctly. Once again we stress: The topic of power, the topic of the formation of the Russian state will remain paramount in our newspaper. We deem our most important task to be to provide information about the processes under way in society, and to expose political "machinations," and the mechanism for adopting decisions. Other of our readers' diverse interests will be satisfied by the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI sections which are offered in this issue. DELO and DENGI are addressed to entrepreneurs. PROMYSHLENNAYA GAZETA is aimed at producers. VEKHI is a newspaper for the independent intelligentsia. RETSEPT is a supplement for those interested in health. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is an important source of information for workers in the system of executive power, jurists, and economists. Our KURYER and DOKUMENTY sections are aimed at this group of readers, promptly publishing edicts and directives from the president, government decrees, and normative acts by ministries and departments, which come into force only after publication in our newspaper. The new year poses a difficult task for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI -- to live up to its name, to become a newspaper reporting extensively on the life of the regions, the Russian heartland. To this end, our correspondent network in the localities is constantly growing. As of now ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI already has 18 own correspondents within the country, and one abroad. The number of correspondent offices is set to increase further. We will strive to ensure that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reaches readers in good time, and without delays. To this end, we are printing it not only in Moscow, but also in 16 other cities around the country. We will try to maintain a reasonable price for our newspaper. To this end, the editorial office is expanding its commercial activity, increasing the volume of advertisements published. The reader's opinion is pivotal in the newspaper. We are therefore publishing a page of readers' leaders in this issue: lively, "undiluted" letters. Permanent dialogue with readers is one of our immutable creative principles. Analytical centers, in which the country's leading scientists are working, are being set up under the editorial office and a powerful information service is being formed. We have already concluded a contract with REUTER, the world's leading news agency, from which we will obtain news and photographs. It is planned to set up a fitness center under the editorial office, where leading Russian doctors, the authors of our RETSEPT section, will be able to give you a consultation. We will only be able to implement all these plans with your support, dear readers. It is with a hope for this support and mutual understanding that we are beginning our dialogue in the new year.
