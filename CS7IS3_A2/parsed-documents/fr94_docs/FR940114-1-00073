ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend the Department's regulations on direct grant programs and State-administered programs to clarify the requirements and procedures for establishing and applying indirect cost rates under programs administered by the Department. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Sherlyn Taylor, Grants and Contracts Service, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 3636, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4700. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Glenn Riley, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 3636, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4700. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;7640. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: To improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures and requirements of the Department, the Secretary is proposing to revise sections in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. A number of problems in this area of grants administration will be addressed by the proposed changes. For example, the use of a restricted indirect cost rate for programs with supplement-not-supplant language in their authorizing statutes is required by current regulations. However, State education agencies have incurred significant financial liabilities by using incorrect restricted indirect cost rates. The proposed changes clarify how these rates are calculated and so will reduce the likelihood of those errors recurring. In addition, the term ``occupancy and space maintenance costs'' as used in the computation of restricted indirect cost rates has not been clearly defined, resulting in grant recipients being reimbursed improperly for space costs. The inclusion of a definition in these proposed regulations will address this problem.
