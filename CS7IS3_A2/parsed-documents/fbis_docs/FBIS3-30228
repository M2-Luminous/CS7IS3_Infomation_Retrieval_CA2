[Begin Bobetko recording] The issue of Croatia's involvement or noninvolvement [in the fighting in Bosnia] is an issue which has always been absolutely politicized because the basic fact, or the strongest argument, has been completely forgotten, and all humanitarian and civilizational norms have been ignored. Thousands and thousands of Croats born in Bosnia and living here in Croatia not only looked on [at what was going on in Bosnia], but also lost either their entire family or some members of their family in most beastly ways. They saw their fathers gone missing, relatives who are no longer there, sisters who are wondering around those Bosnian ravines -- and the question which is raised now is: who has got the right to forbid me or any Croat from Bosnia, to defend his (?own). Who can do that? Which institution? It is sad that organizations which have concrete insight in every detail of what is going on can still be perturbed by a statement by a Silajdzic because Croatia is present and it does not allow the genocide over the Croatian people. If that was [true], and it is in fact invented, the world, today, in the 21st century, [as heard] should ask itself: What are we doing, gentlemen, when in 21st century [as heard] Europe we have allowed such atrocities and such a war?
