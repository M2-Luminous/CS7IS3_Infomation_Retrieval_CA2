What is the government doing about it? [Rabin] We launched consultations on the Jerusalem situation two or three weeks ago, even before the public storm broke out. Organizations providing the Palestinian residents of the territories with services have been established over the years; some of them are fully justified. These include the Supreme Islamic Council, which is responsible for Temple Mount, a sacred site frequented by Palestinians from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. This council has been in charge of religious services since 1967. There is the al-Maqasid Hospital, which has existed under different governments for many years, and which serves residents in and outside East Jerusalem. There are institutions in other fields devoid of any political significance. We intend to explore the situation. As Israeli law applies to united Jerusalem, we may be forced to initiate special legislation to avert any PLO attempt to set up bodies of governing nature in Jerusalem. The PLO pledged that all Palestinian Authority bodies would be in Jericho during the interim period. We will insist on it even if special legislation is needed to ensure it. [Einstein] What about Orient House activities? [Rabin] If Mr. Faysal al-Husayni wants to be member of the Palestinian Authority, he will have to reside in Jericho. If he wishes to remain in Jerusalem, he will have to waive membership in the Palestinian Authority. [Einstein] Does this mean we are going to close Orient House? [Rabin] We will check the legal aspects. In fact, the attorney general has been doing it for about two weeks. A discussion on the issue was held in my office and a similar discussion was held at the Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs. The discussions dealt with moves we should take to ensure that the agreement is adhered to and that all the governing authorities and their institutions be situated in Jericho, and not in Jerusalem during the interim period. [Einstein] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.
