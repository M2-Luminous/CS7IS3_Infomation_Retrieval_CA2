Chief of Cordiplan [Office of Coordination and Planning] Enzo del Bufalo made this statement yesterday, when he was asked if the increase in yield that this financial paper had experienced during the last auction conducted at the BCV did not contradict the administration's strategy for stabilizing the economy. One of the results produced by the most recent sale of zero-coupon bonds was an increase in their yield by slightly more than 2 percent, which caused an increase in the ceiling of the cost of money to 72.13 percent. Del Bufalo said that it would not be possible to correct this problem until the financial crisis is resolved. When asked whether the BCV's actions are aimed at preventing capital flight, he recalled that an increase in interest rates also serves to "direct savings toward the domestic market." Referring to the controversial Tax on Bank Debts (IDB), he said that, with or without the Value Added Tax (IVA), the IDB would go forward, even though it had been proposed only "to deal with the emergency." He also stated that the tax reform presented by the administration to the National Congress could generate more revenue than it was estimated IVA would produce. Nevertheless, he made clear that "even so, a gap would remain" in the budget, and because of this the IDB had been proposed. It is "an instrument that is essential in order to reduce the deficit to less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)." The head of national planning also said that within a couple of months, he will present what will be the long-term strategy of President Caldera's government. He stressed that growth without inflation would be among the basic principles of the plan, the Ninth National Plan, as it was in the eighth plan, The Great Turning. "But this growth must be maintained by productive investment and not by spending by the state." Del Bufalo's statements came after his participation in the forum, State Intervention vs. Free Economy, organized by the Venezuelan Institute of Finances. In his presentation, the chief of Cordiplan said that in Venezuela, tax payments represent less than two percent of GNP [gross national product], in sharp contrast to the fact that in a "normal country" taxes generally exceed 10 percent of GNP. He said that an economic policy "of doubtful efficacy" had been tried in the country, and that it had been politically nonviable. The previous government, he said, thought that an open economy and market mechanisms would be sufficient to overcome this model. "It was a conceptual and empirical error to leave the functioning of the economy to market dynamics, and that has been our basic discrepancy with that administration." There had been no long-term planning, and it is the state that must produce the appropriate economic policy to create a market that does not yet exist. He said that the alternative to be followed must become a reality with the cooperation of the private sector, "which is responsible for financing part of the increase in costs with its earnings." "The state must resolve the structural problem that is causing inflation, but while the fiscal deficit is a problem of the state, it is also true that it is a responsibility of business, because business does not pay taxes." In addition, he maintained that although he does not believe the maxi-devaluation is feasible, "this dark horizon will become more probable, if the Congress does not do its duty."
