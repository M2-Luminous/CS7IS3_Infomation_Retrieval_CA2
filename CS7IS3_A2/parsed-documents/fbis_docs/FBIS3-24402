It is well understood by everyone that this is a delicate issue and requires a special approach. But the most important point, which has been mentioned both here in Russia and over there in the West, is that this greatly needed interaction between the special services of different states requires a certain level of trust and, if you wish, sincerity, although it is hard to speak of the latter as applied to special service operations. Whatever--the interaction between Russian foreign intelligence and analogous structures in the West and the East over the past year has acquired real form. From searching for ways toward understanding we have progressed to exchanging information and developing promising problems that concern the entire world today. True, observers in the United States, Europe, and Russia could not help noticing that CIA Director James Woolsey has been increasingly often displaying greater activity in making public statements. And, what is especially remarkable, his statements have, as a rule, recently involved his agency's work in Russia, with whose foreign intelligence the CIA has begun to establish direct contacts and undertake interaction. On the List of Priorities Actually, the enlightened reader will say, what is so strange about the chief of American intelligence supporting the continuation of work in a country that only recently was the main target of its intelligence penetration? What attracts one's attention is the peremptory tone of these statements. Speaking at hearings in the U.S. Congress special Senate Intelligence Committee, the CIA director said at the beginning of February this year (even before the arrest of high-ranking CIA official Aldrich Ames, suspected of working for the KGB and later for the FIS), that the United States has "four extensive areas" in Russia where American intelligence is active. First, the CIA "supplies the politicians (of the United States) with important, and sometimes unique... analytical materials containing warning of potential dangers Russia is encountering." Second, U.S. intelligence "continues to track the deployment and status of about 27,000 of Russian nuclear warheads." The third "Russian" line of its work remains "monitoring the state of Russian Federation general-purpose armed forces." And, finally, the fourth is "analysis of Russia's policy with respect to its neighbors." "The future of Russia, Ukraine, and other states of the former USSR, as well as potential problems that may arise there, are on the list of priority tasks of American intelligence activities," he said at the end of February, speaking at hearings at the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The changing political climate in Moscow, Russian policy with respect to the new independent states, and Russia's growing concern regarding the West's goals in East Europe and the CIS continue to be the subjects of the CIA's attention, Woolsey emphasized. ...That Is What Intelligence Is About As we can see, the range of American intelligence interests is quite broad and its intent to conduct active operations with respect to Russia is beyond doubt, despite the developing cooperation between the two countries. In this connection it would be proper to note that Moscow never hyped a situation in which an American intelligence officer was suddenly apprehended, or a Russian citizen actively working for American special services was caught red-handed. That is what intelligence is about, knowledgeable people say--learning other countries' secrets, analyzing them, and reporting observations to the government. There are, however, some differences in the activities of the two special services: While Russian intelligence in the case of the Ameses, according to American sources, was interested in CIA operations in the Soviet Union (and later Russia), as Woolsey's statements demonstrate, American intelligence is interested in "high politics." The latter, as a sophisticated leader understands, is conducted in the Kremlin offices, and a limited number of people have access to it. Is it worthwhile under such circumstances to raise such a clamor, as some American Congressmen and CIA top officials did, on the subject of detaining a CIA officer who shared secrets with foreign intelligence? If we approach this soberly, calmly, from the standpoint of developing partnership relations--hardly. Double Bookkeeping Perhaps we should have put a period at this point, had it not been for one piece of news, which came practically simultaneously from faraway Australia, where local newspapers, as though on command, raised the subject of Russian intelligence activities. The topic--several Russian diplomats who had left the country back in the middle and second part of last year. In response to the inquiry of a liberal party representative in parliament, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Evans Gareth especially emphasized that the de facto expulsion had not been made public because Australia did not wish to aggravate relations with Russia. Interestingly, the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper, quoting informed sources, reported that information on Russian intelligence officers working in Australia had been received by Australian special services at the end of 1992-beginning of 1993... from the American CIA. (Note: During this period the CIA and the FIS were moving toward searching for areas of interaction!) Also, the CIA, together with British intelligence (which, by the way, also began talking about partnership relations with the FIS at the time), insisted that the activities of aforementioned persons were energetic and dangerous to Australian security and that insufficiently decisive actions with respect to Russian representatives on the part of Australian special services allegedly compromised these organizations. Today, after the arrest in the United States of CIA officer Aldrich Ames, American-British pressure apparently was brought to bear all the way up. Gentlemen's agreements, which had previously been lauded in England and the United States, were forgotten this time. Learn To Be Peaceful Rivals The campaign of unmasking Russian intelligence agents is gathering speed, and it is clear that its organizers have little concern for the development of interstate relations, which may to a certain extent be jeopardized, or the development of partnership ties, which are just beginning to produce the first results along lines important for many countries, including the United States. Political salvos have already had a negative impact on the economic sphere of U.S.-Russian relations. The mass media have already reported numerous times on the blunt statements of some American Congressmen, who believe it necessary to immediately suspend appropriations of any money whatsoever to support the program of reforms in Russia. Now we are getting the first reactions from experts and direct capital holders. It should be noted that they reflect a much more realistic approach to the problem. "The effect of the Ames affair should be short-lived," the REUTER agency quotes Aleksis Rodzyanko, managing director of the Chemical Bank--the largest in the United States. Neither do representatives of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Johnson & Johnson foresee any problems for their companies. But this, it should be noted in parentheses, mainly goes for companies already actively doing business in Russia, who have invested serious capital in the country and have established themselves in the market. The spy scandal per se will undoubtedly die down; however, the reverberations of the noise raised around it will long serve as an irritant, causing excessive caution among investors--especially those who are just contemplating investing their capital in Russia. Thus, they are in a way being pushed in the direction of thinking that with all the attractiveness of the Russian market, there exist numerous others--East European, Asian, or Latin American--where investment can bring no less profit to American companies, and without fear of being "accused of collaborationism." At this point, as a counterbalance, I want to quote the remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at hearings on the federal budget for the 1995 fiscal year at the subcommittee for operations abroad of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. The United States "must be a realist" in conducting policy with respect to Russia, he said, expressing the administration's opinion. As American-Russian relations develop, disagreements are inevitable, believes W. Christopher, and in this case the United States must act on the basis of its national interests. Recalling some Congressmen's calls for cutting or suspending aid to Russia entirely in connection with the Ames case, he said: "It is not in our interests to be mere spectators watching the course of reforms in Russia." The secretary of state reminded legislators of the words of President Clinton, who considers aid to Russian reform not charity but an investment in American security and prosperity. "Our dollars... will turn into credit guarantees for American exporters and investors," he emphasized. To change the current course toward Russia would mean to damage American interests first and foremost. Realists understand perfectly well that in politics one should not mix two unrelated things. The cold war is a thing of the past, and it is not in our common interests to resurrect it. As the Paris newspaper L'ECHO writes, the "Ames case" will be good for both Russia and the United States if it helps them understand that the end of ideological confrontation between the two grandees does not mean the end of rivalry between them, which is natural for such major powers, and that now they have to learn to compete peacefully.
