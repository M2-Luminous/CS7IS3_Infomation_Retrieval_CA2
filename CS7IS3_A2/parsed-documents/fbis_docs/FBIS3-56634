Opposition Newspapers Suspended"] [Text] According to the People's Front of Azerbaijan (PFA)'s press service, local Internal Affairs Ministry officers in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic have been carrying out mass arrests of PFA activists since 12 January. Yadygar Mamedli, chief of the PFA press service, said that "at 0500 on 12 January officers of the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs Ministry were put on alert and were ordered to search the apartments of the local PFA branch's activists." Within an hour, PFA members D.Gasanov, I.Salakhov, V.Asadov, I.Mamedov, A.Mamedov, and N.Agayev were arrested. A few days later, another two PFA activists were detained in Babek rayon. All the detainees are currently held in custody at the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs Ministry's investigatory confinement block. During Abulfaz Elchibey's stay in power they fought at the Saderak front (in the western sector of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border -- A.S.) as members of a volunteer battalion of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's Internal Affairs Ministry. Following Abulfaz Elchibey's overthrow they all left the battalion and expressed their loyalty to the former president. Your SEGODNYA correspondent was told at the PFA press service that no charges have yet been brought against the detainees. The chief of the PFA press service said in a telephone conversation with a SEGODNYA correspondent that "PFA leaders assess the arrests as political reprisals and see them as preparations for Abulfaz Elchibey's arrest." According to Mamedli, "It cannot be ruled out that following the suit of their Georgian counterparts the Azerbaijani authorities are planning to destroy the former president physically," because the other day Azerbaijani General Prosecutor Ali Omarov said on republican television: "As long as two former presidents -- Ayaz Mutalibov and Abulfaz Elchibey -- exist, the threat of political destabilization in the republic remains." Aside from the arrests, the opposition is threatened with a newspaper ban. In the new year a number of opposition publications, such as MUKHALIFET, DZHUMKHURIET, YENI MUSAVAT, KHURRIYET, ISTIGLYAL, and others, have already been suspended. At present only 20 out of 600 registered newspapers are being published in the republic. While previously officials at the "Azerbaijan" printing house, which was resubordinated to the presidential staff upon Geydar Aliyev's arrival to power, attributed this to a lack of printing equipment, after the newspapermen themselves found everything they needed, the printing house's chiefs refused to sign a contract with opposition newspapers. Opposition leaders say that this runs counter to the republic's Law on Anti-Monopoly Activity, which was passed last year by the Azerbaijani National Assembly.
