The long-announced military intervention by the Western allies to break the 22-month-old blockade of Sarajevo is becoming more and more certain, especially after the massacre in the Sarajevo market, in which 68 people died and over 200 were wounded by a shell's explosion, and after the UN's official request to NATO for authorization for airstrikes in Bosnia, or, more specifically, for bombing the Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo. It seems that the international community's prolonged hesitation and wait-and-see attitude are finally over. The key decision was adopted the day before yesterday in the evening in Brussels at a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO members, with the declaration of the critical date--21 February, one hour after midnight, when NATO planes will bomb artillery sites within a radius of about 20 kilometers around Sarajevo. The ultimatum, formulated as a warning primarily to the Serbian side, refers to the withdrawal of all of the heavy weapons and their placement under UNPROFOR control by a set date and time. Regardless of the announcement of the international community's last argument of persuasion, military intervention, which the world public received in a way with a great deal of relief and support, many unresolved questions nevertheless remain despite everything. Will the air intervention against the Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions around Sarajevo settle the Bosnian conflict? To what extent would such a step by the Western alliance serve to establish the peace that is so much desired in the embattled region, especially after the statements by the leaders of the so-called republic of Srpska that they will defend themselves by all means available? Are there possibilities that after such an action the war might spread beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders? Where is Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in such a possible course of events, and what are the realistic chances that it might also become involved in the conflict? UNPROFOR the First to Suffer According to the chief of the General Staff of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia [ARM], Major General Dragoljub Bocinov, the airstrike by NATO or UN forces against the Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions will complicate the already extremely delicate and complex situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will already nullify even the present limited control over this military hot spot, thus creating broad possibilities for the conflict to spread and for it to be regionalized in southern Europe, with complete destabilization of the Balkans and with their being drawn into a zone of constant conflicts. One of the most essential aspects of the already announced intervention and the possibilities of its escalation into an open conflict between two or more combatants, according to General Bocinov, is the Serbs' attitude toward the UNPROFOR units deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an operational sense, the UN forces have an enclave deployment, which means that they are not linked in a combat line and are in a situation of strategic encirclement. In other words, the chief of the General Staff emphasizes, to a certain extent they are already hostages. According to our interlocutor, an extremely significant element in this context is the attitude of the Western governments which have their own peacekeeping contingents in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In their assessments at any level of the balance of power, human life is the number one factor, and thus saving and protecting the troops in the UN multinational contingent can play the deciding role here. Thus, Bocinov emphasizes, these countries can be expected to decide to withdraw their forces, which in the first place is almost impossible in the present conditions, and in the second place, even then the conflicts will increase in intensity, ferocity, and uncontrollability. This position coincides with the view of retired Major General Todor Atanasovski, namely the possibility that the UN may decide to abandon the battlefield and continue political and economic pressure, leaving the combatants to themselves. The only logic of this goal, according to General Atanasovski, is to maintain the conflict within the present limits. Many problems arise in this case, however, as he emphasizes. In the first place, whether the world can accept such an inhuman step with a clear conscience, and whether it is even possible for the UN forces to be withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina at such a juncture. One has to bear in mind that their main goal at present is to protect humanitarian convoys, which in a way are the last crumb of hope for numerous unfortunates in Bosnia. With the possible withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces, in addition to the loss of any control and any sort of influence and mediation among the combatants, UNPROFOR may become their common enemy, and be attacked on all sides. This is the most difficult alternative to implement, Atanasovski emphasizes, although the governments of the countries that have their own contingents in Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming more and more nervous about the fate of their troops, and some of them, like France recently, have already announced the possibility of withdrawing them. Will the Bosnian Cauldron Overflow? As an area that objectively gravitates toward the unsettled region and in a way is located in the critical zone, Macedonia is directly affected by the Bosnian military outcome. As Slobodan Dimiskovski, a doctor of military sciences and an expert on this problem, emphasizes, the FRY's attitude toward military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs is a significant aspect of a speculative situation thus formulated. One can assert with a considerable degree of certainty, Dimiskovski says, that the FRY would become involved in supporting, i.e., in the actions and operations of, the army of the so-called republic of Srpska. The general situation would thereby become more complicated not only in the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in a much broader area, including even the entire Balkans, and within them Macedonia as well. Retired Lt. General Mitre Arsovski, the former chief of the ARM's General Staff, has an almost identical view of things; in his opinion, the most natural thing is to expect direct intervention by the Republic of Serbia and its involvement in the conflict. General Arsovski emphasizes that this directly raises the possibility of an expansion of combat operations into the FRY as well, which, by the way, also borders on the Republic of Macedonia. In his opinion, a second significant element in assessing the possible course of events after air attacks against the Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the fact that fighter-bombers will fly from the aircraft carriers in the Adriatic and from the NATO bases in Italy. And what will happen, Arsovski asks, if the bases in Greece are used, even if the latter country still opposes it? In his opinion, if this possibility is realized, which is fairly likely in a given course of events, then by yielding its air space for overflight by American aircraft Macedonia would indirectly be joining one side, in all of this development of the conflict assumed so far. This is essentially the worst alternative for the country's security, since in one speculative situation thus formulated the reality would be a response by Serbia using the so-called retaliatory strategy, at first against the U.S. troops on the Macedonian-Serbian border and then in a later phase against the Republic of Macedonia, thus creating a hot spot with unforeseeable consequences for the entire Balkans, or for the security of Europe in general. The situation can also be complicated in another way. According to General Bocinov's estimates, the Bosnian barrel can overflow at the moment when Izetbegovic's Bosnian army sees its own chance in the escalation of the entire conflict, and it will very likely also be joined by the Muslims in Sandzak and Montenegro. Bocinov says that this, at the same time, will also be an extraordinary opportunity for the Albanians from Kosovo, and then from Western Macedonia, who in a situation in which there would be military pressure and the expulsion of the Serbs from their positions in Bosnia, to join in the conflict. In effect, the chief of the ARM's General Staff emphasizes, this would mean the beginning of a hellish cauldron in which everyone would be against everyone. Will the Americans Attack? The model for the outcome of the Bosnian conflict that is now being applied did not arise as a well-considered military system but rather arose step-by-step and was carried out partially, gradually, and in a palliative manner, General Atanasovski thinks. In his opinion, that lack of coordination is also reflected on the formal level--from resolutions, through conferences, to one more partial measure, namely the threat of air attacks against the Serbian positions. Obviously, Atanasovski emphasizes, the results of the latest initiative will be the same as the ones to date, i.e., this maximalization of the pressure indicates the counterproductive nature of the entire action. Instead of ending the war, it will lead to an even greater intensification of combat operations. The only model for resolving the Bosnian war, according to Atanasovski, should start with noting that the status of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina has already passed the level at which it is not important who is the aggressor and who is the victim. That former definition, Atanasovski claims, no longer makes any sense. "I agree and I accept the fact that the Serbs are the cause of the war," he says, "but the future operation will have to disarm all the armed sides in the Bosnian region, regardless of which side they belong to. That means their forcible immobilization and forced isolation in the entire war hot spot, and furthermore for a long period." According to Atanasovski, this is the only good solution for the Bosnian conflict. On the other hand, as Dr. Dimiskovski emphasizes, it is unlikely that the airstrikes will even be carried out, regardless of all the seriousness of the NATO ultimatum. There were decrees in the past and they were almost always counterproductive, and thus Karadzic also said in response to the last warning that the Serbs would defend themselves by all means available. A similar attitude is also displayed by General Mitre Arsovski, according to whom airstrikes by NATO forces against the Serbian positions in Bosnia will not be carried out, and at the moment they serve to intimidate and exert psychological pressure and coercion for new negotiations. "I personally think," he says, "that by using air power alone one cannot resolve the situation on the front in Bosnia, and if it is used, it will be more demonstrative in nature." In any case, regardless of whether these are empty threats or a warning that will be carried out at any cost, the fact is that a new, and perhaps the most serious trial for peace in the entire region to date is in sight. Everything else is entering an area of great uncertainty. [Box, p 16] Dragoljub Bocinov, Major General and Chief of the ARM General Staff: "NATO Cannot Repeat `Desert Storm'" For the time being the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the brink between war and peace. It is balancing between these two options, since it is already clear that there cannot be a middle solution. At the moment, the most problematic is the answer to the question of whether Serbian wants peace and a peaceful settlement of the war, since if it is achieved there will be serious internal upheavals, and even its destabilization. Imagine what would happen if 200,000-300,000 armed soldiers returned to the FRY, which has already been devastated by the international sanctions. In other words, it is an extremely likely assumption that ending the war does not suit Serbia at all. On the other hand, it is more than clear that NATO or the United States cannot implement in Bosnia-Herzegovina or repeat the model of the ground-air-sea battle of January 1991 from the "Desert Storm" operation, since at the moment they do not have a ground base organized. Without ground forces, territory cannot be conquered and the war cannot be resolved. [Box, p 16] Slobodan Dimiskovski, Doctor of Military Sciences: "The Most Horrible War in All Human History" Hypothetically, in my opinion at least two options are possible for a Bosnian settlement. The first would be concrete implementation of the Karadjordjevo agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, i.e., combined Serbian-Croatian forces would definitively defeat the Muslim army. This would achieve the main strategic goal--preventing, at any cost, the formation of an Islamic state in the Balkans, and creating a Greater Serbia and Croatia within their historical borders. The second option is based on the assumption that the UN, the EU, and NATO will not succeed in using negotiations, political means, and even airstrikes to settle the Bosnian crisis, and then it is likely that the UNPROFOR units will be withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fate of the three hostile ethnic groups would thus essentially be left to their leaders and armies. That would constitute a horror in comparison with all wars in the course of all human history.
