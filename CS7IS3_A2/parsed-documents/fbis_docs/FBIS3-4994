North Korea, which now elects four-year term delegates in accordance with the statute [section 134] prescribed in its constitution following the election of provincial (and directly administered city) people's assembly delegates in November of 1989, published lists of voters in every election district for the (district election committee) all over the nation on 6 November and has carried out its agitation campaign for "100 percent participation, 100 percent `yes' vote," mobilizing the government operated broadcast media, every level of organization cadre and students/agitators. On 5 November, a Pyongyang broadcast pointed out that this election was taking place "in a strained situation in which there were constant schemes to destroy the our-style socialistic sytem," and emplasized, "We must demonstrate that our unfailing unified force around the Party and the President will never be broken by any scheme of any enemy," relating the election to the international pressure on North Korea for its nuclear inspection issue. Meanwhile, KCNA (8 November) was intensifying its drumbeat calling for the reception of the election "with combativeness to bring about the shining achievement of increased coal production" and was urging to commence the battle to accelerate the all-out march for the our-style socialist system. North Korea has presented a detailed description of its regime's election rules such as "general," "equal," "direct," and "secret," stated in its constitution (article 6) through Pyongyang radio in a news commentary titled "Most People-Oriented Election System Implemented in Northern Half of Peoples Republic" immediately after the announcement of delegate election. The First Rule of Election Is "Generality" North Korea maintains that all citizens, 17 years of age or older, have the rights to vote and to run as a candidate for an election regardless of their gender, national origin, occupation, length of residency, levels of income and education, political party affiliation, political opinions and religion (Article 66 of the constitution), and the working mass do participate in an election on unlimited basis. As the result, it further maintains, yesteryear's farmhands, odd laborers and women, who make up one-half of the entire population, are being elected to various levels of elective offices of the regime. Artificial Rules of "Equality" for Meaningless "Election" However, we can surmise that this rule of "equality" is nothing more than a statutory clause in the constitution and has no special meaning in practice of real operations. Because, in practice, the freedom to vote and to run for an election is not guaranteed for all "citizens." In case of the gender issue, it is true that historically about 26 percent, in average, of the total delegates elected for local people's assemblies were women. However, this is nothing but a result of the acceptable safe distribution ratio carefully designed artificially based on Workers Party of Korea (WPK) policies not only of women but of various sectors and levels. We can describe this rule of "generality" as a systemic mechanism to carry out efficiently the "unilateral control" by bringing in various sectors and levels of the "citizens" into WPK one-party dominated political activities, with their individual freedom of expression effectively restricted, and mobilize them into puppet plays. The second rule, "equality" of election, is to maintain that fairness and honesty are assured for election. This is due to the idea that the "generality" rule, which enable all of the working mass to participate in an election, by itself, could not guarantee the perfect equality. The core of the "equality" rule is that no voter would have any "special preferential right" and everyone has one vote, election districts are based on an equal number of population and each district elects one delegate. North Korea's election is a process for one delegate from each election district with a population of 30,000, which is the unit basis for the electoral division of the country. We do not consider North Korea's election, which is an uncontested election without a multiple candidacy, which is artificially blocked, an election of "equality" that assures "honest reflection" of the will of its "citizens," as North Korea claims. This is because the election is meaningless as far as the will of the electors is concerned for the election not only restrict the freedom of candidacy but any candidate once nominated would certainly be elected as if "winning by default" because electors do not have the choice of electing one among several candidates. Political Mobilization To Rationalize Hereditary System North Korea describes its one-delegate-for-one-district election system as "having significance in that each delegate of a comparable level people's assembly represents equal number of population and , thus, all electoral votes have an equal weight." But this is no justification for eliminating a competitive election with multiple candidates, and the election is nothing but a systemic device to have particular persons elected, ignoring the principles of free democratic election which prescribe the fundamental rule of majority decision. The undemocratic nature practiced by North Korea in its election system is displayed clearly further in selection process of candidates and voting mechanism. North Korea maintains that candidates for delegate positions are nominated and selected through free debates and expression at a "respective resident general meeting" or "work site member general meeting." However, a candidate selected at a "resident general meeting" in reality neither has the origin nor a resident of the district involved. The meeting but performs the function of selecting a candidate as directed by the WPK disguising the process as if it was the reflection of the local residents' will. The selection of candidates by political parties is carried out in the same manner. There are such political parties as Korean Socialist Democratic Party and Chon-dogyo Young Friends Party as North Korea's constitution in its formality permits a multiple political party system [Article 67] but they act as WPK's satellite organizations and, instead of selecting a candidate on their own, follow WPK's directive pertaining to the rule of assignment and execute the channelled-down selection process. In effect, the instrument called the local people's assembly is nothing more than a tool for WPK dictatorial rule consisting of delegates handpicked by the WPK and installed by the regime. Following official announcement of the election, WPK opened its so-called election campaign by publicly displaying charts of election districts and their candidates and reviewing the rosters of voters in accordance with the administrative rules of the people's assembly election law. The election campaign aims at simply stirring up the environment for election by mobilizing General Federation of Trade Unions, Agricultural Workers Union and General Federation of Culture and Art, which are government-mandated hierarchical organizations, Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth League which are age-oriented organizations, and Women's League, and does little to gain actual votes. This is simply because there is no need to go after a vote in the channelled down single candidate and uncontested election. North Korea is boasting about its lowering the eligible voter's age from 20 as stated in its old constitution (of 1948) to 17 (the socialistic constitution of 1972) as a proof for implementation of the "generality" election rule but this was done in fact, we believe, in order to mobilize student/youth organizations such as Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth League as vanguard units for election activities. And, the "100 percent voting record" has been achieved through the mechanisms such as having voters go to their voting place in group formations, rather than individually, under the direction of the chief of their people's neighborhood unit, and mobile ballot boxes which an election committee brings to homes of the elderly and the disabled. The third rule is direct election and secret ballot. North Korea continues its propaganda that its election system demonstrates the "people-oriented and democratic" nature, claiming that the "direct/secret" election rule is "in order to assure an election that accurately reflects the people's will." This refers but to the window-dressing piece of constitutional statute designed for external propaganda consumption and, in real practice, it is a widely acknowledged fact that an election committtee consisting of representatives of political parties and socialist organizations plans and supervises a series of election activities and conducts an open ballot election. The perfect election record of the past which had shown "100 percent approval" is the proof of this fact. North Korea's election system is counter-people oriented in that it stresses the "100 percent voter participation" irrespective of constitutional provisions or the free will of its citizens and is undemocratic in that it manufactures "100 percent approval" ignoring the free democratic election process. North Korea, which is about to have the provincial (and directly administered city) delegate election, is unmistakably proving that its election is a political mobilization scheme to assure establishment of the hereditary succession system of Kim Il-song, the father, and his son as its tradition, through its agitation campaign for unified political ideology centered around Kim Il-song/Kim Chong-il and linking the election to fighting against the nuclear inspection pressure it faces and to such other issues as for increased coal production.
