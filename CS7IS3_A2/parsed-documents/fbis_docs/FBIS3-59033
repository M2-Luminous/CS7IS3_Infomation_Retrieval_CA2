Earlier in the day, the delegation met with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss security questions in the context of the NATO summit. The Polish side said it hoped Germany would support Poland during negotiations on the Partnership for Peace agreement. Polish deputies met also with managers of the Association of Polish Servicing Enterprises in Germany, who pointed to their economic problems stemming from the fact that Polish construction firms were pushed off the east German market. According to the Bonn authorities, such a situation was caused by high unemployment in the former GDR, whereas in the opinion of Poles there is enough demand for construction workers in that region. The management of the association appealed to the delegation to take care of the case. The Polish delegation was officially bidden farewell by Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. A speech at the German Foreign Affairs Society in Bonn delivered by Jozef Oleksy was last on the agenda of the four-day visit by the Polish Sejm delegation. Oleksy stressed there were good investment conditions in Poland which was a politically stable country that reported an economic growth. The meeting was attended by representatives of German industrial and financial circles. Present were President of the Krupp Foundation Berthold Beitz, Deutsche Bank President Wilhelm Christians, head of the East German Economy Committee Otto Wolff von Amerongen, and Deputy President of the European Investment Bank and SPD [Social Democratic Party] economic expert Wolfgang Roth.
