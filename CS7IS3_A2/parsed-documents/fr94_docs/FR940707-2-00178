FR940707-2-00178 FR940707-2-00097 The proposal will require ITS/CAES and CAES market makers to quote minimum sizes of 200 or 500 shares (depending on trading characteristics of the securities) and to abide by excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities. ITS/CAES market makers currently are not required to include minimum sizes in their quotations or to comply with the excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities. The excess spread parameters for NASDAQ and CQS securities limit a dealer's spread in a security to 125% of the average of the narrowest three dealer spreads in that security. 12 12 See supra note 8. ITS/CAES enables market makers in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities to direct agency and principal orders to, and receive orders from, the floors of ITS participant exchanges. Currently, transactions in CAES are limited to agency orders. The proposal will enable market makers to execute principal transactions through CAES for listed securities in which the market maker is registered. II. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular, with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), 11A(a)(1)(C), and 11A(a)(1)(D) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act requires that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to an facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that the NASD's rules not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act. 13 Section 15A(b)(11) authorizes the NASD to adopt rules concerning the form and content of quotations of securities sold in the OTC market. 14 Section 11A grants the Commission the authority to facilitate the establishment of a National Market System (``NMS'') for securities to implement certain specified Congressional goals and objectives. Sections 11A(1) (C) and (D) set forth the Congressional finding that the linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities would foster efficiency; enhance competition; increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors; facilitate the offsetting of investors' orders; and contribute to best execution of such orders. 13 The Commission believes that any burden on competition that may result from the proposal, if any, is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 14 The Act requires these rules to be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations. Section 15A(b)(11). The Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate the further development of the NMS by integrating all registered market makers with intermarket trading in listed securities. This will facilitate the ability of third market orders to interact with orders of other market participants. Other ITS participant markets currently cannot execute, through ITS, transactions with registered third market makers that are not registered as ITS/CAES market makers, even when a better published quotation may exist in the third market. 15 Thus, despite the ITS/CAES linkage, not all third market orders are exposed to other ITS participants. This inhibits a broker's ability to ensure best execution of customer orders and impedes fair competition between and among different types of trading markets and market professionals. 15 The quotations of all third market makers are consolidated into a composite third market quote and disseminated through CQS to the exchange floors and to quotation vendors. Therefore, while third market quotations are visible to other markets, they may not be accessible through the ITS/CAES interface. The proposal will facilitate the development of a more efficient market linkage for concurrent exchange and OTC trading of listed securities. The ITS/CAES interface is designed to permit the execution of orders routed to exchange floors in the OTC market when more favorable prices are offered by OTC market makers. The ITS/CAES interface likewise provides OTC market makers access to rapid execution of their orders on exchange floors when exchange markets are quoting better prices. The proposal will facilitate interaction of orders in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities in all market centers, and thus, will increase competition between the markets for order flow in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities. For non-Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities, CAES provides an efficient mechanism for OTC trading of listed securities. By extending application of ITS Plan provisions to all registered third market makers, the proposal also will provide consistent trading rules for multiple trading of listed securities. The ITS Plan provides uniform rules governing: (1) Trade-throughs, to provide price protection for customer orders; 16 (2) block trades, to enable other markets to derive the benefit of a block without breaking it up; 17 (3) pre-openings, to enable other markets to participate in the primary market's opening of a security; 18 and (4) dispute resolution, to enable efficient resolution of disputes between market centers. 19 16 A trade-through occurs when an ITS participant initiates a purchase of an ITS security at a price that is higher than the price at which the security is being offered at another ITS participating market; or initiates the sale of an ITS security at a price that is lower than the price at which the security is being bid at another ITS participant. 17 A block trade is a trade that: (1) involves 10,000 or more shares of a common stock traded through ITS or a quantity of any such security having a market value of $200,000 or more (``block size''); (2) is effected at a price outside the bid or offer displayed from another ITS participating market center; and (3) involves either: (i) a cross of block size (where the member represents all of one side of the transaction and all or a portion of the other side), or (ii) any other transaction of block size (i.e., in which the member represents an order of block size on one side of the transaction only) that is not the result of an execution at the current bid or offer on the exchange. 18 The ITS pre-opening application enables an ITS participant who wishes to open his or her market in an ITS security to solicit any pre-opening interest in that security of other market makers registered in that security in other participant markets. This allows other ITS market makers to participate as either principal or as agent in the opening transaction, which may ameliorate disparities between pre-opening orders. 19 The ITS Plan provides for procedures by which participants can obtain a non-binding opinion on a dispute between ITS participants on the application or interpretation of the ITS Plan and model rules.
