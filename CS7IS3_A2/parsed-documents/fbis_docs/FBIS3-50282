FBIS3-50282 "dreeu018_d_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-018 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 SLOVAKIA Commentaries View Sovereignty Over South AU2601145594 AU2601145594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25 January publishes three commentaries in reaction to statements by Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], about the situation of the Hungarian minority, made during his recent three-day visit to Slovakia, held at the invitation of the Hungarian minority's Coexistence Movement. Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25 January on page 3 carries a 450-word Dominik Hurny commentary entitled "Boundless Ruthlessness." The commentary takes issue with Lezsak's statement that, "as long as the basic rights of citizens of Hungarian nationality in Slovakia are not guaranteed, it is impossible to speak about a Hungarian-Slovak settlement--that is, about the signing of an interstate treaty." Hurny asks: "What basic rights do the Hungarian citizens of Slovakia not have? Do they have no schools and periodicals, are they forbidden to speak Hungarian, do they not have their own radio and television broadcasts and bilingual names of streets and shops? What are they being denied--church services in Hungarian, the use of Hungarian in dealings with the authorities in southern Slovakia? What is being denied to them in comparison with Hungary and its minorities? Who gave Mr. Lezsak the right to declare in Slovakia that Hungarian citizens in Slovakia do not have basic rights?" After denouncing Lezsak's assertions as a "lie" and "boundless ruthlessness," the commentator goes on to challenge "Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy," the leaders of the Hungarian parties in Slovakia, "to state in public which basic rights the Hungarian population of Slovakia does not have and in which areas Hungarian legislation and, above all, the Hungarian practice vis-a-vis the Slovak and other minorities is better and of a higher standard than is the case in Slovakia." He says: "It is necessary to ask Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy to furnish evidence for their propaganda attacks, which run counter to reality. We know very well who in southern Slovakia is threatened with assimilation! As long as Mr. Duray and company do not try to specify their attacks, any further talks are superfluous. The government must demand from these muckrakers a clear answer to the question of their alleged basic rights. There can be no talk of a dialogue until then." On the same page, REPUBLIKA carries a 600-word Eva Zelenayova commentary entitled "And Who Will Protect the Citizen?" Commenting on the MDF delegation's visit to southern Slovakia, Zelenayova says: "During the delegation's first stop, at Kralovsky Chlmec, Stefan Pasztor, the mayor of that city, let himself be heard that Hungarians in Medzibodrozi [area between the Uh and Latorica Rivers in east Slovakia] are not free and that the government does not take care of them, which is why they have to help themselves. The guests from Hungary, in turn, stated that they are fulfilling their electoral program, which includes taking care of Hungarians beyond the borders of the Hungarian Republic. At his news conference on Sunday [23 January], MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak went so far as to term the Komarno rally [of 8 January, at which Hungarian minority representatives formulated their demands] the beginning of efforts at a Slovak-Hungarian settlement, which, however, is still a long way off, in his opinion, because the basic human rights of the Hungarian minority are not guaranteed in the Slovak Republic.... We could scarcely find a state in Europe that would let its sovereignty be jeopardized the way we allow our southern neighbors to do this. They are not alone, receiving substantial help from their notoriously known lackeys in our own country. By their statements and initiatives, they jeopardize and offend with impunity the state and its population. Meanwhile, the General Prosecutor's Office is silent, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not sent a single protest note yet. Quite the contrary, we are being generous and assume an accommodating stand, imprudently and to our own detriment." In concluding, Zelenayova calls on the government "to act as the government of a sovereign state so that the citizen will not have to fear about who will protect him." On the same day, on page 1, REPUBLIKA carries a 400-word editorial by Roman Kalisky entitled "Public Matter." According to the author, telephones had been ringing in the REPUBLIKA editorial office "since yesterday morning," with "indignant readers" asking how it is possible that "a foreign politician can present ultimatums," speaking about the impossibility of a Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation "as long as the basic rights of the Hungarian minority are not recognized in Slovakia," and accuse Slovak representatives of trying to "provoke Hungarians living in Slovakia." Kalisky continues: "What could I tell them? I advised them: Phone the Slovak Government, the minister of interior, the General Prosecutor's Office! Because I know that they are not going to phone them, let me tell these institutions on the callers' behalf: "Esteemed gentlemen, governmental and nongovernmental Slovak politicians! "In every sovereign state from Albania to the United States, from New Zealand to Zaire, a foreign state representative such as Sandor Lezak [Slovak spelling of Lezsak's name used] would get in his passport the `persona non grata' stamp. And the matter would be settled! "Second, every citizen of the Slovak Republic who flagrantly establishes contact with the representative of a foreign power with the aim of subverting this Republic should be made criminally liable!" In this context, Kalisky reiterates his earlier call for the adoption of a "law on the protection of the Republic" to be applied against "conspiratorial criminal acts directed against the state, such as are being publicly committed against the Slovak Republic today." Lezsak's visit to Slovakia is also the subject of a statement made by Docent Jan Cuper from the Theory of State and Law Department of Comenius University's Law School to the Slovak news agency TA SR, which is published by Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 25 January on page 2. The TA SR report on Cuper's statement includes the following passage: "Referring to Sandor Lezsak's tour of southern Slovakia, Jan Cuper said that the naivete of the Slovak state power is being quietly abused in this way in order to prove that Budapest has sovereignty over southern Slovakia. It is no coincidence that the tour did not start in Komarno this time but, rather, in Kralovsky Chlmec in the east, Jan Cuper said, adding that `if you are not acting like a sovereign subject, you will not be treated like a sovereign subject. It is not customary for someone who is not yet the winner to set preliminary conditions for someone who has not yet been defeated and to blackmail him.' According to Jan Cuper, the developments are aimed at the Hungarian minority being granted autonomy rights, so as to make possible the establishment of Hungarian state power in southern Slovakia."
