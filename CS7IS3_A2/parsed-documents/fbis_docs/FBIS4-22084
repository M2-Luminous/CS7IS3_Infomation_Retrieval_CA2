Two Islamic militants were injured Thursday when five explosive devices they were planning to use in attacks accidentally blew up in a shop in the 'Ayn Shams district of Cairo. The blast badly damaged the front of the shop, which was owned by one of the injured, a chemist. His cousin was also hurt. The outlawed Islamic group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has been waging a violent two-year campaign to topple Egypt's secular government in which more than 360 people have died.
