FBIS4-55357 "dreeu093__a94002" FBIS-EEU-94-093-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Albania Report on Greek Human Rights Violations Viewed Report on Greek Human Rights Violations Viewed AU1305101394 Tirana ATA in English 0835 GMT 13 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1305101394 Tirana ATA English BFN [Text] Tirana May 12 (ATA) -- The latest report of the British Section of the ISHR [International Society for Human Rights] (Simon McIlwaine, 31 December 1993) exposes widespread abuses of human rights by the Greek authorities. Greece continues to violate the basic human rights of, in particular, the Macedonian Slavs of northern Greece, and followers of non-Greek Orthodox religious such as Jehovah's Witnesses. This is in direct contravention of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Greece is currently holding the Presidency of the European Union. Firstly by giving some background information on the mix of ethnic groups living in Greece since its foundation in the 1830's, this report challenges the official assumption that the Greek state is ethnically homogenous. This presumption has led to the repeated and official denial of the existence of minorities which are not of pure "Hellenic" origin. This obsession with Greek racial identity is embodied in the idea that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is Greek, and Greek alone. On 20 July 1993 a (Slavonic) cultural festival was held in the village of Melitis. This involved only the participation of local musical and dance groups. Before the celebrations began the local police ordered the musicians to refrain from playing songs in their own language. When an attempt was made to sing songs in Slav, the proceedings were forcibly broken up by the police. According to the report official harassment of the Slavs has intensified over the past two years. Official harassment has extended to human rights activists. During a visit to Greece last year, Professor Eric Siesby, vice-chairman of the International Helsinki Federation, arranged by telephone to meet some Slav dissidents, at his hotel in Florina. An hour after the appointed time his guests had failed to appear. The professor discovered, to his horror, that his hotel has been surrounded by armed police, who had monitored his telephones calls and then deployed to prevent the dissidents from entering the building. In March 1993 a Greek court sentenced two Germans and two Turkish travellers to seven months imprisonment for carrying posters which read "Freedom and Independence for Macedonia." Their "offence" was to display the material on board an Olympic Airways jet before it took off from Athens Airport on a flight to Frankfurt. The court convicted them of "spreading false information" and "interfering with air traffic." One of the convicted was Professor Josef Rochensaus, who told the court that he was a "free person with the right to freedom of speech," which the court ignored. Macedonian Slavs who leave Greece face a further risk. Under the Greek nationality law, Greek citizens of non-Hellenic ethnic origin, who leave Greece may find themselves stripped of their citizenship in their absence. They may be deemed to have emigrated permanently from Greece, and as the decision is an administrative act, it cannot be challenged in the Greek courts. Greek citizens of Slav or Turkish ethnic origin have gone abroad for a few months, only to find that they cannot return to their native country because some officials, has in their absence, deemed them to have emigrated permanently and thus relinquished citizenship. Under Law 106841 of 1982, and law 1540 of 1985, Greek citizens of Hellenic descent, deprived of their citizenship and property rights by such an act can apply for a reversal of the decision, others are subjected to the confiscatory effects of the legislation. The report also shows a growing pattern of evidence of the suppression of freedom of religion of non-Greek Orthodox believers. Under Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Greek Constitution, "proselytism" for religions, other than the Orthodox faith is forbidden, by the terms of Article 4 of Law 1363/1983 of the penal code. This law was introduced when Greece was ruled by the fascist government in the Metaxas era, which makes it a criminal offence to seek converts to other faiths. Over two thousand of Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists and Pentecostalists have been arrested in the last ten years under this law, some four hundred have been imprisoned. Several of these religious detainees report abuse and beating in jail. One example of the degree of persecution cited is the case of Minos Kokkoinakis. Born in 1909 in Sitia, Crete, he is a merchant and still lives in the same town. He has been arrested sixty times since 1938. Kapeleri Evanggelia, from Platans, has been jailed 13 times for his activities as a Jehovah's Witness, he has additionally alleged torture and mistreatment by the police. George Gerefalakis of Heraklion, Crete, was tried for "proselytism" on 10th May 1990. He was 86 years old, and terminally ill with cancer, he had to be carried into court on a stretcher. His accusers were two Greek Orthodox priests. Mr. Gerefalakis was convicted as charged and sentenced to seven months imprisonment. Tragically, he died in jail on 10th June 1990. The report also examines the fate of religious conscientious objectors to compulsory military service. By May 1993, the ISHR had established that there were 388 imprisoned in very poor conditions. Other violations on religious freedom include the ban on employment of non-Orthodox believers as teacher, even in private schools. One example cited is the case of Valiki Pilaftsgou, who in October 1991, applied for a permit to teach biology and French. He was refused because he is a Jehovah's Witness. Additionally, Greek law imposes restrictions on the publication, circulation and importation of non-Orthodox religious literature.
