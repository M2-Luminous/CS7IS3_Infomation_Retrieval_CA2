'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn, a journalist with the AL-SHA'B newspaper, was accused of "revealing military secrets and publishing information liable to provoke unrest." The sources said Abu-Husayn was summoned by the military prosecutor Monday and questioned by military intelligence officers without lawyers or union representatives being present. He was held at the Haikstep military base 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Cairo and appeared before a military court there Thursday. The prosecutor said an article written by Abu-Husayn on March 22 was based on US press allegations that retired Egyptian generals received millions of dollars' worth of commissions from US companies in exchange for arms contracts. Citing US newspaper reports, Abu-Husayn said one of the generals, 'Ali Mansur "has close links with President Husni Mubarak."
