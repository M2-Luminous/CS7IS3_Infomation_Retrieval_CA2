At the meeting, expected to last until Tuesday, South Korea wants to confirm that Russia will assume responsibility for repaying economic cooperation loans that Seoul extended to the former Soviet Union, according to government officials. South Korea will also press Russia to repay arrears on the loans totaling 390 million U.S. dollars outstanding at the end of last year, the officials said. Rough sailing is expected at the meeting, however, as Moscow is likely to request a further delay in making payments, they said. South Korea agreed to extend 3 billion dollars in economic cooperation loans to the former Soviet Union in 1990. Of that amount, it offered 1.47 billion dollars including 470 million dollars in tied loans. Russia paid back only 17 million dollars in cash and another 13 million dollars in aluminum ingots in 1992. Since then, Moscow has kept postponing any payment on interest or principle, the officials said. The Russian delegation to the meeting, led by Vice External Economy Minister M.E. Fradkov, planned to confirm Russia's responsibility for the loans while asking for a grace period similar to that given by the Paris Club of creditors. The Paris Club, comprised of 19 Western creditor nations, agreed last April to extend a grace period requiring Russia to pay back by September 1993 some 50 percent of arrears and principal of their loans outstanding at the end of 1992. Russia is to pay back the rest over five years with a two-year grace period. The Seoul government, taking into consideration Russia's economic difficulties, is studying a plan under which Moscow could make payments in commodities and in the form of a lease on land on which South Korea is building a trade center, the officials said. The trade center, being pushed by the Korea Foreign Trade Association, is to be built on a 2.5-hectare plot near Moscow University and Russia is asking a lease of 50 million dollars a year, they said.
