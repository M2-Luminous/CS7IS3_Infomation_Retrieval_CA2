[Oleksy] This was one of the topics discussed, and it concerned the specific decision examined by the Council of Ministers, which, at the president's request, was sent back to KOK for reexamination. But this is one element of the whole package of principles related to the defense policies of the state and its security. This is one big document that was also examined by the Council of Ministers, and it will be discussed by the Sejm as well. [Woyciechowski] What does it mean that KOK's meeting was tense? What happened there that was so tense? [Oleksy] I did not have that kind of impression. These were merely media reports. However, there were indeed different opinions, and not only about the issue of subordination in the Armed Forces, which was central to the meeting. [Woyciechowski] Is this about who should nominate the supreme chief--the president, the government, or the Sejm? [Oleksy] No, because Article 35 of the Constitution specifies who has the power to nominate the chief of General Staff, his deputies, and military district commanders. So there are no ambiguities here, and there can never be any. At issue is to what extent the civilian control over the Army--something that is determined by the principles of Polish democracy and that of other countries and is NATO's requirement for countries that cooperate with it--so, to what extent this civilian control should mean the degree of direct leadership executed by the defense minister over the Army. [Woyciechowski] By the civilian minister? [Oleksy] Yes, the civilian minister, because this is precisely what is at issue. Until now, the chief of General Staff has been answerable to the defense minister. So it is the leadership of the president over the Armed Forces that is executed through the defense minister. [Woyciechowski] In other words, the civilian tells a general which way to shoot, and the general shoots? [Oleksy] I do not think this was the problem. The minister is a supervisor of the whole thing. He does not interfere, I believe, with specific matters related to the everyday operation of the military but ensures conditions for its functioning, combat readiness, equipment, etc. [Woyciechowski] Is it true that this is where opinions of the defense minister, who is a general, and the president differ? [Oleksy] I see this in a broader perspective. I had the impression that the president sought direct control over the General Staff, whose chief, his deputies, and military district commanders are appointed by the president himself. However, the deputies and military district commanders are appointed at the request of the defense minister. So I think he wants that done by the chief of General Staff. [Woyciechowski] Let us now talk about another Belweder-controlled minister, the interior affairs minister. Do you think the draft laws on police will be passed? [Oleksy] They will definitely be heatedly and controversially debated. These are new solutions, new in Polish law. The key witness and controlled purchases are well established parts of Western law and an unpracticed novelty in our country--hence, so many fears about the way they will be executed, if passed. I suspect this will trigger a lot of controversy in the Sejm because the commission for administration and interior affairs has already frequently discussed that. One should remember that those projects were already proposed and then withdrawn. So, this is their second attempt. On the other hand, the Interior Affairs Ministry rightly demands resolute decisions to counter the surge in crime, unlawfulness, and arrogance of the underworld. I agree with its arguments. Law must be toughened so that citizens feel more secure. They do not feel safe even on the streets. The reason may be that the police are very often powerless and restrained by the current statute. As a matter of fact, they sometimes find themselves in a worse situation than the criminal. [Woyciechowski] Actually, a lot of interesting things will be happening in the Sejm now. For example, the concordat. Will it pass, do you think? [Oleksy] Everyone is thinking about it, calculating votes, making up proportions, analyzing political declarations by various groups. After all, the dispute concerns both politics and the substance. This concordat is expected to be examined before the break. [Woyciechowski] Which is in June or July? [Oleksy] Which is 1 July, when the Sejm's last meeting will be held. [Woyciechowski] So everything will be resolved by that time? [Oleksy] I do not know because this will depend on how the motions are worded. The Sejm's Presidium intends to bring up the concordat in its first reading. Next, there will surely be a different proposal--to reject the document in its current reading or to submit it to legislative commissions. I even know that there will be proposals demanding the concordat's second reading without even submitting it to the commissions. There will be a large number of different proposals, and it is going to be a tough debate--also in procedural terms. [Woyciechowski] Now, what about abortion? Is the issue of abortion going to come back to the Sejm before the elections, as part, as it were, of the election campaign? [Oleksy] I think this is no longer possible. The first reading has already taken place; the second reading was even accompanied by a certain procedural conflict. Let me recall that this was not finally accepted; now we would need the report of the committee to hold the third reading and the voting. As it is known, a number of persons, as well as certain groups are demanding an even more detailed substantive analysis by specialists. Thus, I do not expect that abortion will be discussed before the elections. [Woyciechowski] What will happen if the Sejm decreases the severity of this law? If the president does not sign it, the law will return to the Sejm. From your high place in the Sejm, you can easily see how the deputies vote. Will the Sejm manage to force this law with the majority of the votes? [Oleksy] I think that is possible. Right now this issue is slightly controversial; some people perceived it as an element of the election campaign. After the entire procedure, when it can be assumed that the president will not sign this law, I expect that it is possible to achieve two-thirds of the votes to override the president's veto. [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] in the Sejm? Will it manage to pass through the Sejm successfully? [Oleksy] The committee has already worked on the report; it issued a positive opinion on this report. Discussions are already under way on whether the report should be accepted, whether to take some measures to change the KRRiT. My personal view--not the official view of the Sejm speaker--is that any attempt to overthrow this council must be approached very cautiously. After all, it is not a new establishment in the Polish democracy. Despite all of the remarks that can be made about it, it is an establishment that has accomplished something; it has introduced some new order. This was accompanied by some conflicts, which, however, did not appear in all of the issues. I also think that the discussion in my club, the club of the Democratic Left Alliance, as well as in the other clubs will be quite animated. Criticism is justified in this case; however, there is the question of whether this criticism justifies such a dramatic step as overthrowing the council. [Woyciechowski] Yesterday the Sejm Committee actually praised KRRiT, but it kept criticizing Walendziak... [Oleksy, interrupting] I can see some inconsistency here... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you watch television and do you not like television? [Oleksy] I have my own complaints here as well, as it were. However, I do not have the right to voice them in public; we have often discussed this. What I want is a more systematic approach and a certain balance in the activities of the public media. However, I do not think that the entire issue can be handled this way--that is, one cannot say that the KRRiT is marvelous, but its decisions and its results are bad. This is false. They must be looked upon as one. This direction, I think... [Oleksy pauses] It will go in the direction of criticism of the KRRiT, without any firmness in deciding its fate. There will probably be certain suggestions of changes in the functioning of the mass media. [Woyciechowski] What was it like in China? Is it true that Chinese women are very pretty but have small breasts? [Oleksy] They have breasts of different sizes. Most of them are average in size. However, there are also very tall Chinese women. Most people in Poland think that they are all slanted-eyed midgets. That is not true. In the fashion show in Shanghai, there were very tall Chinese girls from the north of the country, whom Europe can only envy. Now, China from the point of the visit.... [Oleksy pauses] There was a certain unpleasant event concerning this visit, which had to do with Radio Zet. However, I want to consider it a closed case. Now, China is a country that is incredibly friendly to Poland and mainly to Poland as a country in Central Europe. It will soon become the greatest market in the world. It is a country characterized by enormous investment dynamics, by an enormous growth rate, which has been going on for many years. It is a country that is modernizing, ensuring the basic standard of living for 1.2 billion people.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, does it want to trade with us? [Oleksy] And it wants to trade with us. It wants to do this quite frankly. In line with the protocol, my talks with the president of the state were supposed to take no more than a half-hour; in fact, they finished after an hour and a half. It was not a courtesy. What it really was was the expression of real cordiality and goodwill. I interpret this visit as a good declaration of the Chinese party. We formulated our declaration as well. I believe that this must be developed. There are such possibilities. We were accompanied by businessmen, entrepreneurs of large companies. They made good contacts already during the visit. Three new joint-venture companies were set up during the visit. As I was told there in China, it is a market where everything can be sold. The only requirement is that you must want to do it and know how to do it. I think that we should follow the example of the powers of the world, which want to be there on that market at any cost. They realize the advantages that can be gained in trade and investment cooperation with this country. It would not be very responsible of us if Poland, for one reason or another, which may be quite important but certainly incomparable to the possible strategic advantages, were to miss the opportunities that are offered by contacts with China--a country that is friendly to Poland. [Woyciechowski] The presidential election. What will it look like, Mr. Sejm Speaker? [Oleksy] I think my view of it is similar to the views of most people in Poland: All of the statements, especially sharp statements, and firm announcements are premature. I think there is still a lot of time and still.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the election really be held? Everyone keeps talking about it, but no one knows.... [Oleksy, interrupting] It will be held in October 1995. Thus, it is still too early. We still must work on the constitution, which should absolutely be adopted before the election, so that the election can be held on a new constitutional base, so that there is a clear separation of powers.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The constitution has been discussed for four years now and we still do not have it. [Oleksy] I will do everything to speed up the work and to adopt the constitution in the spring referendum in 1995. [Woyciechowski] The spring referendum in 1995--that is, in one year's time. Thank you, Mr. Sejm Speaker, for the interview. [Oleksy] Thank you.
