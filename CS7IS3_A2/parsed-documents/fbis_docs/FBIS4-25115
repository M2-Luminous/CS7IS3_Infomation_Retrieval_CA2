Giving a bitter smile, Kubo said: "There has been no major change since April of last year when an SDPJ delegation visited China." He made the remarks because, although Kubo called on China to actively serve as a mediator in the issue of DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected nuclear arms development, he failed to get a satisfactory reaction from Li, as the SDPJ delegation did last year. On the contrary, Li admonished Kubo, stating that "putting pressure will heighten the tension." It seems that Kubo -- who persistently maintained the need "to cooperate with China" in dealing with the North Korea issue in previous policy consultations of the ruling coalition -- was disappointed with China's reaction.
