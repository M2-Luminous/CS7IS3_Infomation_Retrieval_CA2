We now seem to be at the threshold of a pacification. What can you tell us about this? [Espichan] I do not want to sound over-optimistic, but just looking at the statistics I can say we have achieved 97 percent progress in our struggle against the Shining Path [SL] and 99 percent regarding the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The key of this struggle, of course, was President Alberto Fujimori's decision to begin political and administrative changes and, at the same time, conduct the struggle against terrorism from the head of his government. History will confirm that there was a time before and after President Fujimori made his political decision. [L.C.R] I believe every government over the past 14 years has made a contribution. [Espichan] Everything failed during the 1980-90 period. Laws were issued that were contradictory from the legal viewpoint. These laws were full of mistakes that prevented us from confronting the terrorists and punishing them adequately. After that came the political decision, that is, on 5 April and, especially, after 6 May 1992 with three important resolutions: Decree Law No. 25475 issued on 6 May 1992, Decree Law No. 25499, the "Repentance Law," that was issued just six days later on 12 May 1992, and Decree Law No. 25659, the "Treason Against the Fatherland Law" which legally specifies terrorism and allows this crime to be tried by military courts. [L.C.R] Some people believe these decrees are too harsh and that, consequently, they could have a boomerang effect. [Espichan] These legal measures, especially Decree Laws Nos. 25475 and 25659 are harsh, but they are what the citizenry demanded because terrorism had already reached Lima. In 1991, it felt almost as if we were being defeated by the SL and somebody had to do something about it and say: Stop, either democracy prevails or we let terrorism take over the country. The final decision was taken by the president when he implemented the structural, political, and administrative changes in our country on 5 April. [L.C.R.] President Fujimori obviously enjoyed the Armed Forces' support at that time. [Espichan] What is quite obvious now is that the Armed Forces are playing a very significant role. If this had not been the case, we would not be heading toward a true pacification. We must mention the brilliant and intelligent performance of a brave man who not only sits behind his desk giving his Army orders at a nationwide level, but personally goes to the theater of operations to give orders and find out what is going on. I am talking about Army General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios, a brilliant military officer who must be paid the highest compliments for his success as the representative of the Armed Forces. [L.C.R.] What about the civilians, have they also responded to this struggle? [Espichan] The citizenry is another component in this struggle. The citizens' brave, heroic attitude makes them even more worthy, considering the suffering they endure. Despite the poverty in which we live as a result of terrorism, the low salaries, and the many shortcomings, the citizenry has lost its fear of terrorism. [L.C.R.] Also in Ayacucho? [Espichan] In Ayacucho and other Andean regions that were severely tormented by terrorism, the people rejoice over the peace they now enjoy. Of course others rejoice over being able to return to their home towns, being able to pick up their abandoned businesses, being able to peacefully walk the streets. [L.C.R.] Many assert that terrorism is not yet fully defeated. [Espichan] That is true. Terrorism has yet to be defeated. I am realistic and admit there are still a few fanatics, psychopaths, but they will not succeed in Peru. There have been many changes, especially regarding the causes that gave origin to terrorism. Peru is a different country today, both domestically and internationally. This is why I repeatedly tell every terrorist to repent now that they are defeated and return to their families who need them. [L.C.R.] The leaders greatly influence them. [Espichan] No way. I believe terrorists have already realized that the while they give their lives for mistaken causes, the leadership gets drunk on fine wines and lives in residences that only wealthy people can afford, that they only struggle in theory and deceive their followers. This is why so many repentant terrorists have surrendered and rejoined society, the fatherland.
