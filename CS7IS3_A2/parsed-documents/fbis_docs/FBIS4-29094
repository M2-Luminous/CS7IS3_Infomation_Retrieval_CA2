FBIS4-29094 "dreas015__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-115-A Daily Report 15 June 1994 ANNEX Japan Japan: Take 3 of 3--Article on Relations Between Ozawa, Japan: Take 3 of 3--Article on Relations Between Ozawa, Yamagishi OW1406134494 OW1406134494 BFN [Text] Meanwhile, Ozawa, too, is conducting underground activities toward the LDP, holding "the Yamagishi card." What has happened to the relationship between the two men since the SDPJ left the government? "Kaishin went so far as to expel the SDPJ. We are now on fighting terms with Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa]." When such remarks by Yamagishi were leaked out to Nagata-cho [the center of Japan's politics], those who were looking forward to "a general election through the coalition of the LDP and the SDPJ under the multiseat constituency system" were encouraged, and SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama advocated "dissolution of the House of Representatives through mutual consent." Meanwhile, Yamagishi was writing a different scenario, displaying "the LDP card." The plan was to push for resignation, through the pressure of Yuaikai, which is a pro-DSP [Democratic Socialist Party] labor union within Rengo, and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, who took action to form "Kaishin." That was to shake Ozawa up and at the same time to pave the way for the SDPJ to return to the coalition government. Then, on 16 May, Yamagishi said to DSP Dietman Eisei Ito and others, "The Hata administration will remain a minority government unless it resigns en masse and makes a fresh start." This remark was made five days before SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo made the same remark. In opposition to Yamagishi's speech and conduct aiming at both "dissolution" and "returning the SDPJ to the coalition government," the general tendency within Rengo was against "the union between the LDP and the SDPJ." At the meeting of Rengo's Central Executive Committee, held on 19 May, all joined in to swell the chorus of calls for "a flat no to the union between the LDP and the SDPJ." Some leaders of Rengo testified that "the purpose of the meeting was to contain Yamagishi." It is not clear whether Ozawa moved behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Ozawa's footing is no longer as firm as it used to be. Concerning the formation of "Kaishin" and the SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition government, former Economic Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, a leader of Shinseito, said, "Ozawa committed a gross blunder." This is the first time that Ozawa was publicly criticized by name within Shinseito. On 19 May, Aino was released by Ozawa from the post of chief director of the Lower House's Committee on Rules and Administration. That night, Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the Lower House's Committee on Rules and Administration, is said to have said in excitement, "Why did Ozawa fire my right-hand man without prior consultation? I can never tolerate such a thing." Okuda is, in effect, the most influential man after Ozawa in Shinseito. Aino, who is Okuda's confident, says in a casual manner, "Ozawa the Terrible is the image made by the media. Younger members have ceased to be afraid of Ozawa because I do not fear him." Now, on 26 May, the Political Reform Promotion Council [Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform], consisting of members of business and labor, announced such emergency proposals as the "holding of a general election under the new system." In response to this, on the same day 88 supra-party Diet members, excepting members of the Japan Communist Party, became promoters and engaged in a signature-collecting campaign "against a general election under the current multiseat constituency system," which was to be completed by 10 June. At a press conference of the Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform, Professor Uchida and Rengo Acting Chairman Jinnosuke Ashida were present. It is said that it was DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa who asked Washio to restore a good relationship between Ozawa and Yamagishi. Ashida is the top leader of Yuaikai which supports Yonezawa. Those who mediated for a meeting between Ozawa and Yamagishi are also advocates of political reform. Ouchi expressed his intention to resign as chairman of the DSP on 1 June. Yonezawa, who had acted as a liaison in the formation of "Kaishin," was elected as the next chairman and Ouchi was made a scapegoat. On the following day, 2 June, at a meeting of Rengo's central committee, Yamagishi highly evaluated Ouchi's resignation, saying, "I hope that the SDPJ will present its political ideas and return to the non-LDP coalition government as soon as possible. This can be construed to mean that Yamagishi has shown a sign for the restoration of a good relationship with Ozawa. (endall) 13 Jun SN/mercado/murphy sm171406.009 su 14/1344z Jun BT #1993 NNNN
