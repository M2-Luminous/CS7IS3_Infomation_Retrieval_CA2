The chetniks were frequently firing provocatively with small arms at the defense lines on the left bank of the Drina River. They also fired grenades. The outskirts of the free territory were shelled occasionally. Somewhat more intensive shelling by the aggressor's artillery took place on the sector of the front toward Foca and Pale. The situation on the right bank of the Drina River has not changed since the arrival of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. The chetniks are still in the same positions. The looting has more or less been completed. UNPROFOR units are still without precise orders and authority. Two UN helicopters landed in Gorazde this morning. After a brief stop they left toward Sarajevo. It is said unofficially that General Rose paid a visit to the members of the peacekeeping units.
