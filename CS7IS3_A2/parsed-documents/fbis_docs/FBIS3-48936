There are no details in this laconic statement, which contains only one sentence, about the ending of the strike that has been going on since the day before yesterday in the afternoon, nor about what was agreed between employers' representatives and the government on the one hand, and the strike committee on the other. One thing, however, is certain: This was a particularly "nasty" strike in terms of its consequences for thousands of passengers who were unable to travel over the holidays and who suffered greatly in waiting rooms and on platforms.
