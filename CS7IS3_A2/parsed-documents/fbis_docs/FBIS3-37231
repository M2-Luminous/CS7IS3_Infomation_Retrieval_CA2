[Zhirinovskiy] Our party is completely new and we have an open and realistic program. I emphasize three issues: First, end all economic aid to the former USSR republics; second, interrupt the reconversion of the military industry for civilian purposes; and third, adopt tight measures against crime. Only by doing this will we be able to improve the living standards of the entire country. Moreover, I was never a communist and that is in my favor. [Lando] Your adversaries claim that if you had not been a Communist Party member you would not have made the career that you made. Is it possible? [Zhirinovskiy] I have never been a communist, and I am happy with that. That is precisely what helped me and what is still helping me now, because all the other leaders of our party are old Communist Party members. [Lando] St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said you are a former KGB agent, and that the Soviet political police created your party to bother Boris Yeltsin. [Zhirinovskiy] Never. All that is propaganda. Just like they say that I am a Zionist, anti-Jewish, a member of the radical right or left, or Jewish. Nothing of the sort. I am Russian, Russian, Russian. [Lando] You were elected thanks to a million-dollar campaign, by Russian standards, with expenses surpassing $800,000. Who sponsored that financial support? [Zhirinovskiy] Everyone. Two years ago, in the elections for president, I received more than 6 million votes. If each one of them had given me 1,000 rubles, I would have had 6 billion rubles, which is equivalent to approximately $3.5 million. Everybody? We receive money through the mail. But I will not disclose the name of the main sponsors: Secrecy is the essence of business. [Lando] What are the grounds for your criticism of U.S. foreign policy? [Zhirinovskiy] We believe the U.S. people are good-natured. And this is the reason why they should stop meddling in world affairs. I warn President Bill Clinton: Do not repeat the mistakes of Napoleon and Hitler. The United States will soon begin to deteriorate because of its ethnic conflicts. It then will have its own perestroyka, with its degradation and iniquities. We, the Russians, will not hail the day when the United States stops being united, when factories stop, when there is no more food and medicine, and when all the U.S. people migrate to Russia, Europe, or Japan. The United States exists simply because it robbed Latin America and Africa. It became rich with two world wars and because, over the past 50 years, it took the best brains -- almost all U.S. mathematicians are Russian Jews. [Lando] Can you give your opinion on some outstanding figures in Russian history, beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev? [Zhirinovskiy] Very weak and very naive. [Lando] Leonid Brezhnev. [Zhirinovskiy] A selfish person who lived only for his own family and himself, but not for Russia. [Lando] Stalin. [Zhirinovskiy] Rude and criminal. [Lando] Lenin. [Zhirinovskiy] Magnificent. A genius, as a theoretician. A wise man, but a failure as a politician. [Lando] What was the best and the worst of the communist government during the USSR's existence? [Zhirinovskiy] There were many victims; we lost 60 million people. It is absurd. But there are positive things in the economy -- the construction sector, the schools. Even with that, the balance is negative. [Lando] In your autobiography, you say that Russia's natural borders are the Indian Ocean. To implement this idea, it would be necessary to conquer several countries, among them Afghanistan. Are you proposing a colonial war? [Zhirinovskiy] We are not against the existing borders. But since they are being changed, we want to return to Russia's historical, natural borders; obviously, through peaceful methods, through our economic links. We will thus be able to satisfy the desires of people who live next to our borders and who are anxious to once again be part of Russia. [Lando] You also dream of putting the countries of the old Soviet bloc in East Europe under Moscow's control? [Zhirinovskiy] I am for solidarity between Slav countries: We are neighbors and we have the same economic and cultural background. But I want a union without military interference and without one country dominating the others. The government should not be exercised from Moscow. The center can be located in Prague, Sofia, or Warsaw. [Lando] You said on many occasions that you would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons. Are you ready to press the button? [Zhirinovskiy] I will never use nuclear weapons, and I am against the use of even conventional arms. It is like using violence against a woman: It is a crime. The same thing happens between states and peoples. I prefer dialogue. [Lando] What is your opinion of the comparison made between your ideas and the fascist ideology? [Zhirinovskiy] It's mere propaganda aimed at reducing my influence on voters. Rather than harming me, it ends up helping me because many Russian say: "If the chief of the party for whom we voted is a fascist and if the party for which we voted is fascist, then we are also fascist." The result is the opposite of what they sought. I must thank them for it. [Lando] Do you think democracy can work in countries of continental size like Brazil and Russia? [Zhirinovskiy] Very slowly. It can succeed in the long term, but not now. [Lando] Would you agree to an alliance with communists? [Zhirinovskiy] I might use some communists as ministers. But by no means a totally communist government. The ideal is to give 10 percent to Communists, 10 percent to Radical Democrats, 10 percent to other parties, and 70 percent for us. [Lando] Why didn't you engage in the White House battle in October 1993, when Yeltsin dissolved the conservative congress? [Zhirinovskiy] It was not our war. It was a war between red and pink communists. I am not a communist; I am a democrat. [Lando] What does Russia expect from the West? [Zhirinovskiy] Nothing! We do not need any help from the West. And we beg, leave us alone. That is the best thing they can do for us. [Lando] Why don't you believe in Western help? [Zhirinovskiy] There is no help at all. It's all lies. They send old clothes, spoiled canned food that no one wants to eat. Send cars, because we do not need rags! [Lando] You have proposed redividing the world in areas of influence, like during the Cold War. Only this time it will be a North-South division. How does that work? [Zhirinovskiy] Why should the United States meddle with European affairs? Let it take care of Latin America; let Europe take care of Africa; let China and Japan to take care of Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and let Russia take care of Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. This vertical domination will produce a good, warm climate all over the world. We will spend less in transportation, communications. Fewer planes will fly, thus making air and water cleaner, and the environment will be preserved. I might live in just one city, my Alma-Ata. [Lando] Some people believe you are trying to become rapidly rich because you know that your presence on the political stage will be brief. [Zhirinovskiy] No, I am not interested in money, women, alcohol, or drugs. I am only interested in my country. I want to see the honest eyes of my voters while they call me Vladimir and kiss my hand (he makes the gesture). [Lando] Is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy a hero? [Zhirinovskiy] Possibly, because this new era calls for a leader. The people need a center behind which to close ranks, a star in the sky, the moon in the middle of the night. Under this viewpoint, I might be mythical. It is not because I want it, but because the people want it. [Lando] Do you think it is possible to be optimistic in Russia? [Zhirinovskiy] Of course. Our country has marked history with its heroism. It has a big bright area and various climates. We play an essential role in the world. Neither Africa, nor Latin America, nor Asia have such significance. Only France, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia.
