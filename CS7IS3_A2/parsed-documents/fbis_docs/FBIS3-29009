Justifying the decision, Clinton said this is the best way to determine the fate of some 2,238 Americans missing in Vietnam. He also cited Vietnam's return of the bodies of a number of U.S. soldiers. Although the decision angered some organizations, especially Vietnam war veterans and families of American POW's, it is, in fact, a response to pressure by U.S. firms. A number of major U.S. firms realized that the embargo on Vietnam narrows their opportunities in this growing market. Still ruled by a communist government, Vietnam introduced an economic reform plan in 1989. Under the plan, Vietnam managed to grow from a rice-importing country to the world's second or third biggest rice exporter. Economic growth rose between 6 to 8 percent over the past four years, and the government managed to reduce inflation from 300 percent to only 15 percent, helping the influx of foreign investment. But foreign investment is largely Asian, and Vietnam does most of its trade with other Asian countries. This stirred U.S. firms, which see in Vietnam an emerging Asian tiger with a huge market, a population of about 67 million, and cheap labor. Irrespective of all the justifications made by Clinton, the decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam was motivated by the interests of the major U.S. companies.
