On 16 December hundreds of people were arrested, locked up in the Pop Sapca Street jail and in the cellar of the police, where they were subjected to brutal treatment. On 17 December the avengers took up arms and shot into the defenseless crowd. The wounded and the dead were falling, and blood was pouring on Temesvar streets. Four years after this tragedy, the names of the murderers are still unknown. Ceausescu's executioners allied themselves with those who shot at the demonstrators, and they succeeded in discrediting and burying the idea of justice. During the revolution, the Reprisal Commando was comprised of activists from the army, the Securitate [secret service], the fire brigades, and the [Communist] Party. Only a few of them were sentenced in the Temesvar trial and in some local trials. For the bloodbath in Temesvar, the following persons were prosecuted: Emil Macri, Ion Popescu, Traian Sima, Filip Teodorescu, Gabriel Anastasiu, Ion Deheleanu, Petru Moraru, Ion Baciu, Nicolae Chircoias, Gheorghe Atudoroaie, Ion Corpodeanu, Tinu Radu, Iosif Veverca, Gheoghe Avram, Valentin Ciuca, Eugen Misea, Laurentiu Preda, Tiberiu Grui, Viorel Bucur, Eugen Peptan, Gheorghe Ganciu, and Iosif Emilian Zamfir. Beyond the 22 defendants, four party leaders were also prosecuted: Ion Coman, Cornel Pacoste, Ilie Matei, and Radu Balan. Petru Moraru and Emil Macri died in prison. Almost two years after the trial began, the court handed down a sentence. Of the 26 defendants, only eight were sentenced: Ion Coman to 25 years, Radu Balan to 23, Cornel Pacoste, Ion Popescu and Traian Sima to 20 years each, Ion Deheleanu and Ion Corpodeanu to 18 years each, and Iosif Veverca to 15 years. The rest of them were acquitted for lack of evidence. Of those who were sentenced, Traian Sima and Ion Deheleanu are still behind bars; the rest were freed for reasons of illness. Traian Sima, former Securitate commander in Temes county, declared that he did not wish to be freed for health reasons, "only through an amnesty or feet first" (dead). Ion Deheleanu's daughter replied to our inquiry that we should look for him in two or three months, by then he would be at home. The medical certificates would soon be completed. Ion Corpodeanu is at home. I visited him and talked with him through the window. He looks good. He does not comment on the events of December 1989. Although he is frequently seen in one of the stores of his son's firm, he claims he did not become a businessman. He says he only goes there to buy mineral water. Ion Coman, who was also released for health reasons, moved and we could not find him. Of the acquitted, Filip Teodorescu started writing cheap mysteries, and he is making good money. Tinu Radu and Valentin Ciuca became businessmen. They own the TIVAL IMPEX import-export company together with an Arab entrepreneur. They export cement and oil products for hard currency. Tinu Radu stated that they were saving money dollar by dollar for a business venture. The former police officer Viorel Bucur, whose role in currency and gold dealings before 1989 was well known, was not sentenced. During the reprisals he led generals Nuta and Mihalea to the hot centers of the revolution. Today he is a successful businessman, owner of the FARFALA and VIBASS companies. Among the army officers who took part in the reprisals, the names of Paul Vasile and Gheorghe Gheorghe are known. The former was given the order to recapture from the demonstrators the tanks stranded on Gyiroki Street. The command was: by any means. Paul Vasile recaptured them. Very many people died and were wounded on that occasion. Since then, Paul Vasile has been promoted to the rank of colonel, and he is the chief of the general staff of the Temesvar motorized regiment. Several people stated that the squad which opened fire on the demonstrators was under the command of Gheorghe Gheorghe. He was also promoted, moved to a different army unit, and was awarded the title "Veteran of the Revolution."
