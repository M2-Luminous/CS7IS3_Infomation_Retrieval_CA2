FR940620-0-00120 FR940620-0-00029 Comment . One corrections official expressed concern about installing combination units that meet ADAAG specifications or separate toilet and lavatory fixtures in existing cells as part of a renovation. Installation of these elements would require converting two standard cells into one accessible cell in order to provide the necessary clear floor space at fixtures. Response . Structural conditions and site constraints that prohibit compliance with ADAAG in the case of alterations are addressed by ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations). ADAAG 4.1.6 notes that where it is ``technically infeasible'' to comply with ADAAG as part of an alteration, compliance is only required ``to the maximum extent feasible.'' Compliance with ADAAG that necessitates the removal of walls may constitute ``technical infeasibility'' in many cases. The term ``technical infeasibility'' is further discussed under ADAAG 12.4.5 (Alterations to Cells or Rooms). Comment . The specifications for toilet rooms in ADAAG 4.22 and for bathing facilities in ADAAG 4.23 include requirements for grab bars at toilets, showers, and tubs. In the prison environment, such elements must be properly secured so that they cannot be removed and used as weapons. As discussed in ADAAG 11.4.2, the NPRM asked whether grab bars can be installed without creating a security risk. A majority of comments, including those from corrections officials, indicated that grab bars do not pose a risk to security if mounted properly. Several State corrections agencies offered certain methods of securement, such as the use of steel imbeds. Some of these suggestions were qualified as being able to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, risks to security. Several commenters considered grab bars more of a security risk in maximum security facilities. Response . Based on the comments, various alternatives do exist for mounting grab bars so that they do not pose a risk to security. Another question raised in the NPRM was whether grab bars can facilitate suicide attempts among inmates or detainees. The NPRM asked about the experiences detention and correctional authorities have had with respect to grab bars and suicide attempts. This issue was raised with respect to holding cells in judicial facilities covered by ADAAG 11.4.2 and to holding and housing cells in detention and correctional facilities addressed by this section. Comment . No information was received indicating that grab bars had indeed been used in any recorded suicide attempt. However, the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives notes that this ``could have more to do with not only the problem of under-reporting of jail suicides *␣*␣* but also the fact that grab bars are not yet predominantly found in jails throughout the country.'' Several comments did consider grab bars a suicide risk, particularly in police holding cells, maximum security cells, and psychiatric facilities. Most of the comments, however, particularly those from State corrections officials, indicated that while they may pose some risk, suicide prevention cannot be based solely on cell design. Some comments considered it impossible to design a cell that is ``suicide-free'' and noted that the risk posed by grab bars is not very different from the risk already posed in many existing prisons or holding cells by cell grillage, bed frames, and air circulation vents. Many of these commenters stressed the importance of appropriate supervision and classification of inmates and detainees in curbing the risk of suicide. The California Board of Corrections, which oversees local and county facilities, stated that: The best deterrent to such activity is staff supervision and appropriate classification of inmates to identify possible suicide candidates. Another consideration is that grab bars are often located in open areas where staff visibility is optimum. Finally, California requires grab bars adjacent to all water closets in detoxification cells due to the potential for injury to intoxicated arrestees and there is no information to indicate an increase[d] suicide potential in these cells due to grab bars. Response . The response from a majority of corrections officials indicates that supervision and classification of inmates are necessary in preventing suicide. The operators of correctional facilities may rely on these methods since correctional systems utilize extensive evaluation and classification of inmates. However, this may not be the case in detention facilities which may house persons immediately after arrest. Information gathered by the Board indicates that, in general, the chance of suicide is greatest during the first 24 or 48 hours following arrest. This is consistent with the opinion expressed by a few commenters that the suicide risk is greater in detention facilities such as police station holding cells. However, commenters indicated that appropriate supervision is necessary in these facilities in order to effectively reduce the risk of suicide, especially since holding cells may already contain elements, such as cell bars, that can facilitate suicide attempts. An exception to the requirement for grab bars in ADAAG 4.22 and 4.23 has not been included. The specifications for grab bars in ADAAG 4.26 (Handrails, Grab Bars, and Tub and Shower Seats) allow various design alternatives, and some designs were suggested in the NPRM as possible alternatives. These included grab bars that are recessed into the wall or that have infill welded plates attached to the bottom. Several corrections officials stated that such designs may help reduce but would not necessarily eliminate the risk of suicide. Further, they may compromise security by providing space in which contraband can be hidden. One State correctional agency advised that operators ``should retain the flexibility of determining the grab bar design suitable for a particular application.'' Current ADAAG specifications do provide some degree of flexibility in the design of grab bars. In addition, ADAAG 2.2 (Equivalent Facilitation) allows departures from, or alternatives to, specific technical requirements in ADAAG so long as equal or greater access is provided. 12.5.2(3)␣Beds This provision requires that clear floor space 36 inches wide be provided along one side of beds. The specifications for beds do not preclude the use of upper bunks, which may be installed particularly in cases of overcrowding. However, sufficient clearance must be provided between bunks so that the transfer from wheelchairs to lower bunks is not restricted. ADAAG does not currently specify such clearances, but an appendix note recommends consideration of the standard human dimensions associated with the use of wheelchairs in Appendix Fig. A3.
