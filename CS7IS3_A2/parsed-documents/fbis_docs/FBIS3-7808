Selman Daci was killed on the Kosovo side of the high road, about one mile from the border with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the centre said. The centre also reports large-scale troop movements this weekend by the Serbian-Montenegrin army in this southern province of the former Yugoslavia. In a statement sent to IRNA, the centre said that dozens of units of the Serbian Army, including about 10 tanks and several long-range guns walked into a village near the Kosovo capital of Pristina last Friday, provoking the inhabitants. The units, the statement said, were stationed in nearby hills. The same day, heavy army units moved out of a barracks in Prizren, near the Albanian border, while heavy weapons which had been positioned nearby, were moved closer to the town. Other units with 30-40 tanks and armoured vehicles moved to a village near Podujevo, just north of Pristina, the same source said. On Sunday afternoon, some 13 tanks, a dozen military trucks and a large number of soldiers and officers were stationed near the village of Komoran and there was much movement by the army in several other places in Kosovo. Following the abolition of the province's autonomy four years ago, Serbia keeps a large military and police presence to maintain repression in Kosovo, where the population is 90 per cent Albanian Muslim.
