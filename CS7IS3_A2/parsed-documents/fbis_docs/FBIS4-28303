FBIS4-28303 "dreas111_c_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 North Korea Buddhist Group Protests Name of Japan's Reactor Buddhist Group Protests Name of Japan's Reactor SK0306213894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1504 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306213894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists Federation sent a letter to Buddhist organizations in Asian countries on June 1 concerning the fact that the Japanese authorities have begun to operate in real earnest the fast breeder reactor "Monju" which was named after "Maijusri" (Bodhisattva of Wisdom). "Monju" is the Japanese pronunciation of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom". Noting that the prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju", starting operation in April, is a plutonium breeder reactor for manufacturing nuclear bombs, developed by the Japanese militarists for the purpose of nuclear armament, the letter says: With no excuse or fair words can the Japanese ruling quarters justify their abuse of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom" to this "devil- incarnate". If the Japanese militarists' moves to gratify their ambition for a nuclear power by abusing even the name of Bodhisattva are not checked today, they would use another name of Bodhisattvas, Buddhist doctrines and Buddhist sutras to reduce us to slaves of their nuclear weapons and scapegoat falling victim to a nuclear holocaust tomorrow. A nuclear disaster that may be caused by the Japanese fast breeder reactor "Monju" will cover the entire Asian region just as the sufferings and damages imposed by the Japanese imperialist aggression in the first half of this century had become a tragedy for the whole of Asia, not confined to any one country. All the Buddhists and Buddhist organizations truly valuing human life should pool their minds and efforts irrespective of their respective borders and schools to expose and condemn the Japanese militarists' criminal acts of insulting Buddhism, and decisively remove from the earth in the name of Buddhism the Japanese fast breeder reactor which is becoming a hotbed of nuclear calamities behind the sign of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom". The letter expresses the expectation that the Dharma friends in different countries will rise as one in the sacred struggle to frustrate Japan's nuclear power ambition and prevent a nuclear war in conformity with their fundamental aims of achieving peace and happiness of mankind.
