Sanin de Rubio stressed "that this agreement will be in effect for citizens who arrived in Colombia or Panama two years ago." She also noted that "in the next two months, authorities will clearly demarcate the boundary stones on the Colombian-Panamanian border," which have not been inspected for years. The border between the two nations is 263 km long and it only has 14 boundary stones. At the meeting, it was agreed to increase the number of stones to improve the border area. The work to establish the boundaries will be conducted by a joint commission, but the date has not yet been set. It was learned that the work might take place in the summer of 1995 when the two governments will verify the limits. The meeting between the two governments included several agreements in which COPA, Avianca, and SAM airlines agreed to several exchanges. Colombian and Panamanian hotels signed a similar agreement. Meanwhile, the Kuna Yala and Embera-Wounaan general congresses criticized the Neighboring Commission meeting because Indian representatives were not invited to discuss the opening of the Darien Gap. The Indian population will be affected by the construction of the Inter-American highway, the railroad, drug trafficking, health issues, biodiversity conservation, and the environment. The Indian chiefs questioned the meeting of the governments of Panama and Colombia because the rulers of these nations are not familiar with the situation of the Darien and Kuna Yala region. Only the Indian population, which has lived there for more than 500 years, know it.
