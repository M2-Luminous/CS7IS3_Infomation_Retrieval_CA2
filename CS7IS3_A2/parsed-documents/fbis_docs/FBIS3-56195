"It is hardly possible that our relations will be difficult. Boris Yeltsin and I share the same point of view", he said adding that they both stand for the strengthening of the presidency in Russia. Khasbulatov was a staunch supporter of Yeltsin before 1991 Soviet coup, but turned rival when Yeltsin began his market reforms in the country. Shumeyko said his main task in the Federation Council will be to rule out "hidden intrigues, shady deals and agreements between factions" of the upper chamber. He added that the Council of the Federation may bypass the State Duma, which is the main legislative chamber, in case the latter works "unconstructively". "It is possible, in cooperation with those deputies of the State Duma who really want to do something, to draft lawbills in joint commissions and committees and adopt them right here (in the federation council)", Shumeyko explained, but added that this may be done only in "extreme situations" and in case of a "tough necessity". Shumeyko said his election to the post of the speaker was the "triumph of commonsense". He succeeded to win the post only in three attempts and encountered a tough competition from his conservative rival Petr Romanov. Shumeyko will most evidently lose his job of the first deputy prime minister and, according to a draft resolution of the chamber, will only be paid the same salary by the government for two years.
