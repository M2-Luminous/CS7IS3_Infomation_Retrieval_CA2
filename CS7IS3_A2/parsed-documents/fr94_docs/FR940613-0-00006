FR940613-0-00006 FR940613-0-00002 The FAA estimates that 148 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes will cost approximately $1,420 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes is estimated to be $320,864, or $2,168 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $482,278. The total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;12&hyph;05␣ McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;8933. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;90&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, &hyph;30F, &hyph;40, and &hyph;40F series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced structural integrity of the wing, accomplish the following: (a) For Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, and &hyph;15 series airplanes: Accomplish paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this AD in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 57&hyph;114, Revision 1, dated July 26, 1993. (1) Prior to the accumulation of 6,500 total landings, or within 1,500 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later: Perform an eddy current surface inspection or an eddy current bolt hole inspection to detect cracks on stringer number 41 on the left- and right-hand wings, in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) If no crack is found, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings. (3) If any crack is found, prior to further flight, accomplish paragraph (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), or (a)(3)(iii) of this AD, as applicable. (i) If any crack is found that extends upward from the fastener hole, and if that crack is outside the limits specified in Condition 2 of the service bulletin, accomplish a temporary repair in accordance with Condition 2, Phase I of the service bulletin, or a permanent repair in accordance with Condition 2, Phase II of the service bulletin. If the temporary repair is accomplished, prior to the accumulation of 5,000 landings after accomplishing that temporary repair, accomplish the permanent repair in accordance with Condition 2, Phase II of the service bulletin. After accomplishment of the permanent repair, no further action is required by this AD. (ii) If any crack is found that extends downward from the fastener hole, and if that crack is outside the limits specified in Condition 2 of the service bulletin, accomplish the permanent repair in accordance with Condition 2, Phase II of the service bulletin. After such repair, no further action is required by this AD. (iii) If any crack is found in a fastener hole, and if that crack is within the limits specified in Condition 2 of the service bulletin, accomplish the preventative modification in accordance with Condition 1, Option II of the service bulletin. If the crack was detected using techniques other than the eddy current bolt hole inspection described in the service bulletin, prior to accomplishing the preventative modification, perform an eddy current bolt hole inspection to detect cracks, in accordance with the service bulletin, and accomplish paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A), (a)(3)(iii)(B), or (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this AD, as applicable. (A) If any crack is found that extends upward from the fastener hole, and if that crack is outside the limits specified in Condition 2 of the service bulletin, accomplish the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this AD.
