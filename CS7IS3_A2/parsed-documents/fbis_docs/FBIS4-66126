The bill had been presented at the start of the new legislature by the National Alliance, born form the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement]. The MSI traditionally presented such a proposal at the start of each legislature, but its presentation by the National Alliance [AN] raised an outcry given that the National Alliance had promised that it was "post-fascist" when entering the government coalition. The withdrawal of the request had been pre-announced by National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini and was presented by Vincenzo Trantino, of the National Alliance, also on behalf of the bill's original sponsors. The government of Premier Silvio Berlusconi has been under pressure from both the Left opposition at home and its European partners for the presence in the executive of five ministers from the National Alliance branded as neo-fascist. Repeated calls had been made, in fact, for members of the National Alliance to repudiate fascist ideology. The MSI, Italian Social Movement, was formed by members of Mussolini's end-of-the-war Italian Social Republic.
