ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; Response to Petitions for Reconsideration. SUMMARY: On April 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule requiring that new and replaced pipeline facilities be constructed to accommodate inspection by instrumented internal inspection devices commonly known as ``smart pigs.'' RSPA has received two petitions for reconsideration of that rule as it applies to gas pipelines. In response to those petitions, this notice proposes to modify the rule with respect to: Replacements in gas transmission lines located in less populated areas; and replacements in gas transmission lines located offshore. In addition, in order to allow completion of rulemaking on these proposals, this notice proposes limited extension of the compliance dates for certain current requirements. Finally, this document announces RSPA's decision with respect to other matters raised in the petitions. DATES: Comments on the limited extension of the compliance dates for current requirements are due October 31, 1994. Comments on other modifications of the rule are due November 29, 1994. Commenters should submit as part of their written comments all the material that is considered relevant to any statement of fact or argument made.
