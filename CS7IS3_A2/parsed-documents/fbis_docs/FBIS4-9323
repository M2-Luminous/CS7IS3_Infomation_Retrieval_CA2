High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy to proceed to Gorazde, Bosnian Serb army sources told TANJUG on Friday [22 April]. The Gorazde-bound convoy of 49 combat vehicles, with 141 U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) members from Great Britain and Ukraine and 41 Norwegian medical workers, on its way from Sarajevo was stopped in Rogatica on Thursday by a group 350 Serb women and children. The spontaneously gathered group demanded that UNPROFOR evacuated all Serbs held captive in the [word indistinct] Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. They also demanded the return of the bodies of killed Serbs. The Bosnian Serb republic (S.R.) authorities are investing every effort towards resolving the situation, Bosnian Serb army sources said. The Serbs have agreed that two U.N. platoons be deployed in the Gorazde area under Tuesday's S.R.-UNPROFOR accord pursuant to which the Serbs proclaimed a unilateral ceasefire in the area on Wednesday. In the meantime, UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British General Sir Michael Rose was reported to have ordered the convoy to return to Sarajevo. News agencies reported that UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo Rob Annink said that Gen. Rose at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) on Friday ordered the convoy to return. He added that the order was issued for tactical and political reasons. Clashes around Gorazde escalated in late March when the Moslems from Gorazde, a U.N.-designated `safe area' which should have been demilitarized last spring, launched an offensive against Serb positions. The offensive has been crushed by a strong Serb counterattack.
