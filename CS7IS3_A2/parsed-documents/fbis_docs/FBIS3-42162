He adds that the security of the country is the responsibility of each person. He adds: "The police behavior toward the enemies of the homeland will remain civilized and governed by the rule of law and will remain above the methods of revenge. The police will not punish anyone for a crime committed by someone else but will put the whole matter into the hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not subject to any authority other than conscience and the law." Mubarak notes that the terrorist incidents could have been used as an excuse to impose "emergency measures" but that Egypt's government has insisted on adhering to the rule of law due to its belief in democracy. President Mubarak continues his speech by noting: "The fact is that some of our national parties have taken a step in the right direction. They condemn terrorism and strongly call for eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots. Only some of the enemies of democracy, who are still hiding behind false slogans that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have remained outside this national consensus." He recalls his recent call for a national dialogue among political parties and clarifies that he is not trying to eliminate the differences among political parties but rather to find a consensus on confronting terrorism.
