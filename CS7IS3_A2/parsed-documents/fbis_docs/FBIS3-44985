They said Deng, who has reportedly been staying in Shanghai since December for relaxation, arrived by car at the hotel where Chen, who has often taken a cautious stance toward reform, was staying. This was Deng's third reported outing since the 89-year-old architect of China's economic reforms moved to the Chinese coastal commercial city. Chen, a long-time economic leader and later chief of the party's Central Advisory Committee in the 1980s, has been staying in the metropolis from around summer last year. A Beijing-funded newspaper in Hong Kong reported Monday that Deng had made a rare public appearance on New Year's day, visiting a five-star Shanghai hotel and chatting with foreign guests.
