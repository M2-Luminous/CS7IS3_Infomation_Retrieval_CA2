U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry made such an admission on the eve of his visit to Moscow. The Pentagon head declared that there should be active cooperation with Russia in those cases where the two countries' interests coincide and that mutual attempts to act independently should be perceived calmly when such interests do not coincide. Americans should also be prepared, however, for the fact that the strategic aims of Russia and the United States might also contradict each other. Precisely in order to prevent such a turn, the United States must give all possible support to Russia's democratic processes and peace-loving steps, the defense secretary emphasized. Among the main areas of cooperation in the military and military-political sphere between the two countries he particularly singled out cooperation in destroying chemical arsenals and part of the nuclear arsenals, in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and in converting defense production. The Pentagon chief named as examples of direct cooperation along military lines the exercise planned for this summer by Russian and U.S. peacemaking contingents -- the 27th Motorized Rifle Division and the 3d Mechanized Division respectively.
