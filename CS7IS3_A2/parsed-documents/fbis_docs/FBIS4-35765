Army Commander General Lahhud briefed the HDC on the details of the Israeli assault. He said that the Army, immediately after monitoring the hostile planes, informed all the concerned departments and confronted the enemy with all available weapons in all operational areas. After discussing the issue, the HDC expressed satisfaction with the Army's prompt response. His excellency the foreign minister was again instructed to lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council and ask it to hold a session to discuss this barbaric assault. The HDC instructed his excellency the health minister to let the hospitals admit and give treatment to all people injured in the attack at the Health Ministry's expense. Lebanon emphasizes its legitimate right to resist the occupation and confront its assaults with all available means. It asserts that these Israeli assaults and pressure, regardless of how intense they become, will not make it submit or back down from its firm patriotic stance. [Correspondent] Minister, we notice that Israel has recently escalated its assaults in more than one area in the south. Do you expect the situation to escalate further and expand? [Dallul] We expect Israel to perpetrate every possible abomination with the aim of undermining domestic conditions in Lebanon. After it failed to achieve anything via its agents, it personally intervened in Lebanese affairs to confuse matters and drive a wedge between Lebanon and those who confront the Israeli occupation. We wish to stress that this Israeli policy, no matter how assiduously pursued, will not make us submit or cooperate with Israel. We are cooperating with our people to end the occupation. We back those who confront Israel because the people of any occupied country have the right to resist the occupation with all available means. [Correspondent] Minister, one can see that the lack of international sympathy with Lebanon's complaint about the Israeli act of piracy [abduction of Believers Resistance official Mustafa al-Dirani] gave a green light to Israel to carry out the current major assault. What does Lebanon plan to do in connection with the complaint? [Dallul] We will ask the international community to bear its full responsibility. Either there will be an international community response to countries' needs to protect their citizens, sovereignty, and independence or the international community will become a stooge for Israeli objectives and the objectives of those who back Israel. We will lodge a new complaint so that the international community, particularly the UN Security Council, will shoulder its responsibility regarding the Israeli assaults. [Correspondent] Minister, the press corps doyen cited the president as saying today that Lebanon is no longer surprised [words indistinct] if Beirut is attacked using the usual Israeli pretexts. What are the limits of the Israeli aggression at this stage? [Dallul] It is not important to predict whether Israeli attacks will occur or not. Israel is a state founded on aggression. The Israeli entity is based on aggression. Accordingly, Israel will carry out attacks. It is, therefore, important for us to maintain our solidarity and accord to prevent Israel from achieving its objectives or goals through such attacks. [Correspondent] Will Lebanon adopt an official stand on the issue of the Arab-Israeli negotiations if the Israeli attacks continue? [Dallul] This depends on the Council of Ministers and the Chamber of Deputies. We joined the negotiations after a decision by the Chamber of Deputies. However, I believe that if Israel continues its attacks we will hear voices calling for withdrawal from these negotiations because they will be impotent. We will not accept negotiations used as pretexts to strike at our people, sons, and areas. You will be surprised to learn that young girls were victims of the Israeli attack early today. Children of 12 or 13 years old were killed. [Correspondent] Do you believe that [words indistinct]? [Dallul] Nobody will forget anything. Every Israeli act of piracy will be remembered. These are acts demonstrating Israel's barbarism and bestiality. The Lebanese people are victims of such Israeli acts. Israel, which speaks about Hitlerism and Nazism, is itself carrying out this method, a method not even used by the Nazi regime with such barbarism and bestiality. [Correspondent] In your opinion, do you believe that the cabinet's meeting on Tuesday [7 June] will adopt a decision concerning the negotiations? [Dallul] This, as I said, all depends on the Council Ministers and the Chamber of Deputies. We have allies in the negotiations. Together we joined the negotiations. We will not adopt unilateral decisions. But every one of us wonders about the usefulness of such negotiations when Israel is bombing us and destroying the sources of livelihood of our people. [Correspondent] Minister, [words indistinct] to avoid extensive fighting in the south as happened in the past? [Dallul] We do not interfere in the actions of our sons, who are confronting the Israeli occupation. We often said that as long as Israel continues to occupy our land, it is the right of everyone to resist and liberate this land with all available means. When the land is liberated, there will be no weapons except those that belong to the legitimate authority [words indistinct]. But at present Israel is bombarding us deep inside our country. Therefore, I believe we are not the police to defend the occupation forces. Defending the occupation troops is treason. We are a state which cooperates with its people and citizens. Our state is responsible for the sovereignty and independence of the homeland. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. [Dallul] Our coordination with Syria is continuing, whether there are attacks or not. We coordinate with fraternal Syria on all issues and in all fields. We have a common fate. Together we joined the negotiations and we will continue together. This is because we do not bite the hand that helps us. We will continue to coordinate efforts with the states that entered the negotiations with us, foremost among them being fraternal Syria.
