John Major told reporters that Russia, the United States and the European Community should use their influence to resolve the conflict in Bosnia. The British prime minister said Russia and NATO had the same goal in this respect -- we want to put an end to the shelling of Sarajevo and reach a long-term political settlement of the conflict. Chernomyrdin told journalists that the British prime minister and himself focused on the development of trade and economic relations between the two countries and specific projects relating, among other things, to the reconstruction of the Moscow telephone network and some technologies for the Russian fuel and energy sector. The British prime minister spoke in favour of expanding European investments in the Russian industry. Chernomyrdin said the two countries are enjoying the most favourable climate for their trade and economic relations: in 1993, Britain came to rank third among Russia's western foreign trade partners.
