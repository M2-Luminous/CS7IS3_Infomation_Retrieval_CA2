During the meeting, a plan for controlling water pollution in the Huai He basin was adopted, ushering in a massive effort to control pollution there. State Councillor Song Jian, who is also in charge of the State Council Environmental Protection Committee, said that it is necessary to take economic, administrative, and legal measures to control the Huai He's pollution within a set time so as to achieve the goal of making the Huai He clean by the end of this century. During the meeting, leaders from four riparian provinces along the Huai He -- Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong -- as well as responsible people of relevant state ministries and commissions adopted a plan for pollution control in the Huai He basin after carefully analyzing the river's pollution and control situation. To control Huai He pollution, the following efforts will be made: The State Council Environmental Protection Committee and the Water Resources Ministry will take the lead in forming a Huai He water quality control organization, with the participation of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong and relevant State Council departments. The organization will be responsible for coordinating and planning the overall control of the Huai He's pollution. A Huai He water quality pollution control monitoring network will be established and improved to conduct dynamic monitoring of the river's mainstream and all major tributaries and carry out a target and comprehensive control of pollution in all of its sections. A group of enterprises along the Huai He whose pollution is severe and hard to control will be closed down, suspended, merged with other enterprises, or their product lines changed in three years. The first batch of enterprises whose pollution is severe and whose economic performance is poor will be closed down, suspended, merged with other enterprises, or product lines changed this year. In addition, 200 control projects will be accomplished in three years. By 2000, all riparian cities and counties along the river must build water pollution treatment facilities suitable to local conditions. It is necessary to formulate relevant laws and regulations concerning the control of the Huai He's pollution to put the control work on a legal track. The meeting urged the four riparian provinces to carry out and accomplish the control plan included in the "Eighth Five-Year program." Any construction projects that might cause severe pollution will be banned in the future. State Councillor Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai He's pollution, it is necessary to have a resolute attitude and action and carry out the work in a planned and systematic way. In this way, we can achieve practical results. We will never leave the polluted Huai He to the next century. Riparian local governments at all levels should conscientiously strengthen their leadership and supervision and inspection. They must carry out the water pollution control plan. They must clearly define their responsibility and achieve their goals within the set time. Any units that are slack in carrying out pollution control measures or shift their responsibility onto others and cause bad consequences will be criticized in circulars. If a case is serious, their leaders shall be investigated and affixed the responsibility for it. Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai He's pollution, it is necessary to adhere to the principle that "polluters are responsible for cleaning up." Through the cleaning-up process, it is imperative to help cadres and people living along the Huai He foster a sense of importance to protect the environment. We should establish a new norm of social behavior that is beneficial to the environmental protection. The drive to control the Huai He's pollution is China's first attempt to clean up the whole basin of a river that flows through several provinces. This will be a giant project involving a wide stretch of areas and many people. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we should mobilize leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people to actively participate in the work. We should launch a joint effort to control pollution in the Huai He. We must make the Huai He clean again in this century and provide experiences and methods for the drive to clean up other transregional rivers in China.
