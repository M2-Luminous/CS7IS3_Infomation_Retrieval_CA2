In its latest edition, the magazine ISTOE reports that Nuclear Industries of Brazil (INB) has sold the enriched uranium at a cost of $1.7 million. Flores said: The transaction will not bring any problems to the Brazilian nuclear program. He added that he would release today all the figures concerning Brazilian uranium reserves. Flores said he learned about the transaction after the contract had been signed, as INB is empowered to make these sales on its own. He said this was a good deal for INB, as the money it has obtained through this sale will make it possible to reactivate already this year the uranium mine of Pocos de Caldas, in Minas Gerais State. Regarding the possibility that the Brazilian uranium could be diverted to countries like Iraq, Iran, or India--to make bombs--Flores was even more emphatic. He said: It would be paranoid to believe that Canada, one of the most active verifiers of the use of nuclear energy, could divert the material. Canada, Flores said, is the ultimate destination of the Brazilian uranium sold to Nuexco.
