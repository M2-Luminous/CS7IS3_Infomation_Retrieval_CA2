FR940412-0-00007 FR940412-0-00002 An examination of the record in the 1992 rulemaking, which contains information that was not available when that NPRM was put out for comment, further supports the Commission's conclusion that this balance has now shifted so as to justify a broader interpretation. For example, a comment from an authorized committee of a major party presidential candidate stated that an unauthorized project using that candidate's name raised over $10,000,000 during the 1988 presidential election cycle, despite the candidate's disavowal of and efforts to stop these activities. The same unauthorized committee was raising money by means of a comparable project, using that same candidate's name, in the 1992 election cycle. This comment added that two other unauthorized projects by that same committee raised over $4,000,000 and nearly $400,000 in the name of two other presidential candidates in the 1988 election cycle. None of the named candidates received any of the money that was collected in their names. One of these candidates, a United States Senator, also submitted comments asking that the pertinent rules be strengthened. In addition, a television documentary, a videotape of which was placed in the rulemaking record, detailed how an unauthorized Political Action Committee had, over several election cycles, established numerous projects whose titles included the names of federal candidates. The named candidates had no connection with the projects, had not authorized the use of their names in this manner, and received no money from the $9 million raised in response to these appeals. Program investigators found that elderly people are particularly vulnerable to being misled in this manner, since they may not notice or fail to fully comprehend the disclaimers included with the solicitations. Such cases point up the potential for confusion or abuse when an unauthorized committee uses a candidate's name in the title of a special fundraising project, or other designation under which the committee operates. A person who receives such a communication may confuse the project name with the committee's registered name, and thus may not understand that the communication is made on behalf of the unauthorized committee rather than the candidate whose name appears in the project's title. Potential donors may think they are giving money to the candidate named in the project's title, when this is not the case. Some comments that opposed any modifications to the former standard argued that current disclaimer requirements at section 441d(a)(3) were sufficient to minimize the potential for confusion in this area. Others suggested stronger, or larger, disclaimers, in place of the overall ban. One suggested that the disclaimer be in as large and as bold a typeface as the largest, boldest use of the candidate's name anywhere in the communication. The Commission believes that such an approach could be more burdensome than the current ban, while still not solving the potential for fraud and abuse in this area. The requirement that checks be made only to the sponsoring committee's registered name would similarly not ensure that the contributor did not erroneously believe the money would be used to support the candidate(s) named in the project's title. It also would be difficult, if not practically impossible, to monitor and enforce, since nothing on the public record reflects who the payee is on a contributor's check. It is important to note that the ban applies only to project titles, and not to the body of the accompanying communication. Unauthorized committees remain free to discuss candidates throughout the communication; and to use candidates' names as frequently, and highlight them as prominently (in terms of size, typeface, location, and so forth) as they choose. In other words, while a committee could not establish a fundraising project called ``Citizens for Doe,'' if Doe is a federal candidate, it could use a subheading such as ``Help Us Elect Doe to Federal Office,'' and urge Doe's election, by name, in large, highlighted type, throughout the communication. Also, by amending the regulation to exclude from the ban names that indicate opposition to the named candidate, the Commission has acceded to the petitioner's main concern, amending the rules to permit the American Ideas Foundation to use the names of federal candidates in titles that clearly indicate opposition to such candidates. As stated in its summary of the petition (petition, p. 1), ``There is no danger of confusion or abuse inherent in the use of a candidate's name by a committee or project which opposes the candidate.'' The Commission recognizes that the potential for fraud and abuse is significantly reduced in the case of such titles, and has accordingly revised its rules to permit them.
