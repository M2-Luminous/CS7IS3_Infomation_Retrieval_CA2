The Kingdom also wants to see a more active role for the United Nations in the Middle East peace negotiations as well as in guaranteeing the protection of Palestinian citizens. "Jordan's declared position is that Palestinians in the occupied territories have to be protected," said the official, who asked he remain anonymous. Jordan, along with its Arab partners to the Arab-Israeli negotiations, pulled out of the Washington-based bilateral talks early in protest against the massacre of 60 worshippers in Hebron last week. The PLO has placed several conditions on the resumption of negotiations, including the dismantling of settlements especially in Hebron and the Gaza Strip, move the issue of settlements from final-status negotiations to be current negotiations, disarm settlers and increase the number of Palestinian policemen. Israel has already freed around 1,000 Palestinian detainees and announced it was ready to disarm 100 settlers. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, according to reports, was willing to accept international observers to supervise the transfer of power from Israel to Palestinians, possibly dismantle particularly trouble-some settlements, crack down on radical Jewish settlers and increse the size of the Palestinian police forces. "We believe that the best security arrangements are that settlements are dismantled especially in Jerusalem and Hebron, the official said. He said that these two areas are especially important because "of their historic value and the close contact between fundamentalist settlers and Palestinian residents in those areas." "Jordan also calls for U.N. participation in negotiations," the official said. But most importantly, the official said the issue of settlements should be moved forward to the current Arab-Israeli negotiations instead of relegating the sensitive debate to final-status negotiations. "Jordan always believed that the delaying of this issue will have dangerous ramifications," the official said. The official said that the head of the PLO political department, Faruq Qaddumi, will not visit Amman as previously scheduled and has instead gone to New York to discuss the proposed U.N. resolution on the Hebron massacre. U.S. and Palestinian diplomats had been holding negotiations at the U.N. headquarters in New York to work out disagreements on wording and reach a final draft for a U.N. Security resolution condemning the Hebron Massacre.
