FR940228-1-00112 FR940228-1-00010 The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that specifies that an institution must establish and maintain, on a current basis, financial and other institutional records necessary to determine the institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution. The Secretary believes it is essential for the Department to have access to this information when evaluating an institution's compliance with the requirements of the provisions governing the institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution. Further, an institution needs to maintain this information because, under its program participation agreement, the institution must agree to make the information available to appropriate authorities specified there (see the discussion on proposed §668.14). The Secretary proposes to require that all records required under the applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations be retained by the institution for at least five years from the time the record is established unless specific program regulations require that a record be kept for a period of time longer than five years. Five years is the standard period of time that institutions are required to keep most records under the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this is a reasonable period of time to require institutions to maintain most records so that the Department is able to evaluate the past performance of an institution. Section 668.26␣End of an Institution's Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs The Secretary proposes to clarify the purpose of the section currently titled ``Loss of institutional eligibility to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs'' by changing the title to ``End of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.'' The Secretary proposes to specify the date on which an institution's participation ends under a variety of circumstances to reflect statutory changes and to make clear existing practice. The Secretary has clarified in these proposed regulations the end of participation date currently used by the Department to be the date that: The institution closes or stops providing educational programs (the Secretary proposes, consistent with provisions proposed to be included in the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, to specify that this closure must be for a reason other than a normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the institution or the institution's students); the institution loses its institutional eligibility under 34 CFR part 600; the institution's participation is terminated under the proceedings in subpart G of this part; or the institution's program participation agreement is terminated or expires.
