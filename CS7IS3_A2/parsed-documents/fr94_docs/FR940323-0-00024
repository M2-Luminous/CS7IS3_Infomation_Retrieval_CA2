FR940323-0-00024 FR940323-0-00013 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300310A; FRL&hyph;4747&hyph;4] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Ronnel; Revocation of Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document revokes the tolerances for residues of the pesticide ronnel ( O,O -dimethyl O -dimethyl O -(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) phosphorothioate), including its 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-containing metabolites, in or on all raw agricultural commodities. EPA is taking this action because all registered uses of ronnel on these commodities have been canceled; therefore, there is no need to maintain these tolerances. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective March 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections and request for a hearing, identified by the document control number, [OPP-300310A], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (A-110), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be identified by the document control number and submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring copy of objections and hearing request to: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202. Fees accompanying objections shall be labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees'' and forwarded to: EPA Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, OPP (Tolerance Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Jeff Morris, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Special Review Branch, Crystal Station #1, 3rd Floor, 2800 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8029. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60573), EPA issued a rule that proposed to revoke tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the insecticide ronnel, including its 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-containing metabolites, in or on the commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.177. EPA proposed this because the insecticide ronnel is no longer registered in the United States for any food or animal feed crops (the sole manufacturer of ronnel, Dow Chemical Co., ceased all production of ronnel in 1979 and in 1986 voluntarily canceled its ronnel technical registration), and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical that is not registered for a particular food use. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance revocation will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance revocation is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: March 4, 1994. Victor J. Kimm, Acting Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. ยง180.177 [Removed] 2. Section 180.177 Ronnel; tolerances for residues is removed.
