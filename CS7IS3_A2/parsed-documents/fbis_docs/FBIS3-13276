Our Foreign Ministry's statement clarifies that the United States and the other mentors of Zionism who were the ringleaders in pushing the issuance of such a resolution have all remained silent on the massacre of fasting Muslims in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and have even prevented the issuance of a resolution condemning the Zionist regime by the UN Security Council. Therefore, under the current conditions the Islamic Republic of Iran considers this resolution to be a manifestation of the spite of the Western-Zionist circles vis-a-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran's independent policies, its defiance of superpower domination, and especially its refusal to assist in imposing humiliation on the Palestinian nation. It has now been proven to the world that the Western countries who support such resolutions have been hypocritically assisting in the inhuman crimes and flagrant violations of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the heart of Europe for a long time. The statement also refers to the political and social rights of the minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the fact that penal codes in Iran are based on the judicial system of Islam accepted and respected by more than 1 billion Muslims throughout the world, and emphasizes that the issuance of such resolutions mars the credibility of such forums.
