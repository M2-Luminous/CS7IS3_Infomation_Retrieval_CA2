This measure was announced by the Cuban president during the close of a special session of the National Assembly of the People's Government (ANPP) (parliament) convened to review and find solutions to the economic crisis facing the country. There is no other option; in Havana alone, the consumption of electricity has increased 24 percent because of the use of electric stoves due to the lack of other fuels, he said. He added, however, that the government will not rest a minute until it finds a solution to this situation. As for the increase of tobacco prices, the president asked for prudence and that estimates be made before the application of the measure because of its effect on the population. During the inauguration of the event the day before, Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended an increase in cigarette prices in a report to the ANPP, which could provide the government with 2 billion pesos in taxes per year, (a peso is equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate). Fidel Castro pointed out that the decisions to be adopted in this area are aimed at overcoming the current crisis, which he compared to the 10-year war period of 1868-78, the first Cuban attempt to militarily achieve independence from Spain. In this regard, he pointed out that even though many considered it impossible, four years after the collapse of the socialist bloc, "here is Cuba, in the Caribbean, and 90 miles from the United States."
