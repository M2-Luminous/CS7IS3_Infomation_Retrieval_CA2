The votes of Marvin Cheung Kin-tung and Timothy Ha Wing-ho might decide the fate of Mr Patten's two-year battle for greater democracy in the territory. Neither could be reached last night. Some Legislative Council [Legco] members admitted that the battle between Mr Patten's proposal and the Liberal Party package which seeks to bring electoral changes more in line with the Basic Law, had become a "neck-and-neck" race. They say the margin would be in the range of "one or two votes." The chances of the Liberal Party holding sway in Legco tomorrow took a sharp turn for the better yesterday, when seven pro-China legislators indicated they had changed their earlier position and would lend their support to the watered-down proposals. The seven are Tam Yiu-chung, Chim Pui-chung, Philip Wong Yu- hong, Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja, Alfred Tso Shiu-wai, Dr Tang Siu-tong, and David Li Kwok-po. A senior mainland official said last night: "The choice is clear: the Liberal Party proposal is better than Patten's. There are now two proposals on the table. We are in effect supporting Patten's if we do not support the Liberal Party's." The official said Beijing would spell out clearly that support for the Liberal Party alternative did not mean that its political structure would survive after 1997. Beijing, however, has not put pressure on pro-China legislators to support the package, the official said. "The chances of success for the Liberal Party proposal is now 50/50. There might be some accidental factors at the debate. We can't say which proposal will win... After all, I do believe that Patten will have his ways to get his proposals passed," he said. A senior official said last night the government still believed that its proposal would win a majority in Legco. The vote, however, hinges on the independents. With 15 votes from its members and the seven of pro-China colleagues, the Liberal Party needs eight more from independents to impose its package. Three independents, Eric Li Ka-cheung, Elsie Tu, and Roger Luk Koon-ho, said they would support the Liberal Party amendments. It is believed those in favour of the amendments include Samuel Wong Ping-wai, Simon Ip Sik-on, Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen and Martin Barrow. The Liberal Party pressed Mr Patten to instruct the three officials who sit in Legco not to cast their votes. But in a statement issued after Mr Patten's meeting with three Liberal Party leaders, a government spokesman said Mr Patten had made it clear that the three ex-officio members would vote in support of the government proposal. Mr Patten said it would be wrong to make artificial distinctions between councillors in the way suggested by the Liberal Party. "Every member of the council has the right to vote and every vote is of equal weight." The spokesman pointed to the fact that apart from the three official members there were another 18 appointed members. Eight of these appointed members are also members of the Liberal Party.
