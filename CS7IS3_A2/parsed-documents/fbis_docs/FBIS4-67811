It also pointed out that A. Kuntsevich has been released from his post ``for a single gross violation of work duties.'' The Press Service did not explain what kind of violation this was, and Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, said at a briefing that there were such violations. But Kuntsevich's closest colleagues do not know of them, and he himself, so he declared in conversation with me, had not heard about this and learned of his dismissal only in a call from IZVESTIYA's editorial office. Let us leave aside this, not the first occasion when someone released from a high state post learns of this from press reports. Particularly a prominent scientist who is one of the creators of the most sophisticated Soviet chemical weapons, winner of the Lenin Prize, hero of socialist labor, lieutenant general, and academician who, at the end of his scientific career, resolutely set about destroying these weapons. Let us ask ourselves a different question: Why, after all, has Academician Kuntsevich been removed from his post, and what true reason hides behind the vague wording ``single gross violation of work duties''? There are several answers to this question. One version was suggested by observers: Kuntsevich has suffered...for the complete failure of the case of chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov, which he supposedly initiated. In conversation with me the academician categorically denied his involvement in the ``Mirzayanov case,'' although he has repeatedly and harshly condemned Mirzayanov's action. In any case, the responsibility for that shameful trial lies, in my opinion, with the law enforcement organs. The reason for Academician Kuntsevich's dismissal lies far deeper than it seems. It lies in our country's economic and technical inability and unpreparedness to fulfill its international obligations to destroy chemical weapons. The program for the destruction of these weapons has not yet been approved either by parliament or by the government. The funding of all measures connected with preparations for the direct salvaging of toxins and ammunition is proceeding extremely irregularly and plainly inadequately, not to mention the actual program of their destruction. This year alone the preparations to rid Russia of chemical weapons are to cost 10.4 billion [currency not specified], but this [money] simply does not exist. Academician Kuntsevich was categorically opposed to the destruction of chemical weapons without resolving social problems and without guarantees for the population resident in the places where they are stored and where it is proposed to salvage them. But sufficient funds have not been found for just these purposes. The program is slipping and is today under threat of being wrecked. The Convention Committee tried to find nonbudgetary funds to implement the chemical disarmament program. In many ways it succeeded. We were given assistance in resolving these problems by the United States (the total amount exceeded $60 million for the development of a safe and efficient technology for the destruction of toxins), the FRG, Sweden, and the EEC, and contacts were initiated with NATO. I am not sure if they will be broken off with Kuntsevich's departure from his post, but they will certainly be complicated somewhat -- the academician's authority in international scientific circles is very great. One thing remains beyond doubt -- by signing the Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Paris in 1993 along with 155 other states, Russia assumed juridical obligations to start parting with them in two years' time. It will hardly be able to keep to this deadline.
