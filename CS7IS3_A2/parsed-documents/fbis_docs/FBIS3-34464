His excellency praised the attitude of the Lome Convention states in asking the European Union to be patient and to respond to Sudan's invitation to send a joint fact-finding mission. The Lome Convention states said the convention would lose credibility if it let itself be exploited as a tool to increase the difficulties faced by any of its peoples. Mr. Baridu also reviewed the activities of Sudan's delegation during the meetings of the OAU ministerial council held recently in Addis Ababa. His excellency also described the massacre perpetrated by the Serbian forces against defenseless civilians in Sarajevo as a hideous crime that shook the pillars of the accords of international legality and highlighted the weakness of the new world order. Baridu affirmed that the great powers, the members of the Security Council, had badly failed in their efforts to solve the issue of Bosnia, saying that this failure would diminish the UN's importance. He said Sudan had issued a statement demanding the lifting of the siege on Sarajevo and for the Muslim Bosnian people to be allowed to obtain weapons to defend themselves.
