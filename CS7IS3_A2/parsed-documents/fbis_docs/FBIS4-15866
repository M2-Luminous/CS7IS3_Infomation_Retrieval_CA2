With what outcome? The City Duma elections were declared valid in just 16 of the 34 districts. The enthusiasm of the city's inhabitants was dampened by the postponement of elections for the mayor of Niznhiy Novgorod and the referendum on the city's charter. The results of the formation of the oblast parliament are more indicative and objective. There were 206 candidates running for 45 seats. The overwhelming majority of them were not affiliated to any party. But, among the candidates as a whole, quite a different affiliation, not registered anywhere, "appeared" of its own accord -- the "party of power." It is made up of officials from the executive structures: rayon and city administration heads and department and administration staffers. One noticeable aspect of the Nizhniy Novgorod elections was the appearance of the "Spring" Alliance. This association of young entrepreneurs backed a large group of its colleagues to run as candidates. The "Spring" Alliance, sparing no expense, tested the suitability of Western standards of political advertising on the Nizhniy Novgorod public. The entire election campaign conducted by "Spring" was like a carnival. Air balloons were launched, bright posters displayed, and "star" concerts organized, and the opportunities offered by local radio and television were used extensively. The overall results of the elections for the Oblast Legislative Assembly read as follows: 32 deputies out of 45 were elected. Of these, 19, or 42 percent, were administration heads and their deputies ("party of power"); 7, or 16 percent, were economic managers; and 6, or 13 percent, were journalists, scientists, and trade union officials. People are tired of fruitless political rhetoric. They want to live normal lives, and pin their hope on people exercising actual power and experienced in economic management, and it is for them that the people of Nizhniy Novgorod voted.
