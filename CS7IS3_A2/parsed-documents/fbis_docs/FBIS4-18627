The Commission's decision is based on article 225 of the EC treaty which applies to cases in which article 224 has been cited unjustifiably by a member state in support of unilateral measures which would otherwise be in violation of Community law. The implementation of the decision is suspended until 13 april 1994. At the same time, the Commission issued an appeal to the governments of Greece and FYROM to renew their dialogue in an effort to resolve the points in contention between them. The Commission called upon FYROM to reconsider its position on questions in contention regarding its constitution and flag as part of a search for a simultaneous solution to all outstanding issues including the name of the state. The Commission is continuing its efforts to facilitate the resumption of dialogue between Athens and Skopje and is in touch with all the parties concerned, in close liaison with Mr. Cyrus Vance, the United Nations mediator, and with Mr. Mathew Nimetz, the United States envoy. On 16 february, the Greek Government took unilateral measures towards FYROM aimed at preventing trade through the port of Thessaloniki of goods coming from or going to FYROM as well as the import into Greece of products from FYROM. Since then, the Commission has repeatedly been in contact with the Greek Government in order to ascertain and to evaluate the reasons put forward to justify the embargo. As these arguments, which are based on article 224 of the EC [Euroepan Commission] treaty involve political considerations related to public security in Greece and the risk of war, they were discussed by the European Union's foreign ministers at their meeting in Ioannina on 27 march 1994. This discussion confirmed the Commission's doubt as to whether these arguments are well-founded and as to whether the measures are compatible with Greece's obligations under the EC treaty, particularly in the areas of customs union, the common commercial policy and the internaL market. Despite calls upon Greece by the Commission and by the foreign ministers to lift the measures, they still remain in force. Accordingly, as guardian of the treaty and as an institution responsible for ensuring the consistency of the Union's external activities, the Commission has decided to bring this question before the European Court of Justice.
