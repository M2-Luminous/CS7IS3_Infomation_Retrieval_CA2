Election results show a significant increase for the Political Spring party, a greater proportional increase for the Coalition of the Left and Progress, and a sizable increase for KKE [Greek Communist Party] and DIANA [Democratic Renewal]. The initial consequences may be a corrective shift toward the governing party, and a serious reaction to the leadership's policy toward New Democracy. The elections for the European Parliament show that it was affected more by the domestic situation and the country's internal problems than from the European aspect of the elections. [passage omitted] The two largest parties fared just under the level of the previous elections for the European Parliament but the significant increase of Political Spring confirms the split in the conservative faction. At the same time, the Coalition of the Left and Progress and KKE showed that they tended toward their traditional overall level. Yesterday's elections also gives a message about the upcoming presidential election in May 1995. The message is that the lack a presidential majority cannot be ruled out, something that will lead to new general elections. [passage omitted]
