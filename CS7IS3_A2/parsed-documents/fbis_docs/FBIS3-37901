"The State Duma replaced the notion of `pardoning' by `amnesty' thus exceeding its authority. According to the Russian Constitution pardoning is the right of the president", national security aide Yuriy Baturin told TASS on Thursday. He explained that there is a big difference between "pardoning" and "amnesty". An amnesty frees people convicted for certain crimes, while only concrete people can be pardoned. Baturin also said that the Duma decision is contradicting the principles of law because "there are dead bodies while there are nobody guilty". He was referring to over 140 killed during the October revolt and the policeman killed during the May Day demonstration last year. He stressed that the principle of power sharing between authorities had also been violated as, according to the Constitution, it is only the court which can decide whether defendants are guilty or not. "Thus it would be better to wait with pardoning until a court verdict", Baturin said. The national security aide believes the Constitutional Court could have helped in the dispute. "But as the law on its activities has not been adopted yet, the president, as the guarantor of the Constitution has the right to demand that the office of the prosecutor general and heads of departments do not fulfill the resolution of the State Duma which does not abide by the principles of the Constitution and Russian laws", Baturin said. He added that the Russian prosecutor general may file a protest against the Duma decision which, according to the law, is to be considered by the lower chamber. In Baturin's personal opinion the Duma decision was "a political-emotional act, rather that a juridical step".
