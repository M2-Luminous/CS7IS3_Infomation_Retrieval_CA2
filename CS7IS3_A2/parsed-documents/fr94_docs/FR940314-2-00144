FR940314-2-00144 FR940314-2-00074 Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Notice of Determination; Decabromodiphenyl Oxide, Etc. AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces a determination, under notice 89&hyph;61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code will be modified to include decabromodiphenyl oxide and tetrabromobisphenol-A. EFFECTIVE DATE: This modification is effective July 1, 1990. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. Determination On July 9, 1991, the Secretary determined that decabromodiphenyl oxide and tetrabromobisphenol-A should be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. The rate of tax prescribed for decabromodiphenyl oxide, under section 4671(b)(3), is $7.41 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for bromine of 1.666. The rate of tax prescribed for tetrabromobisphenol-A, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.22 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for bromine of 1.175. The petitioner is Ethyl Corporation, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material comments were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis for the determinations. Decabromodiphenyl oxide HTS number:␣␣2909.30.07 CAS number:␣␣1163&hyph;19&hyph;5 Decabromodiphenyl oxide is derived from the taxable chemical bromine. Decabromodiphenyl oxide is a solid produced predominantly by direct bromination of diphenyl oxide in the presence of a catalyst. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for decabromodiphenyl oxide is: C 12 OH 10 (diphenyl oxide) + 10 Br 2 (bromine) __> C 12 OBr 10 (decabromodiphenyl oxide) + 10 HBr (hydrogen bromide). Decabromodiphenyl oxide has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 90.3 percent by weight of the materials used in its production. Tetrabromobisphenol-A HTS number:␣␣2908.10.25 CAS number:␣␣79&hyph;94&hyph;7 Tetrabromobisphenol-A is derived from the taxable chemical bromine. Tetrabromobisphenol-A is a solid produced predominantly by the reaction of bromine with bisphenol-A. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for tetrabromobisphenol-A is: C 15 H 16 O 2 (bisphenol-A) + 4 Br 2 (bromine) __> C 15 H 12 O 2 Br 4 (tetrabromobisphenol-A) + 4 HBr (hydrogen bromide). Tetrabromobisphenol-A has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 73.7 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
