That is certainly long enough to consider the initial results of the circulation of the new money and what effect this unavoidable step has had on the country's economy. It was indeed unavoidable, although banknotes and coins manufactured beforehand in Britain, were ready and waiting, but the government thought that at that time Turkmenia was not yet fully prepared for the switch to its own currency. It was only when it became obvious that the Russian authorities were planning to force their CIS neighbors out of the ruble zone that Turkmenia accelerated the introduction of the manat. November was a month of euphoria and...empty pocketbooks. The exchange of citizens' savings was carried out in such a way as to drastically reduce the money supply. However, even with a mere handful of coins in his pocket, a person felt quite solvent. For 5 kopeks (that is what people here habitually call the small change -- the tenge) you could buy the latest newspaper or eat a bread roll, and for 20 you could buy a loaf or stick of wheaten bread. With 2 chervonets, you could buy 10 eggs, some green vegetables, and a couple of kilograms of apples. Potatoes cost 1 manat, and, just as in the good old days of stagnation, traders would stick cardboard price tickets into their piles of late melons, saying "1 melon -- 1 ruble." And although, after the first pay packets were issued in the new money, the Turkmens learned to count their small change in a new way, for an average wage of 400 manats you could not only feed yourself, but also buy, say, a pair of Italian shoes for 110 manats or a washing machine for 120 manats. Alas, November and December, when the family budget was "tight" but you could fill a bag with food products for a small sum, are remembered here today as months of plenty and days of bright hopes which, unfortunately, are not yet fated to become reality. In Turkmenia it is still not the custom to publish information on the inflation rate or to calculate the cost of the consumer basket, but every inhabitant of the Republic can see for himself every day how life is growing increasingly expensive. Meat prices in the bazaars have risen from 5 to 50 manats a kilogram, the cost of fruit and vegetables has also gone up, for the third month in succession the shelves of stores selling industrial products are practically empty, and in the few commercial stores the prices are certainly not suited to people who are living only on a wage. And without the continuing government subsidies on flour and bread for the population, so that bread still costs 20-30 tenge, without the free provision of electricity, natural gas, and water and the very low cost of housing, of sending children to preschool institutions, and of travel on public transport, things would be very tight indeed for the Turkmens. It is certainly not the manat as such that is to blame for the fact that the Republic, which in all previous years had a deficit-free budget, is today spending more than it receives. The financial hole in the state's pocket was caused by the huge debts of the former brothers in the Union for natural gas supplied in the past year. It is no joking matter that Turkmenia is owed $1.5 billion by Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and the other CIS countries -- a shortfall of nearly 380 "greenbacks" for every local inhabitant. The main debtors -- Ukraine and Georgia -- asked for their last year's debt of $700 million and $200 million respectively to be classified as a Turkmen Government loan. Their wishes were accommodated, but the first two months of this year elapsed without either Ukraine or Georgia keeping its promise -- to pay for gas every 10 days. It was necessary to resort to extreme measures and close the valves on the pipelines to Ukraine. But apparently the Ukrainian authorities are today more worried about the purely internal political struggle and the disastrous decline of their own economy. President Saparmurad Niyazov and his team are intensively seeking a way out of the crisis situation. Preparations have been stepped up for the implementation if the plan for a gas pipeline which will convey Turkmen natural fuel via Iran and Turkey to Europe. The possibility of pumping gas through Afghanistan to Pakistan is being examined. A major reform of the agrarian sector is under way: More than 50,000 hectares of formerly unused land has been handed over to private ownership. But for the moment the manat remains a sideshoot of the dollar and the ruble. Its real rate is falling rapidly. Having ostensibly been set as equivalent to 50 cents and 500 Russian rubles in November, today it only runs to 1 cent and 20 rubles. The lack of Russian currency in the banks has been a severe blow to state and business structures, which are 80 percent "tied" to Russia. Contracts are being broken, former links are being lost, and business circles can be heard increasingly frequently dreaming: "If only we were back in the ruble area! We cannot survive without Russia yet..." As for survival, this is, of course, a slight exaggeration. But common sense and the example of Belorusia [Belarus] suggests that it is not a question of what picture there is on the banknotes, but of preventing them from degenerating into pretty colored candy wrappers.
