Two nights ago, the defenders of the city received six of our fellow citizens on the demarcation line in the People's Revolution Boulevard [Bulevar Narodne Revolucije]. They were ruthlessly expelled by HVO fighters late at night, without even being allowed to take with them the most basic belongings. At 1330 today, another six people -- mostly women, children, and old folk -- arrived in the eastern, free part of the city across the [word indistinct] bridge from the direction of the airport [word indistinct]. They were forcefully evicted from their homes. Boban's fighters came wearing hoods over their heads, these expelled Mostar people told me, with the obvious motive of looting and moving into other people's homes. [passage omitted] The [Mostar] War Presidency sees this latest wave of ethnic cleansing of the Bosniak Muslims from the western part of Mostar as part of the long-term project to change completely the demographic structure of the Neretva River Valley. The final outcome is to have a Croatian majority in the Mostar commune and the Neretva River Valley, who would then -- in the final stage of breaking up Bosnia-Herzegovina -- decide in a referendum to live in the Croatian state.
