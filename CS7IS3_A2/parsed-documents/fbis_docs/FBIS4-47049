Considering the results of the South Korean leader's recent travels, we can assume that he views discussion of this issue as one of the main objectives of his visit to Russia. The results of his recent trips to Japan and China also show that the essence of the 'nuclear issue in North Korea,' exaggerated by the South Koreans in the footsteps of their transoceanic patrons, amounts to an attempt to slander and discredit the DPRK and then try to crush and destroy it. The Russian Society for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the DPRK expresses serious alarm and the fear that the South Korean visitor will succeed in finding supporters in Russia for his unprecedentedly impudent claims. The DPRK is our sovereign ally. Therefore, if there truly were a need to officially discuss 'the nuclear issue in North Korea,' it would be entirely natural to invite Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, to participate in such a discussion. This is a truth not requiring any special proof and falling within the realm of ordinary international practice. The ancient Greeks had an immutable rule: 'Let the other side state its point of view.' The Russian Society for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the Democratic People's Republic of Korea earnestly asks you, esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, to take these considerations into account and see to it that a state friendly to us--the DPRK--is not harmed for many decades to come."
