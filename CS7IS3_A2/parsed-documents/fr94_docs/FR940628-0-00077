FR940628-0-00077 FR940628-0-00019 §195.3 Matter incorporated by reference. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) American Gas Association (AGA): AGA Pipeline Research Committee, Project PR&hyph;3&hyph;805, ``A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe'' (December 1989). The RSTRENG program may be used for calculating remaining strength. * * * * * 9. Section 195.5 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) to read as follows: §195.5 Conversion to service subject to this part. (a) * * * (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or more of the variables necessary to verify the design pressure under §195.106 or to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum operating pressure determined by_ (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N, to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure that produces a yielding, the design factor F in §195.106(a) and the appropriate factors in §195.106(e). * * * * * (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by §195.406. * * * * * 10. Section 195.50(f) is revised to read as follows: §195.50 Reporting accidents. * * * * * (f) Estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000. 11. Section 195.52(a)(3) is revised to read as follows: §195.52 Telephonic notice of certain accidents. (a) *␣*␣* (3) Caused estimated property damage, including cost of cleanup and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000; * * * * * 12. Section 195.106(b) is revised to read as follows: §195.106 Internal design pressure. * * * * * (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the following: (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the tensile tests of API Specification 5L on randomly selected specimens with the following number of tests: ␣ 1Pipe size 1No. of tests Less than 168.3 mm (65/8 in) nominal outside diameter One test for each 200 lengths. 168.3 through 323.8 mm (65/8 through 123/4 in) nominal outside diameter One test for each 100 lengths. Larger than 323.8 mm (123/4 in) nominal outside diameter One test for each 50 lengths. (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield strength shall be taken as 165,474 kPa (24,000 psi). If the average yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is taken as the lower of the following: (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile tests. (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests. (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 165,474 kPa (24,000 psi). * * * * *
