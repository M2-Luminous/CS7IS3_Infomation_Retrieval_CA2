The congress would pave the way for a "legitimate representative body for the Lebanese people because it is now impossible to organise any political activity in Lebanon to confront the occupation," General 'Awn told AL-NAHAR newspaper on Wednesday [13 April]. "As long as Syria maintains its presence in Lebanon, the country's stability will be in jeopardy," 'Awn was quoted as saying by AL-NAHAR. Supporters of 'Awn said the renegade Lebanese army general announced earlier this month that a committee was to be set up to prepare for a "Liberation and Renewal" congress to be held in Paris on June 11. A government official told AFP any political activity by 'Awn would be a clear violation of an agreement with France, which has granted him political asylum since 1991. Lebanon feels that France is not respecting its engagements and the relations between the two countries could suffer, said the official who declined to be identified. On Tuesday Lebanese pro-Syrian Labour Minister 'Abdallah al-Amin said Lebanon was planning to ask France to extradite 'Awn, warning ties could worsen if Paris turned down the request. 'Awn was granted political asylum in France after he was banished from Lebanon in 1991, on condition he avoided any political activity. The Lebanese army officer led a military government in the late 1980s that had refused to step down after presidential elections. He had fought Syrian troops in a "war of liberation." But 'Awn was driven out of the presidential palace in a joint Syrian-Lebanese offensive, ordered to stay out of Lebanon and refrain from political activity until 1996. Syria maintains some 35,000 troops in Lebanon, where Israel also occupies a self-declared "security zone" along the international border.
