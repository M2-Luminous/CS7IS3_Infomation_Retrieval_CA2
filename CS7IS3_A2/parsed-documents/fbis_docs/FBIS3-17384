According to the document, the two sides will look into the possibilities for cooperation in space research, physics of circumterrestrial space, the mutual impact between the sun and the earth, space-based scanning of the earth, space biology and aeronautics. In part, the declaration proposed using the Ukrainian scientific vessels Yuriy Gagarin and Academician Korolev. According to NSAU Director General Vladimir Gorbulin, the vessels were used to maintain space communications in times when the former Soviet Union still existed. "Nowadays they are out of service and are a heavy burden for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry," he pointed out. Gorbulin said the talks failed to touch on the possibility of bilateral cooperation in producing spacecraft and using space transportation systems which is of great importance for Ukraine. In his opinion, that was caused by Ukraine's failure in 1992 to back the U.S. proposal to expose its missile technologies to international control. At the moment, as many as 26 countries have signed the agreement.
