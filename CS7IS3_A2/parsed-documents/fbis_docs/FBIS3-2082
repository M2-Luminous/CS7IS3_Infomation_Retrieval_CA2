It is disclosed that as the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing nearer and nearer, Zhongnanhai has ordered that "every measure be taken at whatever expense" to maintain stability across the country. Information has it that the mission to keep down commodity prices has become the "central" task for China's major economic management sector. Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, and Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the commission, have been named to run this massive price-curbing operation, which will be carried out with the involvement and cooperation of a few other departments. In order to mitigate the drastically soaring trend of commodity prices, a series of actions will be adopted soon, including convening an urgent national telephone conference, launching a nationwide general inspection of commodity prices, and taking some necessary administrative actions to set price ceilings for some means of subsistence. The whole operation will be fully launched by 7 March, with different phases started one after another. The margin of price hikes in China has remained at a two-digit level since last year. Despite the macroeconomic regulation and control policy that was introduced in last July with the aim of cooling down the economy, the momentum of price hikes has not been curbed, with the commodity price index rising from 19.5 percent in May to 22 percent in August in 35 major cities. Then, last November, the country experienced a drastic increase in the prices of grain, edible oil, and foodstuffs, with grain prices alone rising by over 40 percent in some localities. Although grain prices were temporarily stabilized after 5 billion kg of grain reserves were sold on the market and some administrative actions taken by the state, the price increase trend was not completely halted. The price index in 35 major cities for January this year, as released by the State Statistics Bureau, remained as high as 23.3 percent. Some Beijing experts noted that China is now facing the fourth commodity price "blast wave" after the three price increase peak periods in 1985, 1986, and 1988. An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC higher leadership is deeply worried about the persistent high inflation rate. And the commodity price issue will be a politically sensitive one this year, particularly because this will be a "year of reform" and also the year to see the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident. Early this year, a central department concerned pointed out in a most confidential document: This year will see the fifth anniversary of the 1989 "Beijing contretemps" (that is, the 4 June incident), "hostile forces" at home and abroad will be doing something. From last year onward, more and more of those who went abroad before and after 1989 will be returning to China (many of them have acquired the right of residence in foreign countries). Meanwhile, those who were arrested because of involvement in the 4 June incident are now being discharged from prison, and they may still be playing a role as "unstable factors," although most of them have now turned to work in the economic field. In view of this fact, the document noted that it is necessary to step up the "anti- subversion struggle" in the economic field, pay close attention to these people's activities after joining the business circles, and guard against any attempt by them to confront the authorities or engage in illegal political activities by making use of economic means or under economic camouflage. It is said that to cope with this development the Chinese public security and state security sectors have set up special departments to keep watch on the economic circles as well as dissidents in business circles.
