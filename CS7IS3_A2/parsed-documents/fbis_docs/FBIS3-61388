Borodayev: "The Railroad and the National Economy"] [Text] Of course, journalists frequently turn to the chief of the Moldovan Railroad, G. Mikenberg, with their questions. However, it was perhaps for the first time in the last few years that so many representatives of the mass media gathered in his office. The press conference was organized on the occasion of the issuance of the government Decree on Measures To Develop Railway Transportation. This was a long-awaited decree. G. Mikenberg dwelled on its key aspects. The document provides for developing the Program and Chart for the Long-Range Development of Railway Transportation, taking into account its integration into the European transportation complex, as well as building new sections of the network and upgrading certain most significant facilities. In addition to the proprietary funds of the railroad, appropriations from the republic budget, bank credit, and off-budget funds are supposed to be allocated for the development of railway transportation. The feasibility of attracting foreign capital and loans from international organizations for purchasing rolling stock and the most significant types of machinery and materials was acknowledged. The task was set to organize in Moldova the repairs of certain types of cars, devices, and equipment and the manufacturing of spare parts, making use of the production capacity of local industrial enterprises. The adoption of the decree does not at all mean that the railroad is indebted to the state. On the contrary, the railroad of Moldova operates in a stable and profitable manner, without subsidies. It fully meets the need for freight and passenger carriage alike, is converting two sections to electric traction, and is building a new spur line, Revaca-Cainari, which will make it possible to reduce the distance to the station Bessarabskaya by more than 100 kilometers. However, a number of specific difficulties have recently developed that the railroaders are not in a position to overcome solely with their own resources. In the last two years, the railroad has not received a single diesel motor coach train, a single freight or passenger car, or a single wooden tie. Some 32 percent of diesel motor coach trains qualify for retirement. The numbers of broken-down passenger and freight cars are snowballing. More than 1 million rotten ties lie on main and entry-and-exit tracks. This is an alarm signal from the railway sounding full blast. At present, it is still able to handle the volume of carriage, whereas tomorrow a crisis may break out in the course of which not only the carriage of freight and passengers will fail to be ensured, but the guarantee of safe traffic will also disappear. This is why it is hard to overrate the issuance of the government decree. There is no way to do without foreign investment. At present, one compartment coach costs 1.1 million Deutsche Marks, and a diesel motor coach train, $5 million. In addition, it has been resolved to build the Chisinau-Bucharest main line. To be sure, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has taken an interest in this project and is prepared to invest in construction. Moldova received 13,000 cars as a result of the division of the car stock among CIS countries. There are many cars that are somewhat difficult to repair because of the erstwhile strict specialization. We have begun to repair certain things in overhaul workshops here. The rest we send for repairs to other states selecting places that are cheaper and more advantageous. However, even this claims considerable funds. All the enumerated problems are objective. There are a great many subjective ones! They are threatening to tear the railroad into pieces. In this instance, furious assault has been mounted on the part of Ukraine. Over there, it has been resolved at the level of the parliament to take away from Moldova the stations that are located on the territory of Ukraine. If they succeed the railway of Moldova will be torn into six sections. To the credit of railroad personnel, we must say that they are also preparing for the worst. A number of scenarios have already been developed under which the unity of the railroad and the management of technical processes will be maintained. Nonetheless, they are awaiting with hope the results of government-to-government negotiations between Moldova and Ukraine that will dot all "i's" in railroad property disputes between the two states. What about the Dniester area? Over there, they just would not give up the desire to establish their jurisdiction over the subdivisions of the railroad located on the Left Bank. The economic absurdity of such striving has been proven. However, yet another cycle of their expansion is building up again. But the appetites of Right Bank officials are no smaller. The Ministry of Health Care is simply obsessed with the notion of taking health care establishments away from the railroad personnel. The government rejected these claims. They did not calm down, and appealed to the parliament. The parliament acted the same way the government had. A new attack is now beginning. Why is the Ministry of Health so bent on doing it? There is one argument: All medical establishments should report to a single center. However, departmental medical services of the railways have been codified in all CIS countries, in Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary because of the specifics of railway transportation. What specifics? There is a special approach to employees who are associated with traffic, that is, traffic safety and the lives of a multitude of people. There are special requirements for sight, hearing, fatigue resistance, and psychological condition. There are prerun examinations of locomotive engineers. There are intricacies of occupational hygiene. There are services to railway workers who live in out-of-the-way locations--at junction points, small stations, and so on. The attitude toward employees on the part of the mayor's office of the city is hard to understand. On one occasion, they took away a secondary school, on another, the building housing a committee of the trade union of railroad workers and the editorial office of the industry newspaper. They are now trying to liquidate the children's hospital of the railroad--notwithstanding that the railroad has built in Chisinau huge residential subdivisions, hospitals, polyclinics, shops, and the Palace of Culture (which, incidentally, they are also dyeing). The railroad is continuing to build a lot of beautiful things, and helping the city to meet its needs. How can they fail to appreciate this contribution to urban facilities? How can they trample on the rights of railway workers? The fact that the government has stated weightily by way of its decree that it is extending its wardship and protection to the main line should cool off the fervor and ambitions of some zealous figures who wish to destroy the enterprise that has evolved for a long time, as well as a stable collective.
