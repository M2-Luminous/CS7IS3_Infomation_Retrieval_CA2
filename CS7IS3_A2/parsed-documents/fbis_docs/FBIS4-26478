With China and Russia having had their economic policies in place, the Sino-Russian border trade is expected to be prosperous once again. Since summer this year, trade talks between China and Russia have become more active. In an international economic and trade conference held in Jiamusi City in Heilongjiang Province in early June, the trade volume increased to RMB 5 billion [renminbi] from several hundred million made in such trade talks held in the past years. The recovery of the border trade was seen as one of important reasons. The official in charge of the border trade in the City attributed the recovery of the Sino-Russian border trade to the following factors: First, China and Russia have mutual-complementary market demands. Despite of Japanese and South Korean products pouring into the Russian market, it is hard for the Russian consumers to accept due to their high prices. Russians still prefer the Chinese products which are of good quality but sell at lower prices. On the other hand, China also needs Russian-made steel products, timber, glass, cars and machines as well as the advanced and new technology in particular. The Chinese side and the Russian side have imposed strict inspection over passports held by their economic and trade staff and a ban on speculators to enter and leave their countries. The two sides have also reached the relevant agreement on development of the border trade. All these have created relaxed circumstances for the Sino-Russian border trade. The Chinese customs and the foreign trade departments have strenghtened inspection over the exports to prevent counterfeit and low quality products from flowing out of the country. They have also hosted various kinds of exhibitions of Chinese products of high quality to raise confidence of the Russian consumers in the Chinese products.
