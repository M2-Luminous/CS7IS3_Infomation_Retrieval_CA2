Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Jericho within three weeks. Both parties will take all the steps necessary to prevent terrorism, crime, and any acts of violence. Israel will be able to take interdictory measures in the areas where it is responsible for security with the intention of bringing any incidents to a rapid conclusion and turning them over to the Palestinian police to handle. The use of firearms will be prohibited, except in the case of immediate danger. Shots will be fired solely for the purpose of deterrence. Israelis, including IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, will be permitted to use the roads in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Palestinians will be able to travel on the roads crossing through the Israeli settlements. The Palestinian authority will be composed of 24 members and will be responsible for all legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The judicial powers of the Palestinian authority will not apply to Israelis. Israel retains judicial authority over the Israeli settlements. The Palestinian authority will have no powers in the field of foreign relations, and it will be unable to establish embassies and consulates.
