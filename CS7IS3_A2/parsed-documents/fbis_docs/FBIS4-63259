At the morning sitting, Leonid Hrach, Communist Party of Crimea first secretary, made a speech in which he called on deputies to "maintain common sense and not unleash a military conflict." However, deputies decided to renew the text of the 6 May 1992 version of the Republic of Crimea constitution (69 deputies voted in favor and 2 abstained). In accordance with the text of the constitution, mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine should be built on the basis of agreements and treaties. The constitution also mentions dual citizenship and creating Crimean military formations. Before the vote, the Crimean Tatar Kurultay's [congress] group announced it would not take part in the voting. People's Deputy Oleksandr Kruhlov, leader of the Sevastopol branch of the National Salvation Front of Russia, promised "in the event of a military conflict, 80,000 Kuban cossacks would defend the Crimean constitution." As Vyacheslav Lebedyev, the Crimean president's press secretary, said Yuriy Meshkov and acting Minister of State Affairs Viktor Minin flew to Krasnodarskiy Kray at 8.30 "in connection with the recent signing in Moscow of an intergovernmental agreement between the Republic of Crimea and the Russian Federation." It is expected that Yuriy Meshkov will return to take part in the parliament's work in the second half of the day. General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea minister of internal affairs of the republic -- appointed on 19 May by the parliament -- reported to an UNIAN correspondent, "the situation on the peninsula is quiet, the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Crimea are fulfilling the duties they are charged with." According to him, Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov, chief of the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in Crimea under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine -- appointed by Leonid Kravchuk's decree -- is now in Simferopol, "and if he wishes to visit the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Crimea, we shall let him in. However, he does not command anyone and the fulfillment of the duties he was charged with by the president of Ukraine is out of the question." The deputies to the Crimean parliament elected a plenipotentiary commission to hold negotiations with the Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president of Ukraine, consisting of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council; Serhiy Nikulin, chairman of the commission for legislation; Refat Chubarov, chairman of the Kurultay group; Deputies Volodymyr Klychnykov, Yuriy Podkopayev, and others. Commenting at UNIAN's request on the developments at the Supreme Council of Crimea, Leonid Hrach, chairman of the Communist Party of the Republic of Crimea, said after such steps by the Crimean parliament, Ukraine has all grounds to take any measures. "I hope the Supreme Council of Ukraine will show political wisdom and will become a balance between the emotions and the legal space which exists in Ukraine and in Crimea," he said. Commenting on the report on the concentration of Spetsnaz [special-purpose forces] in Crimea issued by the TV company Ostankino, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimean internal affairs minister, said there were around 60,000 Ukrainian servicemen on the peninsula and therefore Ostankino's data were correct. Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola Mykhalchenko, official in charge of domestic policy issues at the Ukrainian presidential service, stated: "The Ukrainian president's position is this: There is a boundary, which can be maintained by the central leadership of Ukraine, and it may not be overstepped." In Mykola Mykhalchenko's view, actions by the parliament of Crimea overstep the boundary of common sense "and one has to take the path of compliance with the constitution across the whole of Ukraine's territory." Also, he does not rule out that in the very near future a Ukrainian presidential directive or appropriate actions by the parliament of Ukraine as a reaction to the [Crimean parliament's] anticonstitutional decision can be expected. In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent during a break in the work of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy stated: "I think we now must turn to economic sanctions against Crimea. The republic is in debt to Ukraine, up to date owing over 1.5 trillion karbovantsi. We must turn to sanctions like those used by Russia against Ukraine. We have enough levers such as, for example, the supply of water and electricity." Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said the government was now working on appropriate steps. "I would not call it an ultimatum. This is a tougher approach to our relations", added Yukhym Zvyahilskyy.
