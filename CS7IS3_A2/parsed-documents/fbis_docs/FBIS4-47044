We present here the most interesting aspects of the report of N. Akbarov, chief of the Kazan Internal Affairs Directorate, and portions of the session minutes. Prior to discussion of the report of N. Akbarov, chief of the Kazan Internal Affairs Directorate, charts were distributed to the deputies showing comparative data on the crime situation in Tatarstan and certain regions of the Russian Federation. Over the first four months of this year, 20,581 crimes were registered in the republic (20,690 during the same period of last year). The lion's share of these crimes is attributable to Kazan and Naberezhnyye Chelny (6,637 and 3,894, respectively). One cannot fail to note, however, that 72.7 percent (last year--53 percent) of them were investigated in Kazan, but only 64 percent--in Chelny. The best indices of all were observed in Nizhnekamskiy and Bugulminskiy Rayons. Of 1,299 crimes registered in Nizhnekamskiy Rayon, 64 percent were investigated. In Bugulminskiy Rayon, 66.8 percent of the 800 registered crimes were investigated--and this in view of the fact that the number of criminal incidents in Bugulminskiy (just as in Zelenodolskiy and Almetyevskiy Rayons) Rayon in the first four months of 1994 rose by more than one-fourth. Naturally we cannot help but be overjoyed by the fact that the percentage of criminal cases solved in Tatarstan overall and in Kazan in particular is higher than in our neighboring oblasts and republics. In Nizhniy Novgorod this figure is 49.7 percent, in Ufa--48.8 percent, in Saratov--53.4 percent, in Cheboksary--39.9 percent, in Izhevsk--47.5 percent, in Yoshkar-Ola--47.7 percent, and in Samara--63.2 percent. On the other hand, in comparison with other big cities, Kazan occupies one of the top positions with respect to number of crimes committed (6,637), outpaced only by Nizhniy Novgorod, where felons provided cases for the militia 10,629 times over the four-month period. The Tatarstan capital also leads with respect to number of grave crimes committed (2,043), once again leaving the first prize for Nizhniy Novgorod (2,191). Overall, however, the republic finds itself out in front of Nizhniy Novgorod as far as grave crimes are concerned (5,132 and 3,971, respectively), not to mention other contiguous regions (Bashkortostan--3,086, Saratov Oblast--2,606, Chuvashia--1,614, Udmurtiya--2,260, Mari El--661, and Samara Oblast--3,371).
