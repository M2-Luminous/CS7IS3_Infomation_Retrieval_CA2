In this study the evaluation of special cases is made using a numerical method. For this purpose a study was made of the law of distribution of the geometry factor in the case of an equiprobable distribution of observation points over the Earth's surface and observation times and then with a fixed value of the geometry factor an estimate was made of the accuracy in determining coordinates with any set of measurement errors and positions of the observed satellites. The geometry factor distribution law for each situation and the determinations of position in the course of the day (at 0.5-hour intervals) were simulated at points uniformly distributed over the surface of the northern hemisphere. The series of geometry factor values obtained from modeling was about 100 000 determinations of position for each case, represented by 10 levels. Modeling of determinations of coordinates was carried out with allowance for relief data taken from a 1:100 000 map. A table gives the rms errors in determining coordinates, averaged vertically and horizontally over the Earth's surface, as a function of the accuracy in measuring pseudorange and the accuracy of satellite position in orbit. The rms error in determining position in open terrain when using the standard number of navigation satellites (4.2) is about 13 m; the minimum error is about 6 m and the maximum error is about 30 m. Position accuracy drops in the event of failure of individual system satellites. In the event of operation of 18 satellites the minimum, mean and maximum rms errors are 10, 21 and 400 m respectively. If half the satellites fail in 50% of the cases the problem has no solution. Figures 2; references: 3 Russian.
