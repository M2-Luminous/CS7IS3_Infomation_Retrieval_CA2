Submission of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated April 18, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1276), Kentucky submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. It replaces a previous proposed amendment dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260). Kentucky submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Known as Senate Bill 266, the amendment was passed by Kentucky's General Assembly during the 1994 regular session. It consists of proposed new and amended statutes to KRS pertaining to disposal of coal combustion fly ash, bottom ash, waste from fluidized bed combustion, and scrubber sludge. The statutes offer surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the permit area. Kentucky proposes to revise KRS 350.010 to define coal combustion by-products, and add a new section of KRS chapter 350 to specify the procedures governing the disposal of coal combustion by-products. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 19, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 26153), and in the same document opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment.
