He said that it was against any contacts with NATO as well as Russia's joining the program Partnership for Peace and the Council of European. Zhirinovskiy said that before a Russian parliamentary delegation left for Strasbourg, the State Duma should take a vote on what kind of position it should take there. "The delegation to Strasbourg must have powers," he said. Zhirinovskiy pointed out that the LDPR was against any military exercises which involved the participation of foreign troops on Russian territory. The Russian military taking part in such exercises together with Americans would lose their shoulder stripes if another regime came to power, he was quoted as saying. Zhirinovskiy called on the deputies to take a stance in the wake of the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Kazakhstan's joining Russia and Belarus in the united ruble zone and demanded the resignation of a number of ministers. However, he did not indicate to whom he was referring. As a sign of protest, the deputies of Russia's Choice left the hall as soon as Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Rybkin allowed Zhirinovskiy to take the floor. For his part, Zhirinovskiy asked the health care minister to prescribe them some medicine, because the faction of Russia's Choice had been clinically dead for the last four months, he said.
