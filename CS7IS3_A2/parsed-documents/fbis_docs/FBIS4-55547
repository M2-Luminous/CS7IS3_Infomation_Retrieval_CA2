He said that our country has a particular importance as far as ensuring regional stability is concerned.

Klepsch positively assessed the quality of the talks he conducted during his two-day visit to Romania and focused his attention on his meetings with the leaders of political parties and with various parliamentarians.

Regarding the problem of minorities, he appreciated the valid legal provisions extant in our country and emphasized that all that is left to be done is to implement them. Answering a question, the president of the European Parliament said that it is very difficult to make a precise forecast about the date of Romania's admission to the European Union. Everything is up to Romania, he said, according to our reporter Victor Spirache.
