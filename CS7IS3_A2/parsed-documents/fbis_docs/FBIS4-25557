Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, presided over today's meeting. Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the conference. He pointed out: People's courts throughout the country have centered their efforts on trying and adjudicating major and serious cases of economic crime in the struggle against corruption, and the overall situation is satisfactory. People's courts at various levels have followed the guidelines of the party Central Committee and the work arrangements of the Supreme People's Court, have concentrated their efforts on quickly trying and adjudicating a large number of major and serious cases of economic crime, have heavily punished serious law offenders in accordance with the law, and have attained significant results in promoting and deepening the anticorruption struggle. According to a statistical report, the cases of economic crimes heard and adjudicated by people's courts in 1993 involved 152 cadres at and above the department level, including eight cadres at the bureau level and one cadre at the vice minister level. Liu Jiachen pointed out: We should soberly understand that the results achieved so far still cannot meet the demands of the party and the people and the requirements in the current anticorruption struggle. There are still some problems in the trials of major and serious economic cases which must not be overlooked. He said: In the next phase, people's courts throughout the country will have a heavier task in hearing and adjudicating major and serious cases of economic crime. Therefore, leading cadres of people's courts at various levels must personally take charge of the work and have the courage to resist all interference and obstacles in the trials of various cases. We must adhere to principles, rely on the party's leadership, and ensure the proper trial of various cases. We should handle various cases in a prompt manner with high quality and efficiency. We should establish a sound working system and guarantee the smooth flow of information. We should strengthen propaganda and increase the results in handing cases. At the telephone conference, Liu Jiachen also explained the specific arrangements made by the Supreme People's Court for the trial of major and serious cases of economic crime in the next phase. He said: The Supreme People's Court, based on its understanding of major and serious cases of economic crime being handled at present, will promptly announce the results of trying those cases throughout the country in the next few months.
