After 15 days of discussions, the negotiating teams from the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] today reached an agreement on the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. Radio Vorgan will not close down but its officials will have to follow the legal procedures for its continued operation. There is a law in Angola and Vorgan will have to abide by it. The negotiating teams have already begun discussions on the next issue -- the swearing in of UNITA deputies. The mediators have already presented to the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA the initial document on modalities for the swearing in of UNITA deputies. The government says it agrees with the document. UNITA has requested time to study it but it says it will give its reply tomorrow. A meeting between the government and UNITA, to be attended by Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, and observers, has been scheduled for tomorrow.
