It will apparently officially join this program in the very near future. There is no unanimity of view among analysts on the question of whether or not Russia needs this program and what it can provide for it. A great deal has been discussed in official Ministry of Foreign Affairs circles and circles close to them about the possible advantages of membership in this program. I will discuss only those problems that, in my view, may have serious negative consequences on the strategic level as a result of Russia's joining this program. First of all, it is no secret to anyone that the "Partnership for Peace" is an element of the strategy of the United States and the West with the aim of achieving a phased expansion of NATO. The fact that they did not manage to expand NATO in the present stage by including a number of East European countries that yearn to get in, hoping to intensify their integration into the economic structure of the European Community through NATO membership, is viewed by certain of our analysts as a success of Russian diplomacy in the first round of the struggle against NATO expansion. If we are to make a choice between the "Partnership for Peace" program and automatic NATO expansion, and movement of the entire military-political infrastructure of this organization to Russia's borders, then without a doubt the first alternative is preferable for Russia. Especially since this leaves the door formally open--with respect to both this program and NATO itself in the future--for all, including Russia. It is possible to view the situation differently, however. After all, the Cold War ended following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and collapse of the Soviet Union, and it would be entirely reasonable to expect that in the absence of ideological and military-political confrontation in Europe, and with the beginning of a partnership (certain documents and statements even make mention of an "allied") relationship between Russia and the United States, between Russia and the West, the necessity would disappear of preserving a military bloc created as a deterrence to international communism. In addition to this, it should be noted that in agreeing to the unification of Germany, repudiating the "Brezhnev Doctrine," and withdrawing from Eastern Europe, the USSR obtained assurances from the United States and its Western allies that they would not take advantage of this in filling up the vacuum created and alter the military-strategic balance in Europe to their benefit. I think former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev could discuss this more substantively and perhaps he will still do so. It is entirely evident that there are no external reasons and no threat on the part of Russia either for preserving NATO or, even more so--in circumvention of agreements with the USSR, for expanding NATO directly or indirectly (through the program "Partnership for Peace") to Russia's borders. Most likely the United States and its allies are setting other objectives through NATO and the "Partnership for Peace" program, proceeding from their long-range interests. First of all, the Americans henceforth intend through NATO to maintain and consolidate their military-political leadership in Europe. Secondly, for a number of NATO member countries and for those East European countries that have become candidates for membership in this bloc, joining the "Partnership" program, the United States presence in NATO, and the alliance itself constitute a reliable way of keeping a unified Germany under effective control. Thirdly, the expansion of NATO--even initially through the "Partnership for Peace"--does in fact comprise real steps on the part of the NATO bloc to fill the "power vacuum" left by the USSR, with the aim of containing and disciplining what is now Russia. A number of analysts believe that little depends upon Russia in the situation that has come about. Whether we like it or not, the process has already begun: More and more signatures are appearing under the "Partnership" program. Therefore, it only remains for us to find our place in this process. There are those who believe that Russia should push others aside and stand first in line at NATO's doorstep. It is strange that such judgments are coming from quite serious people--far from naive--who claim to be strategists in matters of foreign policy. But in the situation that has developed, where indeed very little depends on us, we are already unable to stand first in line at NATO's doorstep. This doorstep is surrounded by the Romanians, Estonians, Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are also straining to enter. It will be amusing to see how Russia--still a superpower in the military sense--will look in such a crowd, where everyone is screaming about the threat from Russia and therefore desiring to lean on the powerful shoulder of NATO in a search for guarantees of territorial sovereignty and security. Whether or not these fears and hopes are real or invented is a separate question, but Russia is still capable all the same of securing its territorial integrity and its own security. It is hardly worth it for us to knock on NATO's door and join the "Partnership" for the sake of obtaining dubious support from NATO against the territorial claims of Estonia against Russia. If Russia were to immediately enter NATO as a full-fledged member and this organization were to become a universal structure guaranteeing security in Europe, only a madman would fail to support such a development of events. But under conditions where NATO sets the terms, where the bloc itself determines the schedule for entry of "Partnership for Peace" program members, hardly anyone can harbor illusions as to how long the period of Russia's "candidacy" for NATO membership will be and under what conditions entry will be arranged. Those analysts are entirely correct who say that in not joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, and subsequently NATO, we are dooming ourselves to strategic isolation. But it is also true that having agreed to participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program, with preservation of the NATO bloc which decides who, when, and how one may become a full-fledged member, we find ourselves in isolation here as well. Russia can hardly be the same kind of candidate as Estonia and Poland, for example, and Russia hardly has the same obligations and responsibilities for peace and security before the world community as do those countries that have today swarmed all around NATO's door. In the face of myriad problems in both the near and far abroad, Russia cannot be on a short leash held by NATO when its national interests may require one decision or another to be made in some part of the world which does not coincide with the view of the NATO bloc, the United States, or its colleagues in the "Partnership for Peace." Thus Russia's entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program could give the illusion of the breaching of possible isolation, but will become a far more serious factor, facilitating the weakening of its position and leading to real, not imaginary, isolation. The attitude of the country's leadership with respect to the issue of Russia's entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program is ambiguous. At his January summit meeting with the U.S. President, Boris Yeltsin noted that Russia does not view the establishment of European security through the "Partnership for Peace" program as a one and only opportunity, although it does not oppose it either. One would think the president's message to the Federal Assembly would contain great definitiveness on this key issue in the development of Russia's strategic course in the foreign policy sphere. However, internal foreign policy contradictions within the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs are unfortunately reflected in this document as well. On the one hand, the president's message mentions Russia's support for the "Partnership for Peace" program, although in the opinion of U.S. and NATO strategists the program should become a mechanism for gradually turning NATO into the single universal mechanism for guaranteeing security both inside and outside Europe. On the other hand, it is proposed to make the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) the main instrument of European construction in the military-political sphere. Added to this as one of the goals of Russia's foreign policy is the affording of cross guarantees to the countries of Central Europe on the part of Russia and its West European partners. Clearly, both ends do not meet here. Until quite recently Western strategists, advocating the automatic expansion of NATO by virtue of the East European countries, or at least achievement of the same objectives through the "Partnership for Peace" program, believed that adoption of the concept of cross guarantees for the countries of East Europe on the part of Russia and its West European partners would be a strategic victory for Russia. It must be said, however, that it is this very concept that supported the decisions according to which the USSR agreed to the unification of Germany and repudiated the "Brezhnev Doctrine." But while we have been talking about cross guarantees for the countries of Central Europe, the latter have already entered NATO's waiting room. The same is true of our aim to turn the NACC into the main instrument of support for peace and security in Europe. First of all, within the framework of the NACC too we are in fact joining as a single entity, without allies. Secondly, it is our former Warsaw Pact allies, now NACC members, that are longing to join NATO, and it does not depend on us as to how quickly and effectively the NACC can be turned into an instrument of European security. Thus in joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, the Central European countries view themselves as candidates for NATO membership, and the question of cross guarantees loses its meaning for them to a significant degree. If Russia joins the "Partnership for Peace" program, we will in fact be giving the green light to turning NATO into the military-political instrument for construction of a new Europe. In conclusion, I would like to sum up all the potential negative consequences for Russia should the "Partnership for Peace" program be implemented. First. Historically, NATO emerged as a specific military-political bloc directed against the Soviet Union. The problem of its expansion lies in the danger that Russia will be strategically isolated. We must not ignore even the theoretical possibility of creation of a "cordon sanitaire" between Europe and Russia and the threat of excluding Russia from Europe. Second. It would hardly be advisable to convert this regional organization, created to accomplish quite specific missions, to a universal instrument of security and conflict regulation throughout Eurasia. Third. The proposed concept fails to stipulate any temporary framework for a transition period. A state such as Russia cannot be waiting in the entrance hall while extremely important decisions are made on matters key to its security. Fourth. Whether the authors like it or not, this concept includes an objective attempt to block the process of military-political consolidation of the space of the former Soviet Union. Fifth. Entry of the countries of Central Europe and former USSR republics into the "Partnership for Peace" program, with their subsequent passage into NATO, would push Russia out of the arms market with respect to these countries and thereby inflict a serious blow to our military-industrial complex. Sixth. The inclusion of Russia within NATO (even in the long-range scenario) will in fact lead to conversion of our country into an outpost of this bloc organization along the border with the Islamic world and China. It is difficult to imagine American soldiers undertaking to defend this border the same way they once defended the border between the FRG and GDR. And so, Russia will find its hands tied, its room for maneuver restricted. Skepticism that NATO can be an effective instrument for guaranteeing security and resolving conflicts is confirmed by the events in Bosnia. Clearly, Russia was hasty in agreeing to the change in NATO functions. Recent events have shown that in imprudently extending a mandate of broad authority to the UN secretary general so that he could entrust the conduct of peacemaking operations to the NATO Council, Russia, by the will of its gullible (the one defect Marx considered excusable) diplomats, denied itself the right of veto. So the NATO Council made decisions and presented ultimatums, without regard to the view and position of Russia. Without a full-fledged vote in the NATO Council, Russia will hardly be able to influence the decisions of this organization in the future on matters possibly far more important to it than Bosnia. It is a good thing that President Yeltsin exercised initiative at the last minute with respect to untangling the Bosnian crisis and rescued the Russian diplomats who had brought matters to the point where NATO was openly ignoring Russia's position and preparing to inflict strikes against the Serbs. Surely it would be advisable to perfect the mechanisms of the CSCE--specially created as a guarantor of peace and order throughout the European continent. But prior to that--the countries of East Europe should be given joint guarantees by Russia and the United States (or NATO).
