The General Administration of Customs (GAC) has investigated 38 corruption cases involving customs officials and refunded 21 unreasonable charges on customs services, customs sources said. At least 10 officials from Nanjing Customs, Jiangsu Province, have been taken into custody or arrested for graft, embezzlement of public funds or seeking commissions, according to reliable sources. Eight other customs officials working in the province's Zhangjiagang branch were found guilty of receiving bribes by local courts. In addition, the head of Zhangzhou Customs in southeast China's Xiamen was arrested for smuggling. The GAC has discovered that some customs officials have solicited bribes from importers and exporters, claiming the funds as support of customs work. Some officials have demanded luxury receptions from host organi- zations or enterprises, exceeding government-stipulated standards for work. Others have used import and export companies' cars or mobile telephones without paying for them. Still others have submitted private bills to import/export companies treasurers' offices. According to reliable sources close to the GAC, the current crackdown "will focus on major misbehavior liable to draw strong complaints from the public." By the end of May, the GAC plans to review existing standards and charges on customs services. Charges must be in accordance with State-regulated price standards. Random charges and overcharges on services, both illegal, will be eliminated. The GAC made it clear that customs agencies were not allowed to run any type of economic entity or invest in any kind of profit-oriented business. In addition, companies are prohibited from attaching themselves to customs agencies to escape government supervision. By the end of June, customs divisions must divest from any service industries which they currently hold. The GAC has made major advances in cracking down on internal corruption since last June when the central government intensified its fight against graft. To date, the GAC has also shuttered a total of 127 customs-run companies that were engaged in service industries. Thirty other firms were told their businesses had too close a relationship with the customs administration and they should move into another realm of trade.
