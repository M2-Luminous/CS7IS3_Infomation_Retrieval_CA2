The Pirai problem area concerns national property. Reference must therefore be made to other basins that are also in a threatening situation that is the result of meddling by the hand of man. Rio Yapacani Basin Originating at the Cienaga River, the Yapacani River basin has a steep downgrade, from 2,400 meters above sea level to 1,500 meters above sea level, within the first 56 kilometers of its descent. This contributes to the natural excavation of the riverbed and the carrying down of sediments by the river, as well as the erosion of the surrounding hillsides by farming and overgrazing. At the tableland there is good undergrowth, which leads to the assumption that the input of sediment to that point is low. This confirms that the enormous volumes of sediment arriving at the lowland, silting up the riverbed, and forcing its permanent divergence have their origin in the mesothermal valleys. The consequences are serious problems to roads, bridges, and other infrastructure in the lowland. Rio Surutu Subbasin The studies made under the SENMA-BID [expansion not given] project, bear out the conclusion that due to the steep downgrade of its subbasin and main riverbed, the Surutu River presents torrential characteristics and flash currents that create a high risk of flashfloods, and has a substantial capacity for natural excavation of the riverbed, and for carrying down sediments (gravel and sand) that are deposited beginning at the Huaytu area where its banks lack vegetal cover. This renders the basin ``very frail,'' with results that are being seen around the mouth of the Yapacani River--where some years ago the main channel was two kilometers away from the bridge and where it is now threatening to break up the access road to the bridge--and at Huaytu where the ongoing natural excavation is threatening the rural farmlands. Rio Palometilla Subbasin The main problem presented by this river is the high volume of sediments (soil and embankment) it carries down from its headwaters and the hillsides, owing to the farmers' clearing of trees and shrubs from the terrain. The original level of the riverbed has been raised, causing damming and flooding of considerable magnitude in the ``El Torrente'' sector, with destruction of the Montero-Yapacani road creating traffic problems, and the inundating of certain farming and cattle-raising sectors downstream in quasi-permanent form, with consequent losses. Rio Ichilo Basin According to SENMA-BID researchers, this river and its tributaries carry sediments in suspension in considerable quantities, resulting from farming at the foot of the mountain and in the lower sector of the basin. Rio Palacio Subbasin The damming and flooding of the Antofagasta area is attributable to the following causes: 1) Farming activities (clearing of land and trails) have blocked natural drainage; 2) When the YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits] built its seismological stations, it left embankments that actually are submerged dams; when the ENFE [National Railway Enterprise] built the railway, in 1970, crossing the area's natural drainage lines it caused the obstruction of the riverbed by aquatic and shrub-like vegetation. This is a simplified summary of a wide-ranging study that has been made on the problems in the river basins, that are adversely affecting the farming and livestock industry, the transportation industry, and road infrastructure, in addition to damaging the environment. It is recognized that substantial programs to remedy this situation have not been developed, but targeted efforts have been deployed, such as the drainage system project in San Juan de Yapacani (JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency]); the study and design of the drainage system in the colonia Antofagasta (FAO/CORDE-CRUZ [Food and Agriculture Organization/Santa Cruz Development Corporation]), which is to be financed by PRODEPA [expansion not given]; and the SEARPI [expansion not given] and Regional Drainage Study pilot projects by the CIAT [International Center for Tropical Agriculture].
