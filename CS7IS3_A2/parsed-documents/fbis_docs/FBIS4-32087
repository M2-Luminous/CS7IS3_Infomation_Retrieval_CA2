Marinus Wilmink assessed his first official visit to Slovakia as very valuable. He appreciated the mutual understanding as well as the sharing of views on some military issues. He pointed out that future cooperation will benefit from such trust. According to General Julius Humaj, Slovak Army commander in chief, who was present at the concluding talks, cooperation will take place in three main areas: the development of new organizational structures in our Army--that is, a transition to the system of army corps and brigades similar to that of NATO. The other areas cover the introduction of logistics systems in army units and simulated training and other training for battle, areas in which NATO has rich experience. State Secretary Andrej Sabol also assessed the political aspect of the talks, especially in relation to our participation in the Partnership for Peace program. He recalled that our initiative to set up a NATO consultation center in Bratislava met with Gen. Wilmink's understanding. The general appreciated the need for more intensive sharing of experience. The commander of NATO land forces in Central Europe will leave for NATO headquarters in Germany this afternoon.
