[Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether it is a paradox or rather a certain factual logic in the sense that we, members of the left wing, are searching for new possibilities of society's economic and civilization-related progress. We want to develop our economy in a more cost-efficient, faster, and efficient manner, compared with our predecessors. Of course, some people perceive privatization only in the black colors of transplanting capitalism, whereas I also see in privatization many positive aspects, which, for instance, are about social enfranchisement. I am convinced that, if privatization is conducted in a reasonable manner and is based not on principles of doctrine but on criteria of efficiency, such privatization has a very tangibly positive employee aspect. [Sieradzinski] Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has described this sort of reasoning as "social democrats wearing liberals' pants...." [Kaczmarek] I read his article in POLITYKA, and I must say that the author, who, after all was a liberal in his own time, stopped developing his views in 1989. In the time that followed, my generation of the social-democratic left gained many new experiences. We went ahead, and it is hard to accuse us now of also having changed our views on the issue of privatization. I am convinced that our electorate--and keep in mind that we are a party of employees--has also changed its position on privatization. It no longer has the hostile or unfriendly position that many of us had four or five years ago. The people understand the fact that we have taken it upon ourselves to attempt to build an economic and social system that will allow us to render Poland part of the European arrangement, which will be efficient and competitive and will result in monies for the implementation of social programs. In my view, that is the entire social democratic concept. Privatization is only meant to be an instrument in its implementation. [Sieradzinski] To me, the most important question is this: What do people who work in enterprises that were state-owned yesterday but that, beginning today, become private property stand to gain from this? Do these people not feel like they are just an appendix to the entire transaction? [Kaczmarek] This is a fundamental issue to me, as well. True, the ministry I run implements just a third of ownership transformations taking place in Poland, and it would be hard to hold me accountable for everything that happens in that field, but I can assure you that three things are the most important to me: First, that the State Treasury obtain a decent price for enterprises being privatized. Second, that the enterprises be transferred to good hands, which implies a detailed description in the contract of the obligations of the new owner vis-a-vis the enterprise, contributing additional capital for investment and modernization, securing new markets, and so forth. A third very significant element of our privatization contracts is made up of social issues. The issue is about guarantees of not carrying out personnel cuts in a specified time period, establishing new jobs, prospects for salary raises, and observing many other rights acquired by employees in the past. I want to stress that this is a specific trait of our privatization process. When you look at the eastern provinces of Germany, you will see that such contracts do not encompass social obligations. The fact that, for instance, the new owner of the "San" company in Jaroslaw guarantees the employees that there will be no personnel cuts over the next four years--that is of enormous significance to those employees. Tell me, can you think of a state-owned company where employees have guaranteed employment for at least a year? The example I gave you is not an exception. In an overwhelming majority of enterprises that were privatized recently, the investors took upon themselves an obligation to not make personnel reductions, to increase employment, and to raise salaries by 20 to 30, or even 50 percent. [Sieradzinski] What if these guarantees turn out to be nothing more than a piece of paper? [Kaczmarek] There are penalties contained in contracts for failure to meet obligations. In very flagrant cases, it is even possible to invalidate the transaction signed. I can assure you that we will use all legal means to make sure these provisions are observed. [Sieradzinski] You are trying to convince me that employees should do nothing but be happy about privatization, but we know that that is not actually the case. Take the case of the Walbrzych "Porcelana" factory, the Warsaw "Polkolor," or the infamous firing of women who happened to be on maternity leave when the Compact Car Plant signed a joint-venture agreement with Fiat. [Kaczmarek] This confirms the argument that any generalizations are dangerous. Employees in Kwidzyn, Jaroslaw, the Warsaw "Wedel" company, the Szczecin shipyard, and dozens of other companies have a completely different view on benefits accrued from privatization. Because they finally have a genuine owner instead of a state official exercising ownership supervision from high above on behalf of the State Treasury, the situation of those enterprises--and the feeling of social security of their employees--is incomparably better today than before privatization. What also improves is the overall work environment; I mean cleanliness and order in working halls or at construction sites. Lunchrooms, cloakrooms, and uniforms for employees--they all look different now. That also counts. Of course, a lot depends on whether foreign investors entering the Polish market intend to make links to it permanent and to establish in Poland a modern basis for the development of production or whether such investors regard the Polish market purely in terms of an easy outlet for selling merchandise or services and a place with a relatively cheap labor force. I can assure you that there are increasing numbers of cases of serious investors who can see their future in our market for many years to come. [Sieradzinski] You mentioned the Szczecin shipyard where, to my knowledge, at least, a managerial/employee contract for managing the company was extended at the end of March of this year, and not everyone was happy to see that. Why is that? [Kaczmarek] I paid a visit there recently, but I can only guess what reservations voiced by various "advisers" may be all about. One must get it out in the open: It so happens, historically speaking, that every one of our shipyards has its own political sponsor or "patron." Any attempts at reform encounter particularly strong resistance in those places. As for the Szczecin shipyard, a managerial contract was signed as early as 1992, and it was just extended because it proved extremely beneficial for the company. Let me remind you that, at the end of 1991, all the shipyard had was just one order to build a ship. Right now, its portfolio of orders amounts to approximately $460 million. It is the only shipyard where the time period to build a unit was reduced to 12 months. With 6,000 employees, the shipyard's production level is double that of the two remaining shipyards, where 16,000 people are employed in total. As the only shipyard in the entire domestic shipyard industry, the Szczecin company pays its debts to its creditors, and its employees make much better money than in Gdansk or Gdynia. These are the facts and nobody can question them. [Sieradzinski] Rumor has it that there are even plans in the shipyard to establish its own retirement pension fund. [Kaczmarek] I have suggested to the employees that a kind of employee trust fund be established that could be devoted to paying out increased retirement pensions. I think that this kind of long-term capital investment may be beneficial for both employees of companies being privatized and the state budget. After all, the state could possibly support such initiatives through a system of tax breaks--that would be beneficial to public finances, out of which huge amounts are currently spent on subsidizing an inefficient and costly insurance system. [Sieradzinski] Is the variety of establishing organs [organ zalozycielski] that represent the State Treasury's interests not an obstacle to you in coordinating the process of ownership transformations? [Kaczmarek] The issue is not even about the fact that we have over 70 establishing organs. What is important is whether branch ministries are dealing with developing developmental strategies for a given branch, with defining rules of the game among economic units, or whether these branch ministries are trying to mainly execute their ownership functions, without a strategy that an owner should have. Against this background, there have emerged quite a lot of doubts regarding distribution of powers between my ministry and several other ministries, such as agriculture, foreign economic cooperation, and industry. My view is that I should be responsible for the entire privatization process, while my colleagues in charge of specific sectors of the economy should exercise their ownership functions mainly through preparing developmental strategies for the branches that different enterprises could join, regardless of their ownership type. [Sieradzinski] There is talk that it is precisely this dispute that caused a delay in the government's presentation of a privatization draft law within the framework of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises. [Kaczmarek] I cannot deny that, even though that was not the only reason. The issue was also about enabling a prior debate by the government on a draft for transforming large and medium-sized enterprises into capital companies [spolki kapitalowe] controlled by the state (a new form of commercialization). We are past that stage right now. There is no denying that another reason for the delay in preparing the law was that it is very hard to "tinker" with a document as important as this one without a deputy prime minister responsible for the economy. My assessment is that a governmental draft law on privatization, which would constitute the basis of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, will find its way into the Sejm at the end of May. [Sieradzinski] What is the importance of a set of four programs that have been worked out by your ministry and debated recently by the government? [Kaczmarek] We have proved to our critics that, after learning about the effects of privatization implemented by the previous governments up to now, we have our own idea for putting the process in order. Let me remind you that the issue is about: --Transforming large and medium-sized enterprises into state-controlled capital companies, introducing a formula for employee management and comanagement that would be different from what it has been up to now. --"Fast sale" of the greatest possible number of small and medium-sized enterprises (employing up to several hundred people) to employee companies [spolka pracownicza] and to other economic units. --Improving the process of managing state-owned enterprises, which means abandoning bureaucratic management and replacing it with parameter-based management accomplished through capital structures. --Setting in motion processes that will serve to improve the structure of public finances, especially in the area of social expenditures, such as health and retirement insurance. [Sieradzinski] That is indeed quite a program, when you consider the accusations being levied against the coalition of having slowed down the rate of privatization, or of having stopped it altogether. [Kaczmarek] Such views do not correspond to the truth. According to the report, during 1993, which was a good year for ownership transformations, a total of 364 privatization projects of various magnitudes were carried out. We have already implemented 86 such projects during the first quarter of this year, which is one-fourth of last year's amount. Apart from that, eight emission drafts have been presented (there was a total of three in all of 1993). We are preparing about 100 enterprises to be transformed into share companies [spolki akcyjne] in connection with conciliation proceedings with banks--we did not have that last year at all. The program for setting in motion that National Investment Funds is reaching its final stage. We will be able to announce, probably at the end of June, that, for instance, an "alpha" fund is being managed by "B" company, with a governing board made up of the following people....and also that the particular fund includes enterprises number 1 to 30, and so forth. This will allow us to begin distributing participation certificates [swiadectwa udzialowe] at the end of this year and the beginning of the next one. Really, a lot is happening right now, and to speak about a slowdown in the rate of privatization is just another case of political "setting at odds." But, first of all, it is to the previous coalition that I "owe" the bad--outright disastrous--atmosphere surrounding privatization. I spend a majority of my time cleaning up after the past. So I am even more surprised with the easy-sounding nature of critical remarks addressed by former Minister Janusz Lewandowski regarding the current privatization process. You could really use some humility, Mr. Minister! [Sieradzinski] So you can see no danger at all that privatization could bring about? [Kaczmarek] Yes, I can see such dangers. I am, for instance, afraid that privatization of a group of enterprises might cause disruptions in the traditionally established connections with domestic producers from other branches. The privatization by foreign investors in previous years of enterprises, producing detergents and other chemical products for households, led to a Kielce-based container plant suddenly losing its orders. The same thing may happen in the case of privatization of a large plant producing food concentrates. It will turn out that a large domestic glassworks no longer has orders for jar production, and, therefore, one will have to eliminate the plant. Only coordination of privatization measures by just one ministry can shield us against the consequences of such decisions, with the ministry basing its decisions on an analysis of impact not just within a particular branch but taking the whole economy into account. [Sieradzinski] When you were accepting the post of privatization minister, were you aware of the scale of responsibility you agreed to take upon yourself? [Kaczmarek] The examples of my predecessors prevented me from forgetting that. I promised myself that I would not promote the kind of privatization that would bring to mind economic scandals, deteriorating work conditions, or investors neglecting the duties they took upon themselves. I want privatization to become a process of enfranchisement of society, to contribute to limiting unemployment, and to provide a strong developmental incentive to the economy. Only then will we feel the positive impact of privatization. I will do everything in my power to keep this promise. [Sieradzinski] Thank you for the conversation.
