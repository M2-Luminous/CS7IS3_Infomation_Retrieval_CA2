The Estonian side at today's talks presented its claims and proposals concerning the shortcomings uncovered by experts at the Estonian armed forces' Central Staff, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said. Issues over which the parties might remain diverse will be settled after additional expert examination, he said. In order to avoid discrepancies in the future, Estonian representatives will inspect the weapons as to their completeness when the next consignments will be put together in Israel, the meeting decided. Soviet-made trophy weapons received by Estonia as a gift from TAAS, which have caused most of the protests by Estonian as to their usability, are to be assessed by a commission of independent experts in the near future, the defense ministry spokesman said. The Soviet-made ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns, which arrived in Estonia in shipments on Jan. 23 and Feb. 4, were found substandard by Estonian experts in a report turned in Feb. 16. The weapons were a gift from TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. to Estonia. This was also confirmed in a letter by the company's Vice President Razi Dotan from Jan. 27. The Estonian defense forces' Central Staff in its Feb. 17 report on expert examination pointed out shortcomings in the supplies of additional equipment when compared to the provisions of the agreement signed between Estonia and the Israeli company. In abidance by the stipulations of the agreement, the Defense Ministry on the same day notified the Israeli company of the shortcomings discovered. The Estonian parliament's State Defense Commission in a statement on Feb. 17 said the Israeli state company had violated the arms purchase agreement with Estonia.
