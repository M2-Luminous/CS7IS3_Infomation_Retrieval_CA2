Garcia] [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban emigre organizations in the United States today agreed that the Cuban Government's call to the conference "The Nation and Emigration," which will be held here in April, is an important step. PRENSA LATINA spoke by telephone with Raymundo Del Toro, president of the Cuban-American Committee for Peace (CCAP), and with Walfredo Moreno, leader of the Alliance of Workers of the Community (ATC). Del Toro said the initiative shows the goodwill of the people in accepting their brothers who live outside the fatherland. The CCAP has 17,000 members and is headquartered in New Jersey, the state with the second largest concentration of Cubans in the United States after Florida. About the meeting, the most recent precedent for which was in 1978, Del Toro stated: "They call us once again to share and listen to our worries and aspirations." On 14 February, the Cuban authorities announced the convocation of a meeting on 22, 23, and 24 April in which over 200 representatives of the Cuban community residing in other nations are expected to participate. Although the topics on the agenda and the list of participants have not yet been defined, Havana made it clear that those who want to destroy the country and support the U.S. blockade have been excluded from the meeting. Del Toro said the decision not to invite organizations such as the Cuban-American Foundation and the terrorist groups Alpha 66 and "19 April" L (Liberty) Commando Units, among others that have spoken out against the people and for the blockade, was fair. Those groups do not represent the Cuban community residing in the United States, but the interests of Washington and the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), he added. He said that recent polls showed that 83 percent of emigres residing in Miami favor the elimination of the economic sanctions imposed on Cuba over 30 years ago. For his part, the president of the ATC stated that the convocation to the conference has scared "the worms" (ultraright-wing sector of the emigres) and encouraged those who favor the ties with Havana. Moreno said the initiative has left the most reactionary sector of the community without arguments. Those sectors wish to perpetuate the blockade, the main cause of the economic crisis in the country. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina recently said the Government has the willingness to smooth edges and solve differences with the community, whose relations with the Cuban Government were manipulated or undermined by the enemies of the revolution.
