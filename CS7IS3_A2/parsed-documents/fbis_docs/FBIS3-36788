The Romanian foreign minister already signed this agreement on Wednesday [26 January] and ensured the possibility for his country to be first to settle in the Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe [SHAPE] -- an office building specially provided for states not belonging to NATO. The Lithuanians secured a nook for themselves in this two-storied house on Thursday, when President A. Brazauskas put his signature under the agreement. However, history will include us in the list of the "first ones" because Lithuania surpassed all former USSR republics with its determination. Observing the haste with which Lithuania rushed to sign the PFP program, one may suspect that it was afraid of missing an office in the SHAPE -- the first one is the winner. There even was no time to find out the price of this nook situated 65 km away from Brussels, and all additions -- maneuvers, humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, conferences, and so on. Article 6 of the PFP program reads that "states themselves finance their participation in the PFP activities and share duties in organizing maneuvers in which they themselves participate." The president himself recalled this fact at the signing ceremony. The situation is laughable: No one knows the price of anything or what we will do in the PFP program, nevertheless, we want to be the first everywhere with the political and sport zeal typical of the Lithuanians. The president's adviser D. Trinkunas claimed yesterday that His Excellency knew only the approximate price of the PFP, because his office did not make any estimates, and National Defense Ministry [KAM] employees had to inform A. Brazauskas about everything. Meanwhile, E. Bajariunas, chief of the KAM International Relations and Agreements Department and a member of the government working group on the PFP, stated that there were no accurate estimates because countries participating in the program would themselves finance all events. According to him, Lithuania will participate in the PFP as much as the budget allows, because neither the KAM nor the Foreign Ministry has any finances assigned to this program for this year. Remembering the facts that 130 million litai this year (about $33 million) has been earmarked for KAM, and that according to some officials, the PFP will cost Lithuania at least $10 million a year, there is no doubt that the KAM will fail to finance this program. True, the figure $10 million also seems to be concocted, because according to V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee, a company of "blue helmets" would cost Lithuania from $30 to $40 million. Certainly, one may expect assistance from neighboring countries, particularly from Scandinavia. However, they will hardly agree to cover such expenses. The notorious "armored" bicycles from Sweden's military aid have caused enough laughter throughout the world, and it would be high time to feel the ground under one's feet while dreaming. Nor is there any reason to expect that Lithuania will find in its budget sufficient resources to participate in joint NATO maneuvers. There is a 165-million-litai deficit hole agape in our "state coffers" as of today. "We do not yet imagine how much our participation in the PFP program will cost us," claimed the president at the 10 January press conference. Many changes were expected after A. Brazauskas' visit to Brussels. Judging by the president's official statements and media reports, however, financial issues passed in oblivion, as fits an intelligentsia's company. "We really have enough finances for summit visits," maintained E. Bajariunas and added immediately: "I am joking." However, this joke reminds us of reality very much. Certainly, Lithuania can refuse joint maneuvers, peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, and other costly integral parts of the program. It is incomprehensible then, however, why we had to sign this document at all. It is the participation in joint military operations that can open the road to NATO in the future. As an officer responsible for SHAPE's ties with Lithuania has reported, NATO countries will arrange almost 200 drills and training courses this year. Lithuanian representatives have been invited to 40 of them....
