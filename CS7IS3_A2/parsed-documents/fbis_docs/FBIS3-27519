Many of the scientists, educators, and writers were invited to air views on the revision of the government work report in Zhongnanhai for the first time. The forums were permeated with a cheerful and animated atmosphere. Among those who spoke were He Zuoxiu, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; Yu Changyou, director of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry [MMI] Automation Research Institute; Cai Rang, deputy director of the MMI Iron and Steel Academy; Wang Sihong, head of the Beijing High and New Technology Development Experimental Zone; Duan Yongji, president of the Stone Group Company; Lu Liangshu, chairman of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Academic Committee; Sun Shu, vice chairman of the CAS Division of Earth Science; Chen Zhangliang, director of Beijing University Life Science Institute; Beijing University president Wu Shuqing; Fang Huijian, party secretary of Qinghua University; Huang Tiecheng, vice president of Beijing Agriculture University; Nankai University president Mu Guoguang; Xie Xingui, president of the Central Radio and TV University; Tian Yutan, principal of the Beijing No. 1 Experimental Primary School; Shen Decai, principal of the Tianjin No. 1 Middle School; Ou Xueguang, principal of the Beijing Changping Agricultural Vocational School; Qin Shaode, party secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Education and Health Commission; performing artists Ying Ruocheng, Liu Changyu, Bai Shuxiang, and Yu Lan; writer Malaxinfu; writer Pan Xia and cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang of the China TV Drama Production Center; director Yang Weiguang of the Central Television Station; Lin Erwei, general manager and concurrently editor-in-chief of the Commercial Press; and director Ren Jiyu of the Beijing Library. They agreed: The government work report (for the solicitation of opinions) has given a factual summation of China's remarkable achievements in science and technology, education, and culture in 1993, which once again bear testimony to the correct principles behind various structural reforms in the country. After reading the report, they have increased their confidence in this year's work. Discussing the section dealing with science and technology, scientists suggested that the policy of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" should include some areas of applied sciences that cannot be immediately put to production use. They also suggested that leading scientific research institutes and academies should play a significant role in national economic construction by gearing their work to meeting the needs of the main front of economic development; that more effective measures be taken to promote the development of high and new technology; and that the State Council promptly formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the law governing scientific and technological progress. They also made suggestions on increasing government appropriations for science and technology, on combining science and technology with economic construction, on cultivating new industries, on building large modern enterprises, on adopting policies regarding high and new technology development zones, on developing agricultural science and technology, and on training young scientist and researchers. While fully affirming the continuous advance of educational undertakings in the course of reform in 1993, educators said they were greatly inspired by the report's emphasis on "giving strategic priority to the development of education." Meanwhile, in view of the lack of urgency shown in developing education in some localities and departments, some educators proposed that the government attach importance to improving radio and television education, vocational education, normal education, and compulsory education; and should strengthen the intensity of educational reform; they added that efforts must be made to ensure that cultural education helps the healthy development of youngsters. Other educators suggested increasing government appropriations for education and stabilizing the contingent of teachers. In their speeches, celebrities from literary and artistic circles said: The government work report's discussion on the need to bring about a "flourishing of socialist culture" means encouraging all writers and artists. They shall always adhere to the principles of serving the people and socialism, and of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Some comrades suggested reform of the system under which literature and art are produced was needed; that the state should support and finance the creation of literary and artistic masterpieces; and that, to make progress, the reading public and audiences needed more excellent works containing positive messages, though in keeping with the spirit of the times, if the nation wanted to encourage elegant art and develop its cultural tradition. A number of comrades suggested greater cultural opening up through the improvement of exchanges with foreign countries and by intensifying research in basic culture. Li Peng frankly exchanged views with everyone present. He said: Science and technology play an important role in enhancing comprehensive national power. We must depend on joint efforts by the government, enterprises, and all trades and professions in society to increase input in science and technology. Scientific research institutions must further strengthen their own vitality through deepening reform and integrate science and technology thoroughly with economic construction through competition. The future of China's science and technology still relies on its youth. We must attach importance to young scientists and make the most of the strong points of China's scientific and technological personnel. Li Peng affirmed the practice of showing a hundred films on patriotism in middle and primary schools last year. He also said: Television education is mobile and flexible. It can be conducted among a vast number of students. We must increase television education in the future. Li Peng said: We live in a great era. We face very good opportunities for development. It should be a splendid era in which culture and art will enjoy a high degree of development. The development of culture and art is closely bound up with this era. I hope writers and artists can produce works worthy of a great era. Li Peng stressed the importance of the role of public opinion. He said: We must guide the masses of the people to encourage the spirit of patriotism and collectivism and to advocate our traditional virtues so as to inspire enthusiasm among the people for progress. Meanwhile, we must also expose abominable phenomena in society. While attaching importance to the social benefit of spiritual products, we must take into consideration their economic results. We must pay attention to providing guidance for various cultural phenomena in a bid to improve the cultural quality of our nation. Li Peng thanked all present for having put forward very good opinions. He instructed the drafting group to properly sum up their speeches and to incorporate them in the government work report so as to pool the wisdom of the masses, better represent the will of the people, and do a further good job in conducting government work.
