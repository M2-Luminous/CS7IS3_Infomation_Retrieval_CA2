FBIS4-59200 "drnes091_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 JORDAN Muslim Brotherhood Condemns Self-Rule Agreement Muslim Brotherhood Condemns Self-Rule Agreement JN1005153294 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 10 May 94 p 3 JN1005153294 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Information Bureau of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan; date not given] [Text] O ye that believe, betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you. [Koranic verse] The self-rule agreement signed by the domineering leadership of the PLO and the Zionist enemy is the latest regrettable and disgraceful chapter in a series of concessions to the Zionist enemy that are selling out the rights of the Arab and Islamic nations in general and the Palestinian people in particular --concessions which include the dearest spot on earth, which is second only to holy Mecca and Medina and which represents a dear element in our true Islam. The large official Arab and Islamic presence at the signing ceremony bore witness to the recognition of the Zionist enemy and its usurpation of our sacred territory, including the first of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim direct his prayers] and Islam's third holiest mosque. This signing came in preparation for the establishment of the Greater Israel project and the realization of the dreams of world Zionism and its colonialist supporters, which are panting after the wealth of the Islamic east. The signing of the self-rule agreement is a clear violation of the nation's rights and constant principles, a challenge to the will of the Palestinian people, a betrayal of their blessed intifadah, and a treacherous act against the Palestinian people's steadfast jihad and righteous martyrs. The Muslim Brotherhood declares its denunciation of this agreement, as well as its innocence of its provisions, and that it knows it will be forgiven by Almighty God because it warned and announced to all the Islamic and Arab peoples that it rejects this agreement and the likes of it, that it will use every legitimate and available means to regain rights, and that its stresses the following principles of the Muslim Brotherhood: 1. Palestine, as well as all Arab and Islamic lands, are for the nation and the future generations, and no one has the right to relinquish any part of them under any pretext. 2. We condemn and reject all forms of current and previous negotiations, as well as all agreements with the enemy occupier, as a betrayal of God, His messenger, and the faithful, and as a breach of God's orders and the teachings of His messenger, peace be upon him, that forbid the relinquishment of any inch of Islamic land, let alone Palestine's blessed land. 3. Proceeding from our Islamic principles and our commitment to our religion and our homeland, we declare our hatred and rejection of that agreement and the likes of it, which are part of a plan to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab and Islamic causes in the interest of the enemies of Islam, the Arab nation, and the homeland. 4. We declare our denunciation of the current Arab and Islamic participation in opening the doors of the Arab and Islamic world to normalization of relations with the Jewish enemy and to holding meetings with Jewish delegations as part of a series of concessions and relinquishments of the nation's rights. 5. We reject all forms of surrender to the American program, which some Arab leaders are trying to peddle to peoples under the pretext of pressures and threats. We also demand that the Arab leaders implement their slogans calling for entrenching Arab dignity and strength and enabling the nation to be lofty and proud. 6. We urge the masses of our Arab nation in general and the Palestinian people in particular to support the militant forces on the land of Palestine, which reject surrender to the enemy and which are seeking a total liberation of the Palestinian soil from the filth of the Jews--forces which include the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas. 7. We reaffirm that the only way to liberate Palestine and all the Arab and Islamic territories and to restore the nation's dignity and strength is to launch a holy jihad, which is a duty as long as an inch of Islamic land is occupied. Leaders are responsible for preparing the future generations for that militant duty and for achieving true unity. Any deviation from this path will serve the projects of the enemies of God, His messenger, and the faithful. But honor belongs to God and His apostle, and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not. [Koranic verse] God will certainly aid those who aid his cause; for verily God is full of strength, exalted in might. [Koranic verse].
