FBIS4-27287 "dreas105_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 North Korea ROK Military's Special Alert Status Viewed ROK Military's Special Alert Status Viewed SK0106092094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0800 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0106092094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0800 GMT 1 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim Yong-sam held a security-related ministers meeting at Chongwadae [presidential office] on 30 May and made a bellicose, violent remark by saying that it is necessary to have a 24-hour operation of the early warning system, that it is necessary to strengthen the South Korea-U.S. joint alertness, and so on. The traitor also ordered a special alert and emergency alert for the whole army and the police from 31 May. A few days ago, the traitor inspected on-the-spot the actual fighting combat readiness by the units of the puppet's army, navy, and air force in the front line area and instilled the war fever. The reason that he ordered a special alert and an emergency alert, convened a security-related ministers meeting, and decided to strengthen joint alertness by making violent remarks of war, hints that the military moves to put into practice the new Operation Plan 5027, which is a war provocation to invade the North, has emerged into an extremely dangerous stage. This kind of military move clearly proves itself that the Kim Yong-sam ring is truly through and through a warmonger all the more running toward the adventurous road of war opposing the fellow countrymen by conspiring with the outside forces.
