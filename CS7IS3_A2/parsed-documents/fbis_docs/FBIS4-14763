He is also the initiator of the Accord for Russia movement. Over to our correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov. [Zherebenkov] The Accord for Russia movement is actively engaged in setting up organizations in the localities and is preparing to hold a congress, Gennadiy Zyuganov announced, adding that Aleksandr Rutskoy is taking part in constant consultations with the movement's leaders. Zyuganov said: [Zyuganov] "The leaders of the movement have a weekly meeting. The general philosophical principles upon which such accord may be reached have been drawn up. Consultations have been conducted with all government structures, we are trying to find mutual understanding and are formulating our basic demands that will bring the country out of civil conflict and war, and will halt any further territorial, social, and economic collapse. We have held meetings with all those who determine the foundations of the genetic development of the nation; with representatives of fundamental science and academic science, with representatives of the military industrial complex and heads of major enterprises, and with leaders of other movements, parties, and associations. Many of our representatives, including deputies, have gone out to the localities, where they are briefing people on the essentials of the movement and tackling organizational work. I will not rule out that there will be a congress or assembly in May, which will finally work out the manifesto and nature of the movement's activities, and will define its attitude to all administrative structures, including government structures." [Zherebenkov] Speaking about the new party in opposition to the Communists which Yegor Gaydar has set up, with the symbolic name of Russia's Choice, Gennadiy Zyuganov said the following: [Zyuganov] "From a purely personal viewpoint, I want to tell you that the more politicians of Gaydar's type that manage various parties, the better for us." [Zherebenkov] As for another opponent, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Gennadiy Zyuganov's position in regard to him is like this: [Zyuganov] "He actually exists, he has his own program and policy. I repeat for all to hear: Today I will work together with anybody, no matter whom, for whom the integrity of the country and belief in our state and the welfare of every citizen is the highest value." [Zherebenkov] All that is splendid, of course, but Gennadiy Zyuganov's desire to work together with anybody, no matter whom, puts one on one's guard.
