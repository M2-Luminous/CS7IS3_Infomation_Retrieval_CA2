Because neither side made concessions, no agreement was reached. This shows that after the end of the Cold War, economic and trade contradictions between the two countries have become sharper. Japan is the second largest trade partner of the United States. Trade frictions have continuously existed between the two countries for a long time, and the main problem is the increasingly serious imbalance in bilateral trade. According to statistics from the U.S. side, Japan's trade surplus with the United States has increased year after year, and amounted to $54 billion between January and November 1993. In order to solve the trade imbalance issue, Clinton reached a "framework agreement" last July in Tokyo with former Japanese Prime Minister Miyazawa to make Japan open its markets wider and to reduce its trade surplus with the United States. In the agreement, the Japanese side promised to adopt measures to stimulate economic growth, increase imports, and reduce its trade surplus. In more concrete terms, Japan agreed to increase imports of autos and auto parts, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, and services from the United States. The framework agreement stipulated that the leaders of the two countries would hold talks twice a year. The two sides planned to reach concrete agreements on implementing the "framework agreement" at the recent summit meeting. At the meeting, the positions of the two sides were distant. Hosokawa put forth his plan to stimulate economic growth in Japan. The plan will cost $140 billion, and it includes such measures as reducing individual income taxes, stimulating consumer purchasing power, and increasing imports. However, the U.S. Government was not satisfied with this and held that the plan was not effective enough to bring about substantial changes in the Japanese economy and did not guarantee an expansion of imports from the United States. The U.S. side insisted that Japan should have "objective standards" for expanding the openness of its market and should lay down "quantitative targets" for imports. Japan refused to accept this, holding that this would be de facto "managed trade," which goes against the principle of free trade. As the two leaders held tough positions, the talks inevitably broke down. Observers here held that the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict can mainly be attributed to the following factors. First, after the end of the Cold War, the Untied States gave top priority to correcting its trade imbalance with Japan in its Japanese policy, and it is impossible for Japan to require the United States to make concessions on the grounds of "strengthening global cooperation between Japan and the United States." Before Hosokawa visited the United States this time, the Japanese foreign minister arrived in Washington one day earlier and met with a lot of key diplomats and security officials on the U.S. side in the hope that U.S. officials would persuade American business circles, as they had done before, and would thus make concessions. However, he found that the U.S. officials held the same position and in turn required the Japanese side to make concessions. Second, the Clinton administration has found it harder to endure the increasing trade deficits incurred by its country, and resolved to adopt tough measures to reduce the trade deficit with Japan for the sake of the U.S. economy and employment prospects. At the summit meeting, the Japanese side did not give an impression of weakness. Japan opposed the adoption of quantitative targets. On the one hand, it does not want to subject itself to U.S. controls; on the other hand, Japan has not yet recovered from its most serious economic recession since the end of World War II and is finding it hard to increase imports. As both the United States and Japan have to proceed from their respective interests, it will be hard for them to actually solve their trade frictions.
