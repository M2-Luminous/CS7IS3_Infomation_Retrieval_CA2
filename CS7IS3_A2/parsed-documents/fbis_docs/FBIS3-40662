Bansi Dhar, President of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said the global trade would now move forward with more certainty in the years ahead. "The world merchandise trade of $3800 billion will be able to come out of sluggish growth which it had slipped into the last few years," he said, adding that world trade would grow by 8 per cent to 9 per cent per annum for the remaining years of the century. N. Sankar, a president of Indian National Committee of International Chamber of Commerce (INC-ICC), while complimenting the governments of 116 countries and GATT director general Peter Sutherland, said that GATT round would strengthen the multilaterism and reduce the tempo of building trade blocs and scope of bilateral and plurilateral agreements on trade issues. L.K. Modi, president of North Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) said that countries like India would benefit because of the larger market access given in the services and agricultural products.
