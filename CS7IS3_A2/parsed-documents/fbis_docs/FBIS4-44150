A crack 60-strong unit that arrived at Cyangugu, across the border from Zaire, on Thursday, was on Friday assessing the humanitarian needs of the civilian population of the region, the army's Information Department said here. A giant Russian-built Antonov 22 transport plane left France on Friday with 80 tonnes of medical equipment and medicines. The plane was bound either for Bangui, Central African Republic, or Libreville, Gabon, a military spokesman said. The equipment would then be transferred to France's two staging areas in eastern Zaire at Goma and Bukavu. A second Antonov carrying a similar 80-tonne cargo was scheduled to leave Lyon, central France, for Africa later on Friday. Meanwhile a UN spokesman reported in the capital, Kigali, that rebel and army gunners pounded Kigali overnight and sporadic fighting continued Friday as UN forces prepared to evacuate hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a United Nations spokesman said. "The fighting was very intense last night," said UN military spokesman Jean-Guy Plante, contacted by telephone from Nairobi. "There was a lot of heavy mortar and machinegun fire." Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the capital Kigali, apparently fearing that the French troops may forestall an all-out victory by the rebels, who control about two-thirds of the small central African country. In Paris, the military said the 60 troops sent on the UN-mandated mercy mission spent their first night in Cyangugu "without incident" and were "welcomed" by local people. [passage omitted] The 50-bed field hospital will have an operating theatre and 12 doctors forming two full medical teams. [passage omitted] The French expeditionary force, which will have a full strength of 2,500, is to set up safe areas for minority Tutsi people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the majority Hutu government. [passage omitted] In Nairobi, the STANDARD newspaper, which is owned by the Lonrho multinational, said Friday the French operation was "pure neo-colonialism" aimed at strengthening French influence in the regime. Plante said UN commander General Romeo Dallaire planned to meet Rwandan Army chief of staff General Augustin Bizimungu later Friday to discuss the French intervention and the future UN role in Rwanda. The UN has fewer than 500 soldiers in Rwanda, but plans to boost the force to several thousand. [passage omitted] Plante said UN troops in Kigali planned to escort about 800 displaced people under UN guard at the airport to a camp at the King Faisal hospital where thousands of civilians are sheltering.
