FR941230-0-00141 FR941230-0-00022 (D) Full credit is given for periods of nonpay status during which an employee was eligible to receive continuation of pay or injury compensation under the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. Full credit also is given for periods of time off the rolls during which an employee was eligible to receive injury compensation under the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, provided the person is reemployed under part 353 of this chapter. (E) Credit is given for up to 30 calendar days for time off the rolls that follows separation by reduction in force of employees who are eligible for entry on the reemployment priority list under subpart B of part 330 of this chapter, provided the person is reemployed in Federal service during the period of his or her reemployment priority; and (F) Credit is given for up to 30 calendar days for time off the rolls that follow involuntary separation without personal cause of employees who are eligible for a noncompetitive appointment based on an interchange agreement with another merit system under ยง6.7 of this chapter, provided the person is employed in the competitive service under the agreement during the period of his or her eligibility. (iii) Restoration based on unwarranted or improper actions. (A) Based on a finding made before March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation if he or she was eligible to receive retroactive pay under 5 U.S.C. 5591&hyph;93 (formerly Pub. L. 80&hyph;623) or 5 U.S.C. 5594 (formerly Pub. L. 81&hyph;733). (B) Based on a finding made on or after March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation for which he or she is eligible to receive back pay. If the employee is restored to duty at a date later than the original adverse action, credit for intervening periods of nonpay status or breaks in service is given in accordance with other provisions of this subsection. If the employee had been properly separated from the rolls of the agency before a finding was made that the adverse action was unwarranted or improper, the correction and additional service credit given the employee may not extend beyond the date of the proper separation. (iv) Intervening service. Certain types of service that ordinarily are not creditable are counted when they intervene between two periods of creditable service without a single break in service in excess of 30 calendar days, excepted as provided in subparagraph (H) of his paragraph. Under these conditions, credit is given for periods of service: (A) In the excepted service of the Federal executive branch, including employment in nonappropriated fund positions in or under any Federal agency; (B) Under temporary, term, or other nonpermanent employment in the Federal competitive service; (C) In the Senior Executive Service; (D) In the Federal legislative branch; (E) In the Federal judicial branch; (F) In the armed forces; (G) In the District of Columbia Government through December 31, 1979. For an employee on the District rolls on December 31, 1979, who converted on January 1, 1980, to the District independent personnel system, credit also is given for service between January 1, 1980, and September 25, 1980. Otherwise, service in the District of Columbia Government on or after January 1, 1980, is not creditable as intervening service; and (H) Performed overseas by family members, as defined by ยง315.608 of this chapter. Such service is creditable toward career tenure if it intervenes between two periods of creditable service without a single break in excess of 180 days. * * * * * 3. In ยง315.401, paragraph (b) is revised and paragraph (c) is added, to read as follows: ยง315.401 Reinstatement. * * * * * (b) Time limit. There is no time limit on the reinstatement eligibility of a preference eligible or a person who completed the service requirement for career tenure. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an agency may reinstate a nonpreference eligible who has not completed the service requirement for career tenure only within 3 years following the date of separation. This time limit begins to run from the date of separation from the last position in which the person served under a career appointment, career-conditioned appointment, indefinite appointment in lieu of reinstatement, or an appointment under which he or she acquired competitive status. (c) Extension of time limit. Intervening service of the following types extends the 3-year limit on reinstatement of eligibility of a nonpreference eligible who has not completed the service requirement for career tenure: (1) Employment in Federal competitive service positions under temporary, term, indefinite, or other nonpermanent appointment. (2) Employment in Federal excepted, nonappropriated fund, or Senior Executive Service positions in the executive branch; (3) Employment in the Federal judicial branch or in the executive or judicial branches of the insular possessions of the United States; (4) Employment in Federal legislative branch; (5) Employment in an international governmental organization or a territorial, State, county, municipal, or foreign government in a position in which the agency determines that the proposed appointee acquired valuable training and experience for the position to be filled; (6) A substantially full-time training course in any educational institution of recognized standing when the agency finds that the proposed appointee acquired valuable training or experience for the position to be filled; (7) Compulsory service on work of national importance under civilian direction as required by the Military Selective Service Act; (8) Active military duty terminated under honorable conditions; (9) Service with the District of Columbia Government prior to January 1, 1980. In addition, for an employee on the District Government rolls on December 31, 1979, who was converted on January 1, 1980, to the District of Columbia merit personnel system, continuous District Government service after that date also extends the 3-year period; (10) Periods of nonemployement during which a person is eligible for injury compensation under the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs; (11) Periods of nonemployment during which a person receives disability retirement under the Civil Service or Federal Employees Retirement System; (12) Employment by a nonfederal organization when the person's function was transferred to the nonfederal organization on a contract basis or by law or executive order; (13) Volunteer service and training required prior to actual enrollment as a volunteer with Peace Corps, VISTA, and other ACTION programs if it begins within the period the person is eligible for reinstatement; and (14) Periods of overseas residence during which a spouse or unmarried child, under 21 years of age, of a member of the Armed Forces or of a Federal civilian employee is accompanying that individual on official assignment to an overseas post of duty.
