The last two years were not simple for our people. During this period we have experienced such events that will not be forgotten by the people for a long time. The past year, despite economic difficulties, has firmly established the position of peace in the republic and allowed the safeguarding of the integrity of our Motherland and the restoral of law and order. Our people began peaceful constructive labor, tackling the issues of industrial production. Unfortunately, so far we have many difficult problems, similar to those that all of the peoples of the former Soviet Union are currently facing. All of us feel for ourselves the consequences of breaking the economic ties between the states of the former Soviet Union republics. Prices of food, consumer goods, and fuel have sharply risen. The financial system is in crisis. I have felt the pain of the people during numerous meetings with the workers of the different branches of the national economy, war and labor veterans, and intellectuals. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government of the republic have been persistently looking for ways to resolve these problems in the course of 1993. It was not (?easy) and that is for a number of objective reasons. The leadership of the republic has inherited a ruined economy after the 16th session of the Supreme Soviet. The 18th session of the Supreme Soviet, which was convened recently, has adopted a number of laws and decisions that are laying a firm foundation in the development of our national economy. Next year we intend to change the basic principles of our policy. We intend to direct the main force to [word indistinct] construction of agriculture and other branches connected with the well-being of the people. In the new year we will undertake a number of measures to promote the stabilization of the situation in connection with ensuring the rights of citizens. We will carry on a ruthless struggle against speculators, criminals, and mafia groups. The other problem is the repatriation of refugees. We will do everything to bring home those compatriots who had to flee the republic. In the course of the visit of Mr. Borhanoddin Rabbani, the head of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, to our republic, along with the solution of other important problems, we have concluded an agreement on refugees together with the representatives of the Commissioner of the United Nations. Dear compatriots, my big wish in the new year is that all citizens of free Tajikistan will be busy in working hand in hand to improve services and utilities in the Motherland and to treat each other kindly. The draft of the new constitution of the republic will be submitted to the public referendum no later than 1994 to provide an opportunity to the people to determine the kind of future -- presidential or parliament. The election of the new parliament and the head of state will take place in autumn. Let the people elect freely the form of the government and its head. Dear compatriots, all our achievements and the authority of the republic is the result of the friendship and merit of those peoples who are living in Tajikistan. During the difficult days of the past year, the Russians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyzs, Turkmens, and the representatives of other peoples selflessly worked together with their Tajik brothers and sisters to restore the economy and [word indistinct] of the Motherland. The fraternity and friendship of the peoples of Tajikistan is the foundation of the young sovereign state of Tajikistan on which we will build the future. The international spirit of the Tajik people was also displayed in that during the comparatively short historical period of time it was recognized [words indistinct] countries. On the eve of the new year I would like to express sincere gratitude to (?United Nations) organizations and heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States for their disinterested assistance and support. Sovereign Tajikistan must go through a new stage of development in the new year. In connection with this, I confidently address the people who have great experience -- war and labor veterans, peaceful women, careful mothers, and glorious youth -- let us in the new year, shoulder to shoulder, by joint efforts take our republic out of the difficult social and economic situation. Popular wisdom says that when there is an order and mutual respect in the family then one can achieve all kinds of success. Let the new year of 1994 be for all of us a year of well-being, happiness, peace, and prosperity.
