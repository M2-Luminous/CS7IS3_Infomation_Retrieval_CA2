FR940902-2-00102 FR940902-2-00049 a. Number of Claimants Referred. The burden of reporting to service providers should not be placed upon claimants when services are not available. Similarly, service providers should not be required to expend time and resources working with referred claimants when services are not available for them. Therefore, there must be a balance between the available supply of services and referrals to these services. To avoid excessive referrals, the agreement must provide a method for assuring that the number of claimants referred to the provider is based on the number the provider is able to serve. Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, only requires the referral to ``available'' reemployment services of claimants identified as likely to exhaust regular UI and who need job search assistance. Therefore, the State will meet the requirements of Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, when the supply of services and referrals to these services is balanced. b. Receipt of Information. New Section 303(a)(10), SSA, requires that claimants, identified and referred to reemployment services through profiling, participate in such services, or in similar services, as a condition of UI eligibility. Also, Section 303(a)(1), SSA, requires ``methods of administration *␣*␣* as are found by the Secretary to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.'' This means the UI agency must have methods of administration for obtaining eligibility information from service providers and for promptly determining eligibility based on this information. To ensure service providers meet the UI agency's needs, arrangements must exist for the prompt provision of any necessary eligibility information concerning participation or availability. States also will need to establish methods of administration for obtaining this information when claimants are attending ``similar services'' as discussed in item 11.b. Further, as discussed in item 12 below, States must provide information to this Department related to reemployment services received by claimants and employment outcomes. Arrangements must be made for the provision of this information. 6. Definition of ``Reemployment Services.'' The second conference report for Public Law 103&hyph;152, which added Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) to the SSA, describes ``reemployment services'' as including_ Job search assistance and job placement services, such as counseling, testing, and providing occupational and labor market information, assessment, job search workshops, job clubs and referrals to employers, and other similar services. [H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1993)] Reemployment services need not include skills and education training. Therefore, States are not required to apply the participation requirement discussed in item 11.a. to such training even if claimants are referred to such training through the worker profiling and reemployment services system. Orientation and assessment activities are both reemployment services for purposes of Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) SSA. Orientation is a service since claimants are made aware of why services are available and what the services are and, as a result, are able to participate in the identification of appropriate services to assist them in returning to employment. Assessment is a service since it identifies the specific needs of each claimant. Assessment is also listed as a reemployment service in the Committee Report. 7. Benefit Rights Interview (BRI). Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, individuals who may be entitled to UI must be provided information as will reasonably afford them an opportunity to know, establish and protect their rights under the UI law of the State. Therefore, BRI information provided to claimants during the initial claims taking process must advise claimants of the possible consequences of failure to report or to participate in any reemployment services to which they may be referred. 8. Identifying Claimants Likely to Exhaust and in Need of Reemployment Services a. Who is to be Profiled. Section 303(j)(1)(A), SSA, requires that State agencies establish and utilize a system of profiling ``all new claimants for regular compensation'' (i.e., regular UI) that ``identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment.'' Based on the plain language of Section 303(j)(1)(A), all claimants for regular UI must be profiled. The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in Section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85), *␣*␣* other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Through the reference to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85, the phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation'' includes claimants filing for UI for ex-servicemembers (UCX) and Federal employees (UCFE). The phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation'' includes all intrastate, interstate and combined-wage claimants. The Department will work with the States in developing arrangements for profiling interstate claimants. In determining whether to take action against a State which is not profiling and referring interstate claimants, the Department will take into account the feasibility of such State taking appropriate action. b. Who is to be Identified. The profiling system must be structured so as to identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UI and will need job search assistance services to make successful transition to new employment. If a claimant is not permanently laid off, there is no need for job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment'' and the likelihood of exhaustion also decreases. Similarly, if jobs exist in the current industry or occupation, then the claimant is less likely to exhaust and to need job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment.'' The word ``transition'' as used in Section 303(j)(1), SSA, indicates that the requirement for participation in reemployment services is not aimed at claimants who are merely between jobs in the same industry or occupation, but instead at claimants who are having to make a ``transition'' to jobs in a different industry or occupation.
