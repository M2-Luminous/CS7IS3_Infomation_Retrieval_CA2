Galaydin, A.I. Zamyatin, and V.A. Ivanov, Institute of Precision Mechanics and Optics, Chair of Radio Apparatus Design and Manufacture, St. Petersburg; UDC 621.318.4] [Abstract] Synthesis of an optimum magnetic system for magnetic resonance imagers is considered, namely maximizing the size of the region of a highly uniform polarizing magnetic field with the minimum number of coils having equal inside diameters and carrying currents of the same density. The conventional method of such a synthesis is expanding the magnetic induction into a Taylor series and subsequently selecting system parameters which minimize several first terms of the series so as to ensure that the deviation from field uniformity will not exceed typically the 10[.sup]-5[/] % order of magnitude. Regions with smaller deviation are obviously smaller. A fourth-order and thus simplest magnetic system consisting of two Helmholtz coils is inadequate for this application, because the region with an even larger (10[.sup]-4[/] %) permissible deviation from field uniformity is too small. In use are now a sixth-order magnetic system of four coils (U.S. patent No. 4276529, 1981), compensated solenoids with a sixth-order outside groove (Ravi Kumar and P. Chaddan in Cryogenics Vol. 27, 1987), and an eighth-order magnetic system with three circuits (FRG patent No. 35 17818). Even in these systems is the region of uniform magnetic field still not large enough, unless they have a large inside diameter but then so is their weight and power requirement. A better alternative is shown to be a tenth-order magnetic system with only three equally spaced solenoids having equal inside diameters and wound with rectangular conductors, a longer one with a smaller outside diameter between two identical shorter ones with larger outside diameters along the common axis. The method of Taylor series expansion is applied here to the longitudinal component of magnetic induction at any point a distance z away from the axis of a solenoid with an inside radius R and a length L. The geometry of the central solenoid is characterized by two dimensionless parameters a[.sup]1[/],b[.sub]1[/]. The two lateral solenoids are regarded as the difference between two solenoids with dimensionless geometrical parameters a[.sup]2[/],b[.sub]3[/] and a[.sub]2[/], b[.sub]2[/] respectively. Such a magnetic system is thus characterized by five dimensionless design parameters. With the value of a[.sup]1[/] (or any one of the other parameters) specified, the other four are evaluated as polynomial functions of that one. This has been done numerically for a[.sup]1[/]= 1.1, with each of the other four parameters expressed as complete fifth-degree polynomial in a[.sup]1[/]- 1 with a free term each. On this basis has been built a resistive MR imager with a two-loop water cooling system. The solenoids are wound with tubular rectangular conductors, the central one having 10 layers of 72 turns and each lateral having 14 layers of 29 turns, for a nominal magnetic induction of 0.1 T and an operating current of 111 A. The inside diameter and the total length are 71 cm and 176.8 cm respectively, the larger outside diameter being 87.3 cm. The diameter of the active region with a less than 10[.sup]-5[/] % deviation from field uniformity is 52 cm. The imager weighs 800 kg and draws a power of 39 kW.
