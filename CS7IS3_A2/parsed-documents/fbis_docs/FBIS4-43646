His new importance is not due to himself, but to Zaire's crucial position in Central Africa. The only safe way for the French soldiers who President Francois Mitterrand wants to send to Rwanda is through Zaire and not through Tanzania because the entire eastern side of Rwanda is in the hands of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. Ugandan President Museveni is on the RPF side. In the southern Sudan, there is a total war between the government army and the south in revolt. At the OAU summit in Tunis last week, Mobutu called for a military intervention to end the slaughter and fighting, if the warring parties did not succeed in doing so on their own. Mobutu used the same words as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, also indicating that the proposal to send a multinational peacekeeping force to Rwanda was a French-Zairian initiative. By supporting Paris's stance, Mobutu increases his own importance. Mobutu immediately capitalized on his higher status as a French ally in the Rwandan drama. At the end of the OAU summit in Tunis last week, Mobutu commented ironically on his "Belgian friends." "Belgium and Zaire," Mobutu said, "are two totally different things. They have nothing to do with one another. My only concern is that everyone should be able to make their bed as they like to sleep in it." In other words: Belgium, mind your own business. There is nothing in Zaire for you any more. His new self-assurance was also shown in his treatment of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi is officially still the prime minister, appointed by the Sovereign Conference. First, Mobutu gave Tshisekedi a lesson by "arresting" him and keeping him overnight. The argument went that Tshisekedi was on prohibited military territory. Mobutu wanted to make it clear that Tshisekedi was a normal citizen like any other, without special rights and privileges, and that he should no longer have any illusions. Then Mobutu had the Transitional Parliament, in the absence of the Radical Opposition, appoint the old faithful [Joseph] Kengo wa Dondo as the new head of government. As far as Mobutu is concerned, Tshisekedi is a "negligible quantity." And who is disagreeing with him: The groups who supported the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] leader in the past are completely silent now. The objections against Mobutu expressed in the past, including by France, have now been forgotten. The French paratroopers who, according to Paris, are going to end the bloodbath in Rwanda, must after all not only have safe access, but also a safe exit route. And that only goes through Zaire. For this reason it is important for Paris that Mobutu is on France's side at this moment. Moreover no one can predict whether and when "something" will happen in Burundi. And in that case too Mobutu is the only point of support, not only for the French, but also for the Belgians, at least if the Belgians, who would then be caught like rats in a trap, are to be evacuated. In any case, the Zairian president is seizing the opportunity offered to him with both hands to promote himself as the key man in Zaire. For the last three years, he has been given the cold shoulder by Belgium, France, and the United States. The Rwandan drama shows that in the present circumstances they can no longer allow themselves to do so. Mobutu knows that.
