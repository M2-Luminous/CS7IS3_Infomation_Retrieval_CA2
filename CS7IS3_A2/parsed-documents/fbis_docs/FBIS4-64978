The minister is expected to announce a plan that would allow Canada to make arrests, levy fines, and confiscate vessels and fish catches of crews who break the law by taking cod. Overfishing by both foreign and domestic fleets is blamed for the near-extinction of northern cod and serious depletion of other bottom dwelling fish in Canadian east coast waters. Mr. Tobin is particularly upset about those foreign trawlers which continue to catch tonnes of undersized cod while thousands of Canadian fishermen and plant workers are paid not to fish in Canadian waters.
