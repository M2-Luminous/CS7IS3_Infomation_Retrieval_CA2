N. Budnik, Yu. D. Minov, V. N. Sosnitskiy, P. I. Sutkovoy; UDC 537.312.62] [Abstract]A study of the characteristics of a relaxation SQUID magnetometer is performed. Two modifications are made to the base- line system of the SQUID by introducing an additional inductive coupling for the interferometer with power bus and a shunting circuit. The experimental results conformed to the theoretical analysis and showed the positive influence of these modifications in the form of an increased conversion coefficient, and a reduction in the effect of unstable power current and external interference. This reduces requirements established for the power circuits and for shielding the electronic components of the SQUID from external magnetic interference for magnetometers operating under high interference and on an unstable power line. The proposed correction for the control characteristic of the relaxation SQUID may be used to improve precision and accuracy characteristics of SQUID magnetometers. Figures 5; references 10.
