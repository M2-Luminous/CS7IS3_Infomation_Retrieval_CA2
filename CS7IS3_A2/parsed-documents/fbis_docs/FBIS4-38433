It Is Proposed To Share Out the Burden of Economic Crisis Equally Among Everybody"] [Text] Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov spent the past weekend with Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Directorate for Liaison with the Territories, in Penza where they inspected a cantonment and met with district administration chiefs and deputies of the oblast legislative assembly. In the established tradition of first acquainting the Russian heartland with pending changes in economic policy, Sergey Filatov told those present that in June 1994 the annual credit rate in Russia will be reduced to 180 percent. According to him, "the process of reducing the credit rate will continue also in the future," and in the end the notion of easy credits will be excluded from Russian economics while the banking system "will enter a civilized path." Today, Mr. Filatov said, more material assets, especially foreign exchange, are being taken out of Russian than brought into it from abroad. Whereas the Russian economy needs $10-12 billion to "revive," we have only $2-2.5 billion, Mr. Filatov stated, and therefore the country's leadership is drafting measures to ensure that the hard currency returns to Russia. In his opinion, the Russian tax system is ineffective: An increase in tax collection by a mere 20 percent will make it possible to cut the planned budget deficit by 73 billion rubles. Mr. Filatov described the process of closing down loss-making state enterprises as "normal and natural." He identified two lines for reforming the state sector in industry: "reorganization of the state enterprise management system which will make it possible to put things in order and create a barrier to abuses by the body of directors using enterprise funds for their own personal aims, and also provision of state assistance to enterprises which have found a niche in the market economy." In the near future, Mr. Filatov said, offering a revealing glimpse of government, industrial enterprises will be exempted from the requirement to maintain social programs. In time, social amenities will be transferred to the jurisdiction of local self-government and will be financed from budget funds. According to the presidential chief of staff, it is necessary to share out "the burden of the present economic crisis" equally among all strata of Russian society. "Last year the gap between the rich and the poor was three- to four-fold but now it has grown to 14- fold," he said. At the same time in developed countries this indicator does not exceed five. "The social differentiation currently observed in Russia," Sergey Filatov stressed, "is fraught with instability because our people are particularly sensitive to injustice." He did not however specify how it is planned to apportion this burden "in equal shares." According to Mr. Filatov, the Russian leadership is moving from the policy of lobbying to the policy of comprehensive economic reforms. One such measure will be cutting sectoral subsidies and privileges because such investments are becoming "a drug just for one day." "In the future," Mr. Filatov stressed, "investments will be made in promising projects and efficient enterprises." The presidential apparatus is drafting a package of state targeted programs: In the very near future the following programs will be submitted to the president: Russia's Natural Resources (on mineral deposits); National Information Networks; Russia's Health (on supplying the country's population with medicines); Development of Power Engineering and Alternative Energy Sources; Energy Saving Resources; Public Telephone (this program envisions a substantial increase in telephone networks for the public); Protein and the Food Industry; Ecology; and Cadres and Education of the Future. Sergey Filatov is already thinking about future cadres, especially those who will be taking part in the 1996 election campaign. "We intend to rename the Russian Management Academy the Russian Academy of Civil Service and educate there new politicians from among provincial political leaders, entrepreneurs, and other categories of Russian citizens," he said. Furthermore, education of future cadres, according to the presidential chief of staff, will be facilitated by the pending law on civil service. Talking about the state anticrime program, Mr. Filatov estimated it at 4 billion rubles. Until this program has begun to work at full capacity, Filatov called for support for the Moscow mayor's initiative, and "everywhere, where it is possible and where there are sufficient funds and the will exists, create workers' volunteer groups to maintain order in residential districts."
