Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said although his country supports the idea behind the Partnership programme he did not feel it would "strengthen the security in Europe but, on the contrary, might throw the situation off balance." "We consider the cooperation in the framework of the Partnership as a street with two-way traffic," he added in a speech to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "On the one hand, we must adapt ourselves to the NATO standards and contribute to the NATO's activities and on the other hand, we feel that finally NATO must inevitably change its nature in the course of cooperation with the partners." In addition to Ukraine, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia and Hungary have also signed on to the Partnership deal which provides for wider military cooperation with former Soviet bloc countries but stops short of offering them, at least immediately, full NATO membership. Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general, said that "by signing this document today, you (Ukraine) indicate the importance you attach to the goal we all share through such cooperation. "Most of all it is a recognition that in today's world, the benefits of independence can only be enjoyed and safeguarded through cooperation with others."
