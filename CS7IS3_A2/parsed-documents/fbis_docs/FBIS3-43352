This has just been established by an authoritative opinion poll. More than nine out of 10 people (92 percent) stated that this is why they are going to vote. The competition among the various parties is still wide open, however, because more than a third of the voters (33 percent) have still not decided who is going to get their ballots. This poll did not include partisan political questions--in contrast to two others that show that the African National Congress (ANC) is going to win by a wide margin. (Report below) The poll, which was conducted by three American institutions--the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies--shows that most South Africans fear political violence and crime. But the enormous gulf that exists between the various population groups is also evident from the survey, which consisted of a total of 2,352 interviews conducted throughout the country between 19 August and 26 September. Of these, 1,250 were conducted with blacks, 301 with whites, 450 with coloreds, and 351 with Indians. The homelands, self-governing regions, and rural areas were included. Some of the results of the poll that was made public this weekend include: - A total of 75 percent of the respondents said that right-wing extremists are going to unleash a war in the country; - Most South Africans are of the opinion that their lives are going to improve after the election. Only 8 percent of whites share this opinion as opposed to 73 percent of blacks; - Most of the people who are hopeful about the future are less well-off and a large majority of those who are under 35 years of age (59 percent). Less than half of the older people are optimistic; - There are great differences between whites and blacks in regard to 13 questions put to them. Of the 13 questions, the two groups agree on only one issue: that South Africa's foreign trade is going to improve. Most blacks believe that eight of the 13 problems will get better after the election, as opposed to whites, who believe that the situation in 12 of the 13 cases is going to get worse; - A full 80 percent--primarily blacks and whites--say they will "very probably" vote, as opposed to Indians and coloreds, who are not as eager; - The greatest concern is over political violence, crime, and the economy. About one-third of the respondents said that political violence is sometimes justified; - Men and women differ a great deal on this issue, however. Some 72 percent of women say there is never a justification for political violence in contrast to 63 percent of men. For the most part, it is the younger men who feel this way. There are significant differences among blacks. Some 53 percent of Xhosas said that violence is sometimes necessary, as opposed to only 18 percent of Zulus; - Black people are hopeful about the election in contrast to the feelings of whites that can be summed up as "anxious." Coloreds are hopeful for the most part as well, while Indians' feelings can best be summed up as "perplexed." 1 Question: How do see your life in the next few years?
