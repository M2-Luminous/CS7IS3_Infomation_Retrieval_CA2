[Filippov] In my analytical report, I wrote that the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is inadmissible in the form it is currently being envisioned. [Samoylov] The saddest thing is that, in Belarus, nobody, aside from a narrow circle of people, knows all details of the upcoming agreement, despite numerous reports. Discussions on this issue generally concern the very idea of unification and its intentions.... As everybody knows, however, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.... [Filippov] We knew about all the shortcomings of this agreement. It would be an economic absurdity if banks that issue money united, and the Central Bank of Russia became the main bank, but their budgets and the bodies that draft them did not unite. [Samoylov] What threat is associated with this? [Filippov] Russia would lose several trillion rubles. Belarus would be threatened with upheavals connected with the fact that its macroeconomic indexes, such as the level of wages, are different. This would inevitably lead to tension. Certain Belarusian products would not be competitive on the Russian market. [Samoylov] They are already uncompetitive. The government claims that this is due to expensive energy resources and high customs duties. [Filippov] This could be resolved by signing a civilized agreement on free trade and customs union. If we abolish customs duties, internal and external prices will be equalized. [Samoylov] Many Belarusians have the same opinion. We are being told, however, that there is no sense in arguing, since everything has already been arranged, and [Russian Prime Minister] Chernomyrdin will soon arrive to sign the documents.... [Filippov] My opinion is one, Chernomyrdin's is another.... [Samoylov] What is the opinion of [Russian President] Yeltsin? Can the president interfere once the agreement is already signed? [Filippov] Yes, he can. He stated in his annual address that "any unifications and unions are possible, however, without damaging Russia." I will repeat: If the monetary systems are unified, this will become a millstone around Russia's neck. [Samoylov] This is very likely to happen however. Certain doubts are raised here. For example, your miners are not paid for months, and entire regions are left without money. Is there a threat that Belarus will end up in the same situation following the unification of the two monetary systems? [Filippov] The problem does not lie here. It does not require much effort to ceaselessly print "zaychiks" [Belarusian currency] -- as your government does -- to cover budget shortages, which triggers inflation and price hikes. The Russian Government endeavors to prevent the unnecessary issuing of money. Sometimes this even leads to undesired results. for instance, Finance Minister Fedorov did not print additional money, and he did not pay peasants for grain ordered by the state. He did not pay the defense industry for tanks and missiles either. The defense industry was not able to pay the metallurgical branch, which was not able to pay miners. Nevertheless, the government can be blamed only partially for this. The delays in payments are also connected with the fact that commercial structures do not pay one another either. They spent their money, for example, on privatization, or simply transferred the money abroad. The strike in Nadyma erupted when the oil industry refused to exchange their hard currency for rubles and pay construction workers. Such phenomena are regulated by the law in the West. In Russia, as well as in Belarus, there is a gap in the law. Our principle is that money should be earned, and we will stick to this. [Samoylov] Many people here fear that the merger will be followed by a rapid influx of Russian shadow capital, which will "prikhvatize" [coined from the word "privatize" and the Russian word for "appropriate" -- "prikhvatit"] our economy immediately.... [Filippov] Russia's current commercial structures have some $17 million in foreign bank accounts. Do you think that it is impossible to transfer at least part of this money to your republic right now, and eat Belarus up, lock, stock, and barrel? Even Switzerland can be eaten up. [Samoylov] I think that Switzerland is beyond your capacity. It is a powerful state with clever laws.... [Filippov] Capital flows to those countries which have better working conditions and legal guarantees. That is why it comes from Russia. I am convinced that its outflow from Belarus, rather than its influx to this country, will be even greater. [Samoylov] It is this that is happening. By hook or by crook, all enterprises leave their profits in Russian or other banks. [Filippov] This is natural. Nevertheless, our reform has gone much farther. Our inflation rate is lower. The key thing is that there is the hope in Russia that reform will be completed. While in your country.... It is enough to take the draft law on fixed prices alone.... I suppose that the first country to fall into the abyss of the terrible economic crisis will be Ukraine. Belarus will follow suit, while Russia will pull out of the crisis.... [Samoylov] What would you advise us in this situation? [Filippov] Not to count on privileges that the merger of the currency systems is supposed to bring, but to speed up reform and implement a tough financial policy.
