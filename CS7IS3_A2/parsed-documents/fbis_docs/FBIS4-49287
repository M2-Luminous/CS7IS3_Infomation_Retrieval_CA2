The conclusion has been drawn from facts in Jiangsu Province over the past few months since the institution of the new taxation and foreign exchange systems at the beginning of this year. Jiangsu ranks the second in China in terms of the number of foreign-funded enterprises. The Nantong Chia Tai Group Company, a Sino-Thai joint venture in Jiangsu Province, reported a gain of 3.7 million yuan in profits in the first quarter of this year. It has decided to spend an additional three million yuan on upgrading its technology and equipment. "We firmly endorse the new tax system and take the lead in implementing it," said Tanes Seriburi, vice-president of the agro-ind. business group under the Chia Tai group of companies, in a letter to the provincial tax authorities. Kam Sueg Hoon, manager of the Lianyungang Jinwu Seasoning Company Ltd, said, "the new tax system is getting closer to international conventions. It has many points in common with the tax system in the Republic of Korea. It is much easier to understand than the old one." Teruju Kawakami, general manager of the Nanjing Fujitsu Telecommunications Equipment Company Ltd, complained of increased expenditure due to the unification of the exchange rates, but he had to admit that the reform is fair to all enterprises in the country. He is optimistic about the future of his company in China as China's market of posts and telecommunications is fast expanding. China abrogated the former consolidated industrial and commercial tax, which required tax payment at every link of production and circulation, and instituted the value-added tax, which requires part of the former tax payment. Parallel with the reform is the unification of the state pegged rate and the swap market rate. "The reform measures are favorable for further opening to the outside world and promote the development of foreign-funded enterprises," said Wong Ronghua, director of the provincial tax bureau. "The reforms have equalized the tax burdens of all enterprises, thus putting them on an equal footing in competition," he said. "The new tax system would make it favorable for enterprises to improve their economic efficiency." Jiangsu had approved 21,161 foreign-funded enterprises by the end of March this year, ranking second in the country after economically booming Guangdong Province in southern China. More than 8,000 of them are in operation. A sample survey shows that most of the foreign-funded enterprises have expressed their understanding of and welcome for China's current reform. "While the new tax system is being enforced, the preferential policies with regard to income tax on foreign-funded enterprises remain intact," he said. "For foreign-funded enterprises which have their tax burden increased due to the payment of turn-over taxes, the province adopted the method of postponing such payment pending the promulgation of the detailed rules for the implementation of the state regulations on tax refund for foreign-funded enterprises." He said that the current tax reform has in fact reduced to varying degrees the tax burdens of most foreign-funded enterprises. A survey of six foreign-funded enterprises in Zhenjiang shows that five have found their tax burdens down while only one said its tax burden has increased. Computed according to the base figure of 1993, the average tax burden of the six enterprises has been reduced by 31.9 percent. The reform of the exchange rate system over the past four months proved that it has not caused any difficulty to foreign-funded enterprises in the use and settlement of foreign exchange. Zhang Bingyu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Exchange Center, said foreign exchange markets and offices are still carrying on their business of servicing foreign-funded enterprises which sell and purchase foreign currencies. According to statistics, foreign-funded enterprises sold 124 million U.S. dollars on and purchased 266 million U.S. dollars from these markets and offices in the first quarter of this year. Zhang noted that a foreign-funded enterprise may open a foreign currency account with a bank and transfer and use its foreign currency. So far, the province has 175 banking offices engaged in such business, ranking first in the country. A survey of 5,078 foreign-funded enterprises shows that these enterprises generated industrial output value amounting to 10.37 billion yuan in the January-March period, up 56 percent over the same period of last year, obtained sales income totalling 7.82 billion yuan, up 60 percent, and made profits of 180 million yuan, up 29 percent. These enterprises exported 346 million U.S. Dollars-worth of goods in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 18.5 percent over the same period last year, and accounting for more than one fourth of the province's total. Accord)ng to the survey, therare still a few foreign-funded enterprises affected by the reform of the tax and exchange rate systems and their production cost has increased. "So long as these enterprises improve their production management, they are still able to gain ideal economic efficiency," an official in charge of the survey said. One example is the Huafei Color Display Systems Company Ltd, a large Sino-Dutch joint venture in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province. The company has overcome the rise in the cost of production materials by rearranging its product structure, raising the percentage of product qualification and reducing production costs. The company exported more than three million U.S. dollars-worth of products in the first four months of this year. According to the provincial commission of foreign economic relations and trade, a number of noted companies from the Netherlands, Britain, Singapore and Japan have increased their investments in Jiangsu this year.
