FR940602-2-00118 FR940602-2-00078 Phlx Response The Phlx refutes the arguments raised by Shoreline. 15 First, the Phlx believes that the proposal will in fact add liquidity to the market, thus directly benefiting public customers. The Phlx believes the proposal will attract new specialist units to the Exchange and will encourage these New Units to make tight markets in New Options Classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Phlx argues that because every newly listed options class is subject to multiple listings, disincentives are created which discourage specialist units from acting as specialists for those new classes of options. The Phlx believes that the Enhanced parity Split will counteract these disincentives by offering New Units a direct benefit if they are able to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Exchange believes the New Units will be able to attract this order flow, and thus capitalize on the Enhanced Parity Split, only if they maintain tight markets in the New Options Classes. As a result, the Phlx believes that public customers will directly benefit from the proposed rule change. 15 See Phlx Response Letter, supra note 5. The Phlx also disagrees with Shoreline's contention that any enhanced split is anti-competitive. First, the Enhanced Parity Split is available to any market making firm that is willing to establish a New Unit. Secondly, the proposal does not impact parity splits on existing options classes or New Options Classes traded by existing specialist units. Finally, a market maker can always establish priority in a trade by improving the market or by being the first in establishing a market that would otherwise be on parity. In response to the commenter's claims that market makers are unfairly disadvantaged by this proposal, the Phlx makes several arguments. First, the Phlx states that the claims that market makers will be hampered in hedging trades where they improve the market does not take into account the possibility that the market maker may be able to hedge by improving both sides of the market or by utilizing another options series for purposes of hedging. Additionally, the proposal does not impact in any manner the ability of a market maker to hedge an options position with underlying stock. Further, the Phlx argues that specialists have responsibilities and are subject to certain costs that market makers do not have, such as, updating and disseminating quotes, reflecting all market interest in the displayed quotes, and the fixed staffing cost committed to market making in a particular issue whether it is active or not. In order to attract specialist units to the Exchange who are willing to accept these responsibilities, the Phlx believes it is necessary to provide specialists with some benefits that are not available to ROTs. The Phlx believes that any negative impact to ROTs that may be caused by this proposal is more than offset by the benefit to the Exchange and its customers of attracting New Units to the Exchange. The Phlx also refutes the commenter's claim that ROTs are further harmed because the New Unit is not required to invoke the Enhanced Parity Split. The Phlx argues that because specialists and ROTs both desire to buy at the bid and sell at the ask, there should be few undesirable trades where the specialist would not find it desirable to invoke the Enhanced Parity Split. As a result, the Exchange believes that any negative impact on the ROTs as a result of the permissive nature of the rule will be de minimis. Finally, the Phlx argues that because the Enhanced Parity Split can apply to a New Options Class for at most one year, the Exchange does not believe that detailed evaluative criteria for use in awarding or removing the Enhanced Parity Split will be particularly effective or necessary. The Exchange believes that by the time that the New Unit establishes a trading history which can be reviewed and evaluated, the Enhanced Parity Split will probably have lapsed. Even without such criteria, however, the Phlx notes that the Committee has the ability to review the performance of a New Unit and to remove the Enhanced Parity Split at the end of the initial six month period, or in more egregious cases, to reallocate an options class for inadequate specialist performance.
