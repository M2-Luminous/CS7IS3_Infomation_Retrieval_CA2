Vucinic: "Friends Together Again"] [Text] The leaders of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] met yesterday in the SRS headquarters to discuss, as they said, their next move in resisting the repression by the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]. Vojislav Seselj and Vuk Draskovic told reporters that a new meeting was called for Monday [23 May] in the SPO headquarters, and that it would almost certainly be attended by the leaders of the Democratic Party [DS] and the Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS], who had been invited too late for yesterday's meeting. Vuk Draskovic, who arrived at the SRS headquarters with Milan Komnenic, stressed that a purge of the SRS had been under way for several months, and that the two of them had come to tell the SRS leaders that they could count on the full support of the SPO in their defense against the legal and police terror. Draskovic stressed that it was not only the SRS that was in danger but parliamentarianism, and that the unified attitude of the opposition could, as he put it, "discourage the SPS." Seselj said that he was personally very pleased when he heard about the criminal charges as that showed that the regime was nervous. Commenting on the fact that Seselj would answer to the same charges he faced last June, Draskovic said that the law put the police force on a sacrosanct pedestal, and wondered: What is the police doing in the federal assembly? Speaking of earlier differences between the two leaders, Draskovic cited Voltaire, and said that the "SPO will always defend the right of the SRS to state their opinion," and that Seselj and he never had any personal differences but only political ones, with the exaggerations that are so typical of the Balkan political scene. The "definite" demands by the parliamentary parties are the dismissal of Radoman Bozovic and an equal treatment and access to television. It is not out of the question that even the extraparliamentary parties could join this, "except those that have been instrumentalized by the UDBA [State Security Administration]," Seselj said. The SRS leader expects that DS leader Zoran Djindjic will distance himself from Dragoljub Micunovic, who is "the author of the declaration of the Chamber of Citizens." Milan Komnenic said that he was sorry that he had voted for the expulsion of deputy Drasko Markovic from the session, saying that he only did so out of inertia, because he was misinformed about the nature of the vote....
