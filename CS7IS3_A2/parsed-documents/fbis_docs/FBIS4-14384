In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in his residence in Amman yesterday Khamis said that he has taken this step in protest at the attitude of the Front's leadership, saying that he had, on several occasions, asked the Front's Central Committee to form a special committee to investigate the accusations leveled at him by some officials in order to judge them and expel them from its ranks. But his requests fell on deaf ears and, as a result, some Central Committee members conspired against him and hence dismissed him as official in charge of the General Command on the Jordanian scene and action in the western sector of the occupied territories. However, circles of the PFLP-GC led by Ahmad Jibril were surprised by these reports when AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT went to ask them about the causes that led to the split. General Command officials expressed their astonishment at and rejection of the idea. An employee in Jibril's office told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is a personal action, and the Palestinian issue does not need further splits and fragmentation. Such actions harm Palestinian struggle, which he is working to unify in order to confront the Israeli enemy, his practices, and his agreement with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.
