"A tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but would be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs of hitting bottom," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission told reporters. Against this backdrop, he reiterated that a tax hike would not undermine consumption, and the government and politicians should clearly state "a consumption tax hike and its timing" in the same law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund the tax cut. But the rate of the new consumption tax, currently at 3 percent, does not necessarily have to be mentioned because the situation changes, said the head of the advisory panel to the prime minister. Referring to opinions that an economic recovery with the tax cut will lead to increased tax revenues, Kato said such a scenario has already proved wrong in the United States under the administration of President Ronald Reagan. "Bridge bonds are for repayment in the short term, and it's irresponsible... to borrow without any scheme for paying back," Kato said. "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax hike... but those who correct public views instead of just following them are the true politicians," he said. Kato stressed that "last-minute" spending can be expected before a sales tax hike as in the case of China. The panel is to study the Chinese case, he added. The argument that a tax hike would dampen consumption is "absolutely a fiction" especially in Japan where savings are still high compared with other countries, Kato said. As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land prices, the impact of the yen's appreciation changing favorably for Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile purchases from the tax cut. He also said the bribery scandals involving general contractors that have stymied progress in public works are near settlement, and the agreement on multilateral trade talks may lead to lower prices. Meanwhile, a senior tax panel member told reporters the panel cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds and wants the government to carry out the tax cut and hike in a single package. But the panel, which resumed to discuss fiscal 1994 tax reform on Friday after suspension since mid-December, confirmed its stance of "leaving the decision to the government and the coalition parties," he told reporters after the meeting. The member said the panel decided to discuss such reforms as methods to increase liquidity in the land market and corrections of unfair levy systems on nonprofit institutions, he said. As for a new timetable, he said members will meet on Tuesday and Friday next week, and hold meetings almost every day from the following week.
