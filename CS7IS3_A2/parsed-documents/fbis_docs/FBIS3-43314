Father Christmas was around during the holiday celebrations and reminded us that besides economic recovery, we have an important exercise to undertake this year -- the legislative elections slated for 23 January and 6 February. This ballot is an important landmark for the continuity and success of the democratic process which must be marked this year by the creation of all the institutions of the Fourth Republic, which was ushered in by the constitutional referendum of September 1992. The fact remains, however, that the upcoming legislative elections must be free and fair and must be held in an atmosphere of security for all. This is the best wish of President General Gnassingbe Eyadema. He stated this in a communique presented here by Adjobi Adjadaye. [Begin Adjadaye recording] The president of the Republic has taken good note of the progress made in the preparations for the upcoming legislative elections. As he had already stated in his first message to the nation in the aftermath of his election as president, the head of state fervently wishes that all those who were not able to be part of the first stage of our democratic process take part in the second stage of national unity, so that together we can all take part in the legislative elections on the scheduled dates. In this spirit the president indicated last November that it was necesary to take into consideration the opinions of French and German electoral experts. Also, to iron out difficulties and create a general atmosphere of trust, the president of the Republic has met several times with the International Monitoring Commission and the National Electoral Commission [CEN], the government officials charged with organizing the legislative elections. All these efforts testify to the constantly renewed political will of the head of state to contribute to a peaceful conclusion of the democratic process within the strict respect of the Ouagadougou accord. This is why the president of the Republic once again invites the CEN and the government officials charged with organizing the legislative elections, and the political parties to double their efforts with a view to accelerating and contributing positively to the carrying out of material tasks so that the elections can be held in a free, fair and secure atmosphere for all. Our people have suffered for far too long from this long transition and it is our duty to move heaven and earth for the elections to take place at the scheduled dates so that we can get to work.
