He revealed that his government's position, which has been forwarded to the United States, has nothing to do with the cordial relations he maintains with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Nevertheless, he said the blockade against Cuba and Haiti should be completely lifted only "when international organizations consider this course of action to be correct." Balaguer stated his views during his regularly scheduled Thursday news conference. Balaguer said his government's support for the embargo and its surveillance along the border with Haiti "will not threaten the Dominican Republic's sovereignty, because this is not at stake." Nevertheless, he reasserted he will not permit the presence of international observers, although he respects the decision by international organizations to maintain an economic embargo against Haiti -- a decision he does not endorse. The president said the embargo is detrimental to the poorest people in Haiti, and, therefore, the Dominican Republic has never favored the embargo. Nevertheless, Balaguer said he decided to strengthen surveillance along the border with Haiti in the wake of complaints from international organizations that said he should not allow fuel to pass into Haiti from the Dominican Republic. He announced that surveillance will be increased in the future, but he did not specify when.
