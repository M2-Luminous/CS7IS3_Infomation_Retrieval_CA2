Addressing about 500 supporters in the D H Williams recreation centre in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said he had cancelled a two-day visit to the Angolan capital Luanda because of the urgency of the situation on the East Rand. [words indistinct] "I have asked for that meeting to be postponed because of the implication of the meeting I am attending." Mr Mandela would have met with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano in Luanda. Mr Mandela said "this (peace) plan is intended to save lives here and bring about stability in the region". The announcement of the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Division [ISD] in the area drew thunderous cheers from the crowd. Mr Mandela said the ISD withdrawal would be welcomed by all. In reply to a question whether the move would not be opposed by mainly Zulu-speaking hostel residents, Mr Mandela said: "I think they are the only people who would like the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] to remain in the area. The rest do not want the ISU to remain here even for a day," Mr Mandela said to the approval of the crowd. He urged the Inkatha Freedom Party to involve itself in the peace plan and repeated an invitation to the party to send a representative to participate in the appointed task group formed to oversee the peace process. Regarding the violence in Natal, Mr Mandela said: "We have embarked on a number of strategies to formulate means to stop violence." The ANC leader told supporters it would be improper for him to be seen announcing the peace plan from the Union Buildings in Pretoria and that it had to be seen to be done in the area plagued by the violence. Regarding Mr de Klerk's absence at the announcement of the plan in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said: "His diary would not allow it." Mr de Klerk released details of the peace plan to the media at 4PM on Tuesday while Mr Mandela made the announcement simultaneously at the community centre in Katlehong. The statement issued by Mr de Klerk was read to the audience by the Transitional Executive Council member Mac Maharaj who visited the area recently to investigate the situation. Mr Mandela said the East Rand was responsible for 80 per cent of the national total of victims of violence.
