FR940720-0-00042 FR940720-0-00001 The commenters on the FY 1991, FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 proposed fee rules indicated the following results if the proposed annual fees were not modified: _Large firms would gain an unfair competitive advantage over small entities. One commenter noted that a small well-logging company (a ``Mom and Pop'' type of operation) would find it difficult to absorb the annual fee, while a large corporation would find it easier. Another commenter noted that the fee increase could be more easily absorbed by a high-volume nuclear medicine clinic. A gauge licensee noted that, in the very competitive soils testing market, the annual fees would put it at an extreme disadvantage with its much larger competitors because the proposed fees would be the same for a two-person licensee as for a large firm with thousands of employees. _Some firms would be forced to cancel their licenses. One commenter, with receipts of less than $500,000 per year, stated that the proposed rule would, in effect, force it to relinquish its soil density gauge and license, thereby reducing its ability to do its work effectively. Another commenter noted that the rule would force the company and many other small businesses to get rid of the materials license altogether. Commenters stated that the proposed rule would result in about 10 percent of the well-logging licensees terminating their licenses immediately and approximately 25 percent terminating their licenses before the next annual assessment. _Some companies would go out of business. One commenter noted that the proposal would put it, and several other small companies, out of business or, at the very least, make it hard to survive. _Some companies would have budget problems. Many medical licensees commented that, in these times of slashed reimbursements, the proposed increase of the existing fees and the introduction of additional fees would significantly affect their budgets. Another noted that, in view of the cuts by Medicare and other third party carriers, the fees would produce a hardship and some facilities would experience a great deal of difficulty in meeting this additional burden. Over the past three years, approximately 2,600 license, approval, and registration terminations have been requested. Although some of these terminations were requested because the license was no longer needed or licenses or registrations could be combined, indications are that other termination requests were due to the economic impact of the fees. The NRC continues to receive written and oral comments from small materials licensees. These comments indicate that the $3.5 million threshold for small entities is not representative of small businesses with gross receipts in the thousands of dollars. These commenters believe that the $1,800 maximum annual fee represents a relatively high percentage of gross annual receipts for these ``Mom and Pop'' type businesses. Therefore, even the reduced annual fee could have a significant impact on the ability of these types of businesses to continue to operate. To alleviate the continuing significant impact of the annual fees on a substantial number of small entities, the NRC considered alternatives, in accordance with the RFA. These alternatives were evaluated in the FY 1991 rule (56 FR 31472; July 10, 1991), in the FY 1992 rule (57 FR 32691; July 23, 1992), and in the FY 1993 rule (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993). The alternatives considered by the NRC can be summarized as follows. _Base fees on some measure of the amount of radioactivity possessed by the licensee (e.g., number of sources). _Base fees on the frequency of use of the licensed radioactive material (e.g., volume of patients). _Base fees on the NRC size standards for small entities. The NRC has reexamined the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 evaluation of these alternatives. Based on that reexamination, the NRC continues to support the previous conclusion. That is, the NRC continues to believe that establishment of a maximum fee for small entities is the most appropriate option to reduce the impact on small entities. The NRC established, and is continuing for FY 1994, a maximum annual fee for small entities. The RFA and its implementing guidance do not provide specific guidelines on what constitutes a significant economic impact on a small entity. Therefore, the NRC has no benchmark to assist it in determining the amount or the percent of gross receipts that should be charged to a small entity. For FY 1994, the NRC will rely on the analysis previously completed that established a maximum annual fee for a small entity by comparing NRC license and inspection fees under 10 CFR Part 170 with Agreement State fees for those fee categories that are expected to contain a substantial number of small entities. Because these fees have been charged to small entities, the NRC continues to believe that these fees, or any adjustments to these fees during the past year, do not have a significant impact on them. In issuing this final rule for FY 1994, the NRC concludes that the materials license and inspection fees do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities and that the maximum annual small entity fee of $1,800 be maintained to alleviate the impact of the fees on small entities.
