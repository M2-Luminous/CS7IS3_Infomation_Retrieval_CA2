These people are tax evaders, speculators, corrupt people, and large estate owners who have unproductive land. He sent a message to speculators, warning them to be careful. He promised: "Speculators will have to invest their money in productive areas of the economy." Lula said that the current problem is that the government pretends to have a fiscal policy, and people pretend to pay taxes. "These people cheat everybody, and no one thinks about Brazil." The PT candidate said that the country does not need big laws, but big accords. "If we have clear rules, agreed upon by the parties involved, we will be able to establish rules that will allow Brazil to grow." Lula remembers that one can only govern by ensuring credibility among social protagonists, workers, entrepreneurs, and government officials. Lula promised to implement the country's first agrarian reform and to end corruption.
