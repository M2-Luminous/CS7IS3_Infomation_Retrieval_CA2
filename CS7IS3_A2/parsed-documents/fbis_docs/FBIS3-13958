During the cold war it used its destructive military might as a medium for political victories, however, this policy was not successful. Vietnam is a prominent example of this failure. The U.S. viewpoint changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. It is implementing a policy of having various parties hold talks in order to maintain its dominance. Examples of these efforts are the Arab-Israeli talks and talks among the Serb, Croat, and Muslim communities in Bosnia. The United States may have its own interests in holding these talks. We would be ignoring facts if we believe that this police work being done by the United States to establish law and order at international level is an unselfish deed. Have these policies succeeded in establishing peace in the nations involved? Has the fighting and the mutual destruction changed? We can surmise the answer to these questions by reviewing the present world situation. The statements issued by President Clinton and his administration over India-Pakistan relations have created a controversial situation. If we look at former President Bush's term, we will find that there is a major difference between the two. It would be wrong to believe that the role of bilateral talks in the U.S. policy, especially in foreign policy or international relations, is not important. It has helped various nations depending on their interests and their having cooperated--be it Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel, or Pakistan. The fact that it did not help them because of altruistic reasons is a different issue. The Jammu-Kashmir question has an important place in India-Pakistan relations. It would be ignoring facts if we think that the bitterness between India and Pakistan will end if the Jammu-Kashmir issue is resolved. There are many chasms between the two countries, and it would not be appropriate to say that if one chasm is filled up the other chasms will not cause problems. If we say that the United States is very worried over Kashmir, then it must be shedding crocodile tears or it is the change in its foreign policy affected after the fall of the Soviet Union. Why did not the U.S. attitude change when Pakistan gave away Aksai Chin region to its then-declared enemy China? The United States continued to be Pakistan's supporter and adopted a harsh attitude toward India. There is no doubt that Pakistan used aggressive lobbying to keep its position strong in the United States, and India has been laggard in this area. India has recently been expressing its reactions to various developments. It is clear from India's spending about 8 billion rupees for lobbying that our policy is very myopic and ineffective. The results are in front of us; the United States is not influenced by the Indian side. A while ago, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel declared the 1947 merger of Jammu-Kashmir with India to be totally disputable. Earlier, the almost-appointed ambassador to India, Solarz, had also disappointed the Indian government with his statements. It is not true that Siddhartha Shankar Ray, the present Indian ambassador to the Untied States, has been successful in presenting the Indian side effectively to the United States. Therefore, the wrong impressions that the United States has about India will remain for some time. We cannot deny that after the Robin Raphel statement, there has existed an anti-United States attitude among all Indian opposition parties, intellectuals, and the media. The United States did not express any reaction to Raphel's statements in the beginning. However, seeing the increasing Indian reaction, spokesmen and officials in the Clinton administration issued statements declaring the Jammu-Kashmir related announcements to be personal opinions, that there has been no change in the U.S. policy on India and expressed happiness at the India-Pakistan talks at the secretary level. The words of Woodrow Wilson Center's Mitchell Reese about India-Pakistan relations seem to be very realistic. According to him, the Kashmir issue cannot be used to hinder resolution of other problems. He believes that resolution of various minor problems will create an atmosphere conducive of resolving larger issues. Before the 2 January talks at foreign secretary level, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had said that India-Pakistan relations will not improve until the Kashmir issue is taken care of. The foreign minister of Pakistan also announced in Parliament that Jammu-Kashmir would become a part of Pakistan within the next five years because India would have fallen by then. We can call these statements efforts by Pakistani rulers to impress the Pakistani people or to shut up the opposition. However, why is the United States ignoring such statements by one side when efforts are being made to improve India-Pakistan relations? Does the United States think that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has the right to declare in the United States that Pakistan will never suspend its nuclear program? Pakistan will continue to expand its program despite all the pressure, and pressure will be put on India to sign the NPT. Clinton is talking about removing the various restrictions imposed on Pakistan. What can we infer from such American thinking? There is no doubt that Pakistan, Kashmiri militant organizations, and their supporters have retained the services of such companies as Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly for powerful and effective lobbying. This not only spreads their ideas and statements, but also influences important people. It is believed that an organization of non-resident Kashmiris, the Kashmiri-American Council, that supports a plebiscite in Kashmir, has hired the expensive lobbying firm of Stone and Kelly. One major result of this effort is President Clinton's ten-line long letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, the executive director of the Kashmiri-American Council. We find that the Washington-based organization Kashmiri-American Council is strongly opposed to Maharajah Hari Singh's merger of Jammu-Kashmir with India. This organization has challenged Jammu-Kashmir's merger with India from the very beginning. There is no doubt that this organization receives all kind of support from Pakistan, other Islamic nations that agree with it, and various so-called human rights organizations. President Clinton told Ghulam Nabi Fai in his letter that he would like to work with people like him to establish peace in Kashmir. He expressed his agreement with Fai and wrote that the human rights aspect should have a strong place in his policies in the changed world situation after the Cold War. It is possible that Clinton's letter was just expressing hope for the future. However, Ghulam Nabi Fai, the Kashmiri-American Council, and its members will not only propagate it as U.S. agreeing with them, but also prove a major headache for India by amplifying the effect of this letter. If we look at the events prior to this letter, it should be clear that Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel's opinion about Kashmir and the feelings hidden in President Clinton's letter complement each other. A third party has been added to the Kashmir problem. If we look at the Jammu-Kashmir issue and India-Pakistan relations, we will learn that White House residents before Clinton had repeatedly said that India and Pakistan should resolve this issue according to the Shimla agreement of 1972. There is no mention of a third party in the Shimla agreement. The UN resolutions call for the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Laddakh to decide whether they want to stay in India or Pakistan. The question arises whether the present situation is appropriate for holding a plebiscite. Is there a specific deadline for such an atmosphere? What will the situation be like in Jammu-Kashmir when an appropriate situation is created? If we look at the U.S. President's opinions as these appear, it seems that there have been major changes in the foreign policy and the thinking of the influential people in the administration after the end of the cold war. From the Indian perspective, especially within the framework of India-Pakistan relations, this change does not agree with the Indian view point. The United States, despite its open denial, does want to establish its supremacy here. It seems that the events related to Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti have not taught a lesson to the U.S. policy-makers. The strong U.S. desire to dominate the talks in Jammu-Kashmir will not resolve this issue because both India and Pakistan do not want the Kashmiri people to make a decision against them. In addition, even when we grant that India and Pakistan may change their Kashmir-related policy under international pressure, will it help a move toward permanent peace? *
