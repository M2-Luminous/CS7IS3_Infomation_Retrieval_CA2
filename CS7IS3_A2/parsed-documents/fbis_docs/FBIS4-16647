This is the second week in a row that the reading Russian public has been intensively studying the document entitled "Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia," which President Yeltsin sent to parliament. The "Agreement" opens with the fresh idea that "civil accord is needed in Russia today as never before" and "there are no problems that cannot be resolved without fueling social tension and not resorting to violence." Although the author of the document has plainly become entangled in gerunds, his meaning is clear and cannot be disagreed with. And yet I recall that we had already been told with equal conviction that "Russia has exhausted its quota of revolutions," but then they upped and carried one out. "Impossible, impossible, impossible!" they repeat every time. The longer they repeat it, the more obvious it becomes: "If we want to very much, then we can!" The section "Political Life of Society" speaks of the need to comply with the Constitution and the principles of democracy, a civil society, and the separation of powers. But protective motives can be glimpsed through the fence of general phrases: "The sides pledge to refrain from making changes to the Constitution which destabilize the situation" and also "not to initiate political campaigns for the purpose of holding early...elections." In return the authorities make a broad gesture: They pledge to reject the "uncivilized and incorrect" use of the mass media and to stop attaching insulting labels to "heroic and tragic pages of the past." But is it possible to "close" the question of early elections when Russia has a president who was elected back in the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, who exempted himself from an oath to the former Constitution and did not take an oath to the new one, who dissolved parliament on condition that both branches of power would be reelected, and who, right after the shoot-up, went back on his word? Can such a president be considered a legitimate authority? Is it possible to silence those who demand that he stand for election again without delay in accordance with the proper procedure? At first sight the section "Regional Policy" is extremely balanced. On the one hand it declares "the need to broaden the independence of the components of the Federation by strengthening the tax base," while on the other it emphasizes an increase in the responsibility of the organs of power of the components of the Federation for the collection of federal taxes. The warning is more than topical, since more and more components of the Federation -- Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Karelia, Yakutia (Sakha) -- are ceasing to transfer taxes to the federal treasury. Today the republic budget is shrinking like shagreen leather and reaching ridiculous figures -- something like approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. However you share out this sheepskin and stretch it, it obviously cannot "cover" science, education, culture, health care, defense, assistance for the countryside, and Russia's foreign economic obligations. Foreseeing serious problems with the country's unity and integrity, they are trying to secure from the components of the Federation a "written undertaking not to leave" -- a pledge to renounce changing their constitutional status for two years. But, in addition to this, it would be a good thing to demand of the Moscow authorities a pledge that they will, at least, abide strictly by that status as it exists today. In connection with the fact that the law on the principles of the delimitation of powers has still not been adopted, the federal power has solemnly promised to announce a moratorium on the signing of bilateral treaties on the delimitation of terms of reference and powers. Was it worth a wasted effort -- signing such a treaty with Tatarstan? What about the fact that advances have also been issued to a number of regions? The section "Conditions and Mechanism for Fulfilling This Agreement" appears very surprising. For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the Agreement, it is proposed to form a Conciliation Commission from representatives of the president, the government, the chambers, and the State Duma factions. The procedure for forming the commission and its numerical composition have not been defined at all, and yet precisely it will be entrusted with determining the fact of a violation of the Agreement and precisely it will be empowered to use measures of influence against violators, even including proposals to dismiss them from a leading post and to lay down their powers as a deputy. I need not cite anymore. It is already clear that the "Agreement" is of an extremely one-sided nature and is very reminiscent of the agreements between the first conquistadores and the ingenuous and naive indians. It would be quite possible to forgive the shortcomings of the first version of the document but for another important circumstance. Please tell me, who now is preventing the president from shaping and implementing a policy of accord without any "agreements"? Nobody. Meanwhile, every day there is a new act of confrontation -- with the Constitution, with parliament, with society. Here are just a few examples. Two weeks after the Duma adopted the amnesty decree and the Memorandum of Accord, S. Filatov, leader of the president's administration, signed a directive confirming the list of "disfranchised" persons -- former people's deputies of the Russian Federation to whom social guarantees do not extend. Their entire "guilt" consists in the fact that they were not cowardly and did not run away but fulfilled to the end their duty to the Constitution, as a deputy is supposed to do. As a result, they have been deprived of privileges, are not taken on for work, and are not granted a pension. They are outcasts and persons of no fixed abode with deputies' badges. A little earlier an analytical note by P. Filippov, leader of the analytical center for socioeconomic policy, had popped up out of the presidential structures. In it he unequivocally recommended that the president embark on the compulsory disbandment of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Corresponding draft edicts also appeared. Evidently, it never occurs to the president's favorite oprichnik that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which he despises, still bear the brunt of supplying the country with food. That on the eve of sowing it is stupid and shortsighted to get under a farmer's feet with such edicts. Parliament has been sent a budget which demonstratively "forgets" the chambers of the Federal Assembly, as though they no longer existed. Funding for deputies' aides in the provinces has been ended on orders from above. And not just aides -- this is now the fourth month that the Duma itself, evicted from its legal residence, has been working in totally unadapted premises, surrounded by commercial structures. During this time dozens of guests have been inside its walls, including an ex-president of the United States. But the deputies have never been vouchsafed the honor of beholding their own president with their own eyes. The questions of Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program and of holding joint Russian-U.S. maneuvers on the Totskiy range were decided in a "spirit of peace and accord." They were announced without any consultation with parliament, despite public protests. And then there is the business with Kazannik, who last week, yielding to brazen pressure, tendered to the Federation Council his resignation from the post of Russian Federation general prosecutor.... Even the essentially secondary draft law on the procedure for publishing and validating federal laws gave rise to an acute juridical conflict. At first the president sent an amicable letter and amendments to this draft law, which the Duma accepted. But a week after the adoption of the law on its second reading he "covered" it with an edict which canceled out the already adopted law from the first to the last article.... In short, there are more than enough examples of "accord" and "peaceful cooperation." "We will not allow war, but no stone will be left standing in the struggle for peace...." Immortal lines! "Partnership for NATO" The question of Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program is a visible example of the confusion now reigning in the foreign policy sphere. Discordant statements, contradictory speeches by high officials, which cancel each other out.... On top of everything -- defiant, lordly disdain for the position of parliament and for public opinion. True, the question is far from simple. Opponents of joining point out that expanding NATO and bringing its zone of operation closer to Russia's borders is a direct violation of the political pledges first given to Gorbachev and then to Yeltsin as a condition for the speediest withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of contiguous states. The troops have been withdrawn ahead of schedule, but the pledges...have they been forgotten? It is perfectly obvious that the attempts to jostle Russia into NATO's "anteroom" place it, a Eurasian power and one of the initiators of the CSCE, in an ambiguous position. To all appearances, joining the NATO security system will put an end to the intention to create our own security system within the CIS framework. Politicians of very different trends, including those whom it is hard to suspect of having sympathies with "communofascism," unequivocally maintain that joining the "Partnership for Peace" program does not accord with Russia's international status. But it cannot fail to be seen that Russia's resolute refusal will be perceived extremely ambivalently in the world. "Russia's refusal to join the program," Stephen Larrabee, a leading staffer of the Rand Corporation, maintains, "will be a watershed in the development of Russia's relations with the West.... Very many people in the United States will say that in this way Russia wants to retain a completely free hand in the CIS and thereby confirms its neoimperial ambitions." So, two versions -- one worse than the other. It is legitimate to ask: How can such a thing have happened? Why has Russian diplomacy, which shouts from the house-tops about the "new Russia" and about "loyalty to democratic principles and the ideals of human rights," led the country to such a shameful, humiliating choice? Let us listen to Foreign Minister Kozyrev: "In the course of complex discussions we jointly arrived at the idea of deepening and institutionalizing cooperation with NATO -- an idea embodied in the `Partnership for Peace' concept advanced by the United States. Let us commit to memory the words `we' and `jointly.'" But here is the opinion of U.S. politicians and forecasters of the Heritage Foundation. Feel the difference: "In order to curb revanchist Russia, the United States must encourage the implementation of necessary economic and political reforms in the countries of central and East Europe, so that they can join NATO.... "Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have begun implementing the difficult political, economic, and military reforms which will be required for NATO membership. No country which does not wish or is not able to implement these reforms will be afforded the opportunity to enjoy the security guarantees provided by NATO. Thus, neither Ukraine, which possesses nuclear weapons, nor Russia, which is pursuing an expansionist course, can be regarded as suitable candidates for any membership, even formal membership, of NATO.... "Russia should be allowed to become NATO's `partner,' as provided for in Clinton's `Partnership for Peace' program, but only if it continues the course of democratic market reforms." Do you understand? Those who do not understand are told straight to their face: "It is also important that Clinton's warning to Russia that the price of returning to dictatorship and imperialist expansion will be a high one should be heard." This is how our "strategic partners" express themselves, unlike our twittering minister.... Listen, maybe Kozyrev should be replaced by some U.S. expert? He would hardly increase the size of the damage, and the benefit would certainly be greater. Who Cost What, or How Much Does Democracy Cost? The Central Electoral Commission has submitted an official report, from which it can be seen that the 12 December elections to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on the new Constitution cost the country a "round sum" -- 120.7 billion rubles. [passage omitted] In the election campaign, despite a very strict ban, extensive use was made of the funds of legal persons with foreign participation. Here are some examples of illegal donations ascertained by the Central Electoral Commission. "Russia's Choice" "Effektkredit" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 3,000,000 "Sky Line" Russian-British Joint Venture -- 20,000,000 "Olbi-Diplomat" Joint-Stock Company -- 130,000,000 "Stolichnyy" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 154,800,000 "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" Bloc "Viamond LTD" Joint-Stock Company -- 30,000,000 "Torgovlya i Kredit" Joint-Stock Company -- 10,000,000 "Option" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 10,000,000 What can you say here? Democracy is being squeezed out of money bags....
