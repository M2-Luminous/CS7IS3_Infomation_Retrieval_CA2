Speaking to journalists, he said that speeches by deputies were "adequate considering what is happening in the country." Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled for this weekend will support positions of their parliamentary factions which spoke against signing a civil accord agreement. "Having been to the most remote regions of the country, where electricity appeared only in the `70s, I get convinced that nobody wants conflict, people are seeking accord," the speaker pointed out. Rybkin said that during his meeting with the president scheduled for April 22 at 15:00 he intends to discuss with Boris Yeltsin a further course of debates over the draft agreement. "This is very difficult issue. We should sew with a thin needle, and not to take a pitchfork and thrust it in deputies' sides," the speaker of the State Duma noted.
