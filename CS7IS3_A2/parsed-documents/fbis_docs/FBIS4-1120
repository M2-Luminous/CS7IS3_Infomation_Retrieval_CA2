The Inkatha Freedom Party's 11th hour decision to partake in the elections. Was it brinkmanship or a real change of heart? If one had to go according to newspaper headlines today, the level of violence in the country has plummeted. Has this been as a result of the IFP's decision. To answer these and other questions is Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Good evening, Dr. Buthelezi. Well, you have waited as we say, til the 11th hour -- just one week before the election to decide to take part in those elections. Why? [Buthelezi] We had decided in January not to participate, but then we were given some kind of authority as a Central Committee to look at what was then ongoing negotiations to see whether in fact we could change the decision, and various things took place. In the Freedom Alliance we were negotiating with the ANC and government, and later on there were trilateral talks in December when there was that paper called the yellow paper on the 19th of December, which was more or less the bottom line paper, and then after that, of course -- since nothing came out of it. Then in January the king came out demanding sovereignty of the monarchy and so on, which made a completely different ball game altogether. So then when the king raised this matter, it became very difficult for us, those of us who are IFP and also Zulus to move forward because the king said if his concerns were not addressed, then he was not prepared to advise his people -- his subjects -- to participate in the election. So I mean that is the thing then when the king's matter was addressed, then there was no excuse for us to go in for elections. [Smythe] Was this not actually addressed two weeks ago before the mediators came out here? [Buthelezi] By whom? [Smythe] By the NP [National Party], by the ANC and negotiations. They didn't offer you what you wanted? [Buthelezi] That was just cheap propaganda by the ANC and the and the NP because what was discussed at Skukuza were just pacts which they were promising the king. They didn't address the issue of the kingdom itself. The king was not interested in pacts for himself and the family, but he was actually talking about the land. He was talking about his people. [Smythe] What have you achieved for the Zulu people in general and the IFP in particular that wasn't achievable two weeks ago or a month ago. What specifically have you achieved for the king as well? [Buthelezi] I think that for the king we've achieved this recognition now which is going to be enshrined in the constitution of the country, and that was not anywhere near the king a few weeks ago, even at Skukuza. But on Monday a special session of the Parliament of South Africa has been summoned to actually enshrine this in the constitution. [Smythe] But he will be a constitutional monarch, that he will have certain... what will he have? What will actually be his status in kwaZulu/Natal? [Buthelezi] That will come out now when the constitution of kwaZulu/Natal is actually drafted, because the constitution of kwaZulu/Natal is not drafted. The constitution that we drafted a couple of years ago in fact was never put before the negotiation forum, so it was never actually looked at by the negotiation forum. [Smythe] So the king wanted specific rights enshrined in a constitution. Am I correct in that? He wanted certain status. Now what specifically was that? [Buthelezi] Well, because you see, as long as we were talking about a federation, a possible federation, then the king thought that the self-determination of the Zulu people would then be addressed through a federal formula, because a federal formula does provide for self-rule on a regional basis with devolution of power. Whereas in fact once it's a unitary state, then it meant that that question would not be addressed, and that is why he decided to take it upon himself to go and see the state president and had a few meetings subsequent to that with the state president. [Smythe] Other than the status of the king, what do you feel you have achieved to allow you to take part? [Buthelezi] I think that the recognition that the principle of our symmetry which from the very beginning of negotiations we tried to persuade the people at the negotiation forum to recognize the principle of our symmetry that these regions need not necessarily be the same, so the fact that kwaZulu/Natal is going to be a kingdom that's accepted right across the board is in fact a recognition of the principle of our symmetry that kwaZulu/Natal is different and, therefore, it is likely to have a constitution different from other regions of South Africa. [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, we've seen a great deal of violence in the last few weeks. Do you feel now looking back over these last few weeks that it's been worth the cost of lives lost and the cost to the economy of that uncertainty by people. [Buthelezi] If I should answer that question I'll be implying that we are the cause of the violence, whereas the violence has been there for 10 years in fact, and has become endemic. And I would also say that, therefore, the violence also is of different types because there is the sort of violence arising from socioeconomic conditions, and then there's violence, of course, which is political which goes to incite...[pauses] violence which just comes about because of the conflict between the ANC and IFP members -- which is the political violence, and which members of both these parties, ANC and IFP were involved in, are involved in fact because I don't think that we should have an illusion that it's over. We should just praise the Almighty at present we don't have that; and hope that with God's grace that it might last for good. [Smythe] Let's just take that there, you say that there's political violence between the two groups, and I think that it's an accepted fact that you might have some ANC members living on a hill over there and some IFP members living on a hill over there, and never the twain shall meet. Now the political parties have felt that they weren't safe going into a lot of areas to campaign. Are those sort of no go areas now free and open? What are you going to do ensure that the people will allow that kind of free campaigning? [Buthelezi] I suppose that -- I am hoping myself that the agreement that we signed with Mr. Mandela and the president of South Africa somehow send some signals. This is just a hope of course. They send signals to our followers on the ground that in fact we believe that the only road that we should follow is that of peace and nonviolence if we want our country to survive and to prospwr. [Smythe] You know, I just wanted you to go back on something, you mentioned the Freedom Alliance earlier on, and of course we were watching the news before we came into the studio here this evening. Watching Ferdi Hartzenberg there speaking on behalf of the CP [Conservative Party] and saying our demands haven't been met therefore we cannot take part in the election, words that you've said many times. How do you feel now that you decided to take part? [Buthelezi] In fact I informed Dr. Hartzenberg about it that even before we signed the agreement I sent him a (?call on this). I was in Pretoria. I had to show him that in this case the issue addressed really more realistically insofar as it was going to be enshrined in the constitution on Monday, and that therefore we had to undertake to participate in the election as a result of that. [Smythe] And of course it's too late for them now? Just you made it by a whisker. And I think with all this going on, there's been very little time for campaigning on an official level. You've been at the center of South African political life for many months now without doing any real campaigning. Nobody really knows what your manifesto is. Could you give us some kind of brief outline on let's say the economic policy of the IFP toward kwaZulu/Natal in particular? [Buthelezi] We've always believed in the free market. In fact, that has always been the belief of the IFP as far as the economy is concerned. We do not know of any economic system that is better than the free enterprise system, and therefore even when it was not fashionable in African circles to extol the virtues of this enterprise system, we did so unashamedly, that this enterprise system was the only system that we know that can create jobs as quickly as possible, and is the only system that is such a potent force for development, which our people need very desperately. So we believe that our county can only go forward, and we can only address the poverty of our people through this enterprise system if it's allowed to flourish. We believe that of course it will be necessary for the government to intervene on certain issues... [Smythe, interrupting] Where specifically do you see the government being very important -- the state? [Buthelezi] I think the state is important as far as disparities which will be very much with us for quite a long time to come because in this country per capita -- because of apartheid and racism -- black people suffered, because in education they were rather funded on a racial basis -- a sliding basis, on a disparity basis if you like, and therefore we believe that those gaps will have to be bridged only through the intervention of the government. [Smythe] Does that apply then to something like land redistribution and the distribution of wealth which some people are saying take from the rich to give to the poor -- just as a random example. How do you see that as being dealt with? [Buthelezi] In fact we also believe in the redistribution of wealth, but we've always said that redistribution of wealth as far as IFP is concerned means only redistribution of opportunity. But that is quite separate of course from the issue of land, because it is true that our people are land hungry, and that is an issue that must be addressed because for instance per square meter, I think that kwaZulu as far as density is concerned, is the most crowded place in South Africa -- dhe most crowded region. Durban, our metropolis, for instance, is the fastest growing city in the world -- I'm told -- after Mexico. [Smythe] So how do you see that actually happening? How do you see that being dealt with as an issue -- the land redistribution? [Buthelezi] First of all, there are stretches and stretches of land which I call state lands, which of course after our conquests was called Crown lands, which I think as a matter of urgency should be distributed to our people and to enable our people who want to farm for instance to farm. And there is also the issue of absentee farming, where there are people who don't farm at all but who have stretches and stretches of farms. I think that also should be looked at to address that issue. [Smythe] Right, when it comes to...[pauses] You mentioned the economic situation as being the free market system, is one that you would particularly follow as the IFP, as part of your manifesto as being the main driving force behind job creation. What about international investment, local investment, do you see international investment as being very important? [Buthelezi] Well, I think this really very important indeed, because our country is in such dire straights at this time precisely because of the isolation of South Africa, because of the sanctions campaign. I tried to warn, because I was totally against that myself. Whereas I was an opponent of apartheid and campaigned against apartheid like many other African leaders in this country, or opposition politicians here like the DP [Democratic Party] and so on. But I warned about it -- going so far as to say that because apartheid was such a wicked system, let us now penalize whites by destroying the economy -- because I said that would devastate the poorest of the poor first. So we have a situation now where about 46 percent of the people that should be working in this country have no jobs. So I mean it is going to take us a long time before we are able to do that. So foreign investment is absolutely crucial, it is very important in contributing, but also investment by our own entrepreneurs is important as well, equally important. [Smythe] Alright, we've spoken about the IFP being a Zulu party, as well as for other people, but primarily a party for Zulu people. Now I'm not a Zulu person, why would I vote for you? [Buthelezi] Well, I think that is the propaganda, cheap propaganda of our opponents, saying it is a Zulu party. In fact there are some journalists that I refuse to speak to because they always say it is a Zulu-based party. I don't see them doing the same thing saying that the National Party is an Afrikaner-based party. I don't see them saying about the DP that's an Anglo-Saxon- based, a Judeo-Anglo party. So I think that is just cheap propaganda. I must recall that of course when Inkatha was only two years, I was summoned, you know, to Pretoria by Minister Kruger, you know Jimmy Kruger, the famous Jimmy Kruger who talked about Steve Biko's death, making [word indistinct]. Now he summoned me to threaten me. He said that he sees -- and it was only two years -- he said he sees that, you know, membership of Inkatha is not confined to Zulus. So I told him that in fact it wasn't. Then he said that I was polarizing black and white in the country and said that if I didn't stop it he'd take action. I said that as long as the National Party takes pride of different ethnic groups in the white community, I had the same rights, so that stands out as evidence that even when we were two years old, through his intelligence services he discovered that it was not confined to Zulus only. [Smythe] Alright, but then why would a person vote for the IFP. What do you feel you can give to a South African citizen? [Buthelezi] Well, I think that our track record in the first place, that people know us, and they have every reason to trust us, that we have been motivated in everything that we have done, by the interest, not just of people in kwaZulu/Natal or black people, but the interest of every South African. Because when we campaigned for instance against sanctions, we were not doing this just for ourselves, but we were doing it in the interest of South Africa as a whole because we didn't want South Africa to be a wasteland. [Smythe] You've said in press reports that you will accept the results of this election provided that the international community says, you know, everything was okay and it was free and fair. What happens if Inkatha doesn't do well, if you fare badly both nationally and on a regional level. How will you feel about the election results then? [Buthelezi] Well, as a democrat, you know, I must accept the judgment of the people of South Africa. So as far as I am concerned, as far as my party is concerned, as far as the Central Committee, and my members, we are prepared to accept the verdict of the people. But at the same time of course, I must add that everyone knows that only an (?insane) politician like myself would participate in the election, you know, seven days before the election took place. But even that decision should make you think about voting for me because I did that in the interest of South Africa, because I thought that if in fact we did not get the concerns of His Majesty the king addressed, and therefore participation in the election, that this country was going slide into an abyss, and this would have happened. So even there I was concerned about the interest of everyone. So I've been disadvantaged as a leader, and my party is disadvantaged in that we haven't had time to campaign really like all the other parties. But nevertheless, I could well say, and some people would defend me, that you know, we were not giving enough time to campaign, and that was not by accident, because from the very beginning, the date was actually manipulated, because the 27th was described as sacrosanct. I don't know why it was sacrosanct. From the very beginning, you know, people were actually pushed into accepting the 27th of April as cast in granite, and I don't why it should be cast in granite. [Smythe] Well, you mentioned that you don't have very much time to campaign, and that of course is a fact. But what is also a fact is something I mentioned a little earlier, and the fact that you actually have been at the center of South African politics for the last few months, to some people in the negative way, and to your supporters obviously in a very positive way. So some people could say that was a rather cynical move on the part of the Inkatha Freedom Party to stretch it out. Possibly there have reports that maybe you felt that you weren't going to be a tremendous success at the polls, that this was one way of gaining concessions without having to go through all the campaigning that the others parties have done, but have kept your name in the forefront of the political field all this time? [Buthelezi] I'll say that I had no script for that. To say that it was drawn out deliberately as a strategy is wrong, because it was the issues that were not addressed at Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa]. Codesa was not destroyed by the IFP, it was the ANC and the South African Communist Party alliance who destroyed Codesa. And in fact they walked out of it, they threatened the whole country with mass action, they tried to bring the country to a standstill, they terrified Mr. de Klerk and forced him of course to sign the Record of Understanding, which messed up the whole process of negotiation. So, we are not responsible for all those things, and I would say therefore that there's nothing that we didn't do try and bring about compromise or some understanding, because even after our delegates withdrew from the forum, we then started vigorously talking to -- on a bilateral basis with both the ANC and the government. And then by December we were in a trilateral situation with them discussing on a trilateral, because we were desperate, because we wanted to get to the electoral. We've never been against going to the electoral process. [Smythe] The way you're speaking, you see yourself as an honest broker of your beliefs and the beliefs of your party and for your king, but you're being described in some local press, and indeed in some overseas press, as a demon, as a spoiler, and in one as a public relations disaster. Do you feel a little bit hard done by the press? [Buthelezi] Well, I don't about that. That's a question of opinion, because the largest newspaper -- THE SUNDAY TIMES -- I think you must have seen that editorial on Easter, which completely vindicated my stand, completely the opposite of Mr. Ken Owen and his paper who have tried to demonize me, even swearing at me, even defaming me in most cases. It is not true that... [pauses]. From the beginning the things weren't wrong like th?s, I mean from the outset. The government and the ANC were supposed to be people that must determine our future, so negotiations were made by (Pollard) negotiations because the ANC and the government were going to do it. In other words if I may use an analogy, two cats in the room were enough. When I appeared as the third cat somehow I took a knock by the media by other people including diplomats as spoiling what could be a good thing if the ANC and the government sow it up between themselves. But in fact this is what caused the problem. Now of course, then I had to be destroyed, then that's why there was this campaign by both the government and the ANC and national intelligence, who in fact did their damndest even to incite the press, even when we discuss with Mr. de Klerk. It's just unfortunate that he has got that man called Dr. Barnard, who was the head of intelligence, because he is the man really who has been responsible behind scenes for what has happened. Because even some of the discussions between ourselves when there was no media, for instance Skukuza, he gave them to the press. For example, in Skukuza it was suggested that the king should only go in with a few people. But then we had a delegation which had legal advisers and so on, and he is the one who was arguing with my official, Mr. Stan Armstrong. I mean, that took place just between them, in the veranda, but the next thing that was in the first page of THE SUNDAY TIMES. I mean the water has been muddied by the fact that this man, Dr. Barnard, has really been the power behind everything that has gone wrong in this country. [Smythe] Just continue with that kind of thought. You stood for not making any deals with the present government until Nelson Mandela was released, until the ANC was unbanned. So there again do you feel that you've had rather the raw end of the deal there, as far as the ANC and the NP were concerned? [Buthelezi] I wish you were present at Skukuza, because when the issue of the date came up, I said to Dr. Mandela, I said my brother, I love you very much, which I do really, because to be a friend with someone for more than 40 years is quite something. So now I said to him, you know, I waited for years and years for you. You mean you can't wait for me even for a few weeks? Just for a few weeks? Can't you do that? I put this, you know, it was nearly with tears in my eyes. [Smythe] Well, between tears in your eyes and Mr. Mandela saying he would go down on his knees, there was obviously a very emotional decision that you had to make to actually go into these elections. I wonder now what's going to happen. [Buthelezi] His going on the knees was just really cheap vilification really, because there was no need for him to use the expression that he needs to go on his knees, because I've never refused to see Mr. Mandela. Whenever meetings have been requested I've never refused, I've never had any problems. And in fact, it's strange you know, when we are together, you'll be surprised at the affections that we've had for each other and the warmth that we've had for each other, and comradeship in the ANC surfaces. It comes to the top. [Smythe] Does that mean after the elections when the results are out, you're in Parliament, let's assume you get in, this involvement there by the IFP for the IFP, you are going to be able to work with a government of national unity? [Buthelezi] Well, I don't know about that, but that's what the constitution says, so therefore I suppose if one is in it, one will have to abide by the constitution without necessarily saying that I like that arrangement because I would prefer myself to be in opposition politics. Or if I can't make it, if the people do not elect me, because there are still a few days, they can decide to elect me, I stand just as good a chance as Mr. de Klerk or Mr. Mandela. But if they don't then I would have liked to be in opposition politics. [Smythe] So outside the parliamentary system, basically, you would be happy to do that. [Buthelezi] Yes, of course I would be happy to do that, in fact, that's what [pauses] You know, a lot of people surprise me, because they said to me what will you do if you don't go in for elections? What will happen to you? And it amused me because for 83 years black people have not been part and parcel of the electoral process in this country. We've been out of it and we have been in politics outside opposing apartheid, opposing segregation, we were doing that outside. So that there was nothing traumatic about being outside and actually opposing the thing from outside. [Smythe] There has been talk by some of the political parties of joining up and forming sort of coalitions, or whatever word one wants to use, with other parties, either before or after the election to gain strength in certain regions. How do you feel about that as the IFP? [Buthelezi] I don't think it's feasible as the constitution stands to have coalitions as one had in the past. Maybe in Parliament we can go on one side by arguing on the same side, but to actually form coalitions I thought -- I'm subject to correction here -- that the constitution does not make it possible. [Smythe] So you don't see yourself joining up? Supposing you don't get elected into Parliament, you don't see yourself joining up with the right wing to form some kind of guerrilla outfit that you would form sort of Vietnam situation where you go underground? [Buthelezi] I would say in the first place, I rejected violence long ago, and when I went to London in '79 to see Mr. Oliver Thambo, it was precisely this issue on which we could not agree because I could not agree to the armed struggle, because I've always denounced violence, because the founding fathers of ANC founded the ANC on the basis that the ANC was going to wage a nonviolent struggle through negotiations. So when the ANC decided, because of the intransigence of the government, to take up arms, I disagreed with them. So therefore I'm not attracted really by guerrilla warfare. Even when my people war waged against the people who were oppressing us, the South African apartheid regime, it was never an option I ever considered. [Smythe] You are minister of police as well, Dr. Buthelezi. [Buthelezi] Absolutely. [Smythe] What is going to happen to the kwaZulu Police? I mean, we have seen a lot of IFP supporters who are definitely against, for example, the National Peacekeeping Force, seeing it as an ANC-, an NP-dominated police force. What is going to happen to the kwaZulu Police? Are you going to encourage them to join a national police force? [Buthelezi] Well, actually I suppose that is inevitable. I mean, I think that the fact that you, I mean we are in (?an election), makes it inevitable that they will be merged into a national police force. But of course, as I said at (?the rallies), I think that is absolutely wrong because the king himself has stated, you know, that in his kingdom he would like to have his own police force. [Smythe] But that is not going to be annulled, is it? A private, a sort of private police forces or private armies or.... [Buthelezi, interrupting] Well, it is not private. I mean, America, they have got different police forces in various states. They have even a militia. You know, the king wants a militia as well because they have a militia in various states in America, although you have got the national force, you know, on the whole country. So, I mean it is a question of saying it is not going to be allowed. It's neither here nor there because, I mean, there are so many guns now in South Africa that it's really, it's better to regularize this thing and do it properly. In other countries like America do it. If you are going to have a militia, even the states have the militia, if you are going to have the police from the states, have that. [Smythe] But you would encourage the kwaZulu Police as it stands to participate in a national police force. [Buthelezi] Yes. You know, as a matter of principle. When I was approached by General Meiring and the commissioner of police, General van der Merwe, when they came to Ulundi last year and suggested that some of our police force should join the National Peacekeeping Force, then I said that, well, I couldn't because in the first place some of our people have been killed by cadres of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing]. And there you are saying that we must merge with them. Because we saw something very strange in the state president because on the 20th of December 1991 you will remember, even on television, that he stated that he wanted Umkhonto we Sizwe disbanded and that the arms should be (?handed) to the police. But he had such a dressing down from Mr. Mandela that he never opened his mouth about that later. And the next thing we heard that there was going to be (?a merger) into one force, into the National Peace Keeping Force and also in the SADF [South African Defense Force]. Now, I am very unhappy about that and I think I have been proven right because the exchange of fire that took place at Thokoza just two days ago, I mean bears testimony to that because it was not only the IFP members who complained, but even some members of the ANC were not happy with what happened there. [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, what is it going to be like for you to make your cross on the ballot paper for the first time? [Buthelezi] Well, I think that it's an experience in fact which will mean that at long last after a decade that one has spent fighting for human rights for our people, fighting for the franchise for our black people that at long last, you know, we have reached that point. [Smythe] And it will b a very emotional thing? [Buthelezi] It will be a very emotional thing I think for all of us in the country as black people in particular to put that cross on the ballot paper. [Smythe] How are you going to manage? I mean, do you think you actually can manage to campaign now over the next few days nationally as well as regionally? [Buthelezi] I am trying as much as possible, but if you can't clone yourself, I cannot clone myself and be everywhere where I would like to be, but I mean tomorrow I am going to (?parts) of the Transvaal and I think that those who are conducting our campaign have scheduled me for Soweto on Sunday. But then the days are finished. Then I can't do more than that. I would like to do more than that, you know, but unfortunately as I say I have not done that because I would like to go to the voters myself and to speak for myself with the voters throughout the country. [Smythe] What do you see as the most pressing problem to face the new government? [Buthelezi] I think the most pressing problem is meeting the, I mean, the unrealistic expectations that have been printed because, I mean, the fact that we are going to have a government of national unity, or even if it was a black government, will not cause these things that we discussed at the beginning of this interview -- the poverty -- we are not going to bridge those gaps overnight. And therefore I fear myself, I am very much scared, maybe it is not wise to be in a government of national unity because one will just suffered that blame whether one is responsible for it or not. I fear that the expectations of young people that have been created, when they have been promised that this means that they are going to have housing and so, and all the things that have been promised. (?These such things will not) [words indistinct] even if we try. They will not have them overnight. I think Mr. Mandela made this point -- was it yesterday -- as well as at King William's Town that it will take five years or more. But I believe myself it is a generation. I think we should prepare our people that the real struggle is going to begin on the 28th. The real struggle in this country commences after that. We have got to roll up our sleeves and work, you know, all of us as people of this country. I don't think that we should, even if we have suffered because of apartheid, that other people owe us a living. I think that we should also have, you know, self-help schemes. I have always believed in the IFP. There are twin pillars of our philosophy -- self-help and self-reliance. I believe that even if the economic growth will go higher, 5 percent or even more, we will not be able to create the number of jobs, with the democracy we have in the country, we are not going to be able to give every young person that has catapulted into the labor market with a [words indistinct] job. So, therefore, it is a very uphill struggle. I think that if we were more realistic in our approach by not, you know, creating expectations that once we are also in charge in this country that everything will vanish like mist. I think that it would really pay dividends for us because then our people can be sober and realize that the real struggle now is going to begin on the 28th. [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for joining us on Agenda tonight. [Buthelezi] Thanks very much.
