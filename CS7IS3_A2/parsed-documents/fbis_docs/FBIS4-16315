Ossetians, Ingushis Agree on Accord Preamble LD1504125594 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1055 GMT 15 Apr 94 LD1504125594 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The North Ossetian and Ingush teams negotiating in the Kabardino-Balkarian capital Nalchik agreed on April 14 on the preamble of a final document, a treaty on helping the refugees in their republics return to their homes, as envisaged by the Russian president's decree. Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the interim administration in the emergency-rule zone, said at a news conference in Nalchik Thursday night that adoption of the preamble was the main achievement of the day. He said that the two sides had, at last, developed the guidelines for further talks. In particular, the preamble condemns all kinds of extremism and activities of those who triggered the violence in North Ossetia in the fall of 1992. The preamble also says that the two sides will abide by the Russian Federation's Constitution and ordinances of the Russian government in resolving their problems. Lozovoy also said that the North Ossetian and Ingush negotiating teams headed by Presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev would continue discussion of the draft accord article by article. The talks were expected to resume in the Kabardino-Balkarian president's country residence at 11:00 Friday. Lozovoy said that even though the issues under discussion were not easy, the atmosphere of the talks was polite and benevolent. Speaking on the April 12 capture of Ingush hostages in North Ossetia, Lozovoy said that North Ossetian law enforcement agencies had been keeping three Ingushis suspected of crimes committed in the republic. They are in the custody of the North Ossetian Prosecutor's Office.
