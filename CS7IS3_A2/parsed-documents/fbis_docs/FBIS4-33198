Lien was greeted by Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias and other senior Guatemalan officials at the airport. Herbruger said in his welcoming speech that Lien's visit symbolizes strong ties between the Republic of China [ROC] and Guatemala. Lien said he appreciates the hospitality the Guatemalan Government has extended to him and his entourage. "I hope cooperation between our two countries can be further strengthened for our mutual benefit," he added. Lien later attended a dinner given by local overseas Chinese groups in his honor. Lien will meet with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio Friday to discuss matters of mutual concern. A ministerial-level meeting will also be held, with the participation of senior officials from the two countries. ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, will discuss ways to boost bilateral cooperation in various fields with their Guatemalan counterparts. Lien and De Leon will give a joint news conference Friday evening to explain future cooperative projects between the two countries. Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's current Central American tour. He just ended a four-day visit to El Salvador where he attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran president, Armando Calderon Sol. Lien will leave here for New York Sunday for a two-day private visit. Some sources said Lien may also stop in Mexico on his way to New York, but the rumor could not be confirmed. The ROC does not maintain diplomatic ties with Mexico or the United States. Lien said his New York trip is purely for private purposes.
