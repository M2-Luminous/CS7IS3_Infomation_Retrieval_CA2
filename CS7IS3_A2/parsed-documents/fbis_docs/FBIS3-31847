For details, we approached Petru Ianc, state secretary and chief of the Metallurgical Industry Department. [Maier] What are the social implications of your department's restructuring policy? [Ianc] More than 145,000 people are currently working in metallurgy in various activities: Transportation, the actual production process, repair and maintenance, and research and design. In the West, in countries with market economies, when people refer to metallurgy they actually mean the basic structure: Raw material storage, iron and steel works, rolling mills, and storage for finished products. Other, complementary activities are organized in a separate system of services, which are paid for. This delimitation between the basic activity and complementary activities would mean to shift down from 145,000 employees to some 80,000. Thus, it would not mean a cut in personnel, but simply a separation of activities. Obviously, it is only natural that this process should continue in each of these components combined with appropriate measures resulting from correlating the volume of work with the number of personnel. This, however, will not have a drastic effect, at least not for the time being. Given the prospects for modernizing the production flow, a labor cut from 80,000 to some 40,000 is expected over a period of 10 years. A major part of this cutback will occur naturally. A further part of employees will be absorbed by specific ecologically-motivated actions. Obviously, a retraining program is also needed. [Maier] As a representative of the ruling center-leftist party, do you believe the Vacaroiu government will look favorably on the program you propose? [Ianc] I think it will be supported by the current government. And I also think that this program should not only be supported by a leftist government, but by any government in power over these 10 years. That is what has happened in all countries in the world, both in those with a leftist government such as France and in countries with center or center-rightist governments such as Britian. Social problems are the focus of the current government and must be the focus of any government.
