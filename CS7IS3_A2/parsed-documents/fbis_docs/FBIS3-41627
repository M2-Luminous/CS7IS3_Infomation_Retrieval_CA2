The head of this department, Commodore Viktor (Sakharov) told us about the recent dumping of some of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste intothe Sea of Japan, which all but caused complications in Russo-Japanese relations. [Begin (Sakharov) recording in Russian, fading into English translation] The dumping on 17 October was planned. It was sanctioned by the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection. Some 90 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste were dumped into the Sea of Japan. Their total activity was 0.38 Curie. Everything was done according to schedule in the presence of an official from the ministry. The surface layer of the sea was monitored throughout the dumping. The gamma radiation at a distance of 20 meters from the dumping site did not exceed the background radiation. [end recording] Asked whether the Navy could give up dumping at sea, (Sakharov) said this: The Navy has a big problem. It so far has no shore installations for radioactive waste disposal and it won't have them until after 1997. So it has to use the methods it has employed up to now. In general, (Sakharov) believes the Navy should not be concerned with the storage or disposal of radioactive waste. The problem should be dealt with on a national scale by a single state body. In other words, the Navy should turn its waste over to some reprocessing plant and pay for its services. Such plants would reprocess the waste of all the ministries and other agencies that operate nuclear installations. Asked how the problem is dealt with in other countries, (Sakharov) provided this information: Nearly all the countries operating nuclear power installations face the same problems. Until recently, most of them dumped liquid radioactive waste into the sea. Commodore (Sakharov) says he and his colleagues are well aware that this is no solution to the problem. The problem has to be solved radically. Eventually the radioactive waste dumped into the sea will worsen the environmental situation, first locally in individual areas and then on a bigger scale affecting the animal and plant world and human beings. The problem can hardly be solved by the Navy or, for that matter, by the country. It has to be tackled by all nations since humanity has no intention of giving up nuclear power.
