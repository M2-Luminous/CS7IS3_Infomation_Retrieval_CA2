The two sides expressed satisfaction over the very successful economic and trade cooperation between China and Belgium, and hoped for long-term and stable development of friendly ties and cooperation between the two countries. Dehaene said: Belgium and China enjoy friendly ties, the exchange of high-level visits between them increased in recent years, and Belgium's investments in China have continued to expand and have produced good results. The past few years saw China's economy develop very rapidly, and this will produce a major impact on the Asian region. We attach importance to and appreciate China's constructive role in the UN Security Council. Dehaene was confident that Li Ruihuan's visit would promote continuous development of Sino-Belgian ties in political, economic, and other fields. Li Ruihuan said one of the main aims of his tour to Belgium and four other north European nations is to learn from and draw on experiences which will benefit China. China hopes to develop long- term and stable friendships and cooperative ties with other countries in the world, as this will promote modernization in China and contribute to world peace and development. Li Ruihuan said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out that we must absorb and draw lessons from all fruits of civilization created by human societies, including advanced science and technology and experiences in management and administration from advanced capitalist countries. This is a thesis which is full of foresight. The thesis is extremely important in that it offers guidance on China's reform, opening up, and modernization and the way China conducts exchanges with foreign countries and handles issues concerning international relations. He pointed out: Experiences of mankind include direct and indirect experiences. From the vertical perspective, human knowledge means inheritance, but from the horizontal perspective, it means drawing on experiences. A country which stands still and refuses to make progress, closes itself to international intercourse, and refuses to accept useful things from other countries will be left behind by the trend of the times. He said: In the past century or so, the Chinese nation fully suffered from imperialist aggression and plundering. It had no choice but to devote its main energies on national liberation and was unable to concentrate its energies on economic construction. Thus, it lost a lot of precious time and fell far behind developed nations in the West in economics, science, and technology. With the implementation of reform and opening up, we have marched into the world, entered the international market, and continued to absorb and draw on experiences which benefit us from all countries. We have not only accelerated our development, we have also made corresponding contributions to the international community. Li Ruihuan said emphatically: We must not forget that in the history of development stretching over thousands of years, the Chinese nation accumulated a very rich cultural heritage, and that a complete set of fine traditions took shape despite its having to go through nearly a century of struggle. We must greatly treasure these good things, and care must be taken to preserve them and carry them forward. Only by preserving our good things and absorbing good things from other countries are we "adding one good thing to another" and making ourselves better. This is just what we have often said: Learn from other people's good points, carry forward our good qualities, absorb the strong points from various people, and follow our own path. Today, Li Ruihuan also met Robert Urbain, Belgium minister of foreign trade [and European affairs]. The two sides praised the smooth development of bilateral economic and trade ties. Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Belgian economic and trade cooperation developed rather rapidly in recent years. The two countries' economies are highly complementary to each other. There is great potential and broad prospects for the two sides to conduct mutually beneficial cooperation. We are willing to work together with the Belgian side to push bilateral economic and trade ties to a new stage of development. Urbain said: China has made remarkable success in economic development. The Belgian Government attaches much importance to the development of economic and trade ties with China. It is ready to continue strengthening friendship and cooperation with China. It believes that Li Ruihuan's visit to Belgium will promote bilateral ties, particularly further development in bilateral economic and trade ties.
