FR940725-0-00173 FR940725-0-00019 Based on data in the 1987 Census of Manufacturers, 75 percent of shipyard employees are production employees. Data from CONSAD Research Corporation's 1986 report to OSHA estimated that 76.6 percent of shipyard workers were production workers. Relying on the 1987 Census of Manufacturers, the Agency concludes that there are approximately 79,500 production workers (75 percent of 106,000 total employees) who are potentially involved in confined space entry in shipyard employment and are therefore exposed to confined space hazards. E. Technological Feasibility The shipyard industry has been applying the previous Subpart B on vessels for approximately 30 years_and to some extent on land-side activities. While the revised final standard mandates new elements such as training, rescue, and duty to other employers, it makes no fundamental change in the way shipyards perform confined spaces' work. Technologies such as atmospheric testing instruments, ventilation equipment, and respirators have been in use for many years throughout the industry. As the new standard does not require any new technology or engineering or other controls, the Agency concludes that this new confined space standard is technologically feasible. The performance-oriented criteria of the standard should also allow technological innovation to achieve compliance. F. Costs and Benefits Several elements in the final rule could impose costs on the shipyard industry: requirements for training of production workers; duty to other employers (contractors and subcontractors); extending the scope to land-side operations; and specifications for self-rescue and rescue teams. The Shipyard Employment Safety Advisory Committee (SESAC) recommended that all of these provisions be included in the final confined spaces standard to make the rule comprehensive. Submissions to the docket by the shipyard industry, unions, and professionals in the maritime industry indicate that these elements would not impose new costs on shipyards but would in essence codify current industry practice. Testimony at SESAC's meetings also consistently indicated that the elements of the new standard would impose no new costs on the industry (SESAC transcript Sept. 3, 1992, pp. 471&hyph;503). The Agency therefore concludes that the new Subpart B is economically feasible, and will have no effect on profits or the cost of output of the shipyard industry. A benefit of the final rule is to eliminate a paperwork requirement of reporting the identity of shipyard competent persons to the Agency on two forms and to clarify the duties of the competent person, Certified Industrial Hygienist, and Marine Chemist. The Agency believes that full compliance with existing Subpart B would eliminate the average of one to two annual fatalities. However, the Agency also concludes that mandating the new comprehensive elements of the final standard (for training, duty to other employers, and rescue) will contribute to compliance and discipline in applying Subpart B and will reduce the number of fatalities. The Agency also concludes that increasing the oxygen content to 19.5 percent by volume, specifying the order of atmospheric testing, and limiting oxygen to no more than 22 percent by volume reduces significant risk relative to the requirements of existing Subpart B. The shipyard industry largely conforms to these practices at the present time. G. Regulatory Alternatives The Agency also believes that the proposed rule is the most cost-effective regulatory alternative for this industry. If the general industry ``permit-entry confined spaces'' standard (29 CFR 1910.146) were applied to land-side activities_or all shipyard work_costs would be incurred to re-train shipyard production workers in a second procedure for entering and working in confined spaces, for attendants, and for establishing a written program. The Agency estimates that this would cost the industry approximately $104 million annually. These costs are not as high as estimates found in the comments to the docket because the final general industry permit spaces rule differed significantly from the proposed rule, especially on the number of attendants that would be required. Adopting the general industry confined spaces for only land-side shipyard operations could also result in increased risk of accidents if shipyard workers had to apply two distinct standards to their work. Confined space work is routine in shipyards and employees frequently shift back and forth between land-side and vessels. A second regulatory alternative would be to apply the general industry standard to all shipyard work. Here the program costs would be as great as the first alternative but the Agency has concluded that there would not be additional benefits. The shipyard confined space standard is in many ways a more restrictive subset of the general industry standard. The additional program-based elements of ยง1910.146 would not improve the safety of confined space entry in shipyards because the shipyard standard is even more comprehensive in its coverage of hazardous atmospheres. Further, its approach to inspection, testing, and ventilating spaces has become an integral part of the routine work activity in shipyard employment.
