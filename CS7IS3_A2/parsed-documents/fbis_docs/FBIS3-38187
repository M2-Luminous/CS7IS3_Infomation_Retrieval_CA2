He said the straits are of vital importance to Russia as they are the only way for Russian ships to reach the Mediterranean, and his country understands Turkey's concern concerning Istanbul's security. Turkey has prepared a new regulation draft which aims at bringing to the minimum any risks that may threaten ships and environmental security, and which brings new regulation for ships passing through the straits. Chernyshev also said that Russia is in principle not against a possible Baku-Yumurtalik (in southern Turkey) pipeline to transport Azeri oil from Azerbaijan and former Soviet republics to Europe, adding however that there are two important criteria, which are economic and political feasibility. A framework agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan was signed on March 9, 1993, stating that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline would be the most economic way to bring Azeri oil to world markets. The pipeline has a design capacity of 40 million tonnes per year. Azeri oil production over the next few years is not expected to exceed 25 million tonnes per year. The extra capacity has been incorporated into the pipeline to attract oil transportation demand from Central Asian countries, mainly from Kazakhstan. Turkey has made plain its opposition to oil being transported by tankers through the Bosphorus, a route suggested by some, because of the risks of environmental damage and the potential dangers to Istanbul whose ten million plus residents live on both sides of the busy strait. Commenting on the Azeri-Armenian conflict he said his country sees Turkey as a country that can politically contribute to the solution of the problem. On the European Conventional Arms Reduction Agreement, he said Russian demands should not be seen as threat against Turkey, adding it is not targeting any country. On the nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's remarks targeting Turkey he said the former has no political future. Chernyshev said a planned visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin expected to take place in March will bring a new dimension to Turkish-Russian relations, adding a number of agreements are expected to be signed between the two countries during this visit.
