FR941122-1-00075 FR941122-1-00017 Minority Report A minority report signed by five Council members raises several objections to the proposed red snapper management measures, including alleged deficiencies in fishery data supporting the Council's recommendations and an alleged inadequate assessment of the impacts of bag limit reductions on headboat and charter vessel operators and crew. The report does not object to the delayed opening of the commercial red snapper season. Copies of the minority report are available (see ADDRESSES ). NMFS is considering and reviewing the minority report. Any final rule implementing the approved measures in the regulatory amendment will respond to comments on the proposed rule received by NMFS during the 15-day comment period, including the issues raised in the Council's minority report. Classification This proposed rule was determined to be not significant under E.O. 12866. NMFS has determined that the proposed change in the red snapper bag limit and the restriction on the allowable harvest of red snapper for headboat and charter vessel captains and crew could affect more than 5 percent of gross for-hire commercial revenues. As a result, the proposed action could cause a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. A copy of this analysis is available (see ADDRESSES ). NMFS is proposing a 15-day comment period on this rule, as opposed to a maximum of 30 days allowed under the FMP's framework procedure, in order to provide an opportunity for participation by the public while ensuring that the proposed measures, if adopted in final, can be implemented by January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year.
