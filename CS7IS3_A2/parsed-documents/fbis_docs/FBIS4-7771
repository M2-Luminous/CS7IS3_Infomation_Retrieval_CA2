"Just when there appeared to be a process of normalisation under way, with some spirit of reconciliation among the Bosnian Serb authorities, everything has been thrown into question with this upsurge in tension," a negotiator here said on condition of anonymity. A week-long Serb onslaught on the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, and a last-minute reversal on the proposed evacuation of several thousand non-Serbs from the northern town of Prijedor following a massacre last week, have thrown the spotlight onto possible divergences among the Serb leadership. Differences have long been known to exist between separatist hardliners, mainly in the army and in the Serbs' Banja Luka stronghold, and supporters of Radovan Karadzic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic based at Pale, just outside Sarajevo. These differences are seen as the most likely cause of the latest developments, the most astonishing of which was Karadzic's volte- face over the evacuation of up to 6,000 Moslems and Croats from Prijedor, scheduled to take place on Tuesday. On Sunday Karadzic gave written orders authorising UN and Red Cross officials to proceed with the evacuation, demanded by the non-Serb population of the region which had been terrorised by Serb militants. Then on Monday he vetoed the agreed figure of 6,000, saying that such a large-scale evacuation was unncessary since, he said, measures had been taken to protect civilians in Prijedor. The operation was postponed as a result of the reversal. The fighting in the Gorazde region comes after a ceasefire was agreed between Bosnians and Serbs in Sarajevo. Rivalry between Serb civilian and military authorities is also seen as the likely explanation for such incidents as the theft of parcels at Banja Luka, or the confiscation of food supplies destined for the northern enclave of Maglaj. The commander of Bosnian Serb forces, General Ratko Mladic, seen as the most militant of hardliners, currently spends the bulk of his time in the Banja Luka sector rather than at Pale, diplomats noted. Unconfirmed reports here indicate that Mladic has fallen out with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic's sponsor in the Bosnian conflict. European Union negotiator Lord Owen said last week that at his last meeting with Milosevic he had found the Serbian leader more amenable to a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Serbia has been severely hit by economic sanctions imposed on Belgrade in May 1992.
