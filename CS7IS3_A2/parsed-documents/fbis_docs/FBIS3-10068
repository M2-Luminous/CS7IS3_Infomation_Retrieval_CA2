Both the food--cheap and served in ample portions--and the air conditioning are perfect. Outside on Avenida Rio Branco, in the heart of Rio de Janeiro, the temperature on these dog days is nearly 40 degrees Celsius. People eat well here at the Military Club, a venerable association founded in 1887. This is its third headquarters in its long history, but although the building has a more modernistic appearance, the decor retains touches that are somewhat rococo. The atmosphere is still closely identified with the air that was breathed, politically and anthropologically speaking, in the early 1960's, when it was the meeting place for the officers who organized and commanded the so-called "Democratic Crusade" that led to the coup of 1964 and the deposition of Joao Goulart. The only difference from those somber days is that the messmates, now in their sixties, although they still employ a conspiratorial tone in their conversations can bark orders only to the waiters that glide around the large hall--gracefully and with alacrity, may we say, but armed only with harmless knives and forks. More out of professional duty than any ideological whims, they might venture opinions on the virtues of certain salads, of leafy appearance and well-suited to a carioca summer's diet. Today, a Wednesday, the hall is full of members and their guests, supplemented by those who, although they have never been career military men, still have a deep affinity for the club and participate with their hearts and minds. At almost all the tables one hears debates, sometimes heated, especially when the subject is Brazilian politics. They despise, as they have every reason to, the blemishes that sully the National Congress. There are references to "robbers of the people," (this from a retired general, holding his fork aloft like a hypothetical trident from hell and using it to jab at the air, gesticulating as if he were ready to rummage through the entrails of corruption). "The nation has run out of patience, it can no longer put up with all these calamities and inertia. If that CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] of theirs ends up doing nothing, as people say it will, it would be better to shut down the Congress," added--no less emphatically--a colonel and former member of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. Brizola and Lula are also mentioned. And so passionately! The former is held responsible for the disastrous state of affairs in Rio de Janeiro. The latter is held responsible for what might happen after the presidential elections. The discussions are interrupted by the sound of squealing brakes and shattering glass from the avenue below. Everyone runs to the balcony of the restaurant to see what happens. "That's the third fender-bender today, the traffic lights are not working...this is intolerable...Where's the g...d...governor?" raved one colonel--unaware, surely, of the fact that the one who is supposed to take care of traffic signals is the mayor, Cesar Maia, not Governor Brizola. Short pause for dessert. The coconut pudding, passion fruit mousse, and condensed milk custard are all excellent. "As you can see, we here at the Military Club are a living and dynamic organization. We have a lot of influence. Those who think we are just a bunch of retired old men who come here to eat and play snooker are wrong," said General Nilton Cerqueira, club president and candidate for federal deputy on the PP [Progressive Party] ticket in Rio de Janeiro. A hard-liner, Cerqueira was the man who hunted Captain Lamarca through the backlands of Bahia until he finally gunned him down. He was also the man who when in command of the Rio Military Police, inexplicably refused to beef up the police force at Riocentro at the time of the famous attempted attack attributed to sectors of the so-called "intelligence community." Despite this background, the general, now 63, is an affable man. His professional and ideological past is unequivocal, but Cerqueira insists he is a legalist, although he acknowledges that Brazil is now going through a crucial phase that in some ways resembles the one that preceded the military movement of 1964. "Yes, sir, there is indeed a rebellious sentiment among the military. This has been manifested in high levels of the military hierarchy, in professional contacts where senior officers are being pressured by the junior officers and the civilian public," General Cerqueira said, emphasizing that "one feels that there is an expectation of a military reaction," in the event the corrective measures demanded by the Budget CPI are frustrated. But, despite the "climate," there are no practical measures to be taken, at least for the time being. "After all," he pointed out, "if we were to overturn the tables at this point, what would be the ideal model for Brazil? We also have to remember that we don't have a Fujimori, and so...." Cerqueira says it is in this direction that the Military Club is working, serving as a catalyst for opinions and influencing things to the extent possible--only to the extent possible. In other words, the "ideology" of the club is daring in theory but cautious in practice. It seems the club is essentially an active center for discussion. This means one should not be swayed by the more radical opinions one hears there. "The people in the reserve are more impassioned, but what we are really trying to do is to open up the spectrum of opinions so that the broad meaning of democracy can be discussed," Cerqueira insists. Concerning Lula, the general made another categorical statement: "Disapproval of the PT is strong among the officers and in the Military Club. I can state without fear of contradiction that the consensus within the Armed Forces repudiates his ideas." Cerqueira is unmoved by the argument that the PT's platform appears to be highly favorable to the Armed Forces; it is against low pay scales and the "junking" of the institution. The general almost leapt out of his chair, and responded vehemently: "That does not mean that the PT and Lula are in a position to fulfill it." Before saying goodbye, the general insists on taking the reporter and photographer into the Military Club museum. There in the gallery hang portraits of military men who served as president of Brazil, but no picture of General Ernesto Geisel. I asked Cerqueira about this absence, and he gave me to understand that it is intentional. The general opposed the political opening [abertura] launched by Geisel because "it was inopportune, done at the wrong time." Nothing more is said but, as we left the museum, a museum staffer whispered that "General Cerqueira does not like Geisel...." Some of the members and regulars at the Military Club are not in tune with Nilton Cerqueira's ideas. General Diogo Figueiredo, for example, brother of the general and former president, does not think the Military Club speaks for the military. According to Diogo, the club has a historical tradition but that does not mean it can or should compete with political organizations. "That would be the same as the bank workers' union attempting to control the financial system." The general, incidentally, confesses that he thought it very strange that the president of Brazil would receive the president of the Military Club to talk about matters that are not within its bailiwick. "In my opinion, what is happening is a demoralization and a breakdown of discipline, since the Military Club is creating a sort of parallel hierarchy. The club is a nice place to meet old buddies and have lunch, but the institution is not at all representative." Diogo Figueiredo is convinced there is no danger of a coup, since the Brazilian military is legalist. He recalls that what happened in 1964 was a breakdown of hierarchy and discipline in the barracks. If a problem of that nature were to arise today, then it would indeed be possible that the military chiefs might mobilize for action. The general believes, furthermore, that the Workers Party is a reality: "If Lula seeks out the military leaders to hear what they have to say, wonderful. If he seeks out the corporals and noncoms, then I would have to say I do not think he will take office." As for the problem of low salaries and junking of the Armed Forces, Diogo says that is no reason to start thinking of insurrection, because the military are now used to living with poverty. But they could never tolerate, for example, seeing national sovereignty scorned, sold out. "I am referring to the issue of the Amazon region," he concluded. Another eminent representative of the hard line, General Sebastiao Jose de Castro, former commandant of the Military Region of the Southeast, takes a more moderate position now and acknowledges that in the past, the Military Club achieved great influence, but said this does not happen today. He said the club should defend the interests of the military as a class, but that the institution ought not become a sort of labor union. Like General Diogo Figueiredo, General Sebastiao Jose de Castro thinks the possibility of a coup is remote, and even less likely to be fomented or inspired by the Military Club. "See here, men who are in the reserve, as General Nilton Cerqueira and I are, no longer command the troops and haven't the clout for stirring up anything at all, much less carrying out a coup...such a person could not even boot out the president of the condominium he lives in...but...for the sake of argument, suppose we could? We would carry out a coup to accomplish what? To seize a country that is in worse shape than in 1964?"
