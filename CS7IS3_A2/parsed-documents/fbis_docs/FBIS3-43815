Minutes after being freed, Osman addressed a rally of about 2,000 cheering supporters who welcomed him with garlands of purple bougainvillaea flowers. "Without you we would never have succeeded," Osman, known as 'Ato,' or the slim man told the crowd. He did not mention General Aidid's demand for UN peacekeepers to quit Somalia in what was essentially a non-political speech, but promised to address supporters again on Thursday. Osman, 44, was arrested four months ago on suspicion of involvement in the killings of US and UN peacekeepers before the world body dropped its hunt for Aidid amd suspended a warrant for his arrest in November. Osman was held for a time on an island off southern Somalia with two other senior Aidid aides, Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on international affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, Aidid's former representative in Ethiopia. The latter were arrested during an October 3 firefight in which Aidid militiamen killed 18 Americans. The three were later moved to the central town of Baidoa. They were flown to Mogadishu and handed over to officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday along with five other lower level Aidid aides who had been detained in the capital. An international law expert who investigated the case against the eight detainees, Enoch Dumbuntshena of Zimbabwe recommended their release after a four day visit to Somalia earlier this month, UN officials said. An international commission is still investigating allegations that Aidid masterminded the killings of foreign soldiers. More than 80 peacekeepers have died since the United Nations took over command of the multi-national military intervention force in Somalia from the United States in May, most in clashes with Aidid's militiamen. "We're happy the detainees have been released and we hope that all those will work together for peace with a spirit of reconciliation," UN spokesman George Bennett said. Asked whether the decision to release the detainees was political or judicial, Bennett said it was "humanitarian" gesture. As the eight were being released they met the Imam of Hirab, Omar Mohamoud, a revered Islamic leader who brokered a peace treaty signed by the clans of Aidid and his enemy, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed on Sunday. In a statement from Geneva confirming the releases of the eight, the ICRC recalled that it had in October last year played a role in bringing about the release of a US helicopter pilot and a Nigerian soldier held by Aidid supporters. ICRC officials have visited 206 prisoners in UNOSOM hands during the past eight months, the statement said.
