UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Lieutenant Colonel Bill Aikman said the Dutch had arrived over the past 24 hours. Serb cooperation in allowing a troop rotation in Srebrenica was one of three demands of the international community to move towards peace in Bosnia. The other two were to withdraw heavy weapons from Serb-besieged Sarajevo, which has been done, and to allow the re-opening of Tuzla airport in the northeast, which is due to take place this month. Serb authorities had blocked the rotation in Srebrenica, insisting that the troop level in Srebrenica not increase. But Aikman, a Canadian, said a total of 800-1,000 Dutch troops, a full battalion, would deploy in Srebrenica. The Dutch have arrived so far with 78 vehicles, mainly armored personnel carriers and other troop vehicles. Aikman said the Canadians would be leaving in two to three days. Srebrencia is one of six UN-mandated safe areas designed to protect besieged Moslem populations.
