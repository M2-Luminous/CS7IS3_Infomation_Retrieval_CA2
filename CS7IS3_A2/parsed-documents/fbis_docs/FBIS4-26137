Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived here Saturday [18 June] morning following his four-day private visit to the DPRK, conveyed DPRK President Kim Il-song's proposal to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. President Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet with him at any time, anywhere and at an early date without preconditions, told Carter that he will accept the offer "without any hesitation," presidential press secretary Chu Ton-sik told reporters. Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message when briefing the south Korean president on the results of his Pyongyang trip. Making a quick response to Kim Il-song's suggestion that "the earlier the summit came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam said that "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit would be better the earlier it came," Chu quoted the South Korean president as saying. Observers here believed that barring some unexpected developments, the inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in the near future, for the first time in the half-century of national division on the Korean peninsula. The venue of the summit can be either in Seoul, Pyongyang or at a third place. Officials sources said that South Korea and the DPRK are expected to begin working-level contacts soon to discuss details of the planned summit meeting. Carter's shuttling between Seoul and Pyongyang was a bid to break the deadlock over the DPRK's controversial nuclear program.
