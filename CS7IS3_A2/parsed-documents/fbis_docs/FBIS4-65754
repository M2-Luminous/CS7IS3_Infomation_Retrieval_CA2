On the question of the involvement of loyalist paramilitaries in the talks process, Mr. Reynolds said this was a matter for the Unionist population, but if there was a cessation of violence he wanted to see everyone around the table. He said it must be an evenhanded approach. The taoiseach was speaking in County Mayo. [Correspondent] The taoiseach is in Mayo campaigning in the by-election and the European election. A short time ago he said he welcomed the comments of Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux about loyalist involvement in the peace process. If there is a cessation of violence then who represents the Unionists will be a matter for them, but he said he favored everyone being at the table. This must be an evenhanded equal approach if there is a cessation of violence. On the Sinn Fein response to the clarifications by the British government, the taoiseach said he accepted that they needed more time, but he said there is no time left to stop the killing. It must happen now. Overall Mr. Reynolds said, the peace process was now back on the rails and he believed we were edging closer to the day when we will have a complete cessation of violence.
