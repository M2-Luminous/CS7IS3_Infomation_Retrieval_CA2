"At five-thirty, people began arriving to pray," Imam Ibrahim 'Abidin told AFP. "There were a lot of soldiers around and Palestinian identities were checked," at the entrance to the Tomb of the Patriarchs which both Jews and Muslims hold holy as the burial place of Abraham, his sons and wives. "During the first part of the prayer, suddenly shots were fired. "It can only be a planned operation because there were a lot of settlers around the mosque," the imam said. "The shots came from several directions. It was a veritable bloodbath." Fifty-three Palestinians died and dozens more were wounded. 'Abidin accused the soldiers of being very slow to react and then of delaying the arrival of ambulances. "Most people were hit in the head and chest," he added. [passage omitted]
