After very useful and frank talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe last night on all aspects of the Yugoslav crisis, our foreign minister will today meet Hubert Vedrine, secretary general of the Elysee Palace, who is the closest associate of French President Mitterrand. Jovanovic will also hold talks with General Schmid, personal adviser of the French prime minister for military issues, and (Savior Deviliten), chairman of the French Senate Commission for Foreign Affairs. In all the talks so far, especially with Foreign Minister Juppe, the Yugoslav foreign minister, as we have learned, stressed the discrepancy between French policies and the new reality in the Bosnian conflict and the Yugoslav crisis as a whole. He pointed out the need for Paris to carry out the necessary changes and to persuade both the European Union and the world community to adopt a more balanced approach, to abandon its selective policy, and to realize the advantages of treating all sides in the Yugoslav crisis in the same way. In the context of the U.S. plan and the European initiative, the Yugoslav side stressed during all talks the untenability of the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. The sanctions represent an enormous obstacle to positive solutions. The Yugoslav side also noted that Yugoslavia has met all the demands contained in the European plan, while the European Union has completely ignored its obligations.
