The Islamic Resistance Movement asked Fatah representatives to the Islamic university, a fundamentalist stronghold in Gaza City, to address 2,000 students on the forthcoming Palestinian autonomy and the opposition. "It really is the first time that Hamas has invited us, and what is more to this university to speak to their students," said Diyab al-Lawh, a Fatah leader in Gaza. "It's a good start to establish relations between the national and Islamic movements," he said after the Hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam announced an official agreement Friday to end internecine fighting and to cooperate for autonomy. "However we do not want to talk about a honeymoon because that's for marriages and occasionally matrimony ends in divorce," he laughed. 'Ala' al-Nazli, a 22-year-old student linked to Hamas, agreed. "It's the first joint meeting. It was excellent and moving. "It expresses the unity to which we aspire. We will hold more similar meetings and will maintain our relations with Fatah." After warm applause for the arrival of three members of Fatah's high committee the debate quickly focused on how the 9,000 Palestinian policemen will treat those like Hamas who have opposed the autonomy deal and the whole peace process. The opposition fears victimization, particularly by the 7,000 men of the Palestine Liberation Army who will form the backbone of the force and are totally devoted to PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Political science lecturer 'Atif 'Udwan, who was deported to southern Lebanon in 1992 as a Hamas member, questioned the impartiality of a police force recruited by the PLO. "Generally in democratic countries, the police does not belong to any particular side. Will this be the case or will it be an extension of the Israeli police?" he asked Al-Lawh replied: "The Palestinian authority will be elected by all Palestinians and the policemen who are due to arrive are veteran soldiers who have given their lives to the Palestinian cause and I do not think they will become the oppressors. "The police will be clean and impartial." The Israeli government has made no mention of the agreement, after warning the PLO that if it reached an understanding with the fundamentalists which allowed Hamas to continue its attacks on Israelis then the autonomy deal would be off.
