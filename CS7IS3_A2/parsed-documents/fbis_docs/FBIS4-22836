Kapitsa. Three lectures on the topic of femtosecond pulses and their usefulness in physics were given: 1. ``Current Trends in Research on Femtosecond Pulses and Possibilities of Their Use in Experimental Studies Pertaining to Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics'' by P.G. Kryukov; 2. ``Nonlinear Propagation of Femtosecond Pulses Through Fiber-Optic Waveguides'' by Ye.M. Dianov, A.M. Prokhorov, and V.N. Serkin; 3. ``Generation of Ultrahigh-Intensity Optical Fields by Powerful Femtosecond Laser Systems Including Excimer-Laser Amplifiers and Experiments Relating to Emission of Ultrashort X-Ray Pulses'' by V.M. Gordiyenko, N.I. Koroteyev, and V.T. Platonenko. In this report is summarized the content of the third lecture, which relates to development of ``desktop'' terawatt lasers emitting femtosecond radiation pulses of only 0.01-1 J energy. The mechanism of the process includes ``inertial conservation'' of the laser-induced plasma during its expansion, heat transfer deeper into the target mainly by diffusion being the main factor which limits the plasma temperature. When the radiation intensity exceeds the 10[.sup]18-[/]-10[.sup]19[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/], then light pressure exceeds thermodynamic pressure while the plasma temperature climbs to thousands of electron-volts and the electron concentration reaches 10[.sup]23[/]-10[.sup]24[/] cm[.sup]-3[/] under pressures of 10-100 Mbar. Under these conditions the motion of free electrons shifts into the relativistic mode, which imparts unique properties to a femtosecond surface plasma so that it becomes a new object of basic research. This applies particularly to the electrodynamics of interaction of high-intensity radiation and a rapidly expanding steep high-temperature plasma front, also to the emission of x-rays by such a plasma. The laser facility built at the Moscow State University under the late S.A. Akhmanov includes solid-state visible lasers with a 1-10 GW power rating and an molecular XeCl excimer laser with a 10-100 GW power rating which emit 570-630 nm radiation and 308 nm radiation respectively, in pulses of about 40 fs duration. Proper focusing makes attainable a radiation intensity even higher than 10[.sup]16[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/] at the target surface. Owing to the low optical density of a surface plasma, most of its x-ray emission energy lines within the resonance lines of its ions. With the aid of multilayer resonance mirrors it therefore becomes possible to extract strong narrow-band x-ray pulses and especially so from plasmas with hydrogen-like or helium-like ions. Theoretical analysis of the x-ray emission mechanism indicates that thin-film targets of about 100 nm thickness form laser-induced plasmas which make effective sources of hard x-rays. In this the heat is retained at the target, because the dissipation mechanism is inactive here, so that a less than usual intensity of the ``heating'' laser beam will be adequate. References 7.
