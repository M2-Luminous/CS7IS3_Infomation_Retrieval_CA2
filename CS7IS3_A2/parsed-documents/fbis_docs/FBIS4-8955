The overall level of consumer prices increased 9.3 percent in March compared to February. Prices for nonfood products increased 0.5 percent, for services 0.3 percent, and for public catering only 0.1 percent. In food prices, there was a slight decline of 0.1 percent, mainly due to lower prices for meat and meat products by 0.7 percent, and eggs by 10.8 percent. Among the individual nonfood products, prices for coffee increased 2.7 percent, sweets approximately 2 percent, and vegetable oil 1.1 percent. The development in food prices had an impact on the level of prices in public catering. Prices in restaurants rose only 0.1 percent and those for catering to work places 0.2 percent. Nonfood prices increased between 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, according to individual items, with the exception of personal hygiene products, medical supplies, drug store products, shoes, and leather goods (an increase between 1 and 1.3 percent), and prices for fuel, which declined 0.3 percent. In the sphere of services, prices for cinema and theater tickets rose 1.4 and 4.4 percent, and prices for certain personal services also rose. In the first quarter of this year, consumer prices rose (in March against December 1993) by 2.4 percent, in general, while the price development was different for the individual products within the main groups of goods and services. In consequence of the price increases for rent, heat, and hot water in January, prices for services increased 8.7 percent, for nonfood services 1.9 percent, and for public catering 1.2 percent, while food prices virtually stagnated (there was a decline of 0.1 percent in March against December 1993). The average yearly inflation rate (average over the 12 most recent months against 12 months of the previous year) was 17.6 percent in March. The development of consumer prices, particularly food prices, had an impact on the low increase in the cost of living (this impact was dependent on overall spending on food in individual types of households). The cost of living increased in March only 0.1 percent in households of pensioners, 0.2 percent in households of employees, and 0.3 in households of farmers.
