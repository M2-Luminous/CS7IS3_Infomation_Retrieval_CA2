Interfax learned that more than 20,000 people, including inhabitants of neighboring Dagestan showed up at the rally. Khasbulatov emphasized the necessity for normalization of relations with Russia. He suggested that this would contribute to stabilization of the situation in Chechnya and would bring positive changes in the lives of the Chechen poor. He stressed that the peoples must not suffer from the ambitions of certain politicians. A deputy Chechen interior minister who was present at the rally called this an appeal to be within the composition of Russia and urged that there be no speculation on this sensitive issue. Khasbulatov replied that he had just expressed his opinion. "Issues on state relations are not solved during rallies," he remarked. The Chechen presidential structures told Interfax that the appeal by Khasbulatov had received practically no support.
