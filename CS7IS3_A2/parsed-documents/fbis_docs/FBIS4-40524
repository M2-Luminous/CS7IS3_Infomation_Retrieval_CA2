The aim of the exercise is to improve actions to rebuff an enemy landing party. Marines are landing from Black Sea Fleet ships and helicopters, simulating air and artillery strikes, while defenders will hold out under the onslaught of superior enemy forces and defeat them. President Eduard Shevardnadze and Georgian brass hats departed for the war games. Journalists interpreted this move as a pretext for a meeting with Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze. According to earlier reports, the latter temporarily combined the duties of parliament speaker (he dissolved parliament last year by his decree) with the duties of Adjarian premier. Reports say that this was done "at the suggestion of the heads of ministries and departments of the autonomous republic". This move caused anxiety in Tbilisi which is concerned that Adjaria is increasingly disassociating itself from Georgia. Despite the fact that the list of Russian journalists was compiled and agreed upon in good time, they got up at early hours and arrived at the Tbilisi airport in advance. Nevertheless, they were removed from the plane, as ITAR-TASS learnt, "due to overload". Therefore, journalists have to be content with paltry reports received at the press centre of the Russian army group in Tbilisi.
