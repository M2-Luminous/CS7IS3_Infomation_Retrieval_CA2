Policy has to rest on facts. The great majority of those who are fighting in Bosnia are Bosnians. Bosnian Serbs have besieged Bosnian Moslems in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croats have besieged Bosnian Moslems in Mostar. Bosnian Moslems have besieged Bosnian Croats in Vitez. All now receive some help from outside. The Bosnian Serbs and the Serb government in Belgrade bear the greatest responsibility for starting the war and for the atrocities committed in it. That is why the international community imposes sanctions against the Serbs and not the others. But even now, after fighting and ethnic cleansing, the different communities in Bosnia are hopelessly mixed up on the map. That is why the parallel with Kuwait in 1990 is out of place, and why in the end there will be no stable military victory. John Nott advocates lifting the arms embargo. So did the Americans last year. It was not the British Foreign Secretary, but the majority of the Security Council which turned this down. If it had been lifted, all sides would have rearmed. Instead of dying down, the war would probably now be in full blaze. It might well have spread by now to other parts of the Balkans. Petrol does not put out a fire. A British government needs to look at the British interest -- the interest of a European nation with limited resources but willing to work hard with others for a more decent world. It is in our interest to stop the war spreading -- and so far, with our allies and partners, we have succeeded. It is our interest and instinct to help keep people alive, to relieve cold and hunger. Hence the 160 million pounds of your money which we have spent already on the humanitarian effort. Hence the 2,500 British troops escorting the convoys -- a bigger contribution than any except the French. Hence our aid workers and civilian drivers like Paul Goodman who lost his life last month. I don't have much time for those who belittle this effort. Of course, keeping people alive is not the same as ending the war. But it's a good deal better than leaving them to starve or freeze. It is in our interest to help efforts for a negotiated peace. The fighting will only be stopped by those who are doing the fighting. That sounds obvious. But some people witter on as if outsiders hold the key to peace. What outsiders can do is prepare the way with ideas and a framework for negotiation. That is what David Owen, Thorvald Stoltenberg and Peter Carrington before them have been doing. One day, when a peace has been built, their names will be found on the building blocks. If the surgical use of force by the West could have ended the war, we would have used force long ago. The justification has been there. But government, unlike retired Defence Secretaries, have to weigh the consequences of what they propose. We have to pay heed to professional advice. Britain has been more cautious than some others about talking of the use of force, and has asked practical questions about proposed rhetorical declarations. If the UN forces escorting convoys are attacked, they will be protected from the air. If the relief of Srebrenica or the reopening of Tuzla airport are prevented, these operations can be helped forward from the air. If the No Fly Zone is infringed, it can be enforced, it has been this week. If the Bosnian Serbs renege on what NATO and General Rose have achieved in Sarajevo, there, too, air power could be used. On balance, we believe that these measured commitments can deliver benefit which outweighs the risks. We do not warm to the idea of military operations entered into without judgement. They might satisfy the television viewer for a week or two, but could then draw us month by month, or even year by year, into a quagmire of loss and casualties. Ministers have the power to put at risk the lives of British servicemen. They should do this only after consultation and calculation, not to snatch a headline or appease a mood. There will be setbacks and more bloodshed yet before there is full peace in Bosnia. But in the last few weeks the patient work of many countries and individuals shows signs of bearing fruit. As the Prime Minister's visit to the United States showed, our disagreement with the Americans over Bosnia last year is now history. We work harmoniously with our fellow troop contributors, of which the core is European. We helped to bring the Russians back into the peace effort. From this work we now hope for four main results: First, the resumption of air convoys. They were suspended when air strikes and retaliation against air strikes seemed likely. Those in charge on the ground have to judge the risks day by day. The trucks and drivers are getting back on the road to central Bosnia which our engineers partly built and which our army manages. Second, the civil life of Sarajevo should be restored. Under General Rose French, British, and other troops keep the peace. It should now be possible to open roads and restore services. The Prime Minister and President Clinton announced a joint British-American mission to visit Sarajevo urgently to consider how to help the city get back to as normal a life as possible. Third, the benefits should spread to other towns and distressed areas. The plan for opening Tuzla to relief supplies should be carried out. Mostar, Vitez and the Maglaj pocket need relief. this means redeploying the UN force and may need extra men. Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Canada, Malaysia and many other countries are doing their bit. The extra should come from elsewhere. Fourth, the peace process needs to be revived. The Americans and Russians are needed here. If either hangs back, there will be generals and politicians in Bosnia who will advise against signing up to a peace agreement. We should not be dogmatic about the content. It has to be agreed, not imposed. If, thanks to American initiative, the Croats and Bosnian Moslems are willing to come together in a confederacy, well and good. Everyone, including the Bosnian Serbs, know that a settlement has to start with substantial Serb withdrawal from land they now occupy. We have put an end to war in West Europe. That is one reason why the European Community was founded. Neither NATO nor the European Union now can sensibly claim to be able to stop wars in Central or East Europe. but we have to try. Not by rhetoric and pretence, but by bringing those countries step by step into the European framework which we have created. Exhaustion, pressure and persuasion are opening the way to an end of the war in Bosnia. but that is only the beginning of our task.
