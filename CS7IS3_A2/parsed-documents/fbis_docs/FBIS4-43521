(Dominique Andre), you were at the launch [from Kourou space center in French Guiana] and you are now at Arianespace headquarters in Evry [south of Paris] [Andre] Yes, and Ariane is back in action again at last. The European rocket completely succeeded in its 64th mission this morning by putting into orbit the Intelsat telecommunications satellite, as well as two small satellites for the British Ministry of Defense. This flight has put the smile back on the faces of the Ariane engineers. This success is the first of the year, after the failure in January and the false start at the beginning of June, but now they are going to have to move quickly, or rather well and quickly, to quote the head of Arianespace, in order to stick to the new program--in other words, eight more launches this year. The Ariane team based in Kourou is going to be beefed up with technicians and engineers. The next launch is due to take place on 8 July, in three weeks' time. Dominique Andre in Evry for France-Inter.
