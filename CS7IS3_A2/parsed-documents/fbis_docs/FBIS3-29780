[KEPC] plans to begin demonstration tests of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system, which employs superconductivity technology to overcome the difficult process of storing electricity and transmits power when necessary. Under a five-year plan starting in fiscal year 1994, the company intends to spend about 880 million yen to install the nation's largest demonstration system at a transmission station in the suburbs of Fukuoka to collect various data which could not be gathered at the existing small-scale facilities. Power companies have been asked to seek ways to level out fluctuations in power loads caused by a gap between normal power demand and peak demand experienced during summer afternoons. This problem would be greatly alleviated should storage of electricity become possible. At KEPC's research institute, researchers feel "the upcoming experiments will be a big step toward making the system practical." Major electrical machinery manufacturers and four universities, including Kyushu University, plan to participate in the demonstration test. Work on designing the model system is to begin next fiscal year, and test operations will begin after the system is installed between 1997 and 1998, following partial tests and other initial procedures. The model system will store electrical energy up to 1 kilowatt-hour, with an output of 1,000 kilowatts. This compares with conventional systems' storage capacity of 200 to 300 watt-hours and output of 50 kilowatts. In the United States, the U.S. Defense Department embarked on a project in late 1980's to develop a device to store 20,000 kilowatts per hour as part of its Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) plan, but apparently "not much progress has been made in the development project," (as stated by an official at the KEPC).
