The original draft was amended several times. By extensively soliciting views from all quarters, it became a draft that reflects all their views. A few days ago, the report was issued to members of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who would be attending the sessions. It should be noted that there were four new additions to the work report when when Li Peng read it today. First, there were the contents on helping the poor, which read: "Conscientiously carry out the poverty assistance plan. The plan is intended to help poverty-stricken areas -- especially former liberated areas, minority nationality areas, and border areas -- solve the problem of food and clothing for some 80 million people and to help them out of poverty in the seven years from now to the end of this century. This is the unshirkable duty of governments at all levels. We believe that this plan surely will be ardently supported by people across the country." This was inserted into the paragraph on agriculture and the rural areas in the second part of the work report and obviously was related to the National Poverty Assistance Conference, which preceded the NPC session. One can see from this that the central authorities have attached more importance to the issue. Regulating the Widening Income Gap Pertinent to the above were the added remarks regarding improving the people's living standards in the second part of the work report, in light of the widening gap between rich and poor in China today. They read: "In the meantime, it is necessary to carry out necessary regulation of the excessively widening income gap through a policy of rational distribution and the regulatory role of tax revenue." Exactly 100 characters were added to the paragraph on the Hong Kong issue in today's work report, namely: "In keeping with the Basic Law and the decisions of the NPC standing committees, the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] has begun its work. Its tasks are formidable and its responsibilities are great. I hope the PWC will unite Hong Kong compatriots to the greatest possible extent and will make all good preparations for setting up the Hong Kong SAR and its first government and legislature in such a way that it will live up to the expectations and earnest trust of people across the country." The emphasis of the remarks naturally stresses the work of the PWC and surely will draw the exceedingly great attention of the Hong Kong community and media. Here one can see the Chinese Government's firm position on the British uncooperativeness and confrontation. On the Human Rights Issue In today's work report, the largest proportion and weight were added to the paragraph on human rights, in that the following remarks were added in the last paragraph of the seventh part (on diplomacy): "China attaches importance to human rights and is willing to participate in discussions on the human rights issue with the international community on the basis of mutual equality. However, it never allows anyone to interfere with China's internal affairs on any pretext. The Chinese Government supports the UN Human Rights Commission in its recent denouncement of some countries that exert pressure on developing countries. "Deputies, I am going to announce to every one of you a piece of information which I have just received. Last night, the UN Human Rights Commission once again voted against and thwarted an anti-Chinese resolution proposed by some countries! This fully demonstrates that there is no popular support for the use of the human rights issue against China. Here, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I express my heartfelt to the various countries that uphold justice and that support China!" We can say this was China's good counterattack against the pressure and interference of the West over the human rights issue. It was made on just grounds and it was reasonable and restrained. It also demonstrates the poise of a great country.
