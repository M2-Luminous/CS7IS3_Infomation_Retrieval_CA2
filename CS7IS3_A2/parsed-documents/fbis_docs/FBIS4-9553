FBIS4-9553 "dreeu082_i_94016" FBIS-EEU-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbs Continue Reinforcing Positions in Brcko Serbs Continue Reinforcing Positions in Brcko AU2804094694 AU2804094694 BFN [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 April carries in its regular 10-minute newscast three reports on the current situation on the fronts in the republic. The Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "last night, at 1800 the chetniks launched a fierce tank and infantry attack on the region of Boderiste which lasted until 2200. The destructive tank and artillery fire was supported by fierce antiaircraft guns and small arms' fire. Our reconnaissance units' reports abound with information on the influx of fresh Serbian reinforcements on the Brcko front. The chetniks are placing artillery in almost all strongholds around the free Brcko territory, while the enemy manpower is concentrating in front of the positions of the 100th Motorized and 100th Infantry Brigades in the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste. At the same time, the chetniks are reinforcing their positions around Djukici and Boderiste with armored-mechanized hardware. Such elaborate preparations for the continuation of the chetnik offensive, whose first phase lasted a full 14 days, imply that the future chetnik attacks on the free Brcko territory will be fierce. However, it seems that not all Serbs in Brcko are ready to continue the war against their former fellow citizens of Muslim and Croatian nationality. Namely, this morning, at around 0800, the Serbian Consultative Council clearly and decisively rejected the criminal policy of the Serbian Democratic Party." Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac area and says that "the joint attacks of Karadzic's fascists and Abdic's rebel paramilitary forces continued overnight and this morning on the free part of the Bihac commune. Indiscriminately and at various times, the chetniks targeted the defense positions on the Buzim, Bosanska Krupa, and [name indistinct] part of the front. They continued using antiaircraft weaponry on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau [words indistinct]. There is no peace on demarcation lines with Abdic's paramilitary forces. Provocations are registered continuously along all the defense lines." Correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica and says that "in the early morning hours, the chetniks began their attacks on the defense lines in the theater of operations of the 109th Doboj and 111th Gracanica Brigades. Using weapons of all calibers from the well-known chetnik strongholds -- Sjenina, Paleznica, Skipovac, Rajcevac, and Kostajnica -- the chetniks fired the greatest number of shells at Obric, Vukovac, and (?Banjik). This shelling is just preparation for the [words indistinct] enemy infantry attacks [words indistinct]. Since the enemy is not choosing his targets and shells are landing on the town of Gracanica, a general alarm has been in effect since 0800 this morning. All the attacks over the past few weeks imply that the chetniks have drawn up new borders and that this explains the relentless attacks on the Doboj-Klokotnica, Sjenina-Obric, and (?Tanjik)-Hukovac routes."
