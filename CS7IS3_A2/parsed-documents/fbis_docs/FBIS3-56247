The communist party has been outlawed in Lithuania and its former leader is listed among the 30 believed organizers and executors of the failed Soviet coup attempt in 1991. Some of them currently hide in Russia, and, according to some sources, in the neighboring Belarus. Lithuania has demanded several times to extradite the alleged state criminals, but without any success so far. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius and received on the eve of the third anniversary of the Jan. 13, 1991 bloodshed, the central committee of the so called Lithuanian Communist Party points out "the need to restore the political power of the working people." Burokevicius also demands to legalize the communist party in Lithuania and to stop its legal persecution, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper said. [passage omitted]
