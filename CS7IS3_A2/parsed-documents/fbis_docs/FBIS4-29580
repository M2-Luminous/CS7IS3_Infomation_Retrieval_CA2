"If nuclear weapons are created on the Korean peninsula, this would be a direct threat to Japan. It is our position to demand everything be made clear, including the history of operations of nuclear facilities," he told a House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee meeting. Kakizawa indicated he does not believe the United States will drop its demand that Pyongyang give a detailed report on the history of its nuclear activities, given the growing prospect of a diplomatic solution to the crisis. "I don't understand that the U.S. is ready to let the past pass without questions," he said. Kakizawa was responding to surging optimism that a peaceful solution will be found to the dispute over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit last week to Pyongyang led to an apparent breakthrough in the crisis, opening the way for high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang. After briefing U.S. officials over his talks last Thursday and Friday with North Korean President Kim Il-song, Carter told reporters he believes the crisis is over. But Kakizawa echoed the official U.S. stance toward the issue, which is more cautious than Carter's upbeat tone. Kakizawa said unless negotiations are conducted under international pressure, "There might be a possibility that North Korea will not make its stance clear." The foreign minister said the primary arena for negotiations may shift from the United Nations to Washington-Pyongyang talks. "The discussions at the United Nations may become low-key once the U.S. and North Korea start preparatory talks for high-level negotiations," he said. While welcoming the latest developments, Kakizawa cautioned against unreserved optimism, pointing to the track record of negotiations with the communist country. "The U.S. says it wants to follow up the move diplomatically. It happened once that a summit between North and South Korean leaders failed to materialize after a proposal."
