To chance and luck or to the weakness and disorganization of what is left of the gang [Basque Homeland and Liberty -- ETA]? [Asuncion] I have my own opinions, and there are opinions to suit all tastes. The important thing is that they failed in those attacks. [San Sebastian] It is also important to know why... [Asuncion] I believe that they are not very familiar with the explosives which they are using, but you will forgive me for not entering into technical explanations. [San Sebastian] You stated on your arrival at the ministry that you considered the contacts with ETA closed. If the "Azkoiti way" was, as was said from this ministry, a police way of finding out what was happening inside the gang and creating splits, why was it abandoned? [Asuncion] I have recognized no legacy of contacts with ETA from Algiers. As far as Azkoiti is concerned, he is an ETA member who served his sentence in France and who, according to my information, is in favor of renouncing violence, like many other prisoners, and is trying to persuade the armed gang to renounce violence. But that is no police way; it is the same thing that is happening with groups such as Elkarri, which belongs to the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] milieu, and which is beginning to say that violence is not the way. [San Sebastian] I will put it to you another way. Since your arrival at the ministry, has this ministry any way of knowing what is happening inside ETA? [Asuncion] This ministry knows what may be happening within a gang of mafiosi, drug traffickers, or criminals through informers, about whom, as is natural, I will not say a word. [San Sebastian] If French justice has now granted the extradition of Azkoiti, who was the leader of the roving commando, and this man no longer counts for anything, why is he living peacefully in an apartment in Paris? [Asuncion] I do not know; it is certainly a matter which I will have to check. [San Sebastian] Of course. Did the Basque Socialist Party [PSE] leaders discuss their initiative of beginning contacts with Herri Batasuna? [Asuncion] No, of course not, but in any event these are measures which the PSE must discuss within itself. For its part, the government must carry out its election program. [San Sebastian] I find it very hard to believe that the PSE would embark upon such a venture without the blessing of Ferraz Street [Socialist Party headquarters]... [Asuncion] They have embarked upon nothing. They have announced that there is a number of ideas worth studying. [San Sebastian] Were you acquainted with that plan? [Asuncion] I became acquainted with it later. [San Sebastian] And what was your opinion? [Asuncion] That the government must stand by what was agreed at the Ajuria Enea palace, and that hence that is where that plan must be discussed. Prisoners, Pardons [San Sebastian] Honestly and, if possible, with a date, for how long will the prisoners be negotiable, and for how long will you keep the doors of rehabilitation open? [Asuncion] They have not been or ever can be negotiable. With respect to serving sentences in full, this will be possible when the current legislation is changed. The Spanish Socialist Workers Party has that proposal in its election program, and now we must wait for parliament to decide -- in March, I believe -- on the new penal code. [San Sebastian] Are you personally in favor of this? [Asuncion] I, of course, must carry out my party's programs. [passage omitted]
