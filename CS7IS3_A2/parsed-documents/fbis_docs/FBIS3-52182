This action confirms Western-Jewish plotting against the region and its peoples, resources, and identity. He said that the Vatican's recognition of Israel 500 years after the fall of Granada is a Zionist Jewish victory in the world, particularly in the mother Christian church in Rome. Junblatt added: Perhaps we cannot assess now all implications of this Western-Zionist alliance, but we can say that our Arab identity and our Islamic identity are in danger. Pope John Paul's upcoming visits to Lebanon and occupied Palestine come within this context and cap this alliance. Any other talk about the pope's visit is meaningless. He said: The church leaders in Lebanon--who now advocate human rights, freedom, and other resounding slogans--were mute when Beirut was pounded during the Israeli invasion and when the Lebanese Government signed the 17 May accord with the Israeli Government.
