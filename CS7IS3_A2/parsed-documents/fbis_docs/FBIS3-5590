Gen. Regino Lacson, Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) chief reported yesterday. Lacson said that six guerrilla fronts of the NPA controlled 533 barangays in the three zones last year, adding that these controlled barangays were key "promotion" areas for the NPAs. From these barangays, rebels took "taxation money," rice, livestock, and vegetable crops for their maintenance, Lacson said. They were the single, most important source of income for the rebel movement in the three zones, he added.
