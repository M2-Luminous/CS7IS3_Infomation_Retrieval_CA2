Reacting to a recent statement by General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, that he was not keen to lead hungry, shoeless, and wageless men, Deputy Planning Minister Tomas Salomao said at a news conference yesterday that our country's military expenses could this year take up 45 percent of the General State Budget. He added that each soldier of the future of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, has been allocated a daily sum of 7,200 meticals for his meals. Deputy Planning Minister Tomas Salomo neither confirmed nor denied Gen. Ngonhamo's disclosure that two commanders, two instructors, and [words indistinct] functionaries had been turned out of a hotel in Beira because they had not paid their bills. Minister Salomao simply said that there had been no reason for that to happen because funds will always be made available to cover such expenses. [passage omitted]
