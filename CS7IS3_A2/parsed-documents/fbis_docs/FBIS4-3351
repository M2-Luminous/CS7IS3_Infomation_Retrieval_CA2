In the first half of 1993, the total supply and demand of most materials were roughly in balance and a relatively high growth in total sales could still be maintained. There were three major characteristics in the price changes: First, prices increased monthly, peaking in June. Second, the prices of capital goods [tou zi xing wu zi 2121 6327 7352 3670 6327] rocketed, representing 90 percent of the total price increases. Third, the prices of seven major categories of materials (excepting chemicals) rose by varying degrees. Since July, when the State's macroeconomic regulatory measures were introduced, the shortages of materials have been alleviated and prices have fallen slightly and tended to be stable. What changes will there be in the supply and demand of materials in 1994? What will the trends be? The following are our views: I. The General Situation of Materials Supply and Demand in 1994 First, total demand will not decrease. 1. The macroeconomic regulation and control this time is a structural readjustment and a change in the investment direction and flow volume of capital, not total retrenchment. Therefore, the ultimate demand of the means of production will not decrease. It is only a question of time difference. 2. In 1994, the total demand will grow on the basis of 1993 and the investment scale will not be smaller than in 1993, coupled with such factors as the undampened investment incentive of the localities and the belated effects of macroeconomic regulation and control. Thus, the demand will not decrease considerably in 1994. 3. The infrastructural projects initiated in 1993 constitute a very big demand market and will play an important part in the total demand for materials in 1994. Second, the prices of the means of production will tend to be stable or on the rise. 1. The push from costs keeps the means of production prices high. The continuously increasing costs and lowering profits of productive enterprises prevent product prices from being lowered and this, in turn, keeps the prices of the means of production from plummeting. 2. Prices are influenced by the regulation and control of the state's macroeconomic policy. The fact that one-third of the coal output under unified distribution has had price controls lifted, that the iron and steel industry has resolved the question of "market price and fixed price," and that oil, electricity, and transportation industries have cut rising costs, coupled with the cancellation of the state's mandatory distribution plans for eight types of materials and the removal of all their price controls, will have an influence on the prices of the means of production. 3. The fact that the state is importing large quantities of materials from abroad will cause the prices of some means of production to stabilize and pick up. Third, communications and transportation and capital input are major factors affecting the materials supply-demand balance. Communications and transportation are not developing very quickly at the present time so that ships are too plentiful, ports are inadequate, and traffic congestion has obviously increased. Railway freight transportation in general can only meet less than 70 percent of the total need and in some places, only 40 percent or so. It is also worrying that ports are seriously inadequate for sea transportation. The transportation capacity is so low that it will not improve in the near future and will probably get worse, directly affecting the materials balance across the country which, in turn, will cause price fluctuations everywhere. Despite the fact that China can maintain a strong national economy and has a large demand for the means of production, serious fund shortages will weaken the purchasing, selling, and stocking power of enterprises. China is not only short of renminbi but also of foreign currencies. First, since imported goods have doubly increased, the foreign exchange needed has increased and there are difficulties in pooling foreign exchange. Second, since the foreign exchange supply-demand gap has widened, coupled with the role of the market, the renminbi exchange rates will probably fall and, since the prices of major raw materials on the international market have risen because China bought large quantities of them in the earlier period, the operational risks have increased. Therefore, although a general balance between the supply and demand of materials has been reached, the foundation for the balance is very weak and is restricted by the transportation "bottlenecks" and by the pooling of funds. II. Predictions For Major Materials in 1994 First, there will be coal supply shortages and coal prices will increase. Affected by the changing prices of coal and transportation, and by the cancellation of the preferential policy for market coal, coal prices will rise considerably and the difference between the planned price and outside-the-plan price will continue to narrow. Owing to the inadequate transportation capacity, the difference between coal prices in northern and southern China will become more obvious and coal prices in coastal areas will rise gradually and in a staircase shape. There are two reasons for this: 1. The year 1993 was crucial for the coal industry in curbing losses and this implies that coal prices have entered the stage of substantive increase and that it is an inevitable trend that costs will push up coal prices in eastern and southern coastal areas. 2. The fact that the state will cut back on credit will probably make coal-producing enterprises quicken the recovery of money from sales. The inadequate railway transportation capacity will probably lead to coal shortages and an increase in coal prices. Second, there will be a basic balance in the supply and demand of steel products. Affected by the investment scale and retrenchment, the rising demand for steel products will be weakened. In addition to selling large quantities of hoarded resources, prices will tend to be stable and slightly lower and the decrease in the prices of construction materials will be comparatively obvious. Due to the sudden heating of the machine tools market, steel products for production use tend to be in short supply and market supplies of silicon steel and bearing steel are also in short supply. Their supplies will continue to be inadequate in 1994 and steel products for production use are expected to rise considerably with each tonne fluctuating between 3,000 and 3,500 yuan. The entire price situation is that steel prices are lower in coastal areas and southern China than in inland areas and northern China. Third, there is a shortage of timber resources and prices are consistently high. In 1993, the total timber output was planned at 56.34 million cubic meters but the total demand grew by 23 percent. In the long term, whether domestic or international timber resources, they are inadequate. Moreover, hoping to reduce losses, timber distribution departments in all localities have sold most of their stock at reduced prices with the result that stock has decreased by 20.1 percent, making it more difficult to fill the timber-shortages gap in 1994. In the meantime, affected by world timber shortage and the frantic increases in prices, timber prices in 1994 are expected to be consistently high. Fourth, cement demand will slightly decrease and the price differences between regions are obvious. Because fixed assets investments are being reduced and real estate development is being slowed down, cement demand and supply tends to be stable and prices are decreasing. However, since the state has delegated the power of fixing cement prices to productive enterprises in eastern China, northeastern China, and Hunan, coupled with the shortages of high-grade and special-grade cement in the cement markets and with the drive from the construction projects already launched, supplies will tend to be short in the second half of 1994 and prices will gradually rise. Fifth, nonferrous metals are regulated by the market and their supply and demand are stable. Since the Shanghai Metal Exchange was established, the nonferrous metals market is already linked to the international market and has been developing well on a daily basis. In addition to meeting market demand, nonferrous metal resources also play a role in guiding and stabilizing market prices. In 1994, affected by fund shortages and exchange rates, the domestic nonferrous metals market will not fluctuate very much as a result of the resources shortages and market prices will fall steadily. Sixth, petroleum products will rise steadily. From 1994 onward, the state will only use fuels under the plan in key industries such as the defense industry, fertilizer production, and electricity generation, while oil for other sectors will basically have price controls lifted. In addition, the increased output of Middle East oil and Iraq's restoration of oil exports, strike a balance between oil supply and demand on the international market and oil prices are decreasinging. This is favorable for China to import oil to make up for the shortage of local resources caused by the inadequate transportation capacity. Moreover, affected by the international market, oil prices on China's market will also begin to fall. Therefore, supply and demand in 1994 will be stable in the domestic oil products market and their prices will fluctuate by a small margin. Gasoline prices will remain at the 1993 level but diesel oil prices will increase due to inadequate supplies as the state increases agricultural investment. Seventh, chemical raw materials will be less in demand. Since there is a certain degree of inertia in the growth of the speedily growing light industry, the following trends will appear in the chemical products market in 1994: 1. The supply of chemical products made from grain will become inadequate. The supply-demand contradictions in such chemical products as alcohol glacial acetic acid and acetone will be salient and their prices will be consistently high. 2. The shortage of titanium white powder will affect the entire paint industry. 3. Various types of rubber will continue to be in great demand, especially synthetic rubber. 4. Some products made from calcium carbide will be in great demand. 5. The short supply of methanol and methylamine will be alleviated. 6. The supply of pure benzene, toluene, and dimethylbenzene will be obviously short in some southern areas, while their shortages in other areas will tend not to be alleviated. 7. The market prices of raw materials for plastic production such as high-pressure polyethylene, low-pressure polyethylene, and polypropylene will tend to be lower. 8. Demand in the auto market will be stable while the contradictions in its product mix will be salient. Since the second half of 1993, the cutback on purchases, retrenchment, and funds shortages have checked the excessive expansion of the auto market. In 1994, supply will be slightly greater than demand in the auto market but it will generally tend to develop steadily, competition will be intensified, and the contradictions in the product mix will be very salient. The heavy truck market will be promising, medium-sized trucks will probably sell fairly well, sedan sales will be both gratifying and worrying, deluxe imported sedans will sell comparatively well, the prices of medium- and low-grade trucks will tend to be stable, and some low-grade trucks will be overstocked.
