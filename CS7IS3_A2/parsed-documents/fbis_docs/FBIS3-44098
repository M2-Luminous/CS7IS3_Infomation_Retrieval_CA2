The Volksfront has recently bought 13 steel high- tension masts from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], which it will convert into radio transmission antennas. Its planned FM service will stretch from Hartbeesfontein in the western Transvaal, through the Orange Free State to Bloemfontein, and from there to Upington in the northern Cape. In addition to Radio Pretoria, which is still broadcasting illegally, four radio transmitters were recently set up in the Orange Free State, and a fifth is being built in Bethlehem. According to an Eskom spokesman, the high-tension masts were purchased for 350 rands each, possibly at an auction or by tender.
