At its extraordinary session it examined normative documents for the adoption of the so-called Steppe Code instead of the constitution in operation at present. The mechanism for reworking the republic's legislative basis was approved by 25 parliamentarians who have thus decided the fate of the entire people living on the territory of Kalmykia. Less than two weeks have been assigned for a discussion of the Steppe Code. After it has been adopted, if it is adopted, the republic's supreme legislative organ will be the people's khural, which Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov could dissolve at any moment, considering that it is failing to ensure stability in society.
