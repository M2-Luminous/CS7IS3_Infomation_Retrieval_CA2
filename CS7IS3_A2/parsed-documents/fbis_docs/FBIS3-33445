Carlos Vera Rodriguez ordered Dahik to toe the line and refrain from launching trial balloons after the vice president stated the government is studying the possibility of calling a referendum on topics government spokesmen have not yet disclosed. Vera referred to the burning topic this noon when he hosted a news conference that was broadcast nationwide on a radio network. The minister officially announced his resignation from the post he has held since the start of conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen's government. In announcing that he was stepping down, Vera stated: The president felt a way to resolve the situation my remarks caused was to ask for my resignation, and I immediately agreed. [Begin Vera recording] It is necessary in this country to display constant loyalty and to demonstrate with deeds and renouncements, not just with mellifluous or questionable phrases or poses. It is necessary to etch that word in capital letters; it is necessary. The same applies with the words understanding, friendship, gratitude, and frankness. That is why today when I conclude my work I do so in a manner that should be done--with a president of the caliber of Sixto Duran-Ballen. I begin with my thanks, with a tight summary of results, and my best wishes of good luck. I will later refer to the president's decision to request my resignation and my decision to heed his request immediately. I again begin by thanking him for the confidence and support he gave me by entrusting upon me this responsibility to continue the work of Pedro Zambrano, whose untimely death, which could have been avoided [words indistinct] of Ecuador prompted me to accept this challenge. Before, I had encouraged him to join the task of supporting a new course, something that ultimately cost him his life. I could not help but sacrifice my prestige, comfort, and economy to act according to his struggle and task. [end recording] Vera publicly criticized Vice President Alberto Dahik, who in the last few days announced the government's intention to convene a popular consultation to propose various constitutional reforms. Dahik made the announcement without President Duran-Ballen's authorization, creating a state of confusion within the government and sparking reactions from different sectors in Ecuador. President Duran-Ballen said the issue of a possible plebiscite is only under consideration. Vera said during a news conference: I do not consider it a lack of respect to request respect for a right exclusive to the president. He should be the first to announce such an important matter as a plebiscite. Several papers published today reported that Vera had become a strong Dahik opponent due to the differences between the officials on economic policies. Vera, a 39-year-old reporter, had orchestrated Duran-Ballen's political campaign, which took him to the Ecuadoran presidency for the 1992-96 term. The former information minister also said Leon Herrera, National Radio director, and David Andrade, information under secretary, had placed their post at the executive's disposal. I have asked them to remain in their posts until the new minister replaces them, Vera said, stating he would return to journalism. The government is still undecided about who will replace Vera; therefore, David Andrade, information under secretary, will remain in charge.
