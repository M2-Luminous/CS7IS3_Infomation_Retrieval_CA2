FR940907-2-00093 FR940907-2-00068 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 70&hyph;3070] Louisiana Energy Services, L.P.; Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Claiborne Enrichment Center, Homer, LA Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has published a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (NUREG&hyph;1484) regarding the proposed construction and operation of the Claiborne Enrichment Center to be located near Homer, Louisiana. The FEIS describes and evaluates the potential environmental consequences of granting Louisiana Energy Services, L.P. (LES) a license to construct and operate a uranium enrichment facility. The facility would use the gaseous centrifuge enrichment process. Natural uranium hexafluoride would be used as the feed material, the product would be uranium hexafluoride enriched up to 5 percent in the isotope uranium-235. The FEIS concludes that adverse impacts associated with construction and operation of the facility are small and acceptable and are outweighed by the substantial socioeconomic benefits associated with plant construction and operation. The FEIS also documents the NRC Staff response to comments received on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The FEIS is available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW, Washington, DC and the Local Public Document Room at the Claiborne Parish Library, 901 Edgewood Drive, Homer, Louisiana.

Dated at Rockville, MD, this 29th day of August 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John W.N.
