FBIS4-23435 "drafr108_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 6 Jun South African Press Review for 6 Jun MB0606111094 MB0606111094 BFN [Editorial Report] BUSINESS DAY Bumpy Road -- Given the "huge obstacles" that lie ahead, Labor Minister Tito Mboweni "seems to have identified what needs to be done in the next five years," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 6 June on page 14. He argues "broadly, for a tripartite `social partnership' between government, business and labor -- but one which gives due recognition to the increasingly competitive world economy which South Africa is re-entering" -- "an attempt to create an adequately harmonious system in circumstances which naturally militate against it." But "it may suceed simply because there is no real alternative." "The fragile economy needs a period of consolidation and painful restructuring. Available state resources must be directed at the poorest sections of the population. Tariff barriers must be gradually but surely lowered. The trade-off between job security and wages will become more onerous. For many, the emphasis will be on sacrifice and and deferring the fulfilment of post-apartheid expectations. This will test Mboweni's partnership to the limit." SOWETAN Amnesty -- "It is imperative the Government sets firm principles and guidelines on the issue of amnesty;" Vice President de Klerk granting indemnity and commuting sentences of rightwingers "are bound to add fuel to the fire," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 6 June on page 6. "Pressure on the new Government regarding amnesty is being applied on several fronts": the previous government "seems to have obtained a commitment from the ANC of blanket amnesty for State-inspired crimes up to a certain date" and attempts to draw "the far rightwing" into negotiations may compel the government to extend indemnity to those responsible for the Johannesburg car bombs. "Even more controversial will be amnesty to Chris Hani's killers." "The Government will have to move swiftly on its amnesty plans, including the setting up of a `truth commission', and defuse a potentially explosive situation." Frontline Summit -- "It was appropriate that President Nelson Mandela's first foreign engagement was to attend a summit of Frontline States in Harare last week. It was these states that provided refuge and succour when the apartheid regime forced our liberation organisations and thousands of political refugees into exile," the second editorial in the 6 June SOWETAN states. "Undoubtedly," the new South Africa owes the Frontline States an enormous debt." However the suggestion that the "Frontline club be retained" "needs to be carefully considered" as "a formilised structure could be a costly duplication of other structures like the Southern African Development Community." "The glue in the bonding process among Southern African countries is economic progress" and "it makes more sense to devote resources to what Namibian President Sam Nujoma says is the new struggle against poverty, disease and ignorance." THE CITIZEN Affirmative Action -- "The relaxed mood of the country as a result of the conciliatory speeches and statements of President Mandela may not last much longer. Steps are being taken in various aspects of life to bring into force the government's policies of empowerment, affirmative action and so on," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 3 June on page 6. "There is a plan to place the Defense Ministry under civilain control" and "there is also talk of a complete reorganisation of the South African Police Service." Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] and Transnet [public transportation company] are "already applying affirmative action, which means that Whites are not being taken on but Blacks are. Some government departments are following a similiar line." "Redressing the balance of unemployment by putting Whites out of jobs, or denying them employment, will create the very conditions that will breed White resistance or force Whites to emigrate." "The government should not do anything to upset people, Whites in particular, by making drastic changes that undermine confidence in the spirit of reconciliation or by encouraging discrimination in reverse."
