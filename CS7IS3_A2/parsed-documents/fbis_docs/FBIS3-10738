Today France included Peru on the list of countries authorized to export its products to the French market. A Foreign Ministry press release reported today that the French official newspaper has published information directed to French importers of fishing products, incorporating Peru on the list of nations authorized to sell them their products. The note adds that the French Government has fulfilled the administrative requirement of including Peru on the list of countries permitted to export to their market, as it committed itself on 24 February when it announced it would do so "as soon as possible." On that date, a Peruvian Foreign Ministry note reported that French authorities had communicated to the Peruvian Government that they were taking the necessary steps to fulfill the administrative requirements for publication of the list of accepted Peruvian firms. The French Government said on that occasion that "there is no discrimination" affecting Peruvian fishing products' entry into the French market. On 22 February, it was reported in Lima that France had forbidden the importation of Peruvian hake as a result of French unions' protests demanding protective measures from their government.
