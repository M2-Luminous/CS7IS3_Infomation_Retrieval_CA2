Denktas, who wrote the letter to Clark earlier this week, said he had been "puzzled and surprised" by Clark's remarks at a meeting organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on April 23. The Turkish Cypriot president said he was "disappointed" by Clark's remarks on the following points. The failure to mention the reasons for Turkish intervention: "Naturally, not every one may be aware of the Greek junta led military coup in Cyprus of July 1974 and the discrimination, suppression, and ethnic cleansing which preceded it for eleven years. Also not many would know the legal right of the guarantor powers (Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom) to intervene in Cyprus when the state of affairs established by the international treaties of 1960 creating a bicommunal partnership Republic of Cyprus is violated. Turkey's timely and legitimate intervention in 1974 resulted in the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus and closed the doors for ENOSIS. In the absence of this information, Turkey would be seen as an aggressor and the positive contribution and sacrifice it has been making on the island since 1974 in order to maintain peace and prepare the ground for an overall settlement would not be understood and appreciated. Turkey has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of staying on the island forever and would withdraw its troops within the terms of an overall agreement between the equal communities of the island," Denktas wrote to Clark. The lack of reference to the Greek troops: Denktas reminded Clark that 10,000 Greek troops were present on the island, along with 15,000 National Guard, 10,000 commandos and a 80,000 fully trained reserve force. "Furthermore, no mention was made of the money spent on armaments and the joint Greek/Greek Cypriot side is starting the construction of a Greek naval and air base in the south while expenditure on arms and armament have reached a record high," Denktas said in the letter. Stress on size, rather than political equality: In his letter, Denktas also criticized Clark for his reference to the Turkish Cypriot community "that constitutes roughly 20 percent of the population on the island." "(This) does not take account of the fact that the criteria for political equality of constituent communities is not the arithmetic size or proportion of their respective populations," Denktas said. "The equal political status of the two communities is a well established fact and forms the very basis of the current mission of good offices of the UN secretary-general. As such, your emphasis on the proportion of the Turkish Cypriot population and not its politically equal constituent was very unfortunate." In a similar vein with the letter sent to Clark, Denktas also sent an open message to the world announcing the collapse of talks on the confidence-building measures. "Not because of any fault of ours but because certain things were done which upset the balance between the two parties, which upset what we had agreed to do and changed the complete picture," Denktas said. Denktas said a new map was introduced to the Turkish Cypriot side. "We cannot say yes to this map because (the new map) trespassed into our number one security area," he said, referring to the closed town of Varosha.
