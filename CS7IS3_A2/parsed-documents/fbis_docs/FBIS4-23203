While at Rusumo, President Kanyarengwe was interviewed for one and a half hours by correspondents from Radio France International, Radio Burundi, Radio Tanzania, and Tanzanian newspapers, among others. Our Muhabura correspondent [name indistinct], was also present. To the first question, concerning when the RPF would set up a government, President Kanyarengwe said that the war was continuing, but that the warring armies were going to meet to work out how to solve the problem of war. He said that in case the negotiations failed, the RPF would carry on with the war and capture the town of Kigali, as well as the entire country, and would then establish leadership. President Kanyarengwe said that the RPF would cooperate with those parties that stood for democracy in Rwanda and that it could not recognize the government of Kambanda and Sindikubwabo. Concerning the war, President Kanyarengwe said the RPF forces were doing well. He said that they controlled more than half of Rwanda, and occupied important points in Kigali. On the contributions of our neighboring countries to stop the war in Rwanda, President Kanyarengwe first thanked the countries that had accepted refugees, and the international community, which continues to support us. He called upon Zaire and Tanzania to continue their mediation efforts. He also indicated that a meeting had been called by Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and that it would take place in Tanzania. In short, he said, all the neighboring countries were helping us, and urged them to continue doing so. The journalists wished to know if the Arusha agreements were still useful. President Kanyarengwe said the Arusha agreements would continue to be a crucial basis, especially with regard to the establishment of a leadership based on law, democracy, the unity of Rwandans, justice, and other priciples. Concerning justice, the agreement would ensure the punishment of all murderers. Correspondents also asked questions about intertribal relations in Rwanda. President Kanyarengwe said that the tribal question was just a pretext leaders use to manipulate the people, so that they could continue to cling to power, kill innocent people, and misinform the international community about Rwanda's real problems. President Kanyarengwe said the real problems of Rwanda were essentially political, because a clique wanted to grab the leadership and victimize innocent people. [passage omitted] The journalists are also reported to have visited the Nyarubuye parish, where they saw an unbelievable number of bodies -- more than 20,000 of them. They were reportedly tongue-tied. [passage omitted]
