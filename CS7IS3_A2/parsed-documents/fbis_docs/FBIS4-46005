Raizada] [Text] India's missile program is primarily intended for defense of country's freedom, especially in light of the countries having missiles that can carry both nuclear and nonnuclear warheads surrounding India. As a sovereign country, surely India, like any other country, has the right to defend its freedom and territorial integrity. India was forced to develop missiles when it saw that both Pakistan and China, as well as a number of West Asian countries, are having missiles and missile technology either indigenously developed or clandestinely or openly imported from the Western world. During his recent visit to the United States, the Indian prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has in a very polite but firm way explained that those who advise others must practice a similar advice themselves. India had been in favor of elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and had been advocating at all international forums the need to keep the world free from nuclear and chemical weapons. But India cannot close its eyes to the latest weaponry available with its immediate neighbors that exposes all its cities to the target of the missile. Of all the countries, America, [which] has been carrying relentless campaign against India's missile program, knows fully well that both Pakistan and China not only have technology, but also have deployed missiles around India. The talk of South Asia to be kept away from all missiles becomes fruitless without capping Chinese missile program and arsenal and without keeping Indian Ocean free of missiles deployed by the United States under one cover or the other. The U.S. ambassador designate to India, Mr. Frank Wisner, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last Tuesday [24 May] that United States hoped that India would consider very carefully before deploying short-range Prithvi missile. In a rather one go, he said the United States continues to argue in a reasoned manner with India about the consequences of missile deployment. Supplying F-16's to Pakistan for carrying nuclear weapons on one side and dealing with China with a different tone while threatening India to scuttle its missile and space technology program does not speak the language of a friend. Whether America likes Prithvi or not, India need not bother. What India has to see is its own security perceptions. No arrangement for preventing the danger of nuclear weapons in South Asia without including China would even work as India's concern about Chinese nuclear weapons is not without justification, which Mr. Wisner has himself admitted. The double standards of Clinton administration with regard to the deployment of ballistic missiles especially when China is busy in the modernization of its Armed Forces and Pakistan is deploying Hatf and M-11 missiles is not what is expected from the United States. One wonders why the U.S. did not object when Saudi Arabia deployed its short-range missiles during the Gulf War, nor did it get up in arms when Chinese M-11 missiles were sent to Pakistan. India also cannot afford to forget the threat wielded by America in 1971 when the U.S. had moved its Seventh Fleet carrying nuclear weapons in the Bay of Bengal. Before leaving for the U.S. early this month, the prime minister assured the nation that neither the usual trials nor deployment of Prithvi missile would be derailed whatever U.S. may desire. The statement of the U.S. ambassador designate to India at the congressional confirmation hearing, [which] is virtually a sort of warning to India of the likely consequences should the Prithvi be deployed, appears not to have impressed policy makers in India. Because whatever may be the U.S. stand, India has its own security perceptions and would naturally be guided by its own stand rather than by that of the U.S. India situated in a missile-proliferated environment and its defense forces, both Army and Air Force, has been looking forward to match the arsenals of the neighbors so that it can defend itself in case of any exigency. Indeed, the Indian [word indistinct] statement just prior to prime minister's U.S. visit left nothing for imagination. For, the billions of dollars flowed from U.S. to India or not, India must have its prestige intact and not allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs. Prithvi must be tested and the work of Agni resumed. P.V. [Narasimha Rao] assured its people that India is sovereign in taking decisions and India will not compromise with its self-esteem and security concerns.
