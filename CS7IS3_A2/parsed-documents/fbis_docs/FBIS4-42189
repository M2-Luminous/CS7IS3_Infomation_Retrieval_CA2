This Community initiative aims to ensure the equitable international sharing of the financial burden represented by the closure of the Chernobyl power station and the parallel construction of (two) new nuclear power plants. The EU acknowledges that the problem of the closure of the Chernobyl station is a top priority from the standpoint of closer relations with Ukraine and that the question of this republic's energy supply also deserves to be considered at the earliest opportunity. It is in this spirit that the Commission has suggested that the EU, as part of an internationally coordinated effort: - Aid Ukraine to finalize the construction in progress of two new power stations, as long as Kiev agrees to eventually shut down Chernobyl; - Accept, given Kiev's point of view that Chernobyl cannot be closed before other new stations are operational, that the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] programme help finance essential safety improvements and the subsequent closure operations; - Agree to take over part of the construction cost of new stations in the form of a EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] loan, Ukraine being eligible to receive such loans following the Council decision of 21 March. According to the Commission, funding possibilities by this means currently total a little more than ECU1 billion (for all the Member States and third countries). The work of the Committee of Permanent Representatives resulted in the following guidelines, which were subsequently confirmed by the Council: (a) more comprehensive study is still essential in order to evaluate the extent of the financing needed for the closure of Chernobyl and the scope and urgency of Ukraine's energy supply needs. In this regard, several Member States highlight the need for this country to adopt a global energy strategy; (b) with regard to principles, several Member States are of the view that, instead of favouring the construction of new power plants, it would be better to encourage Ukraine to develop the rational use of energy and alternative energy sources. This point of view is not shared in full by the Commission, which, based on Kiev's view that this construction is imperative due to the urgency of ensuring the country's energy autonomy, considers that it would be unrealistic to envisage short-term solutions in another direction, which could also call into question the very objective of the shutdown of Chernobyl; (c) with regard to the possible financing of new power stations through a EURATOM loan, the Twelve consider that it is vital to examine whether the financial conditions for the use of such a loan (risk, guarantees, etc.) are acceptable, keeping in mind that, due to the amounts involved, an important part of the available funding would thus be mobilized for Ukraine alone. Moreover, Coreper [Committee of Permanent Representatices of the Council] has pointed out that if the EC decides to launch a new international initiative and to use the EURATOM loan in this context, the loan would involve high amounts and would imply a corresponding guarantee provision in the Community budget; (d) since this matter involves TACIS financing of safety improvements and of the subsequent closure of Chernobyl, Coreper has voiced doubts about the sufficiency of available funds for this purpose. Moreover, the question of the applicability of TACIS regulations has also been raised, as some Member States have pointed out that it would be advisable for TACIS to contribute to the building of a "sarcophagus" and the supply of equipment. The idea of intervention by the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] Nuclear Safety Fund was also suggested. The problem of Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy supply is fundamental but is only one aspect of the action envisaged by the European Union in regard to this country. Also at issue are the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the eventual link between this signature and Ukraine's adherence to the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as well as specific support for Ukraine's agriculture.
