These results, which add 39 more renewalist delegates in Madrid and 14 in Leon, do not change the percentages achieved in the rest of Spain in the previous week, which put the Guerraists at 30 percent, as against 70 percent for renewalists and integrationists, but they leave the force of Alfonso Guerra's supporters to the federations of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Aragon, and Extremadura, with, moreover, a renewalist presence in the five federations, and in the last-mentioned federation with an explicit pledge by Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra, its secretary general and autonomous government premier, to support integration or, what is the same thing, the presence of Guerra and Guerraism in the future Executive Committee, but to vote for Felipe Gonzalez' list, even if integration is not finally achieved. These facts and the loss of their traditional fief -- Andalusia, where they have had a big failure -- greatly limit the Guerraists' ability to pressure the secretary general in order to force him to reach agreement on the new leadership with Alfonso Guerra. This is despite the fact that in the official count the Guerraists claim 35 percent of the party members' votes, which is more than they are granted by the renewalists, who insist that the supporters of the party's current number two total well below one-third. Complicated Alliance Nevertheless, the Guerraists have seen their support in the Madrid Socialist Federation strengthened, and have won over 48 percent of the grassroots votes, albeit with a complicated alliance with some renewalists disagreeing with Secretary General Teofilo Serrano and under the last-minute leadership of former mayor of Madrid Juan Barranco, who enjoys considerable popularity in the party. But Guerra's supporters themselves bear in mind that one and a half years ago they were credited with -- and they themselves claimed -- a strength below 30 percent in their federation. In Leon, where one of the dirtiest battles with a view to the federal congress has taken place, with alleged irregular memberships, objections to the census, and investigations by the Federal Executive Committee, the renewalists eventually triumphed with 63 percent of the votes, which gives them 75 percent of the representation at the March congress, with 14 delegates, as against the five Guerraists. As the surprises of the past few weeks -- especially in Andalusia and Murcia -- have confirmed, renewal has been gradually gaining supporters among the members, especially since Felipe Gonzalez made some gestures which were interpreted in that direction, such as, for instance, taking the Executive Committee to a vote, which he won, for Carlos Solchaga's appointment as parliamentary group chairman, or the designation of a government, following the election, in which he placed no Guerraist. Gonzalez' recent statements, in which he expressed his support for Guerra's remaining deputy secretary general, and in which he called for trust to be placed in him to form the Executive Committee, also contributed to this. In some renewalists' opinion, these two interventions deprived of arguments the Guerraists' line, based on the assertion that their internal opponents wished to exclude the number two from the Executive Committee, because of which they were demanding support to sit Gonzalez down with Guerra in order to reach agreement on the new party leadership's makeup.
