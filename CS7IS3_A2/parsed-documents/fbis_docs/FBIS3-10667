Robaina and accompanying delegation will also visit India, Malaysia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as reported during a news conference at Jose Marti Airport minutes before takeoff today. The foreign minister said one of the purposes of the trip is to learn of the economic results that are being achieved in many of these countries. We also intend to explain the goal of our project, bearing in mind the difficult situation we are facing, he said. There is not only curiosity in the Asian nations about what we are doing, but we are also very interested in finding out what they are doing, because Cuba not only has to explain its situation but has to listen as well, the Cuban minister said. He also said in addition to its needs, Cuba has useful things to share with other countries. He explained he does not intend to sign specific economic agreements, because the fundamental mission is to expand and open up opportunities for cooperation. Among the topics to be discussed with the different governments are the role that can be played by the nonaligned nations, especially during its next foreign ministers conference scheduled to take place in Cairo in late May. In addition, the Cuban foreign minister denied press reports of an alleged expulsion of Cuban diplomats from Canada, and he said the island will not close down its mission in that country; "there will only be a rotation of personnel working there." He also announced Luis Suarez, America Research Center director, will attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new Chilean president, Eduardo Frei. The Chilean authorities did not send an invitation to the Cuban Government and instead sent it to four individuals, among them Suarez. Asked about the meeting scheduled to be held in April between Cuban authorities and the exiled community abroad, he said a list of participants, which will be publicized during the next few weeks, is being drafted. In this regard, he recited the exclusion of those whose attitude does not correspond with the "parameters of nonaggression and nonhysteria." "Those who did not even expect an invitation and have already replied (negatively)" will be excluded. As for the latter, he said "if they replied without being invited, it is because they understand the message is not for them." The Cuban Government announced recently a Nation and Emigration Conference scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April, during which Cuban emigrants interested in the normalization of ties with the country will participate. Concerning a possible visit to Spain, he said it will possibly occur in May but that a reply from the Spanish Foreign Ministry was needed. Robaina visited the PRC in June 1993, and he visited eight Caribbean countries in late November. He also visited Mexico and Colombia. The Cuban foreign minister also toured five African countries in January of this year.
