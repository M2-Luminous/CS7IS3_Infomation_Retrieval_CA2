The meeting was attended on the Romanian side by National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and presidential counselors [Colonel General] Vasile Ionel and Traian Chebeleu. In a statement made to the press after his meeting with President Iliescu, the Russian minister noted that "we agreed that our economic relations could be improved and enlarged, and this may only be achieved if the prime ministers of Romania and Russia meet in the very near future. We had a political dialogue with Mr. Iliescu, during which I briefed your president on the political situation in our country, on the actions taken both by the [Russian] government and President Yeltsin to solve various domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as on the stage reached in the reform. I asked President Iliescu whether he has a message to be conveyed to President Yeltsin, and he very clearly replied that Romania wishes to cooperate more closely with Russia and that he wishes to meet President Yeltsin as early as this year. As a matter of fact, Russia's intentions are identical, in the sense that it also wishes to strengthen relations between our countries, as from a certain moment those relations have unfortunately become looser. Together with President Iliescu we also touched on the issue of the Partnership for Peace. We share a number of views: The Partnership ought to be based on the principles of equality among its members, there should not be any teachers and pupils, there should be a basic balance and mutual advantage, and all European states, under equitable conditions for all, should be involved in the ensuring of their joint security."
