The envoy, Foreign Ministry director general for Mid East-North African affairs, Hojjat ol-Eslam Kazem Khonsari, said the Zionist regime's plots were not restricted to Lebanon alone but were aimed at all nations of the region. He said the Lebanese people have the right to defend themselves against the Zionist regime. Khonsari denounced the abduction of Mustafa Dirani on May 21 by Zionist troops and said the silence of international circles against this latest act of state terrorism indicates their helplessness vis-a-vis the United States. Dirani the leader of Lebanon's Momena (Faithful) movement, was kidnapped from his home in Ba'labaakk by a helicopter-borne team of Zionist commandos. Meanwhile, Lebanese daily AL-NAHAR wrote in its Tuesday's edition that Khonsari's visit is aimed to bring calm to Lebanon and called it an effort to end the Zionists aggressions on Lebanon. The daily said that in his meeting with Lebanese officials, the Iranian envoy underlined the need for coordination between the Lebanese Government and Islamic resistance at such a crucial juncture.
