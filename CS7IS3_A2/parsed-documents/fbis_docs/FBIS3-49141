Fur said there is a valid measure which he wishes to observe, whereby soldiers reaching the age of 55 should be pensioned off. This rule will affect three or four generals until by the time of the elections. The minister did not mention names, however, Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, commander of the Hungarian Army, will turn 55 in February, 1994. A decision on relieving him will be made by the president of the republic, on proposal by the minister of defence, as is set down in the Defence Law which came into force on January 1. The new Defence Law also sets down that one person can fulfil the positions of commander and chief of staff. Observers believe that Lieutenant-General Janos Deak, the current chief of staff of the Hungarian Army, would fulfil these two functions in the future.
