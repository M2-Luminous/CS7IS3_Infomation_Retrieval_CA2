Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary Commission on International Affairs, said such pressure, which came from Russia and the United States, could only give a better chance to radicals at the March 1994 parliamentary election. "If we're talked to from a position of strength, the only result will be that we'll want to defend ourselves," he told reporters in Kiev. Ukraine is a sovereign state, "and we won't go on our knees before anyone, not even before the president of America," he said, commenting on a statement by a White House spokesman, who said on January 5 that U.S.-Ukrainian relations would remain at their present low level until Ukraine met all its nuclear disarmament commitments. Pavlychko said the United States was mainly interested in Russia, with which Ukraine would, however, find "common language." "We have lived together and will continue to live together," he said.
