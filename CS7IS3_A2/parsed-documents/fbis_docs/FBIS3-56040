Interfax learned this from the leader of the Agrarian faction, Mikhail Lapshin. According to him, in the near future his faction intends to prompt the State Duma to demand that the government pay its debts to the farmers under its last year's commitments, "in view of the catastrophic situation in farming." According to the farmers' calculations, the government owes them about one and a half trillion rubles, Lapshin said. "The situation in the countryside is very hard, and it will become simply catastrophic, unless we give the industry financial support by the coming spring," he stressed. With reference to the problem of electing the State Duma speaker, Lapshin said: The Agrarian faction believes that his candidacy should be considered in a package with his deputies. Lapshin thinks that if a representative of small factions is elected as speaker, his four deputies should be elected from the four biggest factions: Russia's Choice, the Agrarians, the Communists and the Liberal Democrats. According to Lapshin, the fifth deputy should be elected from a faction of independent deputies or from the representatives of autonomies. He confirmed that his faction still intended to propose Ivan Rybkin for the post of the speaker or one of his deputies. According to Lapshin, at 16:00 on Wednesday the leaders of all parliamentary factions are to meet in the State Duma building to reach a final agreement on the candidacy of the speaker and his deputies.
