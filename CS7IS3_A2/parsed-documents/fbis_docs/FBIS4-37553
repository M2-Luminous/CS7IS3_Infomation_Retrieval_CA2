However, instead of promoting the process of reconciliation in the Middle East, Iran supports the Islamic resistance fighters of the Hizballah in southern Lebanon who are firing Katyusha missiles against Israel. [Velayati] The behavior of the Hizballah and of the "Palestinian group" are two completely different things. The Hizballah is a Lebanese organization. It defends its country, whose southern part is occupied. Resistance against this occupation is legitimate. [DER SPIEGEL] Yet it also support the Palestinian underground organization Hamas; Israel's and the PLO's most dangerous opponent. [Velayati] We have practically not taken any measures against the PLO. We only said from the very beginning that this agreement will not solve Palestine's problems. What was the result of the agreement? 'Arafat will become mayor of Gaza, but that is it. What process should we promote? [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be about time for Iran to recognize Israel? [Velayati] Israel is an usurpatory regime that we do not recognize. [DER SPIEGEL] Is Iran not pretending to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians themselves? [Velayati] First 'Arafat should prove that he is the representative of all Palestinians -- which he is not. [DER SPIEGEL] Even Syria holds negotiations with the Israeli archenemy on a "real and comprehensive peace." [Velayati] That's Syria's business. However, as far as we know, the peace talks are stalled. Syria refuses to continue negotiations with Israel. To exert pressure on Damascus, Israel attacked Lebanon again recently. [DER SPIEGEL] However, if Syria and Lebanon, which depends on Syria, make peace with Israel, the days of the Hizballah are numbered -- or the fighters for God would have to rise against the Lebanese and the Syrian Armies. [Velayati] Hizballah's prospects for a political future are good. As a party, it even bears responsibility in the Lebanese Government and enjoys a great deal of support. For this reason, the Hizballah will not fight against the Lebanese Government. [DER SPIEGEL] In Yemen, too, where the fundamentalist north and the socialist south are engaged in a fierce battle, Iran is allegedly fomenting unrest. It is reportedly supplying North Yemen's President Salih 'Ali 'Abdallah with weapons. [Velayati] We do not support either side. Our principle is: First, the unity of the country should be preserved, and, second, the conflict should be settled peacefully. [DER SPIEGEL] Yet South Yemen has reported Iranian fighter aircraft in the north. [Velayati] This is simply not true. [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Islamic-conservative north is closer to Iran. [Velayati] No, we are interested in all Yemenis, who are one people and one nation -- like the Germans. [DER SPIEGEL] The West -- and the Arab states -- are concerned about continued Iranian efforts to export its Islamic revolutionary model, thus causing additional unrest in the Middle East region. [Velayati] These accusations are not justified. We do not export our revolution with the use of force. [DER SPIEGEL] Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan or in Algeria are boasting that they have been trained and supplied with weapons by Tehran for their armed fight against lay and pro-Western regimes. [Velayati] I reject this allegation vehemently. Instead of exporting violence, we are trying to cooperate with our neighbors and promote economic cooperation in the region. [DER SPIEGEL] You have even established contact with your long-time war enemy, Iraq. You will shortly travel to Baghdad for talks. [Velayati] We want to have good relations with all our neighbors, including Iraq. If Saddam Husayn is president -- this is none of our business. We will not interfere. [DER SPIEGEL] Four officials of the Kurdish party banned in Iran were killed in Berlin in October 1992 by a killer commando. The secret service of your government is believed to be behind the attack. [Velayati] This is not true. We vehemently reject this accusation. [DER SPIEGEL] In the so-called Mykonos trial, the federal public prosecutor described Tehran as the mastermind of the operation and accused your government of state terrorism. [Velayati] This is his business. It is our task to support Iranian citizens who are facing trial abroad. After all, Iran is their home country. However, there is no link between these people and our government. [DER SPIEGEL] Above all, extremists like Ayatollah Mohtashemi are believed to promote the export of terrorism. Has the more Western-oriented head of state 'Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani lost the fight against the radicals in his own ranks? [Velayati] Everybody can have his own political ideas and he is allowed to express them. However, our government makes the decisions in foreign policy. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a very powerful head of state.
