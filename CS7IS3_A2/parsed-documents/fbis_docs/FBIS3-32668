At the same time, the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) is continuing its diplomatic offensive by forwarding letters to various social organizations. The community of Altamirano, 850 km southeast of Mexico City and one of the four communities attacked by the EZLN in the wake of its 1 January offensive, remains virtually occupied by the Armed Forces. Cording to an official communique, however, the Armed Forces intend to simply maintain a garrison at the entrance of the community. Most people in Altamirano who do not have to work remain indoors most of the time and prefer to keep their opinions on the conflict to themselves. During a brief tour of the community, soldiers supported by jeeps and tanks could be seen on every street. Also, heightened security measures are in effect in the nearby mountainous area where it is believed the Zapatist presence is the strongest. Since the conflict began, the Mexican Army has maintained some 17,000 soldiers at its primary base in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas. As of 15 January when a truce was declared, the Army gradually started to withdraw from the towns of San Cristobal, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas, and it has set up checkpoints at the entrance of each of these communities. Yesterday, the Army increased the number of troops at the fork in the road leading to Ranch Nuevo and Ocosingo. Ocosingo is an access point into the Lacandona jungle, which is a Zapatist stronghold. Meanwhile, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and national reconciliation; Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas; and more than 300 journalists are still awaiting a possible meeting with the EZLN. The meeting was postponed several times over the past week. In his Sunday homily today, Bishop Samuel Ruiz reiterated that famine is the most serious problem facing the Chiapas Indians who, according to official figures, total 1 million. While waiting for the meeting between the Zapatists and the government to take place, Camacho Solis is maintaining contact with the EZLN by way of confidential letters. Meanwhile, the EZLN also is sending messages to other intermediators. The meeting between the EZLN and the government is expected to take place in a Chiapas community which has yet to be determined.
