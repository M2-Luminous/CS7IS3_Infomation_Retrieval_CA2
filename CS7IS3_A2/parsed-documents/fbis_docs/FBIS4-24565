The statement urges the DPRK to replace the fuel rods of its 5-megawatt reactor "in a manner that preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements" as required by the IAEA. The statement also urges IAEA inspectors to stay in the DPRK to monitor the 5 megawatt-reactor. Speaking during the UNSC consultations, Li Zhaoxing, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, pointed out: Because of their joint efforts, all parties concerned have achieved a series of successes in handling the DPRK nuclear issue. These hard-earned successes should be cherished. Certain problems have now appeared with regard to the refueling of the 5 megawatt-reactor, we hope the IAEA and the Koreans will continue their consultations on the technical measures for monitoring the refueling and make efforts to reach agreements as early as possible. Li Zhaoxing reiterated China's stand on this issue, saying that the fundamental way to settle the DPRK nuclear issue is by dialogue and negotiations through channels that have been established. He said: China does not endorse any action that may exacerbate contradictions. As a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, China, as always, does not support or encourage nuclear proliferation. He said: "We have been looking forward to a proper solution to the DPRK nuclear issue through proper channels so that peace and stability can be maintained in the Korean peninsula and so that there will be a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. We are ready to make continual efforts to attain this goal."
