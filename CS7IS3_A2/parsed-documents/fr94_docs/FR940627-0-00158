In vivo assays: Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE), Chromosomal Aberrations (CA), Micronucleus (MN), Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS). In vitro or microbial assays: E. coli Reverse Mutation, DNA Repair, Yeast Mutation, Yeast Mitotic Recombination, Mouse Lymphoma, CHO/V79 Mutation, UDS, CA, SCE, Cell Transformation. Mutagenicity Salmonella assay and in vivo Micronucleus assay Salmonella assay plus one in vivo assay MN, Dominant Lethal Assay, CA, Heritable Translocation Assay, Specific Locus Assay. Teratogenicity T2 fertility/teratology assessment with 90-day exposure FDA/Phase II (gd6&hyph;15) Study If fetal effects analysis is included: Two-generation study, Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB), One-generation study. Adult reproductive effects T2 fertility/teratology assessment with 90-day exposure T2 fertility/teratology assessment with 90-day exposure Two-generation study, Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB), One-generation study. Neurotoxicity GFAP assay and neuro-histopathology with 90-day exposure GFAP assay and neuro-histopathology with 90-day exposure Detailed characterization of neurotoxicity using behavior, neurophysiological, and/or neurochemical assessments (e.g., EPA Neurotoxicity Assessment). Pulmonary effects T2 respiratory tract pathology after 90-day exposure T2 respiratory tract pathology after 90-day exposure Chronic toxicity study, with or without lifetime cancer study; subchronic toxicity study.
