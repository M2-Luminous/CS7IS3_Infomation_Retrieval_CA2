We in the UK have been active in our support for liberalization of the energy market in the European Union because we recognize that competitive forces are needed to reduce costs and improve the competitiveness of European industry. We have therefore been disappointed at the slow progress which has been made on the European Commission's efforts to establish an open internal market in energy. ``The Commission's proposal under discussion at present represents the first step on the road to liberalization. I do not underestimate the magnitude of the change which moving to a competitive environment will mean for many countries. And it will take time to carry out the restructuring needed. It is therefore imperative that we make the start now and redouble our efforts to reach agreement. ``Because we all have so much to gain from liberalization, I would like to take this opportunity to allay some of the fears which have been expressed about opening up energy markets to competition. I have heard it said that it will deter long-term, large-scale investment by increasing uncertainty and thereby risk. But our experience in the UK has proved quite the reverse. Since 1989 investment in generation has almost trebled in real terms. And investment in transmission is four times what it was before privatisation. ``Some also claim that national electricity systems must be controlled and planned, otherwise they will become unstable with wild swings between over-supply and under-supply. Again quite the opposite has happened in the UK. The system is better balanced than it was before with a more diverse range of primary fuels being used in generation. The move towards gas fired generation, which is so often portrayed by critics as an unwelcome effect of privatisation has in fact played a major part in bringing about the present diversity of the system. ``And with diversity comes increased security of supply. If European electricity networks were opened up and we had a true single energy market this security through diversity could be available to everyone. ``In the 40 years since this congress was last held in the UK, electricity supply in this country has been through a period of growth and more recently a period of major structural and management change. We are proud of what has been achieved here and are eager to share our experience. In a world of increasingly open markets, liberalization in the energy sector has much to offer.''
