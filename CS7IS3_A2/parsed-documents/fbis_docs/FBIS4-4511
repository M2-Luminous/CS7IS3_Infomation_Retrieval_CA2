The measure was certified urgent by Malacanang [presidential office]. Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies, stressed that liberalization would allow the Philippines to join the global economy and give the country access to foreign funds development and opportunities opened by present international market conditions. "When the whole world is making the globe smaller; when NAFTA is being organized; when the European common market have become one; when ASEAN is trying to assert its proper leadership in the economic development of the Pacific Area, are we in the Philippines going to be alone and be left behind by all these developments?" Roco said. The approved bill (Senate Bill 1606), entitled "An Act Liberalizing the Entry and Scope of Operations of Foreign Banks in the Philippines," allows a total of six foreign banks to enter the Philippine banking system within a period of five years to foster greater competition in the industry. The president may recommend two more banks. In the bill, foreign banks will be allowed to enter through any one of the three modes namely: -- By acquiring, purchasing, or owning up to 60 percent of the voting stock of an existing bank; -- By investing up to 60 percent of the voting stock of a new banking subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the Philippines; or, -- By establishing branches with full banking authority. Foreign banks will be allowed to bring in not more than three branches with a capital requirement of P [Philippine pesos] 300 million. For every branch in addition to the three (sub-branch), P50 million shall be added to the permanently assigned capital. Assigned capitals shall be inwardly remitted and converted into Philippine currency. Roco stressed that foreign banks that would establish branches in the Philippines would give the country access to global resources of the mother company. "That is principle of the liberalization." Apart from increasing competition, Roco added that liberalization would equalize ownership in Filipino banks. At present, Filipino groups can only own 20 to 30 percent, while foreigners can own up to 40 percent. The bill contains a provision that allows a foreign bank or a Philippine corporation to own up to 60 percent of the voting stock of only one domestic bank or a new banking subsidiary. One of the guidelines for approving a foreign bank application is ensuring that reciprocity rights are enjoyed by Philippine banks in the applying foreign banks' country. The Monetary Board, which is the approving body, is given other guidelines such as: -- Ensuring geographic representation; -- Considering strategic, trade and investment relationships between the Philippines and the country of incorporation of the foreign bank; and, -- Study the demontation for financial innovations and stability in a competitive environment of the applicant. [sentence as published] Only those among the top 100 banks in the world or the top three banks in the country of origin shall be allowed to enter. He said it was time for the Philippine banking industry to share the profits with the Filipino people. At present the banking industry, despite being the most profitable in the past 15 years, gave only 3 or 4 percent interest in deposits while charging 20 to 23 percent interest in borrowing. "The liberalization will foster greater competition in the banking industry in attracting depositors," said Roco.
