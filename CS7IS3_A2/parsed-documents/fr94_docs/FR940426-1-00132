FR940426-1-00132 FR940426-1-00016 Depending on which of the two basic methods is used to account for a business combination, substantial differences in financial statements result. A business combination may be appropriately accounted for in the foreign issuer's primary financial statements by retroactive restatement at combined historical cost using accounting standards of the foreign jurisdiction, whereas, the same transaction would be accounted for as a purchase (fair value recognition at acquisition date) under U.S. GAAP. There currently is a requirement to quantify the effects on the financial statements of these two different methods of accounting for a business combination. This requirement has resulted in significant additional recordkeeping requirements, as well as complex and voluminous reconciling disclosures. The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement that foreign private issuers quantify the effects of differences arising solely from the different criteria applied to the selection of the basic method of accounting for a business combination if the criteria used in the primary financial statements for determining the method are consistently applied and are consistent with IAS 22. However, the effects of differences in the procedures used to implement either the purchase or pooling of interests methods of accounting would continue to be quantified under the proposed amendment. For example, in applying the purchase method, if the amounts included in the primary financial statements did not assign the same fair value to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as would be determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the difference would need to be addressed in the reconciliation. Under the proposed rule, a business combination which would be deemed a uniting of interests under IAS 22 and which was accounted for using that basic method in the primary financial statements may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a pooling of interests, with quantification required only to the extent that the procedures used in the primary financial statements differ from the procedures required under U.S. GAAP for a pooling of interests. Similarly, a business combination which would be deemed an acquisition under IAS 22 and which was accounted for using that basic method in the primary financial statements may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a purchase, with quantification required only to the extent that the procedures used in the primary financial statements differ from the procedures required under U.S. GAAP for a purchase. The proposal would not reduce the quality or comparability of financial information furnished to investors to a material extent, while the cost and burden of a foreign issuer's filing with the Commission would be substantially reduced. The Commission believes the IAS criteria to be well defined, reasonable, and sufficiently clear to ensure consistent application. It is expected that nearly all combinations that would be accounted for as purchases under U.S. GAAP would be deemed acquisitions under IAS 22. Some combinations that could qualify as pooling of interests under U.S. GAAP, however, will be deemed acquisitions under IAS 22, and some of the extremely few transactions that will qualify as uniting of interest under IAS 22 may be deemed purchases under U.S. GAAP. Comment is requested as to whether foreign private issuers should continue to quantify differences arising solely from differences in the criteria used to select the method of accounting for business combinations; whether certain forms or types of combinations (e.g., promoter transactions, leveraged buy-outs) should be excluded from the relief afforded by the proposed rule, and, if so, which ones; and whether consistency in application in the primary financial statements of the criteria for determination of the method of accounting should be, as is proposed, a condition of the relief granted under the rule. Comment also is requested regarding the need to quantify effects of differences in the procedures followed under the two basic methods of accounting. II. Accounting for Goodwill and Negative Goodwill In a business combination accounted for as a purchase or acquisition, the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, reduced by the fair value of the liabilities assumed, is deemed ``goodwill.'' If the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the cost, ``negative goodwill'' arises. Goodwill and negative goodwill are accounted for differently under U.S. GAAP and IAS 22. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill or negative goodwill must be amortized over its useful life except that the amortization period may not exceed forty years. Under IAS 22, goodwill or negative goodwill must be amortized over a period not exceeding five years, unless a longer period, not exceeding twenty years, can be justified. The effects of the differences in amortization periods should be sufficiently transparent that investors would be able to understand and compare financial results and condition company to company, and the acceptance of the amortization period in IAS 22 will ease the burden for foreign private issuers filing with the Commission. Accordingly, under the proposals, foreign private issuers that have consistently applied accounting policies which amortize goodwill and negative goodwill over periods which comply with the amended guidance in IAS 22, but which differ from the periods that would be permitted under U.S. GAAP, would not be required to quantify the effects of that difference in the reconciliation. In determining the amount of goodwill and negative goodwill that is subject to amortization for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, foreign private issuers would continue to be required to consider all other provisions of purchase accounting under U.S. GAAP. Issuers that write-off goodwill or negative goodwill directly to equity would need to record goodwill and the related amortization expense in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. Comment is requested regarding the appropriateness of accepting the provisions of IAS 22 with respect to the amortization period of goodwill and negative goodwill. Comment also is requested as to whether additional disclosures should be required, such as the useful life determined in accordance with US GAAP. III. Transitional Provisions IAS 22, as amended in 1993 becomes operative for financial statements covering periods beginning on or after January 1, 1995 with retroactive application encouraged but not required. The Commission believes that conformance with IAS 22, or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, is necessary for all periods to provide investors with adequate information. The accounting should be consistently applied with respect to all business combinations that would affect reported income in the periods presented in the filing if accounted for in accordance with IAS 22. Accordingly, the relief provided by the rule with respect to the determination of the method of accounting for business combinations and the amortization period for goodwill and negative goodwill is proposed to be available only if the method in the primary financial statements has been consistently applied and is consistent with the amended guidance in IAS 22. Comment is requested on the appropriateness of requiring issuers to conform with the amended guidance in IAS 22 for all periods to receive relief from the reconciliation requirement.
