FBIS4-29222 "dreas116_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 North Korea Withdrawal From NPT Depends on `Developments' Withdrawal From NPT Depends on `Developments' SK1606045894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0446 GMT 16 Jun 94 SK1606045894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- As already reported, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement of its spokesman declared that the DPRK would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in answer to the grave encroachment upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK by the Secretariat of the agency. In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says the DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA is a legitimate self-defensive measure to defend its sovereignty and existence as a dignified independent, sovereign state. The responsibility for its withdrawal from the IAEA rests entirely with the agency, the analyst says, and goes on: We joined the agency in September 1974, believing its impartiality and hoping that its assistance would be conducive to our peaceful nuclear activities. After we signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] in December 1985 and concluded the safeguards agreement in January 1992, however, the Secretariat of the agency has zealously joined the United States in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, contrary to its mission and function, and some officials of the Secretariat intentionally created "inconsistency" and adopted a resolution demanding "a special inspection" of our military sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities. Such unjustifiable acts of theirs resulted in forcing the DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the NPT. It was for the removal of the U.S. nuclear threat and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula that we joined the NPT. The Secretariat of the agency, however, encroached upon the supreme interests of our state and cried to stifle the DPRK, abusing the NPT. Under this condition, we could no longer hope for its help. Later, we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the NPT in June 1993 on condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue would continue on an equal and fair basis. Even in a unique status following the temporary suspension of our withdrawal from the NPT, we had honestly accepted inspections for the continuity of safeguards and allowed even "an additional inspection." But the United States and some pro-U.S. officials of the Secretariat had used inspections as a leverage for infringing on our sovereignty and stifling the DPRK, refusing to recognize its special status and intentionally laying obstacles to the DPRK-U.S. talks. The agency's anti-DPRK moves reached the extent where it adopted an unreasonable "resolution" on the discontinuation of "its assistance" to the DPRK at the meeting of the governors' board on June 10, demanding the opening of our military sites to public under the pretext of the nuclear issue. Such being the situation, we did not feel the need to have dealings with the agency any more and reached the conclusion that we could no longer hope for its help. Now that we declared the withdrawal from the agency, we will not bound in the legal point of view to the "resolutions" or steps which the governors' board has adopted and taken or will adopt and take in the future, and we are not obliged to implement them. Now the agency is not in a position to dictate to us. The freedom of choice is not a monopoly of the United States and the Secretariat of the agency. Whether our special status following the temporary suspension of the withdrawal from the NPT is removed or we completely withdraw from it, fully depends on the future developments. If the United States and its allies resort to a strong arm to stifle the DPRK, ignoring its special status and abusing the NPT, we cannot but make another choice.
