PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 would be amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for Part 571 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117 and 30166; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. 2. Section 571.108 would be amended by revising paragraph S5.1.2, in one of the two manners proposed below, as follows: §571.108 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. Option 1 * * * * * S5.1.2␣Plastic materials used for optical parts such as lenses and reflectors shall conform to SAE Recommended Practice J576 JUL91, except that: (a) Plastic lenses (other than those incorporating reflex reflectors) used for inner lenses or those covered by another material and not exposed directly to sunlight shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.3 and 4.2 of SAE J576 JUL91 when covered by the outer lens or other material; (b) After the outdoor exposure test, the haze and loss of surface luster of plastic materials used for lamp lenses shall not be greater than 30 percent haze as measured by ASTM D 1003&hyph;92, Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastic ; (c) After the outdoor exposure test, plastic materials used for reflex reflectors and for lenses used in front of reflex reflectors shall not show surface deterioration, crazing, dimensional changes, color bleeding, delamination, loss of surface luster, or haze that exceeds 7 percent as measured under ASTM D 1003&hyph;92. (d) The tolerance of the thickness of the test specimens specified in paragraph 3.2.2 of SAE J576 JUL91 may vary by as much as # 0.25 mm. (e) After exposure to the heat test as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, and after cooling to room ambient temperature, a test specimen shall show no discernable change in shape and general appearance when compared with an unexposed specimen. The trichromatic coefficients of the samples shall conform to the requirements of SAE J578a, ``Color Specification for Electric Signal Lighting Devices'', October 1966. (f) Two samples of each thickness of each plastic material are used in the heat test. Each sample is supported at the bottom, with at least 51 mm. of the sample above the support, in the vertical position in such a manner that, on each side, the minimum uninterrupted area of exposed surface is not less than 3225 sq. mm. The samples are placed for two hours in a circulating air oven at 79 # 3 degrees C. Option 2 S5.1.2␣ Plastic materials used for optical parts such as lenses and reflectors shall conform to SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970, except that: (a) Plastic lenses (other than those incorporating reflex reflectors) used for inner lenses or those covered by another material and not exposed directly to sunlight shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.4 and 4.2 of SAE J576c, when covered by the outer lens or other material; (b) After the outdoor exposure test, the haze and loss of surface luster of plastic materials used for lamp lenses shall not be greater than 30 percent haze as measured by ASTM D 1003&hyph;61, Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastic ; (c) After the outdoor exposure test, plastic materials used for reflex reflectors and for lenses used in front of reflex reflectors shall not show surface deterioration, crazing, dimensional changes, color bleeding, delamination, loss of surface luster, or haze that exceeds 7 percent as measured under ASTM D 1003&hyph;61; (d) Samples of plastic to be tested need not be injection molded as specified in paragraph 3.3.1 of SAE J576c, nor discs of a diameter of 76 mm.; and (e) The tolerance specified in paragraph 3.3.2 of SAE J576c shall be 0.25 mm.
