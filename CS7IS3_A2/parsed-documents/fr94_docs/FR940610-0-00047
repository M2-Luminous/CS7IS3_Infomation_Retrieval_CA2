FR940610-0-00047 FR940610-0-00023 In response to comments, several editorial changes were made to clarify certain of the formulas contained in the proposed regulations. These clarifications principally involve the insertion of additional parentheses or brackets in order to make the formulas easier for the reader to understand and apply. Also in response to comments, ยง1.170A&hyph;12(b) was updated in a correction to the proposed regulations that was published in the Federal Register on February 3, 1993. The update includes a formula for the computation of the special factor to value a remainder interest following one life where the property is subject to exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence. A similar formula in ยง1.170A&hyph;12(e), which is applicable to the valuation of a remainder interest following two lives, was also updated. The change in formulas avoids the need to include lengthy commutation factor tables in the regulations. Clarifying amendments have been made in the final regulations concerning the meaning of ``valuation date'' for purposes of an election to value a transfer to a charitable remainder trust. In the case of an election under section 7520 to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the transfer is made, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. Sections 1.664&hyph;2(c) and 1.664&hyph;4(e)(4) of the final regulations have been revised accordingly. Comments were received pertaining to the rule in the proposed regulations under section 7520 concerning the transfer of more than one partial interest in the same property at different times. In response to these comments, the regulations have been amended to make it clear that, generally, each separate transfer is valued with the interest rate applicable in the month of the transfer. The proposed regulations provide for making the election to use a prior month's interest rate in the case of a transfer to charity. Comments questioned the need for requiring the filing of detailed information as part of a prior-month election. This information is already required to be filed with the tax return for certain situations involving charitable interests that are subject to measuring lives. See, for example, ยง20.2055&hyph;2(f)(5). This requirement is now explained in the regulations under section 7520. Comments also raised a question about the revocability of the election and the time for making the election. The final regulations provide that the taxpayer makes the prior-month election by so stating on the return and identifying the elected month. The failure to include with the return other information that is required to describe the transfer, whether or not the election is made, will ordinarily not invalidate the election. For elections made on or before June 10, 1994, a reasonable attempt to make the election and submit the required information will be treated as a valid election. The final regulations also provide that the election is generally made on a timely filed tax return for the year of the transfer. However, the election may also be made or changed on an amended or supplemented return that is made within 24 months after the original return is filed. Comments were received concerning whether the five percent de minimis test (i.e., a transfer to charity of at least five percent of the value of the interest) set forth in the proposed regulations should be applied in determining if the taxpayer may elect to use an alternative prior month interest rate. The final regulations delete this de minimis test. Comments were received concerning the application of these regulations in situations where an individual is expected to die prematurely or where two individuals die simultaneously. See, for example, Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80, 1980&hyph;1 C.B. 194, which holds that, in cases where the individual's death is imminent, the standard actuarial tables prescribed by the regulations are not to be used. See, also, Carter v. United States, 291 F.2d 63 (5th Cir. 1991), where the court refused to ascribe value to an income interest for purposes of the section 2013 credit where the death of the transferee was simultaneous with the death of the transferor. Comments were also received concerning the scope of these regulations in light of O'Reilly v. Commissioner, 973 F.2d 1403 (8th. Cir. 1992), rem'd, T.C.M. 1994&hyph;61. In O'Reilly, the Circuit Court held that the standard actuarial tables were not applicable to a situation in which the application of those tables would have produced an unreasonable result. In that case, the property held in trust produced an extraordinarily low rate of return. A similar result was reached by the Tax Court in Froh v. Commissioner, 100 T.C. 1 (1993), dealing with depletable property. Consistent with these comments, the Service and Treasury are contemporaneously proposing an amendment to these regulations that defines the circumstances in which the section 7520 tables would not apply in valuing a transferred interest. That Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register .
