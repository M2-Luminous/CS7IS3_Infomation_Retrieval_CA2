We begin the new training period of the Western Army. The Playa Giron border guard fighter plane brigade [words indistinct] and to a certain degree the important perfecting process which has taken place in the defensive structure of the western part of the country. As many of you know, during the second semester of 1993, a group of important units of the Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] and the Revolutionary Navy located in this territory became part of the Western Army, which elevated considerably the combat capacity and the responsibilities of this Army, which defends one of the most important strategic areas. This measure, which had been previously taken by the East and Central Armies, considerably elevates the operational independence and the combat capabilities of the main commands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. It was not for the purpose of symbolizing that union which motivated the selection of this site for the ceremony. Rather, it was the results of the work done by this great unit, which has gathered more than enough historic and current achievements to host this important ceremony on behalf of the combat glory [words indistinct] it joins the long trajectory of heroism in the battle together with the dedicated work of thousands of men and women. Almost 31 years ago, on 16 April 1963, in this same spot Fidel said that we would not have an air force of weaklings or an air force of wealthy children [burguesitos] but a force of the people, the best of the people. Today we can say with pride that the path set by the commander in chief has been carried out fully. Our pilots as well as the rest of the combatants of the [words indistinct] have given a solid example of modesty and maturity with their understanding and support for the drastic reductions that were necessary in this type of a concentrated force. This was the same attitude taken by the members of the Revolutionary Navy where it was necessary to make cutbacks that correspond with the [words indistinct] in a shared manner by all our combatants and civil workers. [Words indistinct] the past 25 December, in summarizing the good results obtained by this army during its inspection, what the last three years have been for all the armed forces in this effort and work. More than ever before, it has been an eloquent demonstration of the permanent disposition by all the members of the FAR to confront any task and of the enormous amount of intelligence that our units have. We have been capable of fulfilling the difficult challenge that being the armed forces of a country with a revolution like ours represents, remaining in harmony with the sacrifices and efforts of our people. All of you know, that I am not likely to exaggerate achievements and much less to fall into complacency. But I can say that what we have seen, together with the officers that have accompanied us in the recent tours of the three armies, is truly impressive. Not only have we carried out a gigantic effort to put the armed forces in shape to successfully confront the current economic difficulties, and in continuing its refinement and development under these difficult conditions, but we did it without affecting the fulfillment of the FAR's missions, which can be summarized in the five main goals that we established last year. In combat readiness, a vital aspect for the Armed Forces, all the commands exceeded the results of previous years in the elevated number of inspections that were carried out. The work that has been necessary to carry out with the technique is [words indistinct]. It is enough to mention the millions in material conserved or reconditioned, ranging from rifles to airplanes. This task being fundamentally completed, we have instructed that this experience be employed to preserve the costly investment made by the country in agricultural machinery, construction equipment, and equipment of other branches of the economy, with the goal of continuing their use when we overcome the special period, a task in which the first steps have already been taken. Tens of thousands of professionals, workers, and rank and file soldiers, have dedicated their talents and energy to maintain military equipment and weapons in operational, and perfect, condition. Just a few days ago, during a visit to a great unit of the DAAFAR of the Eastern Army, I recalled the ample reference to this effort made by the commander in chief during the Eighth Forum [of Science and Technology] especially what he said about the difficulties of maintaining airplanes, tanks, and the rest of the modern equipment of the armed forces in operational condition after three years of not receiving spare parts. He concluded by saying that someday history would note these heroic deeds. Neither did we forget the tasks of the military theater of operations during 1993 in which substantial progress was made, despite the limitation of resources; in the people's defense tunnels in which the year's goal was exceeded, as well as in the projects of more technical complexity. As I have insisted on other occasions, we will continue advancing in this direction no matter the circumstances and with the available means. The agroindustrial activity directed towards self-sufficiency has been a path of permanent priority. We can already see important results in this area. As we have said on other occasions, except for sugar and salt, which would be senseless to produce, we will continue developing the production of all other foods. We have already reached high levels of self-sufficiency in all the agricultural-livestock sectors. For example, the FAR is already self-sufficient in the production of rice in many units, as in the case of an artillery regiment of the Eastern Army that I recently visited that was 72 percent self-sufficient in 1993. It received 22 percent of its needs from the army. It only depended on the national economy for the remaining 5 percent. Like this unit, there are many other examples. We are also giving great attention to aquatic production, which we will significantly boost this year because this is an important source of animal protein [words indistinct]. All the main commands of the FAR have achieved important results in herbal remedies, which has meant a significant savings for the country in imported medicines. It has allowed us to obtain adequate health levels in our units, where herbal remedies currently make up 70 percent of the medicines that are used. In a recent visit to the Eastern Naval Base, we were able to verify that they are producing 104 of the 109 formulas. This allows them to provide substitutes for 93 percent of the industrial medicines. That is not all. Our combatants are making an important contribution to the country's food program and seeking new ways to make the defense expenses weigh less each day on the national budget. We have the firm goal of making the armed forces weigh as little as possible on the people. In that sense, we are advancing toward the goal of self-financing. It is a difficult goal but possible to reach in a reasonable period. That is why, next year, this goal will be added to the other five we had already defined as the main goals. An example of this was the visible progress experienced by the Youth Labor Army [EJT] whose combatants without abandoning any of the important [words indistinct] in the Turquino plan, tobacco production, and many other areas. They have taken on the responsibility of cultivating 49 percent of state lands dedicated to miscellaneous crops in Havana Province. They are working in these farms with only half of the fuel these farms had before they were taken over by the EJT. Furthermore, they remain ready to carry out the combat missions they are assigned. They must maintain their elevated political and moral state and the satisfactory discipline that exists in our units under the complex circumstances that the country is facing. To achieve these results it does not take an army of priviledged people, but an Army that is expressly linked to the population, with whom the combatants share their problems and difficulties. It is an important example of the FAR's firmness. Our three main commands are developing a healthy and fraternal emulation with the population. The Eastern, and Central Armies have just been challenged by the Western Army, [words indistinct] apart from all formalism, it has been an important factor in achieving these results; an essential element of the defensive power of our country. It is its combatants: the millions of prepared men and women, who are determined to take up their weapons. This preparation will continue to be the center of our work. In 1994, we will consolidate the system of preparation of personnel which should allow us to concentrate efforts and resources in vital matters. We will continue adjusting the preparation of our officers, sergeants, regular soldiers, reserves, and the people's militiamen to our current conditions. We will continue developing the tactical thought on the basis of harmoniously combining the universal with the autochthonous. We will continue giving special attention to the living conditions of all our combatants and civilian workers, especially to the corps of officers, which carries out a decisive role as a solid pillar of [words indistinct] made up of men and women with a high level of professionalism, modesty, and dedication. Lieutenant Ermis Brooks Chivas recently lost his leg as he rescued a group of irresponsible people who attempted to abandon the country through the perimeter that borders the Guantanamo Base. They entered a minefield. The only demand of this young man, who is only 22 years old, was that he be allowed to remain active in the FAR as part of the heroic border brigade. Our officers are of that type. They are the inheritors of the Mambi and rebellious traditions. They are children of a people for whom heroism is an everyday occurrence. One cannot be amazed that from a people like ours, in the past year, despite the greatest shortages and difficulties of the revolution, there was an unprecedented number of new members in the the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and the Union of Young Communists [UJC] within the country, including the armed forces. This confirms, once again, the statement made by our commander in chief that the current moment is the most difficult one, but, at the same time, the most glorious of our history. [applause] Deeds are demonstrating that time is on our side. To the same degree that we resist, solidarity increases as well as the number of people who, even though they do not totally agree with our ideas, are convinced that the Cuban revolution is not at the mercy of the reactionary winds and that its deep popular roots allow it to confront these winds successfully despite their strength. We have difficulties, but we are not at a dead end. We know very well what our deficiencies are, where our problems lay, and what we have to do to overcome them. We will continue acting energetically, analyzing the pros and cons of every decision without letting ourselves be provoked, but without allowing the initiative to be taken for us in any field. The enemy must undoubtedly know that the battle with us is until death. In Cuba, they cannot dream of mass surrenders or general desertions. [applause] As the commander in chief said in his report to the first congress of the PCC about the rebellious army, the FAR has not ceased to be the soul of the revolution. To the contrary, we have the duty of being one of its most solid pillars. To be able to maintain that position in the ranks we must preserve our monolithic unity which is based on the ideological firmness and the absolute [word indistinct], the revolution, and the commander in chief. With the visible results that you have been obtaining in all fields, for the solidarity and working spirit that we have been able to see in the large number of units that we recently visited we are sure that the combatants of the Western Army will be the vanguard [words indistinct] for our people in the great battles that are ahead of us. On behalf of myself and the commander in chief, I congratulate you for the good results obtained in 1993 and I ratify my assurance that in 1994 those results be even greater. Long live our commander in chief! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] Long live our invincible revolution! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] Socialism or [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "or death"]; fatherland or death... [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "We will win!"] [applause]
