The G-7 nations are in "close contact to exchange information to take various actions but details are not yet decided," Saito told a regular news conference. Pressed by reporters if those measures would include joint credit-policy actions, Saito said the present currency movements are "not as easy as to cope with just by interest rate differentials." He added, "there are various ways such as Japan's ongoing efforts to reduce its trade surplus." The dollar fell below 100 yen in Tokyo despite last Friday's joint G-7 intervention after the U.S. currency plunged below that level for the first time in the postwar period in New York last Tuesday. With the joint intervention failing to prop up the dollar, global market attention is fixed on whether the G-7 nations will cooperate in credit policies as they did when the dollar fell near to sinking below 100 yen in May. Together with joint market action, the United States raised its key interest rates, while Germany cut the key rates with other European nations following suit, with Japan maintaining a loose stance on the money market. Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations help the dollar fall as dollar assets become favorable. Saito said G-7 nations "are concerned about the rapid, speculative movements," analyzing the trend as the yen's rise against the dollar in sympathy with the upswings in the German mark and other European currencies. Japan will "continue taking tenacious action through close contact with other G-7 nations," Saito said, expressing concerns over the effect on the recovering economy.
