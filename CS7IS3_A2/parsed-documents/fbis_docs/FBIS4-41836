"In that question we, as legislators, have no disagreements with the Central Bank's position", he announced at a press-conference held in the Duma. Medvedev explained that limited penetration of the Russian financial market by foreign banks "would help our banking system to become more stable and civilized". The sub-committee head showed reporters the draft of a new edition of the acting law "On Banks and Banking Activity". The sub- committee hopes to submit the new draft to the full chamber for its first reading at the beginning of this June. Medvedev stressed that the changes to the law are designed to eliminate the contradictions which industrialists and financiers now constantly encounter in the banking business. In particular, banks will be required to offer clients full information, which is often not done now, since the law on that topic is not fully clear. "Therefore, the banking system will become more transparent", he explained. Commenting on the fact that there are a significant number of organisations in Russia who are carrying out banking operations without the appropriate license to do so, Medvedev reported that the new version of the banking law contains an amendment which would protect depositors' savings and clearly indicate which banks have the necessary licenses and what will happen to those banks which ignore the law. The chairman said that the Russian Government's decision to tax the interest which citizen's receive on their bank deposits was "politically shortsighted". Medvedev also underlined that the new version of the banking law included provisions to make money-laundering more difficult and establish stricter control over the origin of funds which are deposited in banks. In accordance with these goals, some depositors will have to submit declarations proving that the money they would like to deposit is really their own.
