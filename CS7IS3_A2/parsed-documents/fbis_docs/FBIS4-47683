We have been getting in the election results of this election. At this stage, the results come from the Western Cape Province, but they are only for the National Assembly. As the results became available, what we will give you from Gallagher Estate at the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] Media Center, would be three components: provincial totals for the national ballot, in other words, the votes cast in the Western Cape, Northern Cape, and the remaining provinces for the national ballot. Secondly, we will give you the provincial ballots for the provincial legislatures, and thirdly, we will give you the overall total for the national ballot, the National Assembly. at the moment, just a repeat: We have only National Assembly ballots emanating from the Western Cape. There the latest results are as follows: PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], 112; Soccer Party, 8; Freedom Front, 641; Workers' List Party, 4; Women's Rights Peace Party, 3; Ximoko Progressive Party, 4; African Christian Democratic Party, 150; African Democratic Movement, 3; African Moderates Congress Party, 15; African Muslim Party, 25; ANC, 4,696; DP [Democratic Party], 544; Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa, 12; Federal Party, 21; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], 132; the Keep It Straight and Simple Party, 24; LUSAP [Luso-SA Party], 13; Minority Front, 34; NP [National Party], 14,436 The rejected ballots number 184. [Khoza] Let me give you an overview of the regional reports with regard to the counting process, as it continues. You will recall that at an earlier briefing we did say that we had some human resource, or staff, or personnel problems at the counting centers in Queenstown and Umtata in the Eastern Cape. We are pleased that staff at Queenstown sub-regional office have gone back to work and at Umtata there has been an acceptance of the agreement in principle, and therefore counting started at 5PM this afternoon. In KwaZakhele, as I promised to report, the allegation of tempering with ballot boxes is still being investigated and the South African Police are involved. Empangeni -- we have a technical error there in that the lines are down, therefore we cannot be fed with information. I just want to emphasize that that does not necessarily say work or counting is not continuing. It's just that we cannot be accessed. Newcastle as a center -- Vryheid and Ngotje are still reconciling. In North-West Mafikeng Center, the center is still trying to address its staffing problems. We have problems with staff at the Mafikeng center as well. In Schweizer-Reneke, Vryburg, Bloemhom and Delareyville counting is continuing. In Christiana counting is continuing, and it is believed that results are imminent. Khanyetsa -- they are not counting as yet, but reconciliation is continuing. In Taung and Kuruman they are at the reconciliation stage. In the Northern Transvaal, Thohoyandou Center, reconciliation was completed in Messina and they are awaiting confirmation to proceed with the counting. In Soutpansberg reconciliation has just begun. It is estimated that the process should be completed by 7PM this evening. In Phalaborwa reconciliation has begun. No stations have started counting as yet. Ellisrus -- still reconciling, counting is imminent, and I will hand over to my colleague, Kumi, to give you an updated situation as far as the Nasrec Center [National Exhibition Center] is concerned. [Naidoo] Judge Kriegler, Mrs. Helen Suzman, and representatives of the major political parties met at Nasrec this afternoon where votes for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] province are being counted, to discuss difficulties around the reconciliation process which has delayed the start of the count. The reconciliation is acknowledged to be a cause for concern. In order not to delay the counting in this important, most populous region in the country, which should be under way already, a working system as agreed -- whereby the ballots which can be reconciled, will be reconciled -- allowing the counting to begin immediately. In the interim each party will appoint a representative to a team which with the IEC will deal with all problem cases, dissolve as any as possible by agreement, and put the ballots into the count. A second team will deal with the more problematic cases where agreement could not be reached, and continue to try to find agreement on these cases. Meanwhile, all objections are being noted and will be lodged with the IEC to be dealt with at headquarters. The results that become available will be tally figures before the resolution of disputes. The IEC appeals to party officials to cooperate with the IEC in getting the answers to the voters as expeditiously as possible. [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, we discussed the situation at the Mitchell's Plain counting center, where at a previous briefing we announced that over half of the total votes will be handled. I have an update for you that an agreement was reached between the IEC and the parties there. They are expediting the process of reconciliation. Instead of the counting officers checking individual boxes from voting stations against the counterfoils, the counting officers will receive the boxes, count the papers, and keep the totals, and then transfer that straight into party support, but while doing this a group of auditors will sit with the tallies from the first count and they will use those tallies as a check for the counterfoils. The counting officers will give the results from the boxes and the auditors will then give their count of the reconciliation.
