One can think of eight models for achieving development and cooperation in the Tumen Jiang region. To achieve the goal of development and economically vitalize the region and the entire northeast Asia, we must do a careful study, compare the various cooperation models, and select the best. The Tumen Jiang development region can be defined on three levels. On the first level is the Tumen Jiang small-triangle development zone, also known as TREZ, made up of a 1,000-square kilometer area of land including Jingxin in China, the southern Hasang area in Russia, and the Luojin and Xianfeng areas in North Korea. On the second level is the Tumen Jiang greater-triangle development zone, also refereed to as the Tumen Jiang economic development area [TEDA]. It is about 10,000 square kilometers in area and includes Yanji in China, the greater Vladivostok economic region in Russia, and Qingjin in North Korea. On the third level is the Northeast Asia Development Area [NEARDA], encompassing northeast China (Jilin, Heilongjiang, and three banners and one city in Inner Mongolia), the Russian Far East, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. This article focuses on cooperation models for the Tumen Jiang small-triangle development zone in hopes of identifying the best model to transform the region into an enormously powerful development magnet, which, in turn, would be the engine to drive the development of TEDA and NEARDA in the course of time through the ripple effect. 1. The Necessity and Criteria of Choosing the Best Model 1) Necessity a) Broadly speaking there are eight cooperation models for the development of the Tumen Jiang development zone: unilateral development zone, bilateral coordinated development zone, trilateral coordinated development zone, functional cooperation, multinational economic cooperation zone, management by a multinational consortium or multinational corporation, three-nation joint management, and UN administration. These are the objectives of developing the Tumen Jiang region. First, spur the development of the economy of the development zone; second, tap the zone's development potential, and fully exploit the complementariness of the resources of the various nations so that they are allocated optimally; and third, build the development zone into a powerful development magnet to fuel the development of northeast Asia as a whole. The several nations involved do not completely see eye to eye when it comes to development objectives. China hopes that a developed Tumen Jiang would power the economic take-off of its northeast. Russia looks to it to fuel the development of its Far East and lead the charge of its Asian Pacific economic and trade strategy. North Korea expects it to jump-start economic development in its several northwestern provinces. South Korea wants it to do the same for its eastern coastal area and hopes to make full use of the complementariness of its resources and captures the market in the region. Japan hopes that it will further the development of its western coast. It too expects to fully utilize the complementariness of its resources and corner the market in northeast Asia. As for Mongolia, it sees Tumen Jiang as another trade shortcut. Depending on the model we pick, these various objectives will be achieved to different extents. Hence we need to do a careful comparative study and select the one which would lead to the achievement of all these objectives. b) The models also produce different results. Some yield short-term benefits. Others satisfy a limited number of national objectives. Yet others meet all objectives in the long haul. It is imperative, therefore, that the best model be selected. c) The complexity of development and cooperation in the zone requires that we carefully choose the best model. The region is one of the most complex, most diverse in the world, as demonstrated by its 1) political complexity, 2) economic diversity, 3) legal complexity, and 4) managerial difficulty. 2) The Criteria of Model Comparison and Selection a) Conduct a qualitative evaluation of the models from the macro strategic high plane. The qualitative evaluation system should consist of six criteria--politics, economics, dissemination effect, its ability to attract foreign capital and technology, management, and law. b) Carry out empirical research on the models through case studies, using international experiences. c) Identify the model acceptable to all parties by conducting feasibility studies. 2. Defining Various Models Depending on the closeness of cooperation among the various countries, the models can be divided into three broad categories: loose cooperation, semi-close cooperation, and close cooperation. 1) Loose-cooperation models Under a loose-cooperation model, China, North Korea, and Russia each set up a development zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region. There is very limited cooperation in some fields, with each country creating its own comprehensive economic development zone characterized by loose cooperation. Specifically, the three nations each establish a comprehensive economic development zone in adjoining areas in the region. By fully exercising their respective sovereignty, the three nations each formulate their own policies to meet the requirements of their comprehensive zones. In particular, they decide on their own what preferential policies to offer to foreign investors. There is some form of low-level cooperation and coordination in some policy areas, but each nation has its own development zone management committee to run the zone. Specific examples of a loose-cooperation model: Model A: unilateral economic zone. Under this model, China, North Korea, and Russia each set up an economic zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region based on their own national interests and aspirations. They run the zones separately on their own and there is no well-defined cooperative relationship or coordination among them. Specifically China has created an economic development zone in Hunchun. To develop Siberia and its Far East, Russia has set up a free economic development zone in the Hasang area in Nahuodeka. To attract foreign capital, North Korea has also created a special economic zone on Hashan Island in Xianfeng Prefecture. They have their own development zone management committees. Each zone has its own regional development plan, a policy to attract foreign capital, and other policies. There is only routine trade among the three development zones, along with border trade and border trade on a very modest scale. Nor have the three nations taken joint measures to develop the local economy by drawing up an agreement, for instance. Model B: Bilateral coordinated economic development zone. Under this model, the three nations each set up an economic open zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region. China concludes a bilateral agreement with North Korea and Russia separately. There is a limited degree of coordination in policy matters as well as some cooperation in certain fields through the establishment of a bilateral coordinating committee, forming an economic development zone characterized by loose bilateral cooperation and coordination. Specifically, China, North Korea, and Russia each set up a development zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region. China enters into a bilateral cooperative agreement with Russia and North Korea separately. It sets up a development zone ministerial-level committee with the two countries, again separately. The committee meets once a year to discuss major matters of coordination and cooperation. In addition, a bilateral coordinating committee is created to coordinate cooperative activities. Nevertheless, the major decisions are still made by each nation. The characteristic of this model is that ownership and the right to use are merged. Each nation retains absolute sovereignty. The basis of coordination is the bilateral agreement, yet no such agreement exists between Russia and North Korea. Model C: Trilateral coordinated economic open zone. Under this model, China, North Korea, and Russia each set up an economic open zone in adjoining areas in the Tumen Jiang region. The three nations sign an agreement setting up a trilateral coordinating committee to coordinate policies and other matters to a certain extent, forming an economic open zone characterized by loose coordination and cooperation. Specifically the three nations each set up their own economic development zone and all three are parties to a coordination and cooperation agreement. A trilateral ministerial-level committee is set up, along with a trilateral coordinating committee to carry out coordination. What you have under this model is still loose coordination and cooperation. Ownership and the right to use have not been separated. The basis for coordination is a trilateral agreement. 2) Semi-close cooperation models Under a semi-close cooperation model, the three nations each set up an economic open zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region by exercising their sovereignty and cooperate more closely in certain fields or in the planning and development of the region as a whole. Specifically the nations each set up an economic development zone in the Tumen Jiang region, sign a trilateral agreement, and set up a three-nation ministerial-level coordinating committee and a three-nation coordinating committee. The three countries cooperate more closely in certain fields, in the formulation of some policies, and in the development of the entire regional economy. Specific examples of a semi-close cooperation model: Model D: functional cooperation. China, North Korea, and Russia each set up an economic open zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region and sign an agreement under which they are to cooperate relatively more closely in some fields that will shape the long-term development of the whole region, such as communication and transportation, energy, environmental protection, tourism, agriculture, and tariffs. Specifically the three nations each set up their own development zone and enter into an agreement specifying the fields of cooperation. A ministerial-level committee and a coordinating committee are set up. In some fields, eg., transportation, energy, and environmental protection, a corporation is set up. In others, such as tourism, a promoting committee is set up. A number of preferential policies are adopted to attract foreign capital to finance development in the selected fields. Resources are allowed to circulate freely in the field concerned. Model E: multinational economic cooperation zone. By exercising their political sovereignty, the three nations, namely China, Russia, and North Korea, sign a cooperation agreement setting up a unified multinational economic open zone and carry out relatively close cooperation on the economic front. Specifically, the three nations sign an agreement creating a multinational economic cooperation zone in adjoining areas in the Tumen Jiang region. A "Tumen Jiang multinational economic cooperation law," which must not violate the constitutions of the three nations, is adopted as the basic law of the zone. There is a single unified fiscal policy, tax policy, and monetary policy in the zone. Tariffs are unified. A free trade zone, perhaps even tariff alliance, is set up. A favorable investment climate is created to attract foreign capital and technology. Resources are allowed to circulate freely within the zone to take advantage of their complementariness. The market system reigns supreme within the zone. A three-nation ministerial-level committee exists to handle major matters. Underneath it is a multinational economic zone management committee, an executive body in charge of the unified planning, leadership, and management of the zone. Model F: management by a multinational consortium or corporation. This carries the multinational cooperation zone model one step further. A multinational corporation leases the land use right to a piece of territory where the three nations abut one another, forming an economic development zone characterized by multinational cooperation through unified planning, investment, and management. Specifically a multinational economic cooperation zone is set up in accordance with an agreement. The multinational consortium or corporation leases the land use right to a piece of land in the Tumen Jiang region where the three nations abut, with ownership remaining in the hands of the three nations. When the land use right lease expires, it may be extended if necessary. A management committee exists to carry out unified planning and management. As far as tariffs are concerned, a free port policy is followed A number of other preferential policies are also offered. The leading industry in the multinational economic zone is banking and trade, with the zone ultimately becoming a banking and trade center in northeast Asia. This model is characterized by the separation of ownership and use-right, but the three nations still retain sovereignty. 3) Close-cooperation models To fully achieve the development objective of the region, China, Russia, and North Korea sign a trilateral or international agrement setting up an integrated Tumen Jiang cooperation zone. They engage in close cooperation on issues relating to the zone's overall development. The cooperation zone is quasi-national in nature and practices political, social, and economic integration for an extended period of time (anywhere from 50 to 100 years, for stance). A case in point is Hong Kong. Specifically the three nations sign a trilateral or international agreement setting up an integrated cooperation zone. By adopting a "special law on the integration of the Tumen Jiang region," the legislatures of the three nations approve the establishment of an integrated Tumen Jiang cooperation zone for a set period of time (say, from 50 to 100 years) in order to develop the region. The zone is quasi-national in nature. It has a committee composed of the heads of government which meets regularly and handles major issues. There is also a development zone special management committee, an authoritative body in charge of the unified planning, leadership, and management of the zone. Special policies apply in the zone. While the territory of the zone belongs to the three nations, no nation can unilaterally exercise sovereign control over its portion of the zone during its predetermined duration. Resources can circulate freely within the zone. It is a free trade zone and an export processing zone. It is a tariff union as well as economic union. It is authorized to issue a freely convertible special zone currency and offers preferential incentives to attract foreign capital and technology. The zone also has a special assembly whose primary responsibilities are legislation and supervising the zone's administrative officers in the discharge of the latter's duties and functions. The zone's diplomatic and defense matters are handled through consultation. Specific examples of a close-cooperation model: Model G, three-nation joint management. The three nations sign a cooperation agreement setting up an integrated Tumen Jiang cooperation zone to effect political, economic, and social integration for a prolonged period of time. The zone is run by a mixed three-nation joint management committee. Specifically, in addition to the above description, the following points need to be noted. The three nations sign a trilateral agreement. A committee consisting of the heads of government of the three nations is set up. Also established is a special mixed management committee comprising representatives from the three nations to run the zone jointly. Model H: UN administration. Under the auspices of the United Nations, the six [as published] nations of China, Russia, North Korea, Japan, and Mongolia sign an international agreement setting up an integrated special cooperation zone where these six nations abut one another in the Tumen Jiang region. A "special law on the Tumen Jiang integrated special cooperation zone" is passed by the pertinent legislative bodies and the United Nations is entrusted to be solely responsible for its administration. Specifically, under the auspices of the UN, the six nations sign an international agreement setting up an integrated Tumen Jiang special cooperation zone. The pertinent legislative bodies adopt a "special law on the Tumen Jiang integrated special cooperation zone" and authorize the UN to be solely responsible for administering it. The United Nations sets up a regional development special committee directly answerable to the secretary general. The committee selects experts to form a "Tumen Jiang experts management committee" to take charge of the zone's unified planning, leadership, and management. There is also a committee composed of the UN secretary-general, the executive director of the regional development special committee directly under the secretary-general, as well as the heads of government of the nations involved. The zone adopts special preferential policies to attract foreign capital and technology and issues a freely convertible Tumen Jiang currency. Its exchange rate follows the exchange rate of the special drawing rights [SDR's]. The distribution of interests and disputes arising therefrom are resolved by the United Nations and the six nations through consultation, with the United Nations holding the ultimate arbitration power. Diplomatic affairs are worked out through consultation. Territorial sovereignty remains in the hands of the three nations. Defense and public security responsibilities are carried out by UN peacekeeping forces. 3. Comparing the Eight Models 1) Model A Pros: Relatively amenable to realizing the wishes and aspirations of an individual nation. Extremely low initial exchange costs, which means that an economic open zone can be set up in no time. Legal and policy coordination can come about readily. Cons: Cannot achieve the basic objectives of developing the region, fully exploiting the zone's absolute or comparative advantage, or bringing about the complementariness of resources. Economies of scale unobtainable. Large-scale infusion of foreign capital hampered by the political system, legal system, level of economic development and policies of the nation in question and other constraints. Hard to build up a lead industry. The fact that each nation solves its environmental and other problems on its own presents enormous difficulties. In the real world, each nation has set up its own economic development zone, but only of a very elementary variety. Foreign capital is cautious about entering Russia what with its current political instability. It still has a long way to go before completing its transition to a market economy and its economic mechanism operates in a most haphazard manner, which gives foreign capital pause. The infrastructure in the Russian far east is backward and there is a shortage of managerial personnel. Foreign-funded enterprises already there cannot operate properly. The legal system is unsound and incomplete, with administrative orders often filling the void. The result is a high degree of unpredictability. Furthermore, the Russian-Japanese territorial dispute is an impediment to the large-scale entry of Japanese capital into the Russian Far East. Thus, domestic investment and the vitalization of existing relations alone will not be able to lift the economy of Russian far east and those of Asian Pacific nations to a higher level of mutually beneficial interaction. Among the various nations in northeast Asia, the North Korean economy is most backward and the least open. It has a tenuous economic relationship with Japan and began trade and economic ties with South Korea only two or three years ago. The channels of economic exchange and trade between North Korea and other nations are narrow and, to a certain extent, stagnant. Despite the establishment of an economic zone on Hashan Island, the possibility of attracting foreign capital on a large scale is extremely remote. China, too, has its own problems: a backward infrastructure, an incomplete legal system, inefficiency, and a shortage of senior managerial personnel. 2) Model B Pros: conducive to bringing out the complementariness of the resources of the two sides involved. Initial exchange costs low; good chance of reaching an agreement; may strengthen bilateral relations; may serve common economic interests through bilateral cooperation. Cons: This model still falls short of achieving the basic objective of developing the region. Bilateral forces not enough of an engine to fuel the development of the region; the free circulation of resources is impeded, their complementariness not fully exploited; there is only limited complementariness between the resources of China and those of North Korea; cannot reap the benefits of economies of scale long term; the different interpretations of the institutions and policies of the various nations and different expectations about the future preclude a large infusion of foreign capital; immense difficulties in reconciling one system of law with another and one policy with another, and in coordinating the distribution of interests; the extent of economic cooperation within the zone is modest, complicating further development. This model is fairly acceptable to the three parties. Thus far all three have made some move on this front. China and Russia, for instance, have set up a common market in a number of localities. 3) Model C Pros: marks the first step toward achieving the basic objective of cooperation and development in the zone; economies of scale much more substantial than under the previous two models; helps bring out the complementariness of resources to a large extent; helps improve relations among the three parties. Initial exchange costs also quite low, albeit they tend to go up subsequently. Cons: hard to coordinate the laws and policies of different nations because of conflicting interests and because they are significantly different from one another; the zone is nothing more than a loose organization; lacking a legal basis for its actions as well as a powerful coordinating committee, it is not in a position to play an effective role or to attract foreign capital and technology in a big way; it has trouble developing into a development magnet and still falls short of achieving the objective of development. In the real world, the three nations do find this model acceptable and now appreciate the importance of cooperation. They have taken some moves on the cooperation front as illustrated by their enthusiastic participation in the international conference organized by UNDP. 4) Model D Pros: helps spur development in some fields, taking the interests of the entire region as the point of departure; makes good use of the resources within those fields and puts their complementariness to work; can lead to economies of scale more extensively and is good at disseminating technology to the surrounding areas. It also succeeds in attracting a substantial amount of foreign capital; can promote trilateral relations further. Cons: because of the presence of the complexity and disparities mentioned above, the field of cooperation cannot be readily broadened; initial exchange costs quite high; difficulties in coordinating policies and management; cannot guarantee the all-round development of zone. It is within the realm of possibility to adopt this model to set the stage for further cooperation. The three parties are in the process of exploring the possibility of cooperating with one another in transportation (building a harbor) and environmental protection. Right now the foremost problem is conflicting interests. A case in point is harbor construction. In 1990 China proposed building a harbor on its soil. Under its plan, the first phase will consist of dredging the silt that has accumulated at the mouth of Tumen Jiang, estimated to be between 1 and 3 million cubic meters. Along with rail construction, the project will cost about $2 billion. The second phase of the plan calls for the construction of a large harbor upstream at Hunchun, about 72 km from Fangchuan, that will handle 10,000-ton ships, at an estimated cost of $8 billion by the year 2015. North Korea, on the other hand, suggests that an international trade port be built within its territory, arguing that, first, Qingjin, Luojin, and Xianji are ice-free ports; second, unlike downstream Tumen Jiang, it does not have the problem of silt accumulation; and third, it is free from flooding and it costs less to use existing facilities. For its part, meanwhile, Russia has proposed that places like Boxiete and Vladivostok be developed first to spearhead the drive of opening up to the outside world. 5) Model E Pros: it tentatively accomplishes the goal of development and reaps the benefits of economies of scale; it is better able to attract foreign capital than the several preceding models and bring out the complementariness of resources. Cons: initial exchange costs quite substantial; management and coordination still present enormous difficulties; South Korea, Mongolia, and Japan still unable to play their proper role. Both China and Russia find this model acceptable. As a matter of fact, Chinese experts have proposed adopting this model. The main roadblock comes from North Korea. In 1984 North Korea introduced a limited open policy, which militates against expanding economic ties with other nations in the region, which, in turn, will necessarily hamper the formation of a cooperation zone in Tumen Jiang. 6) Model F Pros: can attract foreign capital; utilizes the strengths of multinational consortia and corporations when it comes to funding, technology, and management; short-term pay-offs substantial. Leads to considerable economies of scale. Cons: High initial exchange costs. There is no guarantee that the objective of development in the zone will be achieved. Out of self-interests, the multinational consortium or corporation typically pursues short-term benefits while ignoring the region's long-term interests. It may cause the Matai effect. Transfer prices may get out of control. Macro-management presents great difficulties. The three nations are not up to the task. Special preferential policies are needed to create the investment climate to attract foreign capital, something beyond the capacity of the three nations. It is well worth our while to examine ways of ensuring the investors' interests. A banking and trade center is unlikely to materialize in the short run. Besides there is no guarantee this model will lead to the development of the region and other areas. The adoption of this model must be made conditional on the implementation of Model E. Otherwise it simply will not work. 7) Model G Pros: achieves the goal of development; better able to utilize the complementariness of resources; achieves economies of scale in a big way; effective in attracting foreign capital; more harmonious relations among the three nations; internal institutional stability; easy to coordinate policies. Cons: extremely high initial exchange costs; hard to reconcile the interests of the three nations and resolve their conflicts; the complexity and diversity of the region complicates the operations of the model in practice; management would have trouble keeping up. Model still fails to engage Japan, Mongolia, or South Korea actively in it. It is extremely difficult to put this model into practice. The conditions are just not there in the real world. First, the issue of sovereignty. Arduous negotiations are necessary here. Second, the three nations' attitudes. North Korea finds the model unacceptable. China and Russia are more flexible but are still deterred by doubts about whether it can be properly run, about its ability to attract foreign capital on a large scale, and about its future and success from rushing to embrace it. Be that as it may, this model is one of cooperation at an advanced level that is well worth looking into. 8) Model H Pros: It can fully accomplish the objective of development and ensure the interests of all parties. It is effective in attracting foreign capital and technology in large quantities and reconciling the conflicts among the various parties. It is amenable to scientific management and can generate substantial social, ecological, and economic benefits. It is better suited to enable Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia to play their proper role. Under this model, resources can be truly complementary and we can effectively tap their potential. The region can serve as a strong disseminator of technology and gradually helps drive the development of northeast Asia as a whole, achieving optimal economies of scale. It also sets an example for other forms of multilateral cooperation. Cons: It incurs hefty initial exchange costs and entails extremely tough negotiations. However, once the model is in place, all nations in northeast Asia will benefit from it tremendously. This is cooperation of a high order. Nevertheless, further reform of the existing UN management system is needed before it can undertake this monumental task. The fact of the matter is that as an international authoritative body that is neutral, nonprofit, technical, and disinterested, the United Nations has consistently held high the banner of peace and development. It is a strong advocate of development. All nations recognize its organizational, research and development, managerial, and fund-raising abilities; its capacity for attracting, organizing, and putting qualified personnel to work; and its achievements over the past few decades. For this reason, it is the best candidate to play the administrative role. With the United Nations actively supporting and working hard on behalf of the development of the region, it is possible it may accept the role. Let us analyze the attitudes of the various nations. Russia has now adopted a policy of opening itself up across the board and is looking for a powerful engine to boost the development of all Siberia and its Far East, so it is expected to take a positive view. Since Deng Xiaoping toured south China and delivered a number of speeches there, China has opened itself further, emphasizing economic construction as the central task. As we see it, provided the territory belongs to China, provided UN administration can lead to the development of the Tumen Jiang region and fuel the development of the northeast as a whole, making China more powerful overall, China may support this model. And so will Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia. North Korea may well reserve judgment. But if other nations in northeast Asia support it unanimously and put in painstaking work, in the end North Korea will also go along with it.
