The possibility of voting for one candidate nationally and for another candidate departmentally (multiparty vote system) and several provisions on departmental governments are prominent among the constitutional reform innovations. Even though the Senate vote was unanimous, it is not clear that all parties will campaign for the "Yes" ballot. At least two parties will not campaign for it. The Broad Front has yet to decide on this issue and the Batlleist Forum representatives pointed out that it does not support the multiparty vote system, but it does support advancing the plebiscite's date. There were bitter arguments between the Battleism List 15 faction and the Battleist Forum, which at times jeopardized the atmosphere of political agreement that surrounded the debate and vote on the constitutional reform bill.
