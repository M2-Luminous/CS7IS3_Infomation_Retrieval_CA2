A delegation from our country, presided over by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, participated in this meeting. In a speech he gave at this meeting, Mr. Serreqi stressed among other things that Albania assesses that the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative marks a new qualitative step in the direction of setting up trust, security, and practical cooperation with NATO and its member countries, as well as other East European countries. Albania has supported the PFP idea since the very beginning. Albania's signing of a (?framework) document at the highest level clearly speaks for the vital interest in actively taking part in this process, in the service of peacekeeping and peacemaking. Mr. Serreqi said that through active participation in a partnership, we aim at closer, more qualitative, and concrete cooperation with the NATO, which will pave the way for our country's future membership in this vital political and military collective security organization. He talked about the democratic reform that is being carried out successfully in the Army. He said that we have implemented the organization of the Army and ensured transparency in the questions of planning the defense and military budget. We are confident, he said, that cooperation within the PFP framework will play a decisive role in further advancing this reform and modernizing the Armed Forces, thus aiming at coming ever closer to reaching NATO standards. During his stay, Mr. Serreqi held several private meetings with the foreign ministers of NATO countries such as U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, German Foreign Minister Kinkel, the foreign ministers of Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, etc. In these meetings, they discussed aspects of bilateral relations as well as the relations of our country with NATO and the European Union [EU]. The situation in the region occupied a special place in these meetings, particularly the recent developments in Greek-Albanian relations, at a time when Greece alone continues to block, in the EU Council of Ministers and Finance and Economy, the granting of a consensus for aid amounting to ECU35 million toward the balance of payments in Albania. During the reception hosted for the delegation heads, Mr. Serreqi met with Turkish Prime Minister Ciller. She reconfirmed her desire to visit Albania soon. During the meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin, Mr. Serreqi talked about bilateral relations in the framework of the opportunities opened up by the visit to Turkey of President Berisha, both at the political and economic level. During the break between sessions, with the initiative of the Greek delegation, Mr. Serreqi talked with Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias. Mr. Serreqi stressed that since the meeting in Zurich, and after the acceptance of a second meeting by the Greeks, there has been no incident that would make the development of dialogue difficult. At this time, the resurgence of an anti-Albanian campaign and propagation of absurd claims about arrests and repression among the Greek minority, in order to justify the cancellation of the meeting of foreign ministers and hinder Albania's relations with the EU, is inconceivable. For his part, Mr. Papoulias said he was in favor of lowering tones and creating a climate enabling the resumption of dialogue. Mr. Serreqi held a very important meeting with his Italian counterpart Maroni. After becoming acquainted with the situation in Albania, Mr. Maroni expressed his admiration for the results of reform in our country. He said that Albania represents a special case in Central and East Europe and is characterized by political stability and economic achievements. He said that the Italian Government acknowledges Albania's great contribution and role toward stability in the Balkans. Mr. Serreqi stated that the Albanian Government does not see relations with Italy as a neighbor on a bilateral level alone, but as involving priority relations that are being developed with a friendly country that plays an important role not only in the EU and NATO, but also in other international entities. Thus Albanian-Italian relations assume a multilateral dimension. Minister Maroni confirmed to Mr. Serreqi the desire of the new Italian Government to further develop relations between Italy and our country. They also talked about the practical implementation of existing projects, as well as future plans. Mr. Maroni said that Italy will be more engaged in strengthening Albania's relations with NATO and the European Union. Minister Serreqi invited his Italian counterpart for a visit to Albania. The date of the visit will be determined through diplomatic channels.
