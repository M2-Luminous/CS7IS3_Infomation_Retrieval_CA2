FR940928-1-00050 FR940928-1-00013 4.3.4.1␣The vibration frequency test consists of vibrating an illuminated lamp with a sinusoidal wave shape from 5 to 33 Hz in discrete frequency intervals of 1 Hz, at the amplitudes shown in the table below. At each integral frequency, the vibration shall be maintained for five minutes. Amplitudes of Vibration (1/2 Total Excursion) 1Frequency range (Hz) 1Amplitude # inch ␣5 to 15 0.030 # 0.006 ␣16 to 25 0.020 # 0.004 ␣26 to 33 0.010 # 0.002 4.3.4.2␣The endurance test consists of a two hour vibration test of an illuminated lamp using a sinusoidal wave shape at a frequency of 33 HZ and an amplitude of 0.010 # .002 inches. 4.3.4.3␣The vibration frequency and endurance tests shall be performed with the direction of vibration along the lamp stem and in two directions perpendicular to the stem. 4.3.4.4␣A sample of five lamps shall be randomly chosen from a production lot; no failures are permitted. 4.3.4.5␣The test report shall list the testing company, date, place and test engineer/technician. It shall also list the lamp manufacturer, type of lamp, production date code, and pass or fail for the vibration frequency and endurance tests for each lamp. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23749 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
