FBIS4-37727 "drnes121_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi Condemns U.S., U.K., France Al-Qadhdhafi Condemns U.S., U.K., France LD2306092594 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 1930 GMT 22 Jun 94 LD2306092594 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Speech by leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi "before the masses of the western Tripoli suburbs of Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'al" in Tripoli on 22 June -- live or recorded] [Excerpts] Brothers, this evening another strong voice is being raised from an important corner of the immortal town of Tripoli, the Tripoli of Arabs. This voice is being raised today from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'al. This voice is being raised to stress to the enemies that the Libyan people have decided to accept the challenge of confrontation and defiance, and they have decided to confront defiance with their iron and formidable determination which cannot be defeated or swayed. Brothers, let your voice rise from the western corner of Tripoli, from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'aal. Let the enemies hear this strong voice which cannot be terrorized by threats and unjust policies. This voice, brothers, will terrorize and shake them; the voice of the masses and the voice of the free citizen -- the ordinary citizen -- the voice of the street and the voice of quarters. [passage omitted] Dear brothers, they use dirty weapons against us so as to weaken our determination and we find ourselves forced to give in to their wishes. They use economic and psychological weapons and threaten us to step up the sanctions. They threaten us with an oil embargo. This is an insult to the Libyan people when they think that oil is more valuable than the dignity of the Libyan people. They are mistaken and they insult the Libyan people when they think that oil is dearer than the dignity, glory, and our fathers and ancestors' blood which was shed before the time of oil in defense of the freedom of this land. They insult you, brothers, they think that eating, to you, is more important than the homeland. They want to tell you that your are guided by you stomach not by you brains. They want to imply that you have no dignity when they threaten to embargo the Libyan oil. First of all those barbarians use the dirtiest and the most decadent weapons, they fight people in their quest to earn a living. Why do they not say they would impose an embargo on Libyan dates, onions, or oranges. They say we will impose an embargo on Libyan oil if Libya does not surrender, because they know that the main source of wealth and the main resource of the Libyan people is oil. Hence they embarked upon threatening the Libyan people's livelihood. This is not the weapon of real men, nor is it the weapon of the brave. It is not a human weapon at all. This is the weapon of cowards, the weapon of barbarians (?of the jungle), the enemies of human rights and the enemies of peoples. The United States, Britain, and France prove that they are the most decadent states and the most barbaric and savage states when they fight the Iraqi people, the Libyan people, and the Cuban people. They fight each country by its source of wealth. They fight Cuba by sugar, its main resource. They fight Iraq by deprivation of its oil. They fight Libya by threatening that they will impose an embargo on its oil. These threats can only come from very decadent and barbarous nations. What is this despicable talk which is a disgrace to mankind? What is this talk of threatening peoples' resources and wealth? When they impose an arms ban on Libya, this is understandable. When they impose a ban on transports, this can also be understandable. Whether this applies to Libya or any other country, if a state needs to be punished, political relations with it are severed. This is also understandable and acceptable. However, when they threaten to boycott the source of wealth of any people, they are sinking very low in decadence and they show that they are barbarians and snakes. After that they should no longer have the right to talk about humanity, freedom, peoples, and human rights. By threatening the peoples' wealth and the people's main resource, they lose that right. When they decide to starve peoples, they are proving that they are more barbaric than Genghiz Khan and Hulagu, more Nazi than Hitler, and more fascist than Mussolini. The new Hitler is the United States, Britain, and France. The new Mussolini is the United States, Britain, and France. The new Hulagu is the United States, Britain, and France. The new Genghis Khan is the United States, Britain, and France. [passage omitted] Brothers, how do Arab governments continue to adhere to the three Western countries' resolution which was fabricated on behalf of the Security Council; how do they adhere to refusing Libyan planes even during Hajj, although new evidence has come to light before the world regarding the so-called Lockerbie case which categorically proves that at least the perpetrator was not Libya? This new evidence has come as a slap in the face for the United States, Britain, and France, and the so-called false Security Council. How can they impose sanctions on the Libyan people when it has become evident that a number of sides could have perpetrated the crime? A number of sides are now in the dock. A number of sides are now thought to have blown up Lockerbie [as heard]. How can sanctions against the Libyan people continue in an obscure and ambiguous case in which the accused have become numerous? How can they pick on one of the accused and impose sanctions on him? Shame on Arab governments. Shame on the rulers of the Arab nation. Shame on you for carrying out whatever Washington tells you without question and for carrying out what Tel Aviv tells you without question. It is a disgrace that the issue of Arab existence and Arab Palestine has become an issue of the demarcation of borders between Jordan and the enemy. Are they not ashamed of the thousands of victims -- children and women, not to mention men -- of letting the issue of Jerusalem, the issue of Palestine, and the issue of threatened Arab existence become the issue of the demarcation of borders between Jordan and the so-called Israel. This unconditional and unjustifiable surrender is shameful and disgraceful. This nation has sacrificed convoys of martyrs for Palestine. The sacrifice was not made for the border between Jordan and the so-called Israel. [passage omitted] We are telling the colonial countries that the veto has been transferred from the Security Council and the superpowers to the street, the masses, the Libyan people, the Somali people, and the Lebanese people. We are telling them: Do not mock the street, O Arab rulers. Do not mock the wretched Arab citizen. Do not pile humiliation after humiliation on this citizen. Do not gamble with the future of this citizen. This wretched citizen in the Arab Maghreb, the Arab Mashreq [Middle East], the Nile valley and the Arabian peninsula will take revenge. [passage omitted] We tell them: You should fear the citizen more than the United States. You should fear the poor Arab citizen who is humiliated today. You should fear him more than you fear France, Britain, the United States, and Tel Aviv. O You, the servile and submissive Arab leaders, who trade the future of this citizen, this citizen will rebel and he must rebel. This citizen is a threat to you. America will not save you from this citizen. This citizen is closer to you than your jugular vein. This citizen is closer to you than rescue from America and Tel Aviv. This citizen is lying in wait for you, you the servile leaders. Glory is to the street; glory is to the ordinary citizen; glory is to these generations which want to live free under the sun, away from the United States', Britain's, France's, and Tel Aviv's threats. It is this free citizen who will determine what he wants. It is he, the free citizen, who should have the right of veto. Go on, you colonialists, allying yourselves with the most despicable agents and cowards in the Arab region. Go on challenging the Arab citizen because this will turn the Arab citizen into a bomb. It is this citizen who can do what your fleets and nuclear bombs cannot do. We welcome this policy which fosters hatred in our children and grandchildren against you the colonialists. Go on you the colonialists, go on with your devious and mistaken policies from which you will reap regret. You will regret this, you colonialists. We are happy when you despise the Arab citizen and when you fill this Arab citizen with hatred and rancor against you. Let there be more challenge from America to the Arab citizen, the Iraqi citizen, the Libyan citizen and the Somali citizen. Let there be more humiliation to the Palestinian Arab citizen. Let there be more destruction of Lebanon because all this will generate hatred and bombs and will generate fear, brothers. This will generate terrorism, the real terrorism which they fear, when the Arab citizen terrorizes them. This is the citizen whose house is being destroyed in Lebanon and about whom nobody talks. This citizen will take his revenge, as will the citizen who is being jailed in Palestine and who is tortured in Palestine and whose mother and sister are tortured in front of him. This is the citizen who will turn into a bomb which will destroy what is known as Israel. Israel will (?suffer at the hands of) this citizen and what is known as Israel will be finished; and America's fleets will not save it from the ordinary citizen, the explosive citizen wearing an explosive belt or carrying a bomb. Continue, you leaders, on the path of surrender and submissiveness to the will of the enemy because this will shorten your life and will bring your end nearer at the hands of the citizen who rejects surrender, submissiveness, and servility. The peoples want to live free, brothers. The citizen wants to be master of his own destiny and wants to live free. He does not accept always living under the leaders' whip and under the threats of the enemies, Tel Aviv and Washington. God did not create us to live, generation after generation, under America's and Tel Aviv's terrorism. We accept death and challenge. We have decided to confront the challenge with challenge. We have decided to accept the challenge in the spheres of oil, arms, the economy, or in anything else. We do not sell the martyrs' blood for oil. We do not sell the immortal past for oil. [passage omitted] When the confrontation became a confrontation between the citizen and the enemies, between the peoples and the colonialist [word indistinct], the confrontation became one between the Arab citizen and his rulers, between the citizen and the rulers. It is here that the master citizen emerged, the free citizen emerged in the free street on the free Libyan territory. He emerged today in the western corner of the city of Tripoli, in Qirgarish and Hay al- Andalus to make his voice heard by the subservient rulers. [passage omitted]
