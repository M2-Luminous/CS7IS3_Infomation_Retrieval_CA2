They pledged to step up the "struggle against the occupation," politically and militarily. They stressed their refusal to participate in the self-rule authority. However, they indicated their wish to avoid any "confrontation" with the Palestinian police. Talal Ahmad, media spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by George Habash, said that the agreement "is the culmination of the concessions that led to the self-rule authority agreement. It gives Israel complete control at all levels." In a statement to AL-HAYAH he said that the PFLP will not participate in the self-rule authority, "but we will not allow any violent confrontations against the Palestinian authority or the police. We will continue our struggle against Israel and the occupation wherever they exist in order to secure a settlement that offers the Palestinian people a just solution." He stressed the PFLP's intention of moving its decisionmaking to the occupied territories in the light of recent developments on the Palestinian scene. He pointed out that the "agreement should take place inside and that it should be basically confronted inside." On the possibility of PFLP cadres' entry into the Gaza Strip, he said that the return is "a right for everyone. It has nothing to do with the (position on the) agreement." Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, told AL-HAYAH that the agreement "confirms that what is intended is the establishment of an entity subservient to the Zionist entity both economically and at the security level." He said that the agreement does not provide for a Palestinian state plan. He warned that he will confront the agreement by reactivating military and political action. A spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah said that the agreement "is not binding on the Palestinian people." And that yesterday "was not the end of Palestinian national history, but, rather, the beginning of a new phase of struggle whose task is to topple the self-rule and continue the struggle." In a statement issued by him he went on: The agreement "has exposed all attempts at deception and cheating and all the false allegations about the partitioned self-rule in Gaza and Jericho." The "central leadership" of the [Palestinian Forces] Alliance held a meeting yesterday evening to discuss ways of conducting action after the signing of the agreement. Hamas considered yesterday an "ill-omened" day in the Palestinians' history. It said that those who signed the agreement "do not represent our people," and the agreement is not binding on the Palestinians. A statement issued by the movement said what happened in Cairo "is a cheap sellout of the homeland represented in a weak and disfigured self-administration controlled by Zionist domination and sovereignty." Having pointed out that the agreement "is not binding" on the Palestinian people and that those who signed it "do not represent them," the movement urged "all Palestinian factions and influential figures to unite their efforts to oppose this sinister agreement...and not to be dragged in any way into violence or fighting among brothers of one people." Concluding, the statement said that the agreement "will not represent the end of history, because no treaties are going to abolish the Palestinian people's claim to their homeland and holy places. One day our people will tear up this agreement, just as they have torn up all documents of abandonment throughout history."
