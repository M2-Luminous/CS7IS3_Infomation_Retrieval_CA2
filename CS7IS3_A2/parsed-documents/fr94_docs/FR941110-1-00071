EPA is seeking comments on this system in which a person may submit, after January 1, 1996, a request to the Agency for credits based on the destruction or transformation of a quantity of controlled substances in the United States that were initially produced for an emissive use. The person requesting credits would need to identify the amount of controlled substance that was destroyed or transformed and the previous use of the controlled substance. In addition, the person would need to submit to EPA a copy of the destruction efficiency certification as under ยง82.13(k). Upon approval, EPA would grant the person credits equal to the amount of the controlled substance they destroyed or transformed minus an offset. EPA proposes that credits could be used for: (i) the importation of a calculated level of the controlled substance, or (ii) the production of a calculated level of the controlled substance. Consistent with the parameters set for control periods by the Montreal Protocol, EPA proposes that credits not be carried over from one control period to the next, due to the limits on net production. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements associated with the credits described in these paragraphs are outlined in paragraph C.7.a.iv and C.7.a.v below. Under the proposed system, the Agency will create a balance of credits for the person upon approval of a request. Deductions will be made from this balance of credits based upon quarterly reports to EPA showing production and importation. EPA is proposing that inter-pollutant transfers of credits as currently defined in ยง82.12 be permitted within the Groups of class I substances listed in Appendix A and F to Subpart A, subtracting a one percent offset. The Agency is also proposing that inter- company transfers of credits be permitted as currently defined in ยง82.12, subtracting the one percent offset. Inter-Party trades of credits would also be permitted under today's proposal as currently described in ยง82.9 with the actual controlled substance returning to the United States.
