[end recording] [Correspondent] The Government Press Office was not capable of giving a reply to the question of whether and when the resignation might be accepted. Journalists were only told that Henryk Chmielak and Wojciech Misiag, a second deputy finance minister, are continuing to work on the Strategy for Poland program presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, the present finance minister. Unofficially, there is also talk that Wojciech Misiag will leave the Finance Ministry, although not at his own request. Prime Minister Pawlak is to give him his dismissal notice on Monday [27 June]. We did not succeed in gaining confirmation of this news at the Office of the Council of Ministers. Wojciech Misiag himself did not wish to discuss this with the press. He invited them for Monday. Wojciech Misiag was appointed to the post of deputy finance minister by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz in the fall of 1989. For four years, he was responsible for the preparation of successive state budgets.
