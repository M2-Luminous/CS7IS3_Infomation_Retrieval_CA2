The automobile, household electrical appliance, and steel industries, which suffered a heavy blow from the drastic appreciation of the yen, see the weakness of the yen as temporary, providing them some breathing space. Nonetheless, they show no signs of changing their restructuring plans to streamline their businesses, cut their employees, or increase their overseas production. Automobiles The prevailing view in the automobile industry is that "even though the yen cannot be considered weak in terms of its current rate of exchange with the dollar, the exchange rate is working favorably for us" (Muneo Munekuni, vice president of Honda Motor Company). The automobile industry is strongly hoping for a return to the level of 120 yen per dollar. From mid-December last year, when the exchange rate fell to 110 yen per dollar, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have announced their plans to raise the prices of their cars in the American market after suffering a fall in their export earnings. The trend of a weak yen, although small in scale, is working favorably for the management of each automaker. Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, says: "With the trend of a weak yen appearing, conditions are being created in which we can restore our business performance." Each automaker has compiled its budget in anticipation that the yen will continue to appreciate against the dollar during the latter half of fiscal year 1993. While Toyota Motor Corporation has anticipated an exchange rate of 110 yen per dollar, Nissan Motor Company anticipates 105, while Mazda Motor Corporation foresees 108. For every unit the yen depreciates, it is possible for each automaker to reap earnings of 3-10 billion yen. Whenever the yen has appreciated in the past, each automaker has overcome difficulties resulting from the appreciation by simply reducing exports and increasing overseas production. If the automakers stop exporting cars amid a decline in domestic production, employee redundancy and a surplus of production equipment will result. Household Electrical Appliances Toshiba Corporation, which loses about 4-4.5 billion yen for each yen unit of appreciation, welcomes the weak yen, saying: "We feel helped a bit by the weak yen. The weak yen will increase our ordinary income. Our profits are expected to exceed our losses due to the difference in the quotations in our exchange contracts." Many household electric appliance manufacturers have compiled their respective budgets in anticipation that the dollar-yen exchange rate will continue to hover around 105 yen per dollar during the later half of this year. Sony Corporation, meanwhile, is a bit pessimistic. The major consumer electronics maker says: "We have suffered a great loss from differences in quotations because we have concluded exchange contracts at about 108 yen per dollar. The current weakness of the yen will not generate an immediate effect of improving our performance." President Takashi Kitaoka of Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. said: "We expect that the weak yen will put an end to our sluggish exports; however, we are not supposed to fully boost exports because the latest appreciation of the yen was triggered by the growth of the nation's trade surplus." Steel The current weakness of the yen is giving breathing space to seamless pipe makers in the steel industry. The drastic appreciation of the yen is expected to cause a loss of more than 10 billion yen for each seamless pipe maker in its 1994 January-March settlement of account. Therefore, seamless pipe makers have begun studying the possibility of lowering production while continuing their efforts to cut costs. An executive of NKK [Nippon Kokan Limited] Corporation says: "If the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar stands at 120 yen per dollar, we can manage to withstand international competition. The yen has depreciated by 10 units from the time its appreciation peaked last year, and this will help us reap 3 billion yen in profits. We hope the yen will depreciate a little more." Chemicals, Textiles Chemical and textile industries are proceeding with their plans to move their production overseas. Asahi Chemical Industry Company, for example, is now promoting a project in China to produce nylon material, and is forging a partnership with Du Pont in the United States to produce chemical products in Southeast Asia. Reiichi Yumikura, president of Asahi Chemical Industry Company, says definitively: "A small depreciation of the yen cannot lead to a change in our business strategy." Now that Japan is committed to lowering tariffs on imported chemical products following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (the multilateral trade negotiations of GATT), companies in the chemical industry find themselves in a situation where they cannot back away from plans to streamline their businesses and bolster their competitiveness.
