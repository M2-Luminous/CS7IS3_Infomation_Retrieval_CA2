Speaking about the 26 April meeting of the leaders of "five right-wing and centrist parties," KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky reportedly described it "as unlikely that all of these parties would contest the elections with a single slate of candidates. He supposes, however, that the number of slates of candidates will be under five."
