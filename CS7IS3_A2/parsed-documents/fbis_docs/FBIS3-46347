This was learned today from the Ministry of Public Security. The 5-million-word research report offers "systematic and thorough analysis and discussions" on the overall situation, causes and trends of current crime in China, and introduces new tactics to curb them, said a ministry spokesman. A committee consisting of a dozen political and legal experts in the country and 20 provincial representatives met in Beijing today to assess this research result. The spokesman said that more than 1,000 experts conducted investigations in 20 provinces for three years, with some 10,000 criminal cases and 300 police sub-stations surveyed. Through this research, according to the spokesman, China has established a computer system to collect, process, store and consult on criminal information. Some special research institutions and other academic bodies on crime have also been set up. "This research is of great value for fighting against crime and promoting China's criminology theories," said Vice-Minister Bai Jingfu at the symposium. A large number of personnel have been trained in this research, and some have become experts in research, education and public security work.
