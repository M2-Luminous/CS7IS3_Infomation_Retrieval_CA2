Zhou Jue, the spokesman, said that some NPC deputies of the Guangdong provincial delegation raised a bill suggesting that the National People's Congress make a decision to organize the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and its district organizations in 1997 after the termination of the political structure of Hong Kong established by the British government. The Third Meeting of the presidium of the NPC Second Session decided to submit the bill to the NPC Law Committee first for deliberation, he said. Zhou said that Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements broke down because of the sabotage of the British side. Under such circumstances, the last political structure elected according to British Hong Kong government's legislation will come to an end with the termination of the British jurisdiction over Hong Kong. "It cannot extend beyond June 30, 1997," he said. The preliminary work committee for the SAR will unite with Hong Kong compatriots, and make preparations for the SAR, its first government and legislature in accordance with the NPC decision on organization methods of the first government and legislative assembly of the SAR, Zhou said. "No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people have the determination and capacity to resume the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, realize smooth transition of power and maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity," he said.
