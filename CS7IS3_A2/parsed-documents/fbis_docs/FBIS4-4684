He made the remark during a news conference at a hotel in Kyoto, where he made an appearance during part of his stumping tour. Specifically, Ichikawa proposed a plan to set up a new "council on basic issues" (tentative name) under the coalition party representatives' conference to coordinate policies among the ruling coalition parties in preparation for the next general election. He plans to formally present the proposal at a 4 April representatives meeting. Regarding the political situation since the enactment of the political reform bills, Ichikawa said: "The situations at home and abroad have drastically changed since the coalition government's inauguration last July, as exemplified by such developments as the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development." He then stressed the need for working out agreements among ruling coalition parties to promote cooperation in the next general election, saying: "We should work out both an agreement on mutually essential points and a new outline of policies." In the ruling coalition alliance, a plan to set up a "policy study group" was recently shelved due to opposition by such parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan. This study group was expected to serve as a stepping stone toward the formation of a new party to unify the coalition partners into a single party. In this regard, Ichikawa said: "In the future, even should the ruling coalition parties decide not to move toward (the formation of) a new party, they cannot cooperate in elections unless their basic policies are coordinated." Regarding the process of making adjustments among ruling coalition parties in selecting candidates for the next general election, Ichikawa said: "I expected the process to begin in April, but the issue of setting up a policy study group has created unnecessary misunderstandings, resulting in straining the relations (among the coalition partners). Therefore, there may be a slight delay." He thus indicated the process is expected to start later than originally planned.
