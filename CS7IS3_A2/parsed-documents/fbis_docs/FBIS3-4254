This sharp contrast has given rise to speculation that China may well fail to sustain its economic momentum in the long run. But a senior Chinese economist believes a quick fix is at hand. "And, it's no surprise to see enterprises deep in trouble as our economy is in a transition from a planned to a market one," said Li Wuwei, a professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) has maintained double- digit expansion in about three consecutive years. Meantime, State enterprises have watched their profits slide. About one-third of State industrial enterprises are running in the red, siphoning off 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) in subsidies from the government each year. How so? "The profits of State industries have been squeezed by higher production costs resulting from soaring prices of raw materials," Li explained. Take Shanghai, for example. The city's State enterprises spent an extra 8 billion yuan ($920 million) in the late 1980s to offset higher prices for raw materials. But these enterprises recouped only 7 billion yuan ($800 million) even after raising prices for their own products. Thus they faced a deficit of 1 billion yuan ($115 million). At the same time, though, the raw material sector profited by the same amount. Li says that 15 to 20 percent of the revenue of the city's State industrial enterprises went into the hands of the raw material and transportation sectors, which had raised their prices by a huge margin. Still another 30 per cent of revenue was absorbed by the service sector, including banks, insurance companies and advertisement agencies. Incomplete statistics show that the service trade made up 38 percent of the city's GDP last year, compared with only 25 percent 10 years before. Higher wages have also reduced the profit margins of State enterprises. Despite the price increases for raw materials, State enterprises in many cases cannot raise the prices of their products freely. For instance, the prices of oil products cannot be raised even though a big increase in crude oil prices is due in a few months. State industries had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, when the prices of raw materials were kept artificially low by rigid central planning. The service trade was almost nonexistent. But at the same time the enterprises, unlike those in Western countries, were responsible for the welfare of their employees. This was once deemed the superiority of socialism. "A shrinking profit margin due to the booming raw material and service sectors is not the real threat to State industrial enterprises because the latter can adjust their products' prices over time," Li said. "The real way out now is to relieve the enterprises of the extra burden by setting up a sound social insurance system.
