It will be followed by a trip by a Chinese minister to Paris and by a trip by French ministers to China in order to develop economic relations. Indeed, the Chinese believe that, in several spheres, French industry can bring them a lot, and it can also bring a lot to employment in our country, for instance through the development of power stations, telecommunications projects, and -- it remains to be seen whether this takes place -- projects for the export of French wheat to China. The aim was to turn a page in our relations and to resume relations which would be more fruitful and more useful for the two countries. This was my aim, and I believe that this aim has been achieved. [Harrouard] You tackled the issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities. You chose to do so discreetly because you believe that it is more efficient. However, dissidents were arrested during your stay. Didn't that disturb your visit? [Balladur] From the moment attitudes towards economy and trade get closer, we enter the 21st century where attitudes concerning political freedom, human rights, must be closer. This is what I told my interlocutors. I told them it was an evolution for which all countries should prepare themselves. As for the precise problems which may arise, I mentioned them in a purely private conversation and I had the opportunity to say that, as far as this was concerned, it seemed to me that it was more efficient to remain discreet because one should refrain from upsetting one's interlocutor unnecessarily. Let us look at what other countries do, those who would like to give the impression that they can lecture others on this subject: They are often those who ignore the beliefs they usually show off when it is in their interest. As far as we French are concerned, we must do two things simultaneously: We must continue to assert our general beliefs -- this is our right -- while respecting the attitudes and the beliefs of the others, and making sure that, through understanding and dialogue, things will evolve gradually. [Harrouard] Does your visit to China mark the desire of the prime minister to be more involved in international affairs, and to go on more visits abroad? [Balladur] I believe that, by far, my main task is in France. This is the main reason behind my mandate. Nevertheless, in order to improve the situation of our country... [pauses] it is starting to improve in the economic sphere and as far as employment is concerned, although there are still many difficulties. However, there are a whole range of international matters which, quite obviously, are of interest to the government. I believe that, as far as foreign policy is concerned, our constitution gives responsibility to the president, of course, and to the government, and that they must carry them out on good terms. This is what happened for the preparation of my trip to China, this is also what happened as far as GATT was concerned, or last year's monetary crisis. I have no plans to travel to any other foreign country in the near future. Should I have other plans, it would be because I consider it an important issue which affects the life of our country and its economic and interior policy.
