The tendency to return to monopolism in the sector, secrecy, and the adoption of decisions without taking account of the opinions of specialists and the public has been observed over the course of the year. "The endeavors of the state committee for nuclear and radiation safety to counteract this," Heorhiy Kopchynskyy said, "have led to a situation where over time they stopped inviting us to consultations at the government level where the fate of nuclear power was being decided. Our attempts to introduce world approaches to safety problems evoked active counteraction on the part of the government. This was capped by the adoption of the decision on the further operation of Chernobyl nuclear power station, when the opponents of the decision -- the Health Ministry, the Environment Ministry, and the state committee for nuclear and radiation safety -- were not considered either in the government or in parliament." "While supporting the existence of nuclear power," Heorhiy Kopchynskyy observed, "I consider the priority task to be its safety, which the state committee for nuclear and radiation safety should be observing. But when the committee becomes a burden for the government and decisions are taken behind its back, then I consider it impossible to remain there. I do not want to bear the responsibility for others' decisions that run counter to the very philosophy of safety."
