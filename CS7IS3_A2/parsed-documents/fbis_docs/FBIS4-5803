Takemura, appearing on TV ASAHI's "News Station" program, said, "nowadays, some politicians say the coalition should expel Sakigake or the Social Democratic Party (SDP), so our party has come to be regarded as fragile." "Our party does not have an unconditional desire to remain in the government," whatever humiliation it may suffer, said Takemura, who has exerted his influence as the chief cabinet secretary under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced last Friday he is resigning. "Because we have that resolve (to splinter if necessary), we are now speaking our mind," said Takemura, leader of a small coalition component formed by 15 members of the 511-seat House of Representatives. But Takemura hinted that if the coalition's majority group led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] stop trying to marginalize him, Sakigake is ready to continue to put its weight behind the coalition to keep it in power. His comments came as the three-way caucus of Sakigake, the SDP and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) is confronting the Shinseito-led camp that includes Komeito [Clean Government Party] and Hosokawa's Japan New Party over who should be the next premier. Takemura has reportedly been squabbling with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the coalition's most influential politician, over who should take the role of the behind-the-scenes fixer in deciding the course of the coalition government. "I believe neither our side nor their camp think we may allow the coalition to dissolve," Takemura said. "I do not want to allow the current combination of coalition parties to crumble, either," he said. "I do not dislike Mr. Ozawa and I believe we can get along with each other." "However, his repentance and readiness to restart is necessary," Takemura said.
