Solovyev--adopted a decree on changes in the structure and leadership of this oblast's administration. The decision of the Oblast Council of People's Deputies "On the Scheme for Governing the Oblast and the Structure of the Oblast Administration's Organs," dated 12 November 1992," was reversed. The decree adopted on 24 January 1994 abolished the positions of all the oblast administration's deputy heads, including that of the first chairman of the coordinating council and the administrator of affairs. In order to head up and coordinate the activities of the oblast administration's structural subdivisions under the new conditions, the above-mentioned decree introduced seven deputies instead of the previous nine ones. The following persons were appointed deputy heads of the oblast administration: for affairs of industrial policy and infrastructure development--V.B. Bukrin, for affairs of budgetary policy--A.Ye. Prokin, for links with the public, mass media, and the development of education and culture--B.A. Mizrakhi, for affairs of economic, privatization, and investment policy--V.B. Khristenko, for affairs pertaining to the development of market-type relations in the field of public services, foreign-economic activity, as well as the fight against crime and corruption--N.R. Sudenkov, for affairs involving agrarian policy and the development of market-type relations in agriculture--Zh.K. Altynbayev, and for affairs involving social policy, public health care, as well as eliminating the consequences of natural disasters and rehabilitation--V.A. Yachmenev. * * * L.A. Ivanova submitted her resignation from the post of deputy head of the Chelyabinsk Administration. She gave as the reason for her departure the fact that--as an official--she bore responsibility for the absence of monitoring controls on the spending of budgetary funds in the committee on medicine. As our readers probably know already, the office of the municipal procurator has uncovered instances of large-scale misappropriations or even thefts in this structural subdivision. There is an ongoing investigation into this matter.
