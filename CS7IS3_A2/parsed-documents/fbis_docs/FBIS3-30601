"We can't go on indefinitely asking countries quite far away from fighting to make sacrifices, if there is no readiness of the parties to make peace," he told a press conference at the end of a visit to Sofia. Bulgaria is one of the Central European countries whose trade and economy have been badly hit by the United Nations embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia. "I do not favour lifting sanctions," Owen added. "It would be premature. But I don't think the status quo can carry on indefinitely." "Sanctions are applied for a purpose... to achieve a settlement," Owen said. "If there is no way at the end of the day to achieve a settlement, questions would be asked about sanctions. But we have yet not reached that state." Owen and his UN co-mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg had talks here Thursday with President Zhelio Zhelev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov before going on Friday to Albania in a tour of Yugoslavia's neighbours. In Tirana, presidential spokesman Genc Pollo said they saw President Sali Berisha. Albania has expressed concern about the war spreading to Kosovo, the restive northern province of Serbia which has a 90 percent Albanian population, or Macedonia, another former member of the Yugoslav federation.
