The party has secured 65 percent votes which is 1.7 percent less than a two-thirds majority. The ruling National Party has polled 20.6 percent votes, while the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party has secured 8.1 percent.

The postponement is due to the delay in counting of votes. About 100 world leaders are expected to attend the installation of Dr. Mandela as the first Black president of South Africa.
