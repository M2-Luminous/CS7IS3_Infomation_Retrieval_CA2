Introduction The world's deepest drop shaft facility for microgravity experiments, using a former coal mine shaft, was constructed at Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, Japan, in 1991. This drop shaft has a free fall depth of 490 m and a total depth of 710 m. Unlike similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which have vacuum shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been chosen for this facility in view of the exceptional depth of the shaft. The rocket-shaped capsule (1.8 m in diameter, 8 m in length, 5.7 tons in maximum weight) falls through the drop shaft and produces microgravity of approximately 1 x 10[.sup]-5[/] G for 10 seconds. A double capsule arrangement has been adopted. Microgravity condition is produced by floating the inner capsule in which the experimental devices are loaded, in the vacuum space of the outer capsule while falling. Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite each other in the drop shaft, and the outer capsule falls between the rails controlled by magnetic guidance system. The atmospheric drag exerted on the outer capsule is counteracted by a compressed air jet thruster. The motion of the inner capsule (except that in the direction of gravitation) is controlled by electromagnetic bearings just after being released. In this paper, we present an outline of this system. 2. Basic Specifications and System Concept On development, basic specifications were settled as follows: 1. Microgravity time: over 10 seconds 2. Microgravity level: less than 1.0 x 10[.sup]-4[/] G 3. Deceleration at braking: less than 10 G 4. Maximum payload weight: approximately 1,000 kg 5. Real-time data transmission device between falling capsule and control room including color image. The adopted system concepts to realize these required specifications are as follows: (1) Unlike similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which have vacuum shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been adopted, in view of the exceptional depth of the shaft, and in due consideration of the simplicity of braking, recovering, and maintaining the capsule. (2) Atmospheric drag while falling is compensated for by a compressed air jet thruster. (3) A double capsule arrangement is adopted. The inner capsule in which the experimental devices are loaded, floats in the vacuum space of the outer capsule while falling and produces microgravity condition. (4) Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite each other in the drop shaft and the outer capsule falls between rails controlled by magnetic guidance system. (5) The free fall of 490 m results in Corioli's force displacing the inner capsule horizontally by 175mm relative to the outer capsule, which falls vertically guided by the rails. Then the inner capsule is released from the offset position by 90mm westward and lands at a position offset by 85mm eastward, relative to the center axis of the outer capsule. (6) After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges into the closed tube and is gently decelerated by compressing air inside the tube. (7) Recovery of the capsule is done by operating the capsule-recovering equipment from the control room. (8) An optical communication system between the falling capsule and the bottom of the shaft is installed. A schematic cross-section of this facility is shown in Figure 2. 3. Structural Design of the Capsule Figure 1 shows the outside view of the capsule. Figure 1. General View of Capsule Figure 2. System Concept The capsule is composed of three modules as illustrated in Figure 3. The total length is 8,375mm, the diameter is 1,800mm, and the maximum weight is 5.7 tons including the experimental devices. Figure 3. Structure of Capsule Module The capsule is a welded aluminum alloy structure. The main structural part of each module is a stiffened shell 7mm in thickness. As the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is exposed to an aerodynamical force that is too large to be controlled completely by magnetic guidance system. Touchdown bearings (called skids) are provided at the joint part of the modules to prevent the guide magnets from touching the rails. Experiments to determine the shape of the capsule were carried out using a wind tunnel. Tens of models of different shapes were tested. The models were 1/10 scale of the real capsule. Aerodynamic forces acting on the models were measured. The influence of the shape of added parts, such as guide magnet, on air resistance force was examined. The influence of structures installed in the drop shaft on air drag was also studied. The shape of the outer capsule and the capacity of the compressed air jet thruster to counteract air drag while falling were determined from these experimental data. The space between the inner and outer capsules is evacuated to prevent acoustic vibration being transmitted to the inner capsule. The inner and outer capsules are connected by fine optical cables to transmit the signal while falling. 4. Release of Inner and Outer Capsule and Microgravity Performance Figure 4 shows the capsule in the condition ready for release, but still suspended at the top of the shaft. The outer capsule is locked to the shaft top by a hydraulic clamp, with the inner capsule suspended by an electromagnetic clamp to the top of the evacuated interior payload module. Releasing of the inner and outer capsules follows the time sequence indicated in Figure 5. By decreasing the coil current of the electromagnet suspending the inner capsule, the inner capsule begins to fall. When the force retained by magnetic clamp lowers to 85 percent of the inner capsule weight, an answer signal indicating ``inner capsule released'' is transmitted. Some 35 msec later, the outer capsule release command is generated, and the outer capsule is actually released about 20 msec later. Figure 4. Schematic Diagram of Capsule Figure 5. Time Sequence of Inner and Outer Capsule Upon release, the outer capsule is magnetically guided in its fall between a pair of steel rails laid along the drop shaft. The inner capsule must fall freely in the vacuum space surrounding it without coming into mechanical contact with the outer capsule structure. For this purpose, its movement is restricted by magnetic bearings to five degrees of freedom except downward translation, for 0.4 second just after release. As the inner capsule is released about 55 msec before the outer capsule is released, the inner capsule displaces downward to dislodge itself from the narrow gap between the magnetic bearings about one second after release. The vertical distance between the two capsules is detected by an optical sensor mounted on the outer capsule. The thruster jets are then controlled by a feedback loop using the signal from the sensor, to maintain the inner capsule within the prescribed range of distance: between the lower edge of the magnetic bearings and the bottom of the shock absorber. After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges into the deceleration zone. At this time, the inner capsule is still floating. To minimize the impact of landing on the bottom shock absorber, the distance between the inner and outer capsules is controlled so that when entering the braking zone, the inner capsule is as close as possible to the bottom shock absorber. 5. Magnetic Guidance System of Outer Capsule A pair of vertical steel rails (144mm x 160mm in cross section) is installed diametrically opposing each other in the drop shaft. The attraction-type electromagnetic levitation method was chosen. Six pairs of electromagnets are provided on the outer capsule, each pair saddling a guide rail as shown in Figure 6. Their attractive forces are individually controlled for stiffness and damping by controllers mounted on the capsule. Other components provided near each magnet are an eddy current displacement meter to detect the gap between the magnet and rail, and an accelerometer to measure the absolute acceleration in the horizontal direction. The magnetic force of each magnet is 3,000 N max. in Y-direction and 1,500 N max. in Z-direction. The rail-to-magnet gap is 8mm, and the rail-to-skid gap is set to 2.5 to 3mm for each side. Figure 6. Layout of Guide Magnet The motion of the capsule is controlled in five axes (i.e., except that in the direction of gravity pull) by six pairs of electromagnets. Because two pairs are in the Y-direction and four are in the Z-direction, control of the Z-axis can become excessive. For this reason, we have adopted the co-operative control method for the Z-axis: only three motions, translation, inclination, and rotation about the Z-axis, are picked up in input signals, and are subjected to positive control. The input signals for control are the gap between the magnet and the rail, and absolute acceleration in horizontal direction, from which absolute velocity, relative velocity, and relative displacement (relative to the rail) are fed back for control. Optimization of each control gain was done by trial and error in more than 10 drop tests. The block diagram of the magnetic guidance system is illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7. Block Diagram of Magnetic Guidance System The outer capsule falling data in Y-direction as seen at the guide magnet are presented in Figure 8. It shows that in the free fall zone, the outer capsule is satisfactorily guided by the magnetic guidance system and falls without touching the rails. But as the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is exposed to large aerodynamic forces and the skids of the capsule touch the rails many times while falling. Figure 8. Outer Capsule Falling Data 6. Motion Control of the Inner Capsule Just After Released To maintain the microgravity environment created in the inner capsule on its free fall, it is necessary that the inner capsule does not touch the outer capsule. The gap between the two capsules is 75mm on each side, and as such contact can occur when the inner capsule is released with a certain initial velocity, the initial velocity in the horizontal direction must be reduced to less than 7.5mm/s. To reduce this initial velocity, the motion of the inner capsule (except that in the direction of gravitation) is controlled for 0.4 second just after release. To perform this control, five sets of magnetic bearings are mounted on the outer capsule; two sets against the top portion of the inner capsule and three sets against its bottom portion. The activation sequence of the magnetic bearings is as follows: First, the inner capsule is held by the inner capsule holding clamp (top magnet), which in turn is supported with a rod by the outer capsule. Then the lower three pairs of magnets are turned on to bring the capsule into an equilibrium position determined by the tension of the top magnet's support rod and the combined control force of the three sets of magnets. Because activation of the upper two pairs of magnets at this moment will bring about an excess degree of freedom of two for the force acting on the capsule, the control point may not be stabilized properly. To forestall this problem, the target control point (i.e., the zero-in point) that was originally set for the upper bearings is cancelled first, and is reset to the status quo position. As a consequence, when the upper pairs are activated, the inner capsule does not move from this target position. Then, highly stable control of the five sets of magnetic bearings becomes possible after the inner capsule is released from the top magnet. We call this process the auto presetting. Since the time expended in motion control is that much time lost for the microgravity experimentation, the control time must be as short as possible. Although this time can be reduced, theoretically at least, by raising the control gain, but in reality the gain cannot be raised indefinitely, because all the control is done from the outer capsule, such an act will inevitably couple the motion of the inner capsule to that of the outer capsule. The control gain and the control duration time are optimized by conducting simulation analysis for the motion of both capsules, and are duly improved conducting drop tests. 7. Compressed Air Jet Thruster System The thruster device is mounted on the thruster module as shown in Figure 3. Three compressed air reservoirs of 20 MPa are installed. There are three compressed air lines, in each line, air is led through a pressure control valve that ensures the prescribed service pressure, and then branches into three thruster valves, each feeding a pair of nozzles, each pair being mounted diametrically across the outer capsule axis and numbering 18 in all. The nine thruster valves control the jets issuing from the relevant nozzles in the ON/OFF mode: the combination of valves 0 to 9 ensures control in nine steps of aggregate thrust force. For these valves, a compact lightweight type was selected after thorough testing to ascertain its capability to control a large flow of compressed air with a sufficiently rapid response. The service pressure is 4.7 MPa and the maximum available thrust force is 7.15 KN. The thruster control system flow is illustrated in Figure 9. The vertical distance between the inner and outer capsule is detected by infrared sensor. The transmitted signal is converted from analog to digital form after passing a low-pass filter, then processed in the PID algorithm to derive the thruster valve manipulating variable. The output from controller is converted into driving signals for the nine thruster valves, to regulate these valves in ON/OFF mode through valve drivers. To eliminate accidental actuation by noise as well as hunting repetition, the controller software is provided with a hysteresis lag of 0.06 V between OFF and ON signals. Figure 9. Block Diagram of Gas Jet Thruster System Thruster system operating data are presented in Figure 10. The inner capsule, having been released about 55 msec earlier than the outer capsule, is dislodged from the narrow gap between the magnetic bearings in about 1 second; when it reaches the prescribed control position, the thruster valves are actuated to accelerate the outer capsule. In this case, seven thruster valves are actuated. Then, the thrusters are shut down once, and as the capsule continues to fall, the increasing atmospheric drag exerted by the accelerating downward capsule velocity is counteracted by successive re-actuation of the thruster valve. The foregoing progress of the vertical distance between the inner and the outer capsule is timed so that, when the inner capsule attains a position 20-60mm above the shock absorber, the capsule enters the braking zone. Figure 10. Thruster System Operating Data 8. Braking and Recovery of the Capsule The capsule 1.8 m in diameter falls through the free fall zone 4.8 m in diameter for 10 seconds. Then the capsule plunges into the braking tube 1.9 m in diameter and 200 m in length with a velocity of 98 m/sec. Because the bottom of the braking tube is closed, and the gap between the capsule and braking tube is very narrow, air inside the braking tube is compressed and decelerates the capsule. Fourteen sets of mechanical braking shoes are installed at the bottom of the braking tube. Once the capsule comes to this section, braking shoes catch the capsule mechanically and the capsule is stopped. Confirming that the capsule is held by the mechanical brake, the capsule recovering equipment is sent down from the top of the shaft on a wire rope and the capsule is recovered on the ground some tens of minutes after being released. If, by any chance, the mechanical brake should malfunction, the capsule plunges into the emergency stopping zone filled with a cushioning material and is stopped without serious damage. This braking system was developed by Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. 9. Laser Communication An optical communication system is installed. In this system, laser light is transmitted through the air between the capsule and the bottom of the shaft. The results of experiments in the falling capsule are observed in real-time by this optical transmitter. The command data can be also transmitted in real-time from the control room to the capsule by this system. This communication system was developed by Toshiba Corporation. 10. Performance The falling tests at the site prove that the required specifications are fully met as follows: Microgravity time: 10.0-10.2 sec. Microgravity level: approximately 10[.sup]-5[/] G Deceleration at braking: about 8.3 G Figures 11 and 12 show the acceleration of the inner capsule measured during falling test. Figure 11.
