FR941028-2-00168 FR941028-2-00109 •The ``very low-risk'' category generally applies only to an entire facility. A very low-risk facility is one in which (a) patients with active TB are not admitted to inpatient areas but may receive initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation or outpatient management in outpatient areas (e.g., ambulatory-care and emergency departments) and (b) patients who may have active TB and need inpatient care are promptly referred to a collaborating facility. In such facilities, the outpatient areas in which exposure to patients with active TB could occur should be assessed and assigned to the appropriate low-, intermediate-, or high-risk category. Categorical assignment will depend on the number of TB patients examined in the area during the preceding year and whether there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of M. tuberculosis in the area. If TB cases have been reported in the community, but no patients with active TB have been examined in the outpatient area during the preceding year, the area can be designated as very low risk (e.g., many medical offices). The referring and receiving facilities should establish a referral agreement to prevent inappropriate management and potential loss to follow-up of patients suspected of having TB during evaluation in the triage system of a very low-risk facility. In some facilities in which TB patients are admitted to inpatient areas, a very low-risk protocol may be appropriate for areas (e.g., administrative areas) or occupational groups that have only a very remote possibility of exposure to M. tuberculosis . The very low-risk category may also be appropriate for outpatient facilities that do not provide initial assessment of persons who may have TB, but do screen patients for active TB as part of a limited medical screening before undertaking specialty care (e.g., dental settings). •``Low-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is not greater than that for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, (b) no clusters* of PPD test conversions have occurred, (c) person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis has not been detected, and (d) fewer than six TB patients are examined or treated per year. * Cluster: two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within a 3-month period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational group, and epidemiologic evidence suggests occupational (nosocomial) transmission. •``Intermediate-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is not greater than that for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, (b) no clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred, (c) person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis) has not been detected, and (d) six or more patients with active TB are examined or treated each year. Survey data suggest that facilities in which six or more TB patients are examined or treated each year may have an increased risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis (CDC, unpublished data); thus, areas in which six or more patients with active TB are examined or treated each year (or occupational groups in which HCWs are likely to be exposed to six or more TB patients per year) should be classified as ``intermediate risk.'' •``High-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is significantly greater than for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, and epidemiologic evaluation suggests nosocomial transmission; or (b) a cluster of PPD test conversions has occurred, and epidemiologic evaluation suggests nosocomial transmission of M. tuberculosis ; or (c) possible person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis has been detected. •If no data or insufficient data for adequate determination of risk have been collected, such data should be compiled, analyzed, and reviewed expeditiously. b. Community TB profile. •A profile of TB in the community that is served by the facility should be obtained from the public health department. This profile should include, at a minimum, the incidence (and prevalence, if available) of active TB in the community and the drug-susceptibility patterns of M. tuberculosis isolates (i.e., the antituberculous agents to which each isolate is susceptible and those to which it is resistant) from patients in the community. c. Case surveillance. •Data concerning the number of suspected and confirmed active TB cases among patients and HCWs in the facility should be systematically collected, reviewed, and used to estimate the number of TB isolation rooms needed, to recognize possible clusters of nosocomial transmission, and to assess the level of potential occupational risk. The number of TB patients in specific areas of a facility can be obtained from laboratory surveillance data on specimens positive for AFB smears or M. tuberculosis cultures, from infection-control records, and from databases containing information about hospital discharge diagnoses. •Drug-susceptibility patterns of M. tuberculosis isolates from TB patients treated in the facility should be reviewed to identify the frequency and patterns of drug resistance. This information may indicate a need to modify the initial treatment regimen or may suggest possible nosocomial transmission or increased occupational risk. d. Analysis of HCW PPD test screening data. •Results of HCW PPD testing should be recorded in the individual HCW's employee health record and in a retrievable aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. Personal identifying information should be handled confidentially. PPD test conversion rates should be calculated at appropriate intervals to estimate the risk for PPD test conversions for each area of the facility and for each specific occupational group not assigned to a specific area (Table 2). To calculate PPD test conversion rates, the total number of previously PPD-negative HCWs tested in each area or group (i.e., the denominator) and the number of PPD test conversions among HCWs in each area or group (the numerator) must be obtained. •PPD test conversion rates for each area or occupational group should be compared with rates for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely and with previous conversion rates in the same area or group to identify areas or groups where the risk for occupational PPD test conversions may be increased. A low number of HCWs in a specific area may result in a greatly increased rate of conversion for that area, although the actual risk may not be significantly greater than that for other areas. Testing for statistical significance (e.g., Fisher's exact test or chi square test) may assist interpretation; however, lack of statistical significance may not rule out a problem (i.e., if the number of HCWs tested is low, there may not be adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference). Thus, interpretation of individual situations is necessary. •An epidemiologic investigation to evaluate the likelihood of nosocomial transmission should be conducted if PPD test conversions are noted (Section II.K.1). •The frequency and comprehensiveness of the HCW PPD testing program should be evaluated periodically to ensure that all HCWs who should be included in the program are being tested at appropriate intervals. For surveillance purposes, earlier detection of transmission may be enhanced if HCWs in a given area or occupational group are tested on different scheduled dates rather than all being tested on the same date (Section II.J.3). e. Review of TB patient medical records. •The medical records of a sample of TB patients examined at the facility can be reviewed periodically to evaluate infection-control parameters (Table 1). Parameters to examine may include the intervals from date of admission until (a) TB was suspected, (b) specimens for AFB smears were ordered, (c) these specimens were collected, (d) tests were performed, and (e) results were reported. Moreover, the adequacy of the TB treatment regimens that were used should be evaluated. •Medical record reviews should note previous hospital admissions of TB patients before the onset of TB symptoms. Patient-to-patient transmission may be suspected if active TB occurs in a patient who had a prior hospitalization during which exposure to another TB patient occurred or if isolates from two or more TB patients have identical characteristic drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns.
