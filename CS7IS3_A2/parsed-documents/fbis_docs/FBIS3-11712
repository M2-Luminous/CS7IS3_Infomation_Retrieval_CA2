Precisely for this reason -- even though we performed all the protocol formalities -- one cannot fail to note that his stay in Brasilia was not consistent with Brazil's importance in the hemisphere. The five hours that Gore allocated to the last leg of his tour were enough to meet the ends established for his trip, namely, to sign a new science and technology cooperation treaty, to hold talks with President Itamar Franco on the summit of the Americas (to be held in December), and to say some things to the U.S. and Brazilian communities. It was a working stopover, and as such, served its purpose. From the wider viewpoint under which relations between Brazil and the United States should be analyzed, this five-hour stopover was enough to clearly spell out the place Brazil occupies on the Clinton Administration's list of political priorities: For the White House, Argentina and Chile take precedence over Brazil. The brevity of his stay prevented Gore from explaining to President Franco the objectives of President Clinton's Latin American policy. Undoubtedly, the hemispheric summit -- at which the heads of state and government of the Americas will discuss common economic and political problems -- is one of these objectives, and it was discussed with the Brazilian head of state. The Clinton administration bases its Latin American policy on what is known at the U.S. Department of State as substantive symmetry [preceding words in English]. This expression -- with a geometrical flavor -- means, for example, that the United States is seeking to recover a sense of belonging to society and the community while Latin America is pursuing reconciliation between democracy and politics; that the United States is reforming its health care, education, and security systems while Latin America is beginning to turn to the "social agenda." It is from this substantive symmetry that the United States is trying to establish a new relationship with Latin America. One should not forget that this new approach includes problems that have yet to be overcome, such as the fight against drug trafficking -- which Washington deems a matter of national security -- and the new role of the Armed Forces. Al Gore pays more attention to environmental and technological questions. Even though he did not directly raise the issue of telecommunications, he must have surely left a message -- at a time when the leading U.S. companies are devising schemes for a worldwide telephone network, it is unthinkable that Brazil should continue to maintain a whimsical monopoly; but this fact merely prevents Brazil from really entering the high-speed high-tech era.
