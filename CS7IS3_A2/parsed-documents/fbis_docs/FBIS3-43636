Chiluba fired Health Minister Boniface Kawimbe and Dean Mung'omba, Deputy Minister in the National Commission for Development Planning, but gave a reason far removed from allegations of corruption. He accused Kawimbe and MUng'omba of "irresponsible indiscretion" in holding a news conference on their return from the Paris Club meeting last month before briefing him on the outcome of the meeting. At that meeting, western donors demanded stronger measures than the tougher anti-corruption legislation proposed by Chiluba's government. They are reported to have demanded the removal of Ministers engaged in drug trafficking and other corruption. Announcing the Cabinet shuffle at a news conference, Chiluba said his Cabinet was clean and he saw no reason to fire more ministers. He denied suppressing corruption probe reports and produced a report exonerating all but one Minister. The report recommended the prosecution of the new Health Minister, Michael Sata, who was found to have failed to declare an interest in a financial deal involving his ministry.
