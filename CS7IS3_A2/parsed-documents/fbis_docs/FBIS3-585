Kemp] [Text] Levubu March 9 SAPA -- The South African Government would take steps to safeguard South African citizens, assets and interests in Bophuthatswana, President F W de Klerk said on Wednesday [9 March]. Addressing journalists during a stopover on his northern Transvaal election tour, he said the government's attitude was that Bophuthatswana had to be re-incorporated into South Africa. However, any South African measures would only focus on safeguarding South African interests in the troubled homeland. Mr de Klerk said the best way for President Lucas Mangope's ruling party to test its support in Bophutshwana was to participate in the elections. "Our political analysis is that Mr Mangope's party does not have widespread support and that he will not do well in the election." Mr de Klerk said the elections could not be delayed indefinitely to accommodate parties still outside the process. He said Parliament would amend the electoral act to allow for the late submission of candidates' lists by political parties participating in the election. He said this was his initiative and he was pleased that both the Transitional Executive Council and the the Independent Electoral Commission had supported the proposal. "It creates logistical space for parties that have registered late to draw up and submit their candidate list for the elections." Mr de Klerk said he was also pleased to hear from media reports that Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Freedom Front, was preparing to lodge its candidate list. Referring to international mediation demanded by the Inkatha Freedom Party, he said he had not received any detailed proposal and remained sceptical that mediation would be successful. Mr de Klerk said the election date could not be altered in any way to accommodate any mediation attempt. Earlier, Mr de Klerk encountered an African National Congress demonstration for the second time on Wednesday when he visited the homestead of Venda's youthful king, Dimbanyika Mpephu, the son of former President Patrick Mpephu. About 100 ANC protesters chanted slogans and toyi-toyied in the grounds of the royal homestead while Mr de Klerk met the king indoors. The demonstrators carried posters stating: "Try and recruit on your white farms" and "De Klerk is a criminal". The demonstrators dispersed after Mr de Klerk's motorcade left for Levubu.
