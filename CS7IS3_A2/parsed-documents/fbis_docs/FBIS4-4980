This is because there is a behind-the-scenes move within the two nations toward holding unofficial talks in an attempt to break the impasse in the trade talks. However, while the United States urges Japan to set up criteria that have the character of numerical targets, the Japanese Government is persistent in setting up criteria just to measure the effectiveness of Japan's efforts to open its market. Is it possible for the two sides to come to a compromise? The following article reviews the focus of the dispute between the two nations and to predict how the situation will turn out. Foreshadowing Confrontation "An outcome of the Miyazawa-Clinton summit last July is one cause of the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit in February." Many of those concerned with the government regard the agreement reached between then Prime Minister Miyazawa and U.S. President Clinton as a cause of the rupture of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. It was specified in the joint statement of the July 1993 summit that progress in Japan's market opening will be measured "on the basis of objective criteria." Those officials said that there are still differences between the two nations in interpreting such a statement. An official who took charge of drafting the joint statement said that Japan urged the United States to specify that objective criteria are not a pledge. However, the United States answered that "if we specify that, we will be not able to win our people's understanding." The official said that the statement eventually became "vague" because of the Japan-U.S. dispute over how to specify objective criteria. Meaning of Objective Criteria A senior Foreign Ministry official said that objective criteria are merely a "yardstick to measure progress in market opening." He said that "it seems that the United States hopes to have Japan set up objective criteria in the form of the Japanese Government's pledge and that the U.S. Government is ready to take sanctions if such a pledge is not fulfilled," thus showing a stand of keeping an eye on U.S. moves. On the contrary, in the United States, particularly within the Congress, there is a hardline view calling on Japan to come up with numerical targets that Japan will achieve to promote a share of foreign products in Japan's market, saying: "Japan will not seriously come to grips with the issue of expanding imports unless clear targets are set." While saying that the United States "will not call for setting up clear numerical targets," such U.S. leaders as U.S. Trade Representative Kantor have been urging Japan to set up an indicator that has the character of numerical targets. Underlying this is that the United States deeply distrusts Japan. However, there is another view. [Bowman] Cutter, presidential assistant (and deputy for economic policy), stresses that "Japan should understand more that the United States is not calling for setting up numerical targets that are subject to sanctions." Just before the February Japan-U.S. summit, Presidential Assistant Cutter reportedly hammered out a compromise proposal in which he said that among priority areas of economic framework talks, numerical targets will not be introduced to the insurance sector, and that in the area of government procurement, the two nations will only analyze the "trend" of Japan's market opening. Although his proposal failed to become an official U.S. proposal, there is still a possibility that it will give a "hint" to resuming economic framework talks. Possibility of Compromise in Government Purchases and Insurance Judging from the U.S. stance not to call for setting up numerical targets, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] sees that a request calling for setting up a target "designed to help foreign products gain a certain market share in the future" is "out of the question, and the United States will not make such a request." Meanwhile, as for the U.S. call for "keeping a growth rate in Japan's imports," MITI views that it is possible that the United States will instead stress that "such a call is not a numerical target, and Japan should accept this as objective criteria." For that reason, MITI says that "both requests are numerical targets, and we cannot accept them," thus indicating a strong posture in rejecting numerical targets. In the February negotiations, Japan and the United States were about to reach an agreement in the area of government procurement and insurance, two of the three priority areas, which are: 1) government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, 2) insurance, and 3) automobiles and auto parts. In view of this, in the course of behind-the-scenes negotiations, it is possible for the two nations to find a breakthrough in the deadlocked talks. Although it is observed that the two nations will try to reach a compromise based on a proposal that places emphasis on "an increase in import trends," the Japanese say that "if we put any kind of a number in a proposal, it will be interpreted as a pledge." In this way, Japan's distrust of the United States is deep-rooted. On the other hand, Japan is required to make efforts to dispel the distrust of the United States, which says "moderate criteria are not effective to promoting Japan's imports." Japanese officials in charge of negotiations "are half in doubt about the U.S. position not to call on Japan to set up numerical targets" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It seems that the two nations' ability to dispel mutual distrust will be the key to a compromise on "objective criteria."
