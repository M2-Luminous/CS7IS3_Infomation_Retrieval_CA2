After one pass around the earth at an approximate altitude of 450 kilometers, the experimental space shuttle code-named Orex splashed down as planned, 2 hours and 10 minutes after liftoff, about 460 kilometers south of Christmas Island in the mid-Pacific. The successful conclusion of the first H-2 series rocket mission catapults Japan among the forerunning nations in rocket technology, opening broad prospects for the launching of commercial satellites, NASDA officials said.
