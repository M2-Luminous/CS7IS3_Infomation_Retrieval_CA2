After an eight-and-a-half-hour flight, they landed aboard a Bundeswehr aircraft at the military section of the Cologne/Bonn airport 10 minutes after midnight. They were welcomed by relatives and friends. The plane also carried 20 Swiss citizens. The Bundeswehr airbus took off from the capital of Burundi, Bujumbura, yesterday afternoon. The Germans had escaped there in convoys. According to the Foreign Ministry, German Ambassador Dieter Hilscher, his wife, and 11 Germans who are trapped in the relay station of Deutsche Welle are still in the Rwandan capital. The evacuation was difficult because hostile troops control the access roads. However, the Germans are to be evacuated from Kigali and gotten to safety as soon as possible. It is still unclear whether the German ambassador will remain in Kigali. [passage omitted]
