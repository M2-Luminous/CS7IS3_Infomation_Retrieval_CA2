The press service of the prosecutor's office said that Kazannik had adopted the decision after acquainting himself with a medical statement which said that Barannikov "needs a special medical examination in hospital to decide on the necessity of surgical treatment which makes it impossible for him to remain in an investigation prison". Barannikov was released on conditions that he does not leave Moscow. Barannikov's lawyer had several times complained that his client was suffering from heart problems. In January Barannikov was transferred from prison to a specially guarded hospital and his lawyer demanded that he be placed under house arrest.
