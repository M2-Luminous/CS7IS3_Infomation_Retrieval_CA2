Sfc. Yi Chung-kuk formerly of a North Korean CBR (chemical, biological and radiological warfare) unit told a press conference in Seoul that North Korea mass-produced bio-chemical weapons developed by the medical school of Kim Il-song University and People's Army Medical College. "I heard laboratories tested newly developed bio-chemical weapons on living bodies of political prisoners," Yi said. "It was also said that in an area near Chagang Province where a chemical plant is located, many nearby people suffered serious headache and pregnant women gave birth to deformed babies due to the leak of toxic substance in June last year." He said high North Korean military officers used to encourage soldiers by saying that they had nothing to fear because the People's Army possesses nuclear arms. Yi said he learned that North Korean officers trained at Soviet military academies cannot be promoted to general since a coup attempt by those taught at military academies in the former USSR was uncovered in October 1992. About his defection, Yi said he left his home in Pyongyang on last Nov. 9 and smuggled himself to Yanji in northeastern China. He could come to South Korea through a third country with the help of ethnic Koreans in Yanji, he said. Yi said that in the People's Army he served as a calculator at the "counter-nuclear and -atomic analysis center" of nuclear and chemical defense bureau of the People's Army General Staff. The duty of the analysis center is to assess a contaminated area, wind direction and other data in case CBR weapons are used in war and distribute the data obtained to all People's Army units, he said.
