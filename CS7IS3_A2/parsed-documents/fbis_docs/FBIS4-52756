The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said the international community was unable to find effective measures to solve sluggish economic conditions among industrialized nations, regional conflicts such as those in the former Yugoslavia or North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development. Steps to end proliferation of mass destructive weapons or to solve turmoil in the former Soviet Union were also unavailable, the report said. But bright prospects also appeared as a result of international cooperation on a new framework for peace and prosperity, it said. The report cited encouraging developments such as the birth of a new Cambodia, the historic agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel and the successful conclusion of the seven-year-long Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. Seeking solutions to international problems through multilateral means is becoming increasingly important in the post-Cold War era since economic, environmental and nuclear nonproliferation issues are often intertwined, the paper said. It cited the need to strengthen the functions of the United Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan, the United States and Europe which share common values of democracy and market- oriented economies and whose combined gross national product accounts for 70 percent of the world's GNP. Japan, for its part, should carry out, in cooperation with other countries, diplomacy that is both "active and creative" to build a new international framework because it now has great influence not only economically but also in the political and global fields, it said. The report also said Japan also has an increasingly important role as an industrialized and democratic nation in Asia to promote democracy and market-oriented economies worldwide while preventing religious and ethnic conflicts. While conceding that in some ways the Japanese people are not yet fully aware of mounting international expectations toward their country, the blue book said notions are taking root that Japan should contribute more actively to ensuring peace and prosperity in the world while at the same time not seeking to become a military superpower. Japan's cooperation during the Persian Gulf crisis and participation in the UN-led peacekeeping operations in Cambodia helped develop that attitude, it said. Japan also intends to continue efforts to improve its Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing nations in quantity and quality because the ODA is an important method to fulfill its international responsibility and roles, the report said. Regarding its relations with the U.S., the blue book said the two nations reconfirmed the importance of bilateral ties as new governments emerged on both sides of the Pacific. It predicted, however, that disputes between Tokyo and Washington may intensify over trade and economic problems as a result of the failed bilateral trade framework talks in February. Despite the two governments' agreement that the collapse should not affect bilateral cooperation on political, security and global aspects, voices of concern and dissatisfaction toward each other can be heard in both nations, it said. Efforts by both sides are essential to improve bilateral trade relations, but in Japan's case, it should make efforts to boost domestic demand while voluntarily taking measures to ease access of foreign goods, the report said. The year 1993 also saw active moves regarding regional cooperation and regional unification, such as the start of the EU, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the holding of an informal summit meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations, the report said. But such regional cooperation should be in line with the activities of the UN and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it said. On the global economy, the blue book cited the need to work on serious global unemployment while tackling new problems such as improving the compatibility between trade and the environment.
