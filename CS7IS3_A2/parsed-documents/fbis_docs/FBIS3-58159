The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was expected to approve a U.S. proposal for limited East-West military cooperation and send a signal of its eventual intention to take in new members. But with East European states pressing to join NATO over the strenuous objections of Russia, NATO made it clear it would do nothing to antagonise Moscow and hurt its programme of reforms. "Our vital objective remains to build a new comprehensive Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or against, Russia," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said in his opening speech. He said the message for Russia's former satellites was "we shall not leave you alone," but added: "When we extend membership of NATO to new countries it will be to help stabilise Europe and not to divide it again." Woerner, who met just before the summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton, echoed the themes laid out by the American leader in a major policy address here Sunday. [passage omitted] The 21-month-old conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has split the alliance at times, was likely to figure in the discussions here. But NATO diplomats said they expected no new concrete initiatives. France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities. But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act, warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on the ground. Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the 10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia. But British Prime Minister John Major said on arriving at the summit, "We set that out some months ago that we would go ahead with air strikes. That was the position and that remains the position today," he said.
