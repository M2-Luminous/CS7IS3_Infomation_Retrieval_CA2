Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this is virtually a declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war against the North. Noting that the situation of the Korean peninsula has been brought to a very dangerous phase by this reckless act of the puppets, the analyst says: The projected resumption of the "Team Spirit," a test nuclear war for "a forestalling attack" on the North, and an early deployment of Patriots in South Korea are aimed at intentionally throwing a snag in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, pushing ahead with war preparations in real earnest and, further, unleashing another war against the North. In actuality, the puppet army forces were put on "emergency alert" shortly after the puppet rulers made the reckless provocative declaration. We cannot but take a very serious view of this. No matter how desperately such fools as Kim Yong-sam may try to overpower our people with something like the "Team Spirit" and Patriots, they can never frighten our people. We will decisively cope with the South Korean puppets' moves of confrontation and war and resolutely defend the security of our socialist homeland and nation. The United States had better look squarely at the reality, clearly mindful that it has nothing to get and beneficial, though it gives a shot in the arm to such fools as Kim Yong-sam. It must act with discretion, knowing well of our people whom it is dealing with.
