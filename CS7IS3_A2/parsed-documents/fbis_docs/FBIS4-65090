The CiU liaison committee, which met yesterday, Monday, decided to grant the Socialist Party a margin of confidence, after assessing that the recent resignations of some of its members and the announced intention expressed by the prime minister to tackle corruption show "a positive will" to resolve this problem, now regarded as the main threat to Spanish political stability. To this effect, the liaison committee pointed out in its final communique that political stability is essential for the country's necessary economic recovery. According to the nationalist coalition's leaders, Spain's current situation requires clear political stability, since it is "an essential factor for economic recovery, necessary for job creation." Hence, CiU yesterday publicly guaranteed its support for the Socialist government again, although some of its leaders do not conceal their reservations about what they deem to be the government's irretrievable public image and the excessive slowness in tackling the corruption cases affecting the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. The liaison committee meeting was chaired by Jordi Pujol on behalf of Convergence and by Josep Antoni Duran Lleida on behalf of Union and lasted more than two hours. Among other topics, the recent statements by Jose Maria Aznar, who accused CiU of "blackmailing" the government and Spain, were analyzed. According to the coalition's leaders, the People's Party leader's remarks fall within a campaign by the conservative party, which is judged "destabilizing and devoid of proposals" and which was described as "irresponsible" since it even impedes the country's economic recovery. CiU's support for the government was expressed directly to Felipe Gonzalez by Pujol last Thursday at a meeting held in Madrid between the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier and the prime minister, shortly before the Socialist leader's public appearance, and it has been confirmed again now, two days before Gonzalez appears before the Congress [of Deputies] in order to report on the situation. Yesterday, it was Jordi Pujol again who showed the greatest desire to support the government, since, in his opinion, Gonzalez is determined to get to the bottom of the corruption problem. The liaison committee also urged the government to follow through the economic measures adopted so far, which, according to the CiU leaders, have made possible the beginning of the economic recovery. The danger that calling an early election -- a possibility which, moreover, is borne in mind in the medium term -- will represent an insurmountable curb on Spain's economic recovery was one of the arguments which CiU uses to justify its support for the government. The liaison committee's communique states that CiU's political stance gives priority to the struggle against corruption, the policy for economic recovery, and the resolute will to implement the autonomy policy. This last-mentioned point, which the crisis caused by the corruption scandals has apparently overshadowed, was discussed at length yesterday, since it is believed that progress in this field remains decisive for the coalition's maintaining its support for the government. When the meeting was over, the CiU leaders learned of the statements by [former Secretary of State for the National Plan on Drugs] Baltasar Garzon, which sources in the two parties played down in describing them as an internal matter for the Socialists.
