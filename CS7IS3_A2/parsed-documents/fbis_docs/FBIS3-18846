Fiat, Fininvest, Olivetti, ENI [Italian Hydrocarbons Corporation] in the arena for a 3-trillion-lire business. The common enemy: the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company]. It possesses a secret weapon. A revolver pointed at the nape of the neck: "Pull over." The truck driver obeys the order, then surrenders the steering wheel as the hijacker places a hood over his head. The cargo ends up in a clandestine warehouse, and the hijackers abandon the TIR [International Road Transport] vehicle and its driver. But when does help arrive? Almost always too late. Each year Italian insurance companies pay out 4 trillion lire for claims on TIR robberies. In two years, though, the story will have a different ending. As soon as the truck deviates from its route, a satellite will warn police headquarters, which in turn will sound the alarm. The credit goes to AT System, a small Rovereto-based enterprise, which together with Seat and Apple has already developed the solution. But above all, the credit goes to the telecommunications crown's latest jewel, the GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications]. Yes, the GSM, the so-called telefonino europeo [little European cellular phone] which is much more than just a cellular telephone set. It is a system of voice and data transmission that will change our everyday lives. The "telefonino europeo" [smaller and lighter than the "telefonino tradizionale" which in popular usage identifies with Italy's present conventional SIP-operated cellular system] will make it easier to call a taxi and find a hospital bed. For the price of a local call we will be able to exchange written messages. Motorists will be kept constantly informed of traffic conditions. A revolution that in a few years, in Italy, will have enlisted at least 4 million subscribers, and that, to the network carriers, will be worth 3-4 billion lire a year. In keeping with a European Community directive against monopolies, the GSM carriers will be two: the public sector's SIP and a private-sector group. The competition is entering the heated stage. On Saturday 15 January the private-sector candidates formally stated their interest in participating in the bidding that between April and May will decide who the second GSM carrier will be. In the days preceding this first step, the maneuvers had become increasingly intricate, ending in the surprise alliance between the team of companies of the ENI group and the consortium led by Fiat and by Fininvest (publisher of PANORAMA among other things). The next two weeks will usher in another decisive step: The much awaited call for bids, with the rules that will regulate the new market. The fight for the big money-making GSM market will be extremely harsh. On one side SIP, which until now has enjoyed the telecommunications monopoly and is determined to sell its skin dearly. On the other, all the big Italian groups that have entered the arena, in competition with each other, and are ready to invest 1.5 trillion lire over the next five years. A risky investment? Apparently not. Rather, a good opportunity. From Olivetti to Fiat, from Fininvest to Marzotto, backed by international telecommunications giants, everybody is well aware of the success of Italy's traditional cellular telephone system: 1.2 million subscribers, 200,000 in the last three months alone, in spite of the recession; and billings totaling 1.5 trillion lire. But, in view of the extremely tough underground battle the SIP is already waging, the GSM's big money-making potential could also prove to be not very profitable for the private-sector carrier during the initial years of operation. First of all, thanks to heavy investments and contained rates, through its public monopoly and with sights set on the future GSM, SIP has been able to push its marketing of cellular telephones to the limit, and has thus captured a sizable market advantage. Secondly, through the political pressures it has been applying, SIP could pull off a surprise coup: Demand indemnification for the loss of its monopoly, at the expense of the second carrier. At any rate, by the end of 1995, by which time the European "telefonino" is expected to become fully operational, the state-owned carrier will enjoy a commanding position. "In two years, SIP will have 2 million subscribers between its traditional and GSM cellular systems, whereas the second carrier will have at most 300,000," says Franco Morganti, vice president of Teknibank, a high-technology-market research company. "The private-sector company will not have an easy road. SIP will be in a position to suggest to its subscribers who might be tempted to go to the competition's GSM that they continue subscribing to its traditional cellular telephone service at slashed rates, inasmuch as, by that time, its investments for the old network will already have been amortized." It will certainly not be easy to defeat SIP with a price war, considering that, thus far, its public-sector GSM rates are the lowest in Europe (even though subjected to a tax system that is less favorable than in many other countries). SIP's GSM rates average 663 lire per minute, versus Great Britain's 830 lire, and the lowest-priced German carrier's 1,154 lire. Services, for the most part, will thus be the field on which the game will be played. And from this viewpoint, the GSM has enormous potential. Far more than that of mere cellular telephone service! While traditional cellular terminals are of the analog type, requiring transmission by way of sounds, GSM terminals are full-fledged microcomputers that talk to each other in bit language, and permit contact with all of Europe's connected areas without national limitations. They can transmit data without using modems or faxes, which are costly and generate annoying distortions. Two bursts will suffice to send the equivalent of a two-page document. The telephone-answering system will signal the presence of recorded calls. The billing facility will no longer be connected to a terminal, but instead to a microprocessor-equipped card that can be moved from one suitably equipped telephone set, fax, or modem to another. But there is much more. The connections to central offices capable of providing services will be easier to make. By installing the GSM card in a microcomputer such as Apple's Newton, for example, the motorist can have a navigation system: A map of the zone in which he finds himself will appear on his video screen, together with a recommended itinerary for reaching his destination. Subscribers will be warned if there is fog on the road. And a service center will be able to keep parked cars under surveillance in order to foil robbery attempts. And there is more. It will be possible to send an identical message simultaneously to groups of subscribers with the same requirements: to every stock-exchange investor, for example, who is to be advised in case the Comit index exceeds a certain threshold value. It will also be possible to operate taxi and TIR fleets. And Olivetti has already developed a system to optimize the dispatching of police cars. The network carriers will be able to offer all these services directly or through third parties with whom they will share the receipts. "SIP's aspiration is to generate traffic" says an analyst. "SIP will therefore subcontract the services, settling with the contractors within 60 days, and earning a banking profit. The private-sector company instead will be inclined to offer services directly, aiming at value-added returns." But which privately owned group will be the winning private-sector GSM carrier? In the absence of presently unforeseen developments, according to observers, the top contenders are Unitel and Omnitel. Unitel gained strength on Tuesday 11 January by allying itself with the group headed by ENI. Thus, as of today, this consortium consists of Finintel (51 percent Fiat and 49 percent Fininvest) with 54 percent of Unitel's stock; Vodafone 20 percent; SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company], AGIP Petroli [Italian National Oil Company], and Italgas [Italian Gas Company] with a total of 13 percent; Bell South 10 percent; and minor partners including Salvatore Lingresti's Premafin. Omnitel consists of Olivetti with 51 percent, Bell Atlantic 16.6 percent, Cellular Communications International 14.7 percent, Telia 9.7 percent, and Lehman Brothers 8 percent. Both groups can count on important strong points. Both have international allies that have already acquired eminent experience in the sector. Francesco Caio, president of Omnitel, can count above all on Olivetti's computerization expertise and on its capacity for integrating computer, telecommunications, and fax technologies. The group, moreover, has already begun developing the software to operate certain specialized services. Unitel, on the other hand, headed by Niccolo Nefri, besides its know-how in the operation of national networks, and its ownership of many sites suitable for antenna installation, already possesses private telephone lines today that will tend to minimize the difficulties of covering the territory. "Furthermore, Italgas's contribution should not be underestimated," says Nefri. "This company knows everything there is to know about the business of billing, which is a very important technical problem." According to international analysts interviewed by Reuters, the group headed by Olivetti has long been the number one favorite, but the Fiat-Fininvest group's chances appear increased by its association with ENI. "That agreement was not good news for Olivetti, because it strengthens Unitel in the very areas in which it lacked technical experience" says Jan Macleod, a NatWest analyst. "As far as software is concerned, Olivetti remains the strongest" Alberto Rella from Milla & Co notes. "But as regards hardware, Unitel is now ahead. Moreover, by joining forces with ENI, Unitel has gained strength from political contacts." In fact, private-sector groups will have to know how to lobby effectively in Rome. Because the problem will be not only that of defeating a market leader as strong as SIP in the marketplace. Some obstacles could be of another nature. The government had established relatively burdensome prerequisites from the outset, for privately owned companies. These included capitalization requirements for eligible consortiums, tight deadlines for submitting applications; and a commitment to cover 40 percent of the Italian territory with the GSM network within 18 months. But the next moves will be the crucial ones. By the end of January, the Telecommunications Ministry, headed by Maurizio Pagani, will publish its call for bids, a 50-page set, approximately, of specifications on which the interested consortiums must base their definitive bids. "The important pages of that call for bids will be mainly three," says an expert: "Those containing the rules that will regulate relations between SIP and private-sector companies." The problem is one of the thorniest. Telephone calls made by subscribers of the second carrier--and especially those made to traditional telephones--will in fact have to transit portions of SIP's networks. And SIP's charges for this transit could be high enough to cause financial problems for its competitor. "The governments of all countries of the world," says Unitel, "regulate relations in such way as to guarantee the conditions governing competition." In Italy, this cannot be taken for granted. SIP wants to be compensated for the loss of its monopoly and is expected to request the government's authorization to compensate for its losses at the expense of the competition, by making the private-sector carrier pay through the nose, at very high rates, for the public-sector lines it will have to use, thus exacting a toll that could cost the privately owned company hundreds of billions of lire. Might this suffice to convince the privately-owned groups to throw in the sponge? Some experts believe the possibility exists. SIP's indemnification could be borne by the state, of course. But Palazzo Chigi is turning its deaf ear in the direction of this proposal. Another analyst argues, however, that "SIP cannot be having peaceful dreams, because the intent of the antitrust authority is specifically to prevent any abuse of dominant position." Indeed, in this market, the competition will quickly broaden to include new carriers, for the very reason that the GSM is a European system. Between 1996 and 1998, at the very time, that is, when the new system becomes fully operational, deregulation will also enter into effect. This means that an Italian in Italy will be able to subscribe to the service even in Denmark if he finds it more advantageous to do so, and that lobbying strategists for the protection of market shares can expect to be given their walking papers.
