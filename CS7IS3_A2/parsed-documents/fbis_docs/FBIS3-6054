The prime minister's office said that particular news conference was nothing unusual. The news conference itself, however, was a deliberate act to a great extent. Prime Minister Yi called the news conference after attending a high-level strategic meeting at his residence in Samchong-tong that morning and at a time when the North-South dialogue was deadlocked. Prime Minister Yi looked stern and expressed his uncomfortable feeling about North Korea. He stated: "North Korea assumed an insincere attitude toward the working-level contact," and "We doubt if North Korea has the will to exchange special envoys," and "We express strong regret." During the news conference Prime Minister Yi primarily criticized North Korea for its insincere attitude, even though he also discussed ways to give financial assistance to government-patronized organizations and government restructuring. He made hard-line remarks about North Korea for various purposes. First, we can say Prime Minister Yi felt it necessary to express the government's strong will, as some people criticized that the "government has been pulled and hauled by North Korea." He said that the government would not "beg" for dialogue with North Korea anymore. He reportedly expressed a strong uncomfortable feeling about North Korea at the high-level strategic meeting, as well. This means that the government has turned hard-line. Prime Minister Yi made those remarks also because of the demand by Tom Hubbard, U.S. assistant secretary of State, and Warren Christopher, secretary of State, that the ROK National Security Law be abolished. Prime Minister Yi was much displeased with this interventionist demand and, therefore, felt it necessary to clearly express our government's own position on the North-South dialogue, without regard to the United States. We can say that by making those remarks, Prime Minister Yi strongly asked North Korea to change its attitudes at the sixth working-level contact scheduled for 12 March. The government thinks that if no agreement was reached at the sixth working-level contact, it would be impossible for the North and South to exchange special envoys by 21 March, when North Korea and the United States are scheduled to start the third round of high-level talks. We can also say that as it is virtually impossible to exchange special envoys given North Korea's attitude, Prime Minister Yi made those remarks in order to stress that North Korea would be held responsible for a possible breakup of the North-South talks. The government believes that North Korea has deliberately excluded South Korea from discussions on the nuclear issue and that it has also delayed the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys, judging that it has nothing to lose even if the North Korean-U.S. talks are postponed.
