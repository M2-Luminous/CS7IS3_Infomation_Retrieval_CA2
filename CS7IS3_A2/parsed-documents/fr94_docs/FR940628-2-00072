FR940628-2-00072 FR940628-2-00059 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,299] Control Techniques (USA) Inc. (E.C.S.) Fairmont, WV; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated April 18, 1994, Local #702 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on March 23, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16663). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. Investigation findings show that the workers produced electronic control equipment. The subject firm was known as Electronic Control Systems, Inc., (ECS) until it was purchased by Control Techniques Worldwide, a British firm, on February 14, 1991. The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. After the purchase in February 1991, Control Techniques Worldwide, the parent company, began to consolidate all of Fairmont's production to other domestic locations. The major portion of layoffs occurred in 1991. Layoffs prior to November 16, 1992 cannot be considered under this petition since Section 223(b)(1) of the Trade Act does not permit the certification of workers prior to one year of the date of the petition. The union states that components and instruments from the U.K. replaced products produced at Fairmont. The union also states that parts originally made at ECS began to be prefabricated in Mexico. Investigation findings show that no production at Fairmont was displaced by foreign production since Control Techniques Worldwide purchased ECS in 1991. Some SCR power paks, however, were brought over from the U.K. but they were not sold. The power paks from the U.K. were found to be inadequate for the U.S. market and were returned. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, DC, this June 15, 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
