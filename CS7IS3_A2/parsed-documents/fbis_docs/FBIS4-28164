China's cooperation is essential also in achieving a concerted action at the UN Security Council and in persuading North Korea." Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu gave New York-based ROK correspondents the background of his sudden visit to China by saying this before boarding an airplane bound for Beijing on 7 June. After accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a visit to Russia, he flew to New York to have individual meetings with the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. [Reporter] What is China's present position? [Han] China does not readily agree to the allegation stressing the need to have the UN Security Council take strong countermeasures. But, it also is in a position not to offer active opposition, either. This is because China, too, cannot deny the fact that efforts to have dialogue with North Korea have reached a limit. If other permanent members of the UN Security Council come to a conclusion that sanctions against North Korea are inevitable, China will not presumably be able to offer opposition. [Reporter] It is learned that China and Russia are objecting to adopting a resolution for the imposition of sanctions. [Han] You can understand this by noting that a process of working out a resolution--not a debate of pros and cons--is now underway. [Reporter] Russia is calling for holding eight-way talks before sanctions are imposed. [Han] Well, Russia is not advocating such talks as a precondition to the UN Security Council's imposition of sanctions. It is certain that Russia is positive about the working out of measures for the imposition of sanctions. [Reporter] If a resolution is adopted at the UN Security Council, when do you expect it will be? [Han] It seems that it is difficult to see one adopted within this week. [Reporter] In case the UN Security Council adopts a resolution, there seem to be two options, such as the adoption of a resolution of warning or the immediate imposition of sanctions. What is the official stance to this? [Han] As one resolution has already been adopted and two Security Council presidential statements have been issued up until now, I think that now is not the opportune time to go out of the way to go through the process of adopting a resolution of warning. [Reporter] North Korea is threatening that the present regime in South Korea will face an end if economic sanctions are imposed. [Han] It is true that there is a risk in the imposition of sanctions. But, we cannot afford not to do what we should do because of North Korea's threatening remarks.
