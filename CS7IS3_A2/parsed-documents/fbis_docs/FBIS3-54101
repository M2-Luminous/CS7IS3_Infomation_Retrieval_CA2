In a statement to journalists today, Durdah said cooperation with Egypt continues in all fields, especially the security field, noting that Egypt's security is also Libya's security. On the fate of [kidnapped former foreign minister] Mansur al-Kihya, Durdah stressed that this issue is nothing but a suspicious attempt to undermine Egyptian-Libyan relations and to complete the blockade imposed on Libya. Durdah did not play down the effects of the UN Security Council sanctions on the Libyan economy. He said Libya is now preparing its budget, taking these sanctions into consideration. In its own way it is trying to maintain the defense allocations and subsidies for next year the same as they were in last year's budget. The General People's Congress committees have continued their discussions for the second day to draft and prepare the resolutions of the basic people's congresses. These resolutions will be announced tomorrow, while the final session of the General People's Congress will be held on Tuesday [25 January].
