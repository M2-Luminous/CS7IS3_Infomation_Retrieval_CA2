Political sources said Hosokawa has decided to carry out a reshuffle of his 21-member cabinet sometime next week, possibly around Thursday [2 March], despite strong objections from some of his main coalition partners. Speaking to a group of reporters at his official residence Friday, Hosokawa denied that he has already decided on the timing of the cabinet reorganization. "I have not yet considered (the timing of a cabinet shake- up)...It is too early," the prime minister said. At issue is whether Hosokawa will sack or remove to an alternative important cabinet post Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, nominally his top aide. The sources said Hosokawa wants to take such action because of the recent emergence of differing political ideas with Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small partner in the seven-party coalition. The early cabinet reshuffle is favored by two other coalition parties -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), co-headed by the coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, and the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. It is opposed by Sakigake, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest component in the coalition, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Rivalry between the two blocs intensified this week as Hosokawa proposed a parliamentary alliance of the ruling parties to compete with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election, likely to be called this fall. The election for the House of Representatives will feature a new electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats chosen by proportional representation. Hosokawa's new proposal marks a departure from his previously stated desire to establish a multiparty system in Japan and signals his inclination to work for a two-party system. The two-party system is advocated by Shinseito and Komeito but is opposed by Sakigake, the SDPJ and the DSP, which favor a "moderate multiparty system." The new proposal was apparently made because published media simulations have shown that the LDP, ousted from power last August, will dominate the lower chamber unless the ruling parties act as one and run only one candidate in each single-seat constituency. The alliance proposal immediately came under fire from Takemura, who called it "imperialistic" and "expansionist," leaving a deeper crack between him and Hosokawa. Hosokawa was hit by another shock wave this week in the form of an announcement that a rising political star and a top labor leader have basically agreed on the formation of a new liberal party. The agreement was reached between Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi, once dubbed "prince of the socialists," and Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong Rengo labor federation. The accord calls for the unification of the SDPJ, Sakigake and DSP into a "Democratic Liberal Party." Yokomichi, elected to the lower house four times since 1969 and the governorship three times since 1983, is poised to return to the central political stage, probably to head the new party. Yamagishi said Japan's political parties will be molded into three forces -- the conservative LDP, a new conservative party and the new liberal party. On the economic front, a high-ranking U.S. trade official will arrive in Tokyo on Friday to resume subcabinet-level negotiations with Japan on automobile and auto parts trade between the two countries, informed sources said. Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for internal trade, is now on an export promotion mission in Asia. The auto and auto parts trade is viewed in Washington as the key focus in the "framework" trade talks between the United States and Japan. The coming Tokyo consultations follow ruptured trade talks in Washington earlier this month between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Garten is expected to reiterate the U.S. demand to set up "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese market, which Tokyo strongly opposes, describing it as "managed trade." Important economic indicators to be released next week include housing starts for January, a quarterly business outlook (tankan) by the Bank of Japan, foreign currency reserves as of the end of February and governmental fiscal 1994 economic outlook figures. On Monday, the Japan Sumo Association will announce the list of rankings for the spring grand sumo tournament. On Wednesday, a World Boxing Association (WBA) junior featherweight title match will be held in Tokyo between champion Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto Rico and challenger Yuichi Kasai of Japan.
