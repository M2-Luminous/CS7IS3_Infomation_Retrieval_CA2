FBIS4-49383 "drchi088_c_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 Central Eurasia Azerbaijan Rejects CIS Peace Plan Azerbaijan Rejects CIS Peace Plan OW0605013994 Beijing XINHUA in English 0115 GMT 6 May 94 OW0605013994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Moscow, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Azerbaijan today rejected a peace plan on Nagorno-Karabakh made by the Interparliamentary Conference of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Russian media reports quoted Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the CIS interparliamentary conference, as saying that Azerbaijan does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as one side of the conflict in that region. He said that if Nagorno-Karabakh is not involved in signing a peace plan, no ceasefire will be guaranteed. Parliament leaders of some CIS countries held a mediation meeting on Nagorno-Karabakh this week in the Central Asia republic of Kyrgyzstan. Another side of the conflict, Armenia, has accepted the peace plan, which calls for the deployment of a CIS peacekeeping force in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the application by all sides of a ceasefire beginning on May 9. Azerbaijan has also rejected a Russian plan to send a CIS peacekeeping force to the conflict region, and instead wants an international peacekeeping force. Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Russian upper house of parliament, said inviting an international peacekeeping force is not logically sound since Nagorno-Karabakh is situated within the CIS. Therefore, it is the CIS that should send peacekeepers, he said. Azerbaijan regards Nagorno-Karabakh as a part of its sovereignty and insists that the region has been occupied by Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh used to be an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, and is largely populated by Armenians. A separation movement began in 1988 and led to the declaration of an independent republic in the region in September 1991. During four years of conflict in the region, an estimated 3,000 Armenians and 4,700 Azerbaijanis were killed.
