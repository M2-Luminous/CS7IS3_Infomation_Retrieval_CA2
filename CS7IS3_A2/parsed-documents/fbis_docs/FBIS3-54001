They saw President Hafiz al-Asad's Geneva declaration of insistence on a comprehensive solution on all fronts and on the UN Security Council resolutions as significant and positive for the peace process. Dawud al-Talhami, member of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and its official spokesman, has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the emphasis on a comprehensive solution and rejection of partial and separate solutions was a positive sign particularly as such emphasis also came from the United States. He added that although there were no details and we still do not know what happened at the summit, for that will become clear in the future, what was emphatically stated by President Hafiz al-Asad calls for Palestinian satisfaction, particularly the insistence on a comprehensive solution, implementation of Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the land-for-peace principle. Al-Talhami also said that what was stated by President al-Asad and supported by U.S. President Bill Clinton was positive and represented the essence of the position we adopt and whose fulfillment we desire.
