A high-ranking government official on 8 May disclosed: "The majority opinion in relevant government officials and civilian experts holds that in the event that North Korea attempts to cripple the Military Armistice Committee or the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, their function could be transferred to the North-South Joint Military Committee stipulated in the North-South Basic Agreement." It was also learned that the government has devised a plan to push ahead with the adoption of a separate agreement or a protocol between the North and South if North Korea insists on the legal termination of the state of armistice. It was learned that even though there is no need to fully confront the North's attempt to unilaterally reduce the agreement to a scrap of paper, the government is studying ways to propose inter- Korean dialogue so as to discuss the system of North-South Basic Agreement. As regards to this, the Foreign Ministry on 5 May held a first round of meetings in the presence of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, and major high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials. On 7 May, a second round of meetings was held to analyze North Korea's intent and discuss ways to counter it. Those who participated in the second round of meetings were Kim Kyong-won, former ambassador to the United States; Kim Tal-chung, professor of Yonsei University; Shim Song-pyong, professor of Kyonghui University; Yu Pyong-hwa, professor of Korea University; Yi Sang-u, professor of Sogang University; and Ha Yong-son, professor of Seoul National University. A high-ranking official who took part in the meeting said: "Provision 5 in the first chapter of the North-South Basic Agreement adopted in December 1991 stipulates that the North and South should exert joint efforts to replace the present armistice state with the state of peace and that the two sides should abide by the present Military Armistice Agreement until the state of peace is achieved," and added that "a dominant opinion is that if the North-South Basic Agreement is invoked, the present armistice state could be replaced with a peace system." The government plans to clarify its final stance after studying measures mapped out by the Foreign Ministry at a Unification and National Security Policy Coordination meeting.
