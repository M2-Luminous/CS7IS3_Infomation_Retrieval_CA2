NPC deputies are more interested in discussing the significance of developing central and western regions for the future of China and in discussing ways to narrow the gap under a market economy. Since the opening of the NPC session on March 10, dozens of NPC deputies have aired their views on this issue. Due to geological, historical and cultural causes, the gap has always existed. Among the 328 poverty-stricken counties, 295 are in the central and western regions. NPC deputies from the central and western regions said that it is necessary to adopt a realistic attitude towards the gap and narrow it through hard, long-term work. Cheng Kejie, chairman of the people's government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said: "The same policies of reform and openness apply to the central and western regions as well as to east China. This should be our point of departure for narrowing the gap." Yunnan Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang pointed out, "An economy that depends on state support, on an egalitarian policy, or on a mandatory division of market has neither vitality nor future." A policy researcher from Gansu Province said, the central and western regions should develop through market competition and improvement of efficiency, though state assistance and support from eastern areas are indispensable for the time being. In the past 10 days, top Chinese leaders exchanged views with NPC deputies of some 20 provincial-level delegations, of which the overwhelming majority are from central and western provinces and regions. The leaders have repeatedly underscored the central authorities' concern for the economically underdeveloped areas. A number of motions submitted to the current session demand that narrowing the gap between the east and the rest of China be slated for economic legislation and that economic laws include support for economically underdeveloped areas. In short, accelerating development of central and western regions is a consensus reached at the current NPC session. The central and western regions account for 89 percent of China's land area, people there take up 64 percent of the national population, and borderline extends more than 20,000 kilometers. Some NPC deputies said, the central and western regions have opportunities and advantages to accelerate development. With implementation of the new opening up strategy, the vast central and western regions will play a role of growing importance. Rich natural resources are another main advantage of the central and western regions. A guideline for China's economic development in the next decade is to shift the energy- and raw material-gobbling industries to areas which have rich energy and other natural resources. The industrial shift will bring opportunities for western areas. For instance, Qinghai Province will have the unique advantage of developing power, mining, metallurgical and salt chemical industries. Many deputies pointed out, the large number of old enterprises, military industrial firms and strong technological force in the central and western areas provide a sound basis for attracting overseas funds. Some deputies from the western regions have identified their deficiencies in comparison with eastern areas. Cui Lintao, mayor of Xian city in Shaanxi Province, said that the eastern areas have mobilized, organized and made good use of economic factors such as labor, professionals, technology and funds while in the rest of China, especially in Shaanxi Province, many economic factors are lying idle or being wasted. "This should be solved from the causes of the system and concepts," he said. The Chinese Government has decided to implement a program rooting up poverty and helping the 80 million people below the poverty line have sufficient food and clothing by the turn of the century. NPC deputies expressed their hearty support for the program. They said economic development in the central and western areas should give priority to agriculture, especially the construction of water conservancy projects. They also stressed the development of local resources and rural enterprises. At present rural enterprises in the central and western regions accounted for only 35 percent of the national total. The State Council has decided to earmark loans to support rural enterprises in central and western regions from 1993 to 2000. Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture has worked out a program to promote cooperation of rural enterprises between the east and the rest of China, including 100 pilot cooperative zones and 1,000 pilot projects. Some economists among the NPC deputies said that such cooperation will benefit both sides. With the development of productive forces, new industries, products, technology and management expertise should shift from the east to other parts of the country. Otherwise, further development in the east will be impeded. Jiangsu Province Governor Chen Huanyou said the coastal provinces must find the driving force for their economies from the central and western regions if they want to maintain a long-term high growth rate. "Without development of the central and western parts, development of the eastern areas will be restrained in the long run," he added. Jiangsu, which has developed processing industries but lacks natural resources, has established good relations with Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions and Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces in the northwest. It has provided skilled workers, equipment, technology and information while setting up a number of enterprises to develop local resources. Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said the cooperation of the eastern part with the rest of China means integration of advanced technology, financial resources and management experience in the east with rich raw materials, energy and labor force in the rest of the country. The integration will promote development of rural enterprises in the central and western areas while expanding new channels for the east to adjust its industrial structure and update products. Deputies from Shanghai and coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong said they have established various economic ties with central and western regions. Deputies from the central and western regions have also reported encouraging news of their economic progress during the current NPC session. Many sleepy, remote border towns have become busy trade centers. When talking with deputies from Shaanxi Province, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said that the vast central and western regions have a great potential. The economic takeoff of China's central and western regions is the country's hope in the 21st century.
