FBIS4-52040 "dreas088_a_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reaction to Nagano's Remarks on Nanjing Reported Reaction to Nagano's Remarks on Nanjing Reported SDPJ Urges Hata To Sack Nagano OW0605051394 Tokyo KYODO in English 0504 GMT 6 May 94 OW0605051394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Japan's No. 2 opposition party urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [6 May] to sack Shigeto Nagano as justice minister over his remark that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is "a fabrication." The Social Democratic Party (SDP) will demand Nagano's dismissal unless Hata sacks him, said Koken Nosaka, the SDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman. In an interview with mass-circulation daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN published Wednesday, Nagano denied that the Nanjing massacre happened and said it is wrong to call Japan's World War II campaign a war of aggression. Following the invasion of Nanjing in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. Japanese historians, however, tend to cite much lower estimates and some also contend that the mass killings were not ordered but caused by troops that got out of hand. The international war tribunal estimated the number at more than 200,000. On Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "a Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly distort history, deny the historical facts and defend the Japanese militarists' aggression. We are shocked and indignant about this." South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto on Friday that Nagano's remarks are a distortion of historical facts. Nagano, a member of the House of Councillors and a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, was given the justice portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on April 28. The SDP, whose members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime ministerial elections April 25, quit the ruling coalition last week in protest against the establishment of a large parliamentary grouping by coalition partners, excluding the SDP. The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and the SDP, are now both in the opposition camp. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) also demanded Nagano's dismissal, saying it cannot pardon his remark that completely denies Japan's historic crime. Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP Secretariat, said Nagano's remark "is an astonishingly wild one to defend the worst war crimes by the Japanese militarism...The Nanjing massacre has been proved by a number of concrete facts." Shii said if Hata obscures the matter, it will lead to no confidence of the cabinet.
