Unlike several months ago, you no longer want the special services, intelligence and counterintelligence, to quickly become independent of the Ministry. Now that your Ministry is under the direct supervision of the Belweder, accountability to the prime minister represents a compromise with the postcommunist coalition. That seems to be the reason you no longer want the UOP to be independent, at least as long as Walesa is president. [Milczanowski] When I myself was UOP chief, I wanted to move the UOP out of the Interior Ministry. But, to this very day, it is not very clear who the UOP should be answerable to--the president, the prime minister, or both men at the same time. As long as this remains unclear and is not laid down in the Constitution, one cannot risk causing an organizational mess in this vital sphere. But, frankly, it is questionable to have an intelligence service, involved in foreign affairs, supervised by an interior minister. [ZYCIE] Supervision over the intelligence service is a political matter because it brings power. The present unified parliament and government have said that intelligence should be removed from the president's control as quickly as possible. But that is not possible as long as it remains part of the Interior Ministry and you continue to defend this state of affairs. [Milczanowski] All at once I realized that there is no use hurrying with autonomy for the UOP because there are too many power centers that would like to gain possession of it. A new hotbed of conflict between the president, the government, and parliament would appear. I consider myself responsible for the work of the secret services, and, as long as there are no constitutional provisions governing the powers of the executive and the legislature, I will play no part in separating the UOP from the Interior Ministry. [ZYCIE] As interior minister, you must have your own ideas. [Milczanowski] I think the president must have the same kind of influence on the hiring and firing of the heads of intelligence and UOP as he already has on the hiring and firing of the interior, defense, and foreign ministers. That way, there is no danger of intelligence working for just one center of authority. [ZYCIE] You sound convinced that there is a rivalry between the centers of authority in Poland. That is a cause for concern. [Milczanowski] I do not agree with such rivalry, and that is why I wish to prevent hotbeds of conflict. [ZYCIE] Many politicians, including Aleksander Kwasniewski, have been expressing their ideas about the new Constitution, and they say that the three ministries under presidential control should be accountable to the president and the prime minister. What do you say to that? [Milczanowski] I see no problem with that. The Small Constitution and the laws governing the UOP, the interior minister, and the police all stipulate that I, as interior minister, have the duty to inform the president and the prime minister on all important matters concerning state security. [ZYCIE] Minister Falandysz has said what might happen if the Sejm tried to fire you. He said the president would never agree to the dismissal of one of the three ministers under his jurisdiction, and, if the Sejm passed a vote of no confidence in the government on account of any one of these three ministers, the president would not nominate their successors. That confirms your peculiar status in the Pawlak government. Clearly, it is not the government coalition's wish that you be interior minister. How does it feel to be a foreign body in the government? [Milczanowski] I have a Solidarity past, and, because of that, I was once in the Interior Ministry leadership. But I do not feel alien in the Pawlak government, and I possess a nonpolitical attitude toward my job. [ZYCIE] Do you agree with this government's policies? For example, do you accept the Interior Ministry budget? [Milczanowski] I have to. This is a question of loyalty, apart from which one has to be realistic about the size of the budget. [ZYCIE] Someone has said mischievously that you are so flexible that you are willing to be interior minister in any government as long as Walesa is president. [Milczanowski] I see no major difference between the budgetary concepts of the Suchocka government and those of the Pawlak government. The economic facts are harsh. Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's ideas virtually coincided with those of Osiatynski. I am not so interested in the things that lie beyond my ministry's scope. I wish to make it plain that I do not identify with any political party. I am a completely apolitical minister. [ZYCIE] But you do not deny the fact that you were interior minister in the Suchocka government solely because of the Democratic Union's support? [Milczanowski] I beg your pardon, but you are not quite right. Indeed, on 5 June, President Walesa invited me to become interior minister. I told him I would like to be UOP chief once again. But the president preferred me to be interior minister, responsible for the entire ministry, and not just UOP. I considered and agreed with a heavy heart. But I imposed a condition. I told him that, if he ever became dissatisfied with me or found someone better to take my place, he must let me know immediately and I would quit within 24 hours, without a word of protest. I never asked any party to support my application to be interior minister in this government. [ZYCIE] But you remember that it is thanks to the Democratic Union's insistence that you became a minister in the Suchocka government. [Milczanowski] When I was acting minister in Pawlak's first government and we had a Council of Ministers meeting, it was Jan Rokita who telephoned me and asked me what I thought about Artur Balazs being interior minister and I his deputy. I told him I did not wish to be an obstacle to the formation of a government. I said I did not have to be minister, and I did not have to accept his ideas. [ZYCIE] But, in the end, the Democratic Union compelled you to join the government. Right now, all of the post-Solidarity parties are criticizing the Pawlak government. Even Geremek is talking about a postcommunist setup. So how do you feel being in such a government? [Milczanowski] Statements by people in high places are not proper evidence. I feel responsible for the ministry. I am guided by two criteria: common sense and the interests of Poland. [ZYCIE] That sounds rather vague. You are just as vague about your successor from the coalition. You say he must be intelligent, experienced, and professional. Have any suitable candidates been found? [Milczanowski] It is too soon to say. [ZYCIE] Is Democratic Union deputy Zbigniew Sobotka not suitable? [Milczanowski] No comment. [ZYCIE] When will you be able to say something? [Milczanowski] Soon, perhaps next month. [ZYCIE] Rokita described your appointment of Gromoslaw Czempinski as chairman of UOP as a slap in the face to all those who joined the Interior Ministry after 1989. [Milczanowski] The older I am, the greater the doubts in my mind. Is a former Solidarity activist who sat in prison for a while, someone like me, better than a Security Service officer who risks his life for the new Poland? And, if this officer did not risk his life at all, is he better qualified to hold a responsible state post than I am? Perhaps he is better than I. [ZYCIE] Than why don't you change places with Czempinski? He might be a better minister than you are. Those who are criticizing Czempinski are upset by the fact that he was an intelligence officer under the People's Republic. [Milczanowski] I do not judge who should be minister. The UOP chief must be apolitical, that is all. [ZYCIE] Do you really think a UOP chief automatically becomes apolitical when he assumes his post and that his political past is automatically erased? [Milczanowski] I am acquainted with Czempinski's views, and I approve of them. He also insists that UOP is apolitical. You know why? Because, if someone suffers as much as the Security Service, intelligence, and counterintelligence have done since 1989, one becomes tired of politics. UOP officials are reluctant to indulge in political extremism. [ZYCIE] What is this extremism today? [Milczanowski] If some party advocates the use of force as a means of obtaining power, UOP has to know about it. [ZYCIE] But, in the past, Security Service men did serve a party that ruled by force. After the business with the files and the unsuccessful attempt to uncover Security Service agents, have your views about personnel vetting not changed at all? [Milczanowski] Several thousand men who worked in the old Security Service have been positively vetted for jobs in UOP and the police. I do not think they should be thrown out just because of their past. Every case of discrimination serves to divide society. We did not fight for a democratic Poland in order to weaken the country's structures. One can build these structures with the help of those who used to be on the other side but who serve Poland loyally today. Today we need solidarity. [ZYCIE] Does this solidarity also extend to former Security Service collaborators, people who used to secretly inform on their friends and neighbors? Are you still employing informers? [Milczanowski] It is not out of the question. It is not easy to discuss this matter. Many people find the idea of being an informer disgusting. And yet many informers acted out of patriotic motives. [ZYCIE] Most informers are paid or simply forced into collaboration. [Milczanowski] All democratic countries use informers. Without them, there is no question of the intelligence services performing their work effectively. It is difficult to say what makes people inform. A person who informs out of patriotic motives may accept payment that serves to tighten his links to the security service. [ZYCIE] Are you satisfied with the work of UOP? A UOP report on Zygmunt Solorz, head of PolSat Television, came into the hands of the president, the prime minister, and the chairman of the Broadcasting Council. [Milczanowski] I am acquainted with this material, and there is nothing else I can say. [ZYCIE] Can people be placed under surveillance for their political views and connections? [Milczanowski] We are not engaged in that. [ZYCIE] You sign every application to install electronic bugs. How many such applications have you approved? [Milczanowski] I will not say. I even signed a few such applications today. [ZYCIE] While we were talking to one of the leaders of the present coalition parties inside the Sejm building, he turned on the radio. The reason, he explained, was to fool whoever was eavesdropping on him. You might think he was obsessed with the idea of being bugged, but he is not the only one who is worried about your activity. [Milczanowski] Who was he? [ZYCIE] The work of UOP arouses concern among politicians. You are considered alien to all political structures apart from the Belweder. Have you any explanation why people fear you? [Milczanowski] People are simply used to fearing UOP because UOP is burdened by the history of its predecessor, the Security Service. When I was still UOP chief, I answered telephones from all political groups--left, center, and right. Everyone was convinced they were being bugged by UOP. [ZYCIE] In political cases, did you ever decide to install bugs? [Milczanowski] I have already said I did not. [ZYCIE] If fewer people worked in UOP than did in the Security Service, the Security Service's past would not be such a heavy burden. [Milczanowski] During my spell in UOP, I got to know these people and learned to appreciate their work. I even grew to like them. If someone wants to be a responsible UOP chief, he has to identify himself with the people under his authority. [ZYCIE] Why has the Interior Ministry consistently refused to release files on the subject of the slaying of Stanislaw Pyjas, the Workers Defense Committee employee? [Milczanowski] We do not release material on the subject of personal sources of information. That is a matter of principle. [ZYCIE] But if you refuse to release material on Pyjas to the Prosecutor's Office so that an impartial court can judge the issue, you are turning yourself into a judge, and a biased one at that. Do you not trust anyone? [Milczanowski] The files have been examined with a view to ascertaining if any secret informer could have knowledge of the circumstances of Pyjas's death. The answer is no. [ZYCIE] Who performed this analysis? [Milczanowski] It was an internal Interior Ministry analysis. [ZYCIE] But it is the Prosecutor's Office and the courts that should have a chance of assessing this material themselves, independently. You cannot act as a judge. [Milczanowski] I disagree. I have a lot of experience and a bit of intuition. I know what is involved. As I said, I am opposed to revealing personal sources of information. If anyone compels me to reveal them, I will resign. [ZYCIE] The Interior Ministry remains outside control. Not even a parliamentary commission could get any information from you. Have you a feeling of not being under anyone's control? [Milczanowski] No. I might create the impression that I am tough and stubborn, but I am not. I am consistent, that is all. And I do not permit a violation of rules. Am I outside control? Look what the Sejm Commission for Administration and Internal Affairs is doing! Look at what the media are doing! You never leave me alone. You keep picking on UOP just for kicks. [ZYCIE] That is what we are here for. [Milczanowski] You ask about the links between the old Security Service and UOP. UOP is not a continuation of the Security Service, and, if I see the need to protect former Security Service employees, I do so for the sake of principles that are in force in every intelligence service in the world. The list of French World War II agents and collaborators is secret to this very day. [ZYCIE] Have you always been so tolerant of people as you are of former Security Service employees and collaborators? [Milczanowski] There is one thing I noticed not long ago--that work in UOP makes one tolerant of others. There is a tendency to see things clearly, in terms of black and white, and I have succumbed to this tendency. For me, the greatest difficulty is to see things in halftone, in semidarkness, and to reconcile differences. [ZYCIE] Is this the result of working for the Interior Ministry? [Milczanowski] Yes. In the Interior Ministry, one can see the complexity of human nature more clearly than anywhere else. One sees the negative side of the human soul, but also the positive side. In assessments, one cannot exaggerate. Every exaggeration is an offense. That is why I am offended by the extreme attitudes and statements of some people. I am annoyed by all of the sensation-seeking, unfounded statements and unjust accusations, and the manipulation of unverified data for the purpose of political gain. Sometimes, those shouting about being harmed and calling for justice are themselves harming others. What happens to justice then? Nothing. It merely rubs its sleepy eyes. What do I wish myself the most? I have no major expectations. I would like things to be a little easier, that is all.
