It is "a work of fiction in the form of an autobiography" that has been copied in turn by several newspapers, to the extent that the readers are puzzled. In Beijing, an authoritative historian specializing in the history of the CPC has read it and said that the story in this fiction is a complete fabrication, and the fiction is a vulgar piece of work that gains fame by deceiving the public. The author, called "Ai Bei," told a story in her book, saying that Zhou Enlai had had an extramarital affair with "An Ran," a secretary working for the Volunteers. When he knew that "An Ran" was pregnant, he insisted on having the baby, and for this reason he ran into a "marital crisis" with Deng Yingchao. During an interview with the reporters from this news agency, the expert, who has spent a long time researching the history of the CPC, pointed out that the persons who are familiar with China's political environment in the 1950's and those who understand Zhou Enlai's political beliefs and daily life, will be able to tell immediately that this plot is ridiculous. The expert also said that there was a very rigid security system at the senior level of the CPC, and it was virtually impossible for Zhou Enlai to freely meet with "An Ran," as the book described. If the story in the book were true, then it would have been leaked a long time ago. During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing and her followers dug three meters deep into the ground to collect material to topple Zhou Enlai. If there were such a rumor, then why would they not use it? Why has no one heard about it before? The expert said that this so-called "work of fiction in the form of an autobiography" was a fabricated story, and that this point is beyond any doubt. A writer has the freedom of creation, but randomly fabricating "an affair" to harm the reputation of a late dignitary and to cheat the public is very mean and immoral behavior. This person, who calls herself "Ai Bei," is in fact not Zhou Enlai's daughter, and her real life background will be uncovered by the people one day. By then the world will know the truth.
