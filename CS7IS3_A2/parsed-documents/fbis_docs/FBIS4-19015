The Resistance is part of history, and history is the truth.... [Berlusconi] (answers very seriously) The head of state could not have better expressed the values of the Constitution, whose guardian he is. His reference to antifascism's historical truth is sacrosanct. Of course, we must take into account the fact that history is made of winners and losers, and that the winners would be well advised not to rewrite history exclusively to their own advantage, without showing understanding and tolerance in regard to the losers' reasons. True antifascism can only be the opposite of any form of fanaticism and historical integralism. [Cevasco] You will then agree also with Democratic Party of the Left's (PDS) constitutional expert professor Augusto Barbera, who maintains that you should take part in the 25 April [Liberation Day] great antifascist demonstration. Will you join in? Personally? In word? In front of a videoscreen? In the street? Behind the.... [Berlusconi] I welcomed professor Barbera's words. He is right to say that the "stupid" positions of a certain section of the Left concerning the Resistance has given rise to blind and violent ideologies, akin to terrorism. I thank him for his invitation to take part in the demonstration. On 25 April I will be, ideally, on the side of all those who celebrate Italy's liberation, considering also that there will be several demonstrations organized under a variety of banners. The banner that I personally favor is that of truth and of the spirit of national reconciliation. [Cevasco] However, this 25 April is also being interpreted by the Left as a first instance of opposition to the pole for freedom's electoral victory. [Berlusconi] The link between 25 April and the left-wing forces' wish to get their own back, which is a legitimate wish in itself, is somewhat murky. Everything would be clearer, more transparent, if the left-wing forces did not jumble together a national festivity with their grief over their own defeat. It is not antifascism that lost the elections. Rather, the losers were the candidates in the lists set up by the old PCI [Italian Communist Party], reunited for the occasion under the banners of the PDS and Communist Renewal. This is a very different matter. [Cevasco] However, this 25 April will still be marked by division. On whose side will you stand? There are many ways of interpreting and remembering that date.... [Berlusconi] I have already said on whose side I stand, and I do not find it shocking in the least that there should be different ways of remembering a date which belongs to everybody. Obligatory parades on 1 May were something which used to take place on Red Square. There are no more historical balconies and draft cards now. [Cevasco] Where were you that day? [Berlusconi] I was a nine-year old kid, who had been evacuated to Oltrona Sanmamete, a village in the Como province. [Cevasco] How did your father describe events, and how did your family live through that experience? [Berlusconi] My father never held a fascist party card, and in fact he was forced to take refuge in Switzerland for some time. My grandfather was even less fortunate: They forced him to swallow castor oil, not the "electronic" type either; one night -- he told me -- he had to hide under a bridge, at the Navigli [Milan canals system], out of fear of the Fascist action squads. [Cevasco] If you had had in your hands the material used for the "Combat" program broadcast by RAI [State Broadcasting Corporation], how would you have reacted? [Berlusconi] I would have broadcast it, just like RAI did. Perhaps I would have tried to be more sensitive to the feelings and the memory of the antifascists, but I would have not in the least censored those images which spoke of violence and brutality from the other side -- the kind of violence and brutality witnessed at Piazzale Loreto [site of Mussolini's execution]. In those times, censorship was carried out by the Minculpop [Ministry of Popular Culture], but I do not like the Mintelpop (ministry of popular television) any better. [Cevasco] However, as a citizen, what is your opinion of that program? [Berlusconi] Essentially -- I repeat -- it was a positive exercise, a tribute to historical truth. [Cevasco] What did you feel when you heard [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini define Mussolini as the greatest statesman in the century? [Berlusconi] Mussolini governed for 20 years against the rules of democracy and freedom. Finally, he dragged Italy into a war, and the country was devastated by it. Having said this, historical truth and interpretation are always more complicated than the final verdict. I think that there were no elements of fanaticism, loyalism, or nostalgia in Fini's statement. It contained, in fact, an historical interpretation -- a legitimate one, although I do not share it. As for the question who is this century's greatest statesman -- at the risk of arousing my friend [Radical leader] Pannella's indignation -- I would answer: Giolitti, liberal Giovanni Giolitti. [Cevasco] What, then, do you consider to be fascist today? The purges that are being threatened -- or what else? [Berlusconi] The purges are neither fascist nor antifascist -- they simply do not exist. I do, however, consider the attacks and personal intimidation aimed at opponents who are regarded as enemies -- those which, as your Professor Panebianco wrote, have, oddly enough, become the speciality of one section of the Italian Left -- as actions of the "fascist school." [Cevasco] Nevertheless, British and American newspapers abroad have highlighted the link between Forza Italia's electoral victory and the concern over a fascist comeback. Why is this so, in your view? [Berlusconi] Partly, we in the pole for freedom failed to make ourselves clear. On the other hand, it is difficult to describe a situation which, for the first time, is truly new -- one which, to anyone attempting to give an account of it, presents traits that are completely different from anything witnessed for the past 50 years. However, the misunderstandings in the foreign press are also partly due to that syndrome which, in fact, was very appropriately described in yesterday's CORRIERE. Often correspondents paraphrase what they find in local papers, and what they hear in the opinion-making circles among the elite. If Italian newspapers indulge in emotionality and overexcitement, correspondents run the risk of contagion. You should also be giving some thought to this problem. It is not exactly a great self-image that the country is projecting to the outside world: It is neither beautiful nor true to life. [Cevasco] Fini is also speaking, in his own way, of appeasement, and of overcoming the fascist-antifascist logic. Do you agree with this, and what do you understand by appeasement? [Berlusconi] Appeasement means that each person sticks to his own principles and his own truth, without however infringing on other people's rights, and without bending history and memory in order to serve political aims -- all of this with the necessary observance of the republican Constitution, which can be democratically changed, but not dispensed with. [Cevasco] By the way, have you read Norberto Bobbio's book on the Right and the Left? Where do you place yourself in relation to his definition of the Right and the Left? [Berlusconi] I have not read it, but I hope I will have the time to do so soon. I appreciate Senator Bobbio. If the book confirms his views on the Right and the Left, as they have been expounded in many articles of his, I will say that my place is truly in the center, because I believe that there are vital values on both sides. However, I do not trust the old political toponymy, and in any case I am against intolerance and extremism: If such trends develop on the Left, I lean toward the Right, and vice versa. [Cevasco] However, there must be some personality belonging to the existing or the historical Right, of whom you have a high opinion... [Berlusconi] When De Gaulle came into power, the Left spoke of a fascist coup. Here is an outstanding personality -- classified as an exponent of the Right in a loose and approximate manner -- in Europe's recent history. The truth is that I prefer personalities who are difficult to classify. [Cevasco] And whom do you consider as right-wing today? [Berlusconi] The extremists on both wings -- those who endow political action with a ritual and rhetorical meaning, mistaking ideological beliefs for civil reason. [Cevasco] Among Fininvest's opinion-makers, whom would you place more to the Right? Mentana, Liguori, Fede, Sgarbi, Funari, Ferrara... [Berlusconi] I have no wish to make some hasty judgment on people with whom I have worked together in my group. Allow me this stylistic freedom. [Cevasco] Granted, but allow me in turn to insist on Ambra: Some people have compared her to a "Giovane Italia" [Fascist youth] because of her militant faith in Forza Italia. [Berlusconi] I will gladly make an exception in Ambra's case, because she is a young woman who works hard, amuses herself, and tries to amuse others. She is a TV personality, and that is that. It is absurd that she should be attributed so much significance, and that demonstrations should be called against her, thus treating a very young person and citizen like some sort of ideological object or symbol. [Cevasco] Let us return to more serious things: Where should Forza Italia's elected deputies sit in parliament: right or left of the League and National Alliance [AN]? [Berlusconi] In the center. [Cevasco] Let us be even more serious: If you had had the age of discretion at the time of the civil war, which side would you have taken? [Berlusconi] These questions are too difficult, because it is too easy to decide with hindsight. [Cevasco] Let us, then, come back to the present. In a letter to IL MANIFESTO, [progressive candidate] Giuseppe Giulietti writes that Milan could be the ideal city for the 25 April demonstration "precisely because it was from there that Berlusconi challenged the Left and is now preparing the ultimate affront of relegitimizing the fascists." Do you agree, at least on Milan as a venue? [Berlusconi] "De minimis non curat praetor" [Latin, the praetor does not deal with trifling details]. As far as Milan is concerned, the only challenge I took up in the past was that of turning it into a more solid, more beautiful, and more European town. [Cevasco] Giovanni Gentile, the fascist philosopher who was killed by GAP [Partisan Action Group] members, is now being revalued by the Left... [Berlusconi] This is a subject for historians. His thought and his cultural action are the proper domain for philosophers and historians of ideas. [Cevasco] One of the Left's hobbyhorses -- though not only of the Italian Left -- are the antitrust laws. Are you prepared to commit yourself to undertaking a review of the antitrust law on TV, thus obviously "harming" both Fininvest and RAI? [Berlusconi] Antitrust and antifascism have only one thing in common: the "anti" prefix. I hope no confusion arises in this respect, which would be ludicrous. However, I am a champion of the market, in deed and not in name. Before the appearance of commercial TV in Italy, we really had a supertrust, the state's monopoly of TV. As far as the future is concerned, I favor the emergence of other broadcasting institutions, without however expropriating those who have invested resources and created employment, and perhaps I would invite others to run the risk of investing in the market, by appropriately amending the relevant legislation. The issue will concern me as a deputy and politician, but not as a businessman, because there will be a very clear-cut and transparent division between the two roles in the forms that we are currently examining.
