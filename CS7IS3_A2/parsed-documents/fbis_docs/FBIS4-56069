The question is highly topical. It seems that, to this day, U.S. official quarters are not properly informed [nezorientovali sa] about the Slovak issue, which testifies either to the incompetence of its intelligence sources or to the provision of deliberately incorrect information to the U.S. political leadership by U.S. secret services. After all, we are familiar with this situation from the era of so-called socialism when, in some of its stages, particularly in the fifties, political institutions were evidently manipulated by the state police. One cannot but hope that the former communist countries with the Soviet Union in the lead do not serve as an example for the contemporary United States in this respect. That also applies to the unerring selection of evident dummies for the vitally important security structures of the state. The present state of affairs is borne out by the continuing practice of U.S. institutions to issue official information, according to which the situation in Slovakia is similar to that in the warring countries of the former Soviet Union.
