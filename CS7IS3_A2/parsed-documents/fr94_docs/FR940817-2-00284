FR940817-2-00284 FR940817-2-00114 b. Combination container_RO/RO _Square feet (meters) and container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). c. Barge Carrier _Cargo deadweight capacity. d. Partial containerships and container bulk _Cargo deadweight. e. Self-sustaining containerships _Total below deck and on deck container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). f. Non-self-sustaining containerships _Total below deck and on deck container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). g. Breakbulk ships _Cargo deadweight. 6. A ship on charter to a Participant shall not be subject to contribution under this Agreement in the case where the period of contribution would be longer than the remaining term of the Participant's charter or in a case where the contribution would otherwise breach the terms of the charter party, but such tonnage shall be included in the calculation of the Participant's controlled tonnage. 7. The ``controlled tonnage'' of each Participant shall be divided into two categories: a. Level I _Vessels of the Participant which are: i. Subject to Title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1171 et seq. ) It is anticipated that Title VI will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators and the Secretary. Vessels covered by an operating agreement are in Level I. ii. Otherwise required by law to be made available to meet national defense requirements. b. Level II _All other vessels of the Participant. Level I vessels shall be provided immediately in response to the call of the Administrator and instructions of the Administrator are to be observed with the utmost dispatch. Level I vessels will be called into service before Level II vessels. Level II vessels shall be provided according to the schedule set forth in the call of the Administrator. Level II vessels will be called into service if and when Level I vessels actually provided are not sufficient to meet the emergency. A Participant may offer Level II vessels for service as Level I vessels. 8. Other than the specific use of ships described in VI.C.2.b. (foreign-flag feeder vessels), it is expected that vessels covered by an operating agreement will be utilized to the maximum extent possible for line haul service to meet DOD requirements. When a specific ship covered by an operating agreement is removed from regular service to meet DOD requirements, a foreign-flag ship may be employed to replace the ship taken from regular service. 9. The Administrator retains the right under law to requisition ships of Participants. A Participant's ships which are directly requisitioned by the United States or which are under other U.S. Government voluntary arrangements shall be credited against the Participant's proportionate contribution under this Agreement. Ships on charter to DOD when this Agreement is activated shall not be so credited. D. Equitable Contribution of Intermodal Equipment_ 1. ``Controlled intermodal equipment'' shall mean such equipment as is needed in the operation of a Participant's intermodal shipping system and which a Participant owns or leases. 2. During the standby period, the Administrator shall determine the inventory of controlled intermodal equipment as of a specific date each year. 3. When an ocean carrier Participant contributes containerships or partial containerships, or capacity, it will provide containers in accordance with VI.C.4. above and chassis as specified in a Plan of Action. 4. Each Participant agrees to contribute intermodal equipment as provided in a Plan of Action, which may require contribution in the proportion of its inventory of each type of equipment to the total inventory of that type held by all Participants; Provided , that, at the discretion of the Administrator, on the advice of the Committee, when a Participant contributes specialized equipment which is not available from all Participants, its proportionate share of common types of equipment may be adjusted so that its overall contribution is in approximately the same proportion to its total available inventory as are the overall contributions of other Participants to their available inventories.
