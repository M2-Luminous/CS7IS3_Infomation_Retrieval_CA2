Today's agenda reflects this trend," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in his opening address at the meeting of CIS foreign ministers in Moscow today. The forum is being attended by delegations from all 12 countries of the Commonwealth, including foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Other countries are represented by ambassadors and deputy foreign ministers. Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze told ITAR-TASS that a Georgian delegation was taking part in a meeting such as this for the first time, but as a new member of the CIS, Georgia "will try to make its modest contribution to the strengthening of the Commonwealth". Ukrainian Ambassador Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told ITAR-TASS that "We have certain considerations concerning the documents examined at the forum, particularly the document on the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. We do not understand what a linguistic minority means. In our republic there are ethnic minorities -- Russians and Poles. Ukraine is doing everything in its power for them not to feel that their rights are infringed upon."
