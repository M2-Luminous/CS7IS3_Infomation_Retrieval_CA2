Jan Kalvoda, for instance, said a few days ago that he was dissatisfied with the method of communication in the coalition. I would like to ask you whether things have cleared up after the meeting and whether you reached a consensus on the disputed issues. [Klaus] No agreement has been reached because the differences are not caused by lack of communication. This is simply a rumor that is being constantly spread around by someone. The differences exist because of differing views, because of differing approaches to the various issues we are currently facing. Naturally, these differences do not apply to the 95 percent of matters of everyday importance. The differences lie in several evergreens, so to speak. On the one hand, there are the restitution-related issues, and, on the other, there is the creation of the senate, a new chamber in our parliament. In my view, the need for this chamber is very disputable. The third issue is formed by the contentious problems related to the regional setup, the issues that stir the whole country. Thus our views do indeed differ, and in no case can they be related to lack of communication. [Weissova] Let us return to your recent visit to Finland. In your own words, one of the experiences you brought with you from there was that the admission into the European Union does not need to be a cure all, and that, especially at the beginning, it might bring certain disadvantages. Does this mean that you share with the so-called Euroskeptics their worries about the Brussels bureaucracy, which, by the way, is formed mainly by people from governing European Socialist parties? [Klaus] [passage omitted] This bureaucracy is not a fundamental problem of the European Community. It is, rather, a complementary problem that is above the fundamental problem. In my view, the fundamental question is something else: what the concept of European integration is, to what degree it really means a general opening of various obstacles, movements of people, ideas, goods, money, and various other things all over Europe--which we support wholeheartedly--and to what extent it is an attempt to force upon people a specific ideology, specific unity, specific compulsory common solutions, and thousands of other things. This is not Euroskeptism; this is Eurorealism. This is simply searching for a sensible social setup in Europe. I always say that the important thing is not whether there will be 12 or 16 or 20 countries, but what system of relations between the individual and the state will prevail in this situation.
