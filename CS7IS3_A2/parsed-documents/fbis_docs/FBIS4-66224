From the local branches to the center, from factions to individual persons, everyone was flexing one's muscles and scheming as to how many votes could be garnered. Different Inner-Party Factions Presently, it is no more possible to divide the DPP comprehensively into the traditional two factions, the Meilitao [Formosa] Faction and the Hsin Chaoliu [New Trend] Faction. Speaking of factions that would constitute appreciable forces in the present inner-party power struggle, we would have to include the old stronghold of the Meilitao group and its affiliated organizations of local party branches that have been penetrated by the Meilitao's medium-age group [zhong sheng dai], then also the Hsin Chaoliu Faction, the Taiwan Independence Alliance, the Kungtouhui group, the Alliance for Justice, the Welfare State Alliance, and other local factions not otherwise affiliated. Apart from this, and apart from setting up DPP representatives for the various districts, certain local political personages have also begun to gain such power as would allow them to intrude into the power centers of the DPP. For instance, of the 11 seats of party representatives of the Tainan City party branch, there are two seats that had been created in the present election by Lin Nan-sheng [2651 0589 3932], who had been expelled from the Kuomintang, but who had still, in violation of party discipline, participated in the election. He and some of his supporters later joined the DPP. There was also the case in Chiayi County where, as we understand, one seat was given to a person who had strong connections to the local faction. Although the number of this type of party representatives is extremely small, also of little impact on the present power core of the DPP, the phenomenon is still very worthwhile watching as to its future development. Although some "thorough accounting" [jing suan] was started as soon as the election of party candidates had been completed and much planning was done as to how to combine the diverse factions and personalities, the main focus of attention was directed to the election of the party chairman. However, actually, with the factual attachments of the party representatives in so confusing a state of entanglements and not even the beginnings of unification apparent among them, it is only the 31-seat central executive committee, the power core of the party, that most people can now definitely figure out and get a good grasp on. Because the status of the large majority of natural DPP party representatives is that of public servants, they ordinarily have their base of actions and operations within their faction, therefore, as far as the various factions are concerned, the difficulty of assessing votes is still when concerned with the local party representatives. For instance, Taipei and Kaohsiung have 35, 36 local party representatives, but almost all belong to various public service bureaus, and we may still differentiate between them comparatively easily according to the factions of the public office they belong to. However, there may also be some factional overlapping, and this may lead to erroneous assumptions. In all other localities it is even more difficult to get a grasp of the true situation. For instance, the five seats for local party representatives in Pingtung County comprise one seat for the Hsin Chaoliu faction, one seat for the Taiwan Independence Alliance, while the allotment of the other three seats is not clear. But we understand that it was already more or less openly promised the local party representatives during the election campaign that Su Chen-chang [5685 6297 2490]--not supported by any particular faction--a man who had failed in the election for county magistrate and who is now DPP secretary-general, will certainly become member of the central standing committee. This is an example of relying on some kind of local bondage. Again, almost all the ten seats for party representatives of Kaohsiung County are considered the domain of the Yu [0151] family group [jia ban], who belong to the Meilitao faction, but magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien [0151 2398 2009] belongs to the Alliance for Justice. If Yu Chen Yueh-ying [0151 7115 2588 3841] will enter the contest for membership in the central standing committee, the direction in which the votes of the Yu family bloc will be split between the Meilitao and the Alliance for Justice would become a matter of close speculation. Moreover, in the present power struggle within the DPP, two new forces are joining the fray from abroad, namely the Kungtouhui and the Taiwan Independence Alliance, but the power of these two factions and their work at the basic level is somewhat related. Insiders in the Taiwan Independence Alliance have pointed out that after election of the regional party delegates, the strength of the Taiwan Independence Alliance is after all not as formerly anticipated, while that of Tsai Tung-jung's [5591 0681 2837] Kungtou system is exceeding general anticipation. These persons believe that it has much to do with the fact that the Taiwan Independence Alliance has been doing work at the basic level for only a little over one year and has not yet completed its deployment and build-up. For example, in the case of Chang Tsan-hung [1728 3503 1347], now elected party representative in Tainan City, it was pointed out that the forces of Tsai Chieh-hsiung [5591 0094 7160], a provincial counselor of the Meilitao faction, had provisionally allocated over 100 votes in support of Chang Tsan-hung before the election. However, many among these supposed voters failed to vote. On the other hand, cadres of the Taiwan Independence Alliance in the Tainan district came up before the election with urgently needed votes and thereby achieved their task of "protecting their lord" and indeed had Chang Tsan-hung rise to become third-highest vote-getter. However, this version has not been confirmed. As to the trial of strength between the two forces coming from abroad, Yulin County might be expected to become indicative of how their struggle will go. Yulin County will have seven votes for party representatives, one will belong to the Taiwan Independence Alliance and one to one of its affiliates, while the designation of the remaining votes has not yet been clearly determined. Hsu Lung-chun [6079 7893 0193], the newly elected chairman of the Yulin County party branch, has had good relations with both the Taiwan Independence Alliance and the Kungtouhui. As we understand, the local party representatives in Yulin County have temporarily come to one common understanding, namely not to allow themselves to be manipulated as pawns by any faction or personality during the coming elections. When the various forces will come and try to win over new followers, they, the Yulin representatives, will therefore probably resort to the method of asking these factions first how many seats they control, and then, after assessing the "true strength" of each, arrive at their final decision. Among the older factions, the Meilitao faction, although fragmented and dispersed, is presently still the largest faction. At the time of election to the central executive committee and central standing committee, the Meilitao faction will only have to exchange votes with the various local bosses and both sides will have to render mutual support. The medium-age group [zhong sheng dai] of the Meilitao faction are assessed as presently having a good chance of getting the membership in the central executive committee, out of the two top possibilities. The forces of the old Meilitao faction are still in the process of consolidation. The important variable of great influence will then be whether legislator Chang Chun-hung [1728 0193 1347] will decide to enter the race for party chairman. Because Chang Chun-hung's forces had not yet been mobilized during the present selection of delegates, they gained only one seat among the seven candidates for Taipei City party representatives, and that created a crisis for the Meilitao faction. Most members of the Meilitao faction believe that if Chang Chun-hung will stand for election as party chairman, he would be the most formidable challenge for the re-election of the incumbent chairman Shih Ming-teh [2457 2494 1795]. On the other hand, it has already assumed the appearance of a "fight for the protection of the Meilitao faction." Chang Chun-hung could exercise extremely powerful pressure, and it is for this reason that he appears even more cautious in every respect in his present solicitation of opinions and assessments. The likelihood of re-election of incumbent chairman Shih Ming-teh has much increased after he gained the support of the Hsin Chaoliu faction and most personages of the Welfare State Alliance [Fuliguo lian xian]. As to Tsai Tung-jung's drive to enter the campaign for party chairmanship--he, like Shih Ming-teh, belongs to the Welfare State Alliance--this has evoked calls for his retirement from some colleagues in the Welfare State Alliance, while Chang Tsan-hung's campaign strategy gradually shifted toward mainly external propaganda and enhanced external influence. It is generally foreseen that if the present DPP election for party president will ultimately develop into a confrontation between personalities on the island and those abroad, it will--regardless of whether the two men will fight it out to the end--create for both of them a rather unfavorable overall situation. Because the present realignment of power within the DPP will have an impact on overall position in future major elections, everyone inwardly figures that the drive to bring all the diverse forces within the factions together will become even more acute. Add to it the fact that after the experiences of all these years, fighting skills on all sides have been further developed and matured. If one would, therefore, still have the idea that this new wave, the change-over of teams in power within the party, could now be weathered as a smooth transition, that would, by all appearances, be a difficult thing to achieve.
