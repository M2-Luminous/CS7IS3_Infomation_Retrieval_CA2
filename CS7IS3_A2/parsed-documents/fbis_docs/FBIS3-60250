Far from lending an ear to criticism from the world public, Russia has announced that it would continue nuclear waste dumping in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, and Japan tries to avoid criticism, alleging that the nuclear waste it has dumped is not dangerous, the statement says, and continues: It is impudent of Russia and Japan to talk about the DPRK's "compliance with the nuclear safeguards agreement" while wantonly violating international accord without an elementary morality. Russia and Japan must refrain from their reckless act of decrying the DPRK, immediately stop dumping nuclear waste in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, apologize to the countries in the coastal areas, scoop up the dumped nuclear waste out of the sea at once and punish those responsible for the dumping. We hope all the international organisations and community will pay deep attention to the destruction of sea biological resources by Russia and Japan and its consequences and take relevant measures.
