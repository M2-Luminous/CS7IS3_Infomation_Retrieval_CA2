President Havel made this comment at a press conference, adding that conditions for membership have become more stringent following the Community's "metamorphosis" into a Union. "We cannot apply for membership tomorrow or the next day.... We are waiting to be ripe," he added. Mr. Havel did not express a view on the advisability of "partial" membership (to the second and third pillars, for example) but underscored his country's will to participate in political dialogue with the EU.
