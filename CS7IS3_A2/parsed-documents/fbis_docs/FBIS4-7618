But one must get used to various things, including difficult situations. I have been saying from the very beginning of the protest action that one cannot expect spectacular victories, and that this will be a longer process that we must patiently go through. It will take at least several months. All around the world, including in the United States and Japan, the fight went on for months. That is also what will happen in Poland. It is my prediction that the protests' first effects will be visible in a few months, but I doubt that we will be successful in bringing this fight to an end. After all, there is also the issue of constitutional provisions that we must make sure are enacted. If we want to secure ourselves by protecting employee rights, by protecting the rights of people who work in trade unions--and also in various organizations--for free, that must be covered by constitutional provisions. We could not have waited any longer to begin the current protests. If we were to consider a one-time protest, perhaps it would be worth delaying the action by a month or two--that is, until society receives the first increased electric and natural gas bills--and then society's outrage will increase. But that was not the issue. The fact that the scenario did not materialize is proof of Solidarity's logical strategies, whose goal is a wide, social aspect and not just individual interests. Right now, everything depends on the positions that people will adopt. More and more people are becoming aware that their economic and social rights are in danger. But perhaps not enough people are aware of that. People still do not realize that they will not get anything without a fight: They will have no guarantee of the right to social insurance, to vacations, and to other types of benefits; they also do not realize that they will cease to be partners [as published]. But there will come a time when they will lose their patience. I was not optimistic from the beginning that our demands would be met soon. That is because such is the practice adopted by subsequent governments for very many years now: Specific problems are not solved but, rather, obscured. And I can see no reason for that situation to change. I said during a recent rally in Krakow that this is not the way it is going to be: We have appointed negotiators, who will deal with the government for us. If we do not make ourselves seen in public--in factories, on the streets, and at rallies--the negotiators' mission will fail. We experienced that before, for many years, not just after 1980 but also before. There must be pressure: If there is no pressure, our demands will remain just that and nothing else. The trade union should work out a strategy of political action, and special centers for substantive work should be established for that purpose. Money must be found. What is absolutely indispensable is to establish a bureau for economic and social-policy analysis. We must present specific arguments to the people--the "Mazowsze" region [of Solidarity] is devoting 1 billion zlotys for that purpose already at this point. One must not spare money for that goal. We must also have a strong group that would be prepared to have the trade union participate in the mass media in order to present our arguments there. The trade union position on every issue important to society should be communicated.
