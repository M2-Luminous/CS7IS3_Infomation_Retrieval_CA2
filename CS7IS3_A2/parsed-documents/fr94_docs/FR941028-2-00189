All regimens administered intermittently should be directly observed. For infants and children with miliary TB, bone and joint TB, or TB meningitis, treatment should last at least 12 months. For adults with these forms of extrapulmonary TB, response to therapy should be monitored closely. If response is slow or suboptimal, treatment may be prolonged on a case-by-case basis. ¶ Some evidence suggests that SM may be discontinued after 4 months if the isolate is susceptible to all drugs. **Avoid treating pregnant women with SM because of the risk of ototoxicity to the fetus. Note: For all patients, if drug-susceptibility results show resistance to any of the first-line drugs, or if the patient remains symptomatic or smear- or culture-positive after 3 months, consult a TB medical expert.
