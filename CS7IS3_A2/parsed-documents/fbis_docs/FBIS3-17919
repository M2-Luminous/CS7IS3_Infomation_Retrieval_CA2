In his view, Russia is purposefully delaying the setting up of the commission, as well as the launch of the joint fleet review. One of the main reasons, the rear-admiral believes, is that "someone stands to lose from disclosing the facts of illegal use of property and funds, which unfortunately does happen in the Black Sea Fleet, and therefore, does not think it desirable." Mykola Kostrov recalled that the Black Sea Fleet command recently did all it could to prevent the commission, which arrived from Kiev and Moscow, from starting an inspection of one of the Black Sea Fleet fuel bases. Despite the commission's wide powers, the fleet command explained their actions saying that they were subordinate only to the two presidents, of Russia and Ukraine. They do, though, as a rule, obey orders, directives, and instructions coming from Russia's Defense Ministry and Navy headquarters. Meanwhile, the rear admiral stressed, the delay of the commissions' work only tightens the knot of the Black Sea Fleet problems.
