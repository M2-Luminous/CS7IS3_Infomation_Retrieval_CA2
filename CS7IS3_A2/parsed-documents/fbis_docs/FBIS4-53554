FBIS4-53554 "dreas098_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Trade Surplus Scores Fifth Straight Rise in Apr Trade Surplus Scores Fifth Straight Rise in Apr OW2005085194 Tokyo KYODO in English 0830 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005085194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's trade surplus posted a fifth consecutive year-on-year monthly increase in April as the politically sensitive surplus with the United States rose for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Friday [20 May]. The increase came as informal U.S.-Japan trade talks resumed in Washington, and a ministry official stressed "the unchanged recent trend of declining exports and rising imports and declining overall yen-based surplus." The overall customs-cleared merchandise trade surplus rose an unadjusted 8.1 percent to 11.12 billion dollars as the surplus with the U.S. rose 8.9 percent to 4.38 billion dollars, the ministry said. In yen terms, however, the overall figure fell 1.6 percent to mark the third straight decline with the surplus with the U.S. dipping 0.9 percent after rising the previous month. The official, briefing reporters, said the yen's rise is contributing to boosting imports and curbing export volume but has yet to be sufficiently passed along to prices due to the so-called J-curve effects of swelling dollar-term figures. The dollar averaged 104.43 yen in April, down 10.0 percent from a year before. April exports rose 7.1 percent from a year before to 32.89 billion dollars, and imports climbed 6.6 percent to 21.77 billion dollars -- both gaining for 14 months in a row. In yen terms, exports fell 2.7 percent for the 13th straight monthly decline, and imports dropped 3.2 percent for the 24th. Referring to the index of trade growth, the official said export volume decreased for three consecutive months, and imports for 12 months. Looking ahead, he expressed hopes for a dollar-based shrinkage from summer as the dollar had fallen to the 105-yen level in the period from June through August. Many private economists agreed that the dollar-term surplus would move lower. Nobuyuki Saji, senior economist at the Nikko Research Center, said, "the trend for lower surpluses in terms of volume and the yen is certainly fixed." Some kind of an effect from the yen's rise last summer can be expected ahead, he said. "But a sharp shrinkage is unlikely," Saji said, noting strong exports to recovering overseas markets, particularly of electronics products to the U.S. In April, major export gainers were semiconductor and other electronics parts, up 31.8 percent, automobile parts, up 28.3 percent, and ships, up 62.4 percent. For imports, semiconductor and other electronics parts rose 33.1 percent, clothing gained 19.3 percent and aircraft surged 140.0 percent. The ministry official said that many special factors were seen in April to judge the overall trend, citing increased exports of huge tankers, higher imports of aircraft, and lower crude oil prices. With crude prices falling 21.2 percent to 14.57 dollars per barrel, imports fell 20.4 percent in value while volume remained almost unchanged. Among other countries, Japan's trade surplus with the European Union fell 11.6 percent to 2.32 billion dollars for the fourth straight decline, and the gap with other Asian nations rose 12.4 percent to 5.31 billion dollars for the 24th consecutive increase.
