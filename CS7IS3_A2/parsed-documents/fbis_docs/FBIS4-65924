He was referrring to progress on forming a government following discussions with his fellow party leaders and the three politicians charged by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions. This was the first time that Bolkestein had expressed any doubts regarding the chances of achieving a "purple" coalition [composed of the Democrats 66, D66, the Labor Party, PvdA, and the VVD]. He had previously refrained from making any judgment. Bolkestein indicated that the negotiations proper have not yet begun. Leaving the First Chamber, where talks are being held, PvdA leader Kok said "we have listed all the subjects that need to be discussed." Bolkestein said later: "That is somewhat of an exaggeration on the part of Mr. Kok. There are subjects which we have not yet looked at." The VVD leader stated that the talks are still in their initial phase and they have not yet gotten down to discussing the details. Bolkestein: "And as you know, it is in the details that the problems lie." When asked why the process has to take so long, he replied: "Because it is so difficult." He said that he did not know when the negotiations proper would be able to begin. Addressing the assembled journalists, he quoted an Arab saying: "It is difficult to predict anything, especially about the future." The D66's Van Mierlo, the last of the group to leave the building, was rather more optimistic. He termed the talks "fruitful." "It is a typical example of a fruitful process." Are the negotiators rather fearful of the prospect of beginning the negotiations proper? Van Mierlo: "No, this is a calm, prudent approach. Tomorrow, I believe it will be tougher. We are probing deeper all the time. Tomorrow we are going to really get down to discussing specific points rather than taking stock of the situation." The politicians responsible for assessing the coalitions' feasibility drew up an agenda last Wednesday based on the subjects raised by the party leaders. They are now putting the finishing touches to a timetable covering around 20 meeting hours. According to this timetable, a provisional assessment of the situation should be made on Friday. Then they will be able to reply to the question as to whether there is any point in pursuing the attempt to form a "purple" coalition.
