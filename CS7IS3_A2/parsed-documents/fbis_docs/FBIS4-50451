In the commercial field, foreign businessmen will be encouraged to run shops selling brand-name commodities, gift boutiques, chain stores, large shopping arcades, and joint-venture supermarkets. The commerce and investment in the Yangpu Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Zone will be opened fully, and foreign businessmen will be able to set up joint-venture, cooperative, or solely-owned commercial organizations and operate large shopping arcades. In the foreign trade field, foreign businessmen will be allowed to invest in enterprises, to have shares of enterprises in the province which have the right to import and export goods, or to jointly run these enterprises in a bid to give full play to the strong points of foreign capital and domestic capital and to let them supplement each other. Likewise, in addition to allowing foreign businessmen to invest in the construction of superhighways, railways, ports, and wharves, and to operate these projects, they will be able to invest in automobile transportation. Preferential policies will also be implemented and comprehensive compensation will be made. Hainan will also allow foreign businessmen to invest in and operate airport construction, aircraft maintenance, and airport services projects. First rate foreign airlines with a good reputation will be invited to take part in such projects, and one or two Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative airlines will be set up on a trial basis. Hainan will also set up one or two foreign- invested accountant offices and lawyers' offices on a trial basis. The lawyer agency system will be gradually implemented in a bid to speed up the convergence of Hainan's tertiary industry with international norms. Hainan will allow foreign businessmen to buy shares of state enterprises and to take over or annex state enterprises. Hainan will also allow foreign businessmen to transform state enterprises through leasing and contracting.
