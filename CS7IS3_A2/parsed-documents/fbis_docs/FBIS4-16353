[Begin Kasatonov recording] What happened is the result of political games, first and foremost. [end recording] [passage omitted] What happened in Odessa between 8 and 11 April on the territory of the 318th Division can be viewed as a state, anti-Russian action by Ukrainian armed forces. That is how the former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, and now first deputy commander in chief of the Russian Navy, Igor Kasatonov, appraised the Odessa incident today. [Begin Kasatonov recording] Women and children were taken outside in the middle of the night. They were lined up like in the worst times, 50-odd years ago, when Odessa was occupied. Some were taken away, a child was injured. [end recording] As Admiral Kasatonov reported at the news conference, the Russian side is now trying to the best of its ability to resolve the conflict. But the Ukraine Fleet command has already issued an ultimatum saying that all sailors and officers who have not taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine have to leave the territory of Black Sea Fleet units immediately. New commanders from the Ukrainian armed forces have already been appointed to the garrisons in Ochakov, Nikolayev and Izmail. But nevertheless a solution must be found. Otherwise, as one of the major western politicians said, the military conflict in Bosnia will seem to the world community to be an innocent row between two adoloscents who have fallen out in comparison with the possible consequences of the Odessa incident, if two great powers -- Russia and Ukraine -- do not find mutual understanding.
