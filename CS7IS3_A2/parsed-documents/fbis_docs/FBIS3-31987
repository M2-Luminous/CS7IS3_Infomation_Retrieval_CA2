At the beginning of the interview Gen. Discua discussed a very important issue: the transfer or change over of Joint Chief of Staff Reynaldo Andino Flores to the Defense Ministry. My first question is if this should be viewed as a purge or a normal change within the Armed Forces. [Discua] Allow me to tell you that no ulterior motives should be attached to this situation. A list of officers who could fill the Defense Ministry post was presented to the president-elect, who had publicly requested such a list at a council meeting. When he returned from the United States I gave him a list of several officers and the selection was made exclusively by the president- elect. [Murillo] That is a normal decision during a change of government. Nevertheless, he also spoke of the duties the military institution would carry out through the Executive Branch to coordinate with Congress a purging of the police and to counteract the crime wave that is destroying the country. [Discua] As I said, there are many issues that must be approached in a very serious manner, such as military service, human rights, and the police. I have spoken at length with the president- elect about these issues because the Armed Forces want to resolve them. Of course, it would be irresponsible on our part to [words indistinct] because that requires a process that should conclude prior to the year 2000 when the police and Armed Forces are in the condition the people would like to see. The Armed Forces have always agreed with a constitutional reform pertaining to the police, and we are working on it. In due time we will present a report to the president-elect; the general situation has been outlined to him and we are waiting for him to summon us. We are [words indistinct] to all the issues that have been sources of controversy at any given time, but this has helped us to reconsider and begin a period during which, I believe, the people will be content. [Murillo] Spokesmen from the party that is about to take office have said that international organizations are pressing for constitutional reforms and that they have established certain conditions. These conditions include reducing the Army and making certain basic taxes mandatory so payments will continue to be made to the government. What is your reaction to this? You have always said that foreign pressure should never prevail. [Discua] I must tell you that approximately three months ago, or, in other words, last year a meeting was held in Chile to examine Latin America's military spending. The participants took a very close look at military spending with regard to each country's gross domestic product. In Latin America, military spending fluctuates between 1 percent and 7.6 or 7.8 percent. Therefore, there are countries whose military spending is very high. Honduras' spending is less than 1 percent. In other words, our military spending with regard to our GDP is the lowest in Central America and even in Latin America. The Honduran Armed Forces have a budget of $40 million; Costa Rica has $48 million, and the figure rises. In other words, Honduras is the Central American country that spends the least on its military. [Murillo] [words indistinct] making of demands seems to be a prerequisite? [Discua] This is logical. However, I believe the president-elect stated categorically in Washington that the Armed Forces reduction had to conform to each government's needs for equipment [word indistinct]. I have always said that we have to find a balance in Central America. I know the institution must make structural reforms to be in keeping with the new government's modernization policy. [Murillo] With regard to the implementation of the military law, General Discua said there is no wrestling for power or internal strife in the military institution. He added that new groups arise in the Armed Forces as classes start to retire in compliance with the institution's bylaws and military law. [Discua] Logically, we at Mufoco [expansion unknown] will no longer be active Armed Forces officers, and new classes will start taking our places. I believe we have to start the opening process. My entire graduating class will retire when I finish my term and new classes will take our places. They are young military men with experience who will always try to do what is best for the institution. We have to hope that this is how it will turn out. [Murillo] As an institutional policy, and based on international agreements, several U.S. Government sectors have already asserted that they support turning Palmerola into a regional counter narcotics center for Central America and the Caribbean. This prospect is also supported by President Reina. Do the Armed Forces endorse it too? [Discua] One of my administration's main objectives has been the struggle against drugs. I have supported all the programs initiated by our government and those initiated by friendly countries to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. I have always said the Soto Cano Base should be turned into a Honduran base to combat drug trafficking at a regional level. It should unify all actions in the region to enable us to stop or lessen the flow of drugs to northern countries. [Murillo] Has this been discussed at top levels, General? [Discua] Yes, we have been talking about this possibility constantly. I visited Washington and talked with senators and congressmen about my plans to combat drug trafficking.
