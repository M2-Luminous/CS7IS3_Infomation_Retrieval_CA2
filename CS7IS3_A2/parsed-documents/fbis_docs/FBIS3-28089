In the first stage starting in late January, the ceiling on an individual's foreign exchange holdings overseas will be raised from the current 2,000 U.S. dollars to 20,000 dollars. Corporations' qualifications for holding and using foreign exchange overseas will be relaxed by reducing the minimum requirement for an annual two-way trade achievement from 100 million dollars to 10 million dollars to increase the number of qualified firms from the current 136 to 1,304. The ceiling on these firms' foreign exchange holdings abroad will also be raised from 10 percent of the trade achievement or 100 million dollars to 30 percent or 300 million dollars, whichever is larger. But to prevent inflows of hot money, individuals receiving an unrequited remittance of more than 20,000 dollars from abroad will face restrictions when they convert it into won. These restrictions are not yet known. Those with an unrequited receipt of more than 50,000 dollars in foreign exchange a year will be referred to tax collectors for possible taxation. Conversion of foreign exchange into won by non-residents (foreigners) will be limited to 20,000 dollars a month when the conversion has nothing to do with authorized payment in won for their business in the country. The scope of foreign securities investment will be expanded: Securities houses, investment trust companies and insurance firms will be free to invest as much as they want in foreign securities markets, as banks now are, while pension funds and other investment funds and short-term finance firms will be allowed to invest as much as 100 million dollars, instead of the current limit of 50 million dollars, in overseas securities markets. In the second quarter, individual investors will be allowed to invest in foreign securities. As insurance firms now do, banks, securities houses, investment trust firms, short-term finance houses, pension funds and general trading companies will be permitted to invest in real estate abroad, while foreign direct investment will be liberalized except in industries where restrictions on Korean investment are deemed necessary. Under the second stage to be implemented during the second quarter, the number of current transactions of goods and services requiring a bank's approval for settlement of accounts in foreign exchange will be reduced from 109 to 39 to 49. Those still requiring a bank's approval are transactions considered to be of an anti-social nature, such as payment for capital flight or that related to gambling and drugs. The classification of foreign exchange banks into A and B classes will be scrapped.
