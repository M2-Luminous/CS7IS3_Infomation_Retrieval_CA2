FBIS4-34557 "drlat120_b_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Chamber President Rejects Call for Troops Chamber President Rejects Call for Troops FL2106212494 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in Creole 1030 GMT 21 Jun 94 FL2106212494 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio Creole BFN [Report by correspondent Daly Valet; passages within quotation marks in French] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] U.S. officials continue to surprise us as the Haitian political crisis continues. Following reports that some republicans plan to move President Aristide to La Gonave Island, the latest news is that U.S. officials intend to move a ship that is carrying propaganda against the military putschists into Haitian waters. The propaganda reportedly aims to force noncommissioned officers and soldiers to take up arms against Generals Cedras and Biamby and Michel Francois. Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is not pleased. The deputy says it would be immoral for the U.S. Government to stir up trouble inside the Army and a civil war in Haiti. Frantz Robert Monde asks: Can we ask straight Marines to rise up against their gay colleagues? [Begin recording] [Monde] This is like those men planning to have Aristide go to La Gonave, like those men saying that there must be intervention in Haiti. "Those men want to sensationalize." Can you imagine a radio station (?being set up) in the harbor, calling for soldiers to rise up? The soldiers want to destroy them, as well. I will take the hardline position whenever they take such a position. [Valet] They say they guarantee that nothing will happen to those who rise up against the generals, that they will do nothing to the police or soldiers. [Monde] They know they are lying to the little soldiers. They know they will destroy the little soldiers because they know that the little soldiers staged the coup d'etat. They know very well that it was not the generals. "They go through the generals to get to the little soldiers." I have never discussed my position on Cedras, but "I am opposed to getting rid of the entire Army high command in favor of Aristide. It is out of the question." [passage omitted] "Can we ask a Marine who has more or less morality to rise up against his president?" It would be immoral for the United States to do that. They do not have this right. "Stirring up trouble and civil war in Haiti and arousing army against army is not a responsible position. Can we ask straight U.S. Marines to rise up against gay Marines? No, it is out of the question." [end recording] The Chamber of Deputies president says that Duly Brutus and Datus Milcent have gone to Washington to discuss the Haitian political crisis with the Republicans and the Democrats. Bob Monde says these legislators will denounce the U.S. invasion plans and William Gray's behavior during the Haitian crisis: [Begin Monde recording] I asked them to denounce and fight the intervention issue. Second, I asked them to stress Gray's negative influence on U.S. policy toward Haiti. Gray left Congress for shady reasons and is not credible enough to negotiate a crisis today. Gray has managed to secure the job of President Clinton's representative. Unfortunately, he only remains under Aristide's table. He listens to and only repeats all that Aristide says. We do not have many options with Gray. The only option is intervention. You see, "this is the reaction of the negro who has not yet freed himself from the influence of his environment." I think this is very grave. We have no chance of emerging from this crisis when a man like this is involved. [end recording] As for the upcoming 25 June deadline, the Chamber of Deputies president says Haitians must resign themselves to the economic sanctions. he asks them, however, to cope with the embargo. He also wants negotiations to resume. Apparently, this call for negotiations will not have (?the desired results) since all the protagonists are preparing to (?fight). The de facto family's song is: Grenadiers, to the assault! We do not care about those of us who might die! [grenadye alaso, sa ki mouri zafe a yo]
