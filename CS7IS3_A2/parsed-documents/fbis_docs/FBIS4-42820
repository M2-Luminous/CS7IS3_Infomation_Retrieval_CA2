FBIS4-42820 "drweu111aa_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OECD Ministerial Concludes; More on Communique OECD Ministerial Concludes; More on Communique OW0806143694 Tokyo KYODO in English 1419 GMT 8 Jun 94 OW0806143694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- In the communique, the OECD ministers described the December signing of the Uruguay Round world trade accords and the planned creation of the WTO as "historic events which mark an important step toward a universal trading system." The ministers then clarified their commitment to "do everything" to ensure the round's accords will be ratified so that the WTO can take effect on Jan. 1 next year. The ministers also agreed the OECD will "resist protectionism in all its forms and continue to work toward further trade liberalization, proper functioning of market mechanisms and deregulation." The communique underscored the importance for the OECD to continue to build up "contact, dialogue and cooperation" with nonmember countries, which it says are "gaining relevance in the world economy and are basing their development on market principles, pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, as the OECD countries have long done." Specifically, the communique said the OECD will pursue policy coordination with China by exploring "possibilities for dialogue and cooperation...where mutual interests exist." The communique supported South Korea's bid to join the OECD club in 1996. "(South) Korea has established further close links with the OECD and is now taking part in a number of activities on the same footing as member countries," the ministers said, noting Seoul plans to file a formal application for membership by the end of the year. The OECD ministers also called for further dialogue with other Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, former communist bloc countries and Latin American nations. This year's OECD ministerial meeting was divided into three major topics -- "promoting growth and employment," "strengthening the multilateral system" and "the role of the OECD in an evolving world." Proposals under the first topic were unveiled on the first day of the ministerial conference. The unusual advance release of part of the communique reflects the growing sense of crisis within the OECD about the world jobless issue. As prescriptions for the unemployment problem, in which 35 million people are out of work within the OECD group, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye issued a special statement Tuesday [7 June] appealing to OECD member countries to formulate action programs to rectify structural problems that hamper job creation in the world. In order to spur global creation of jobs, Japan and Europe were indirectly requested under the communique to quicken their economic recoveries through further fiscal and monetary steps. "Where recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy should be maintained...where possible, consistent with the medium-term policy objective of budget consolidation, fiscal measures will be implemented as necessary to ensure sustained noninflationary growth led by strong domestic demand," the communique said. After the closing of the ministerial meeting, the 33rd of its kind since 1973, the Paris-based think tank signed a cooperation pact with Russia aimed at smoothing its shift to a market economy for the country's eventual integration into the world economy. During the signing ceremony, the OECD ministers and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev confirmed mutual cooperation in crafting a market-oriented reform program that focuses on establishing a legal, institutional and statistical framework in Russia. The pact calls for an annual review of implementation of reform measures proposed. The joint communique warned against the use of unilateral retaliation-oriented measures as a tool for settling bilateral trade disputes. "Any trade-restrictive or distortive measures that would contradict" the Uruguay Round trade accords should be avoided, the communique said in an apparent reference to the recent U.S. move to resort to retaliatory steps like the Super 301 trade clause. Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for external affairs, told Tuesday's ministerial session that unilateral measures run the risk of eroding the multilateral trade system. The communique called for any country in trade wrangling to use dispute settlement procedures under the WTO, which will have more enforcing power than GATT. The ministers agreed to promote "effective observance" of recommended measures intended to curb bribery in international business transactions. The measures are targeted at schemes by individuals and corporations to bribe public servants in other nations to smooth their business. The ministers also agreed to extend its anti-money laundering program for an additional five years.
