FR940811-0-00037 FR940811-0-00016 4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed to be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of Packing the Waste, if any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(4)] EPA is setting an interim site capacity for the SF&hyph;DODS of six million cubic yards of dredged material per calendar year, which shall be in effect only until December 31, 1996. As the LTMS comprehensive dredged material management planning effort is completed, EPA will reexamine the appropriate site capacity for the SF&hyph;DODS and will establish in a separate rulemaking a final capacity. Typical composition of dredged material disposed at the site is expected to range between two types: predominantly ``clay-silt'' versus ``mostly sand''. These material types are based on data from historical projects from the San Francisco Bay region. The expected disposal method would involve split-hull barges, with capacities ranging between 1,000 to 6,000 cubic yards, which would be towed by ocean-going tugboats. Dredged material would not be packaged. All dredged material proposed for disposal at the site must be suitable for ocean disposal. This determination will be made by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District based upon the results of physical, chemical and biological tests before a MPRSA Section 103 permit can be issued. Dumping of prohibited materials or other industrial or municipal wastes will not be permitted at the site [40 CFR 227.5 and 227.6(a)]. Existing information and modeling analysis suggests that it is appropriate to dispose, via split hull barges, of the type of dredged material that will be removed from San Francisco Bay at the SF&hyph;DODS. The dredged material can be predicted mostly to settle rapidly to the ocean bottom within the dump site boundaries and not to create plumes which will reach significant areas such as marine sanctuaries, recreational areas, or geographically limited habitats at greater than background concentrations. Disposing dredged material at the site which meets regulatory criteria for ocean dumping will create some limited alteration or destruction of benthic habitat within site boundaries, but should not create substantial adverse impacts extending beyond site boundaries. For these reasons, no significant adverse impacts are expected to be associated with the types and quantities of dredged material that may be disposed at the site. 5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)] EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District share the responsibilities of managing and monitoring the disposal site, and, with the on-site assistance of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), to enforce permit conditions within the limits of their jurisdiction. Although SF&hyph;DODS would be the deepest and farthest off shore of any ocean disposal site so far designated in the U.S., standardized equipment and techniques would be used for surveillance and monitoring activities. In addition, recent Navy mid-project monitoring activities confirmed the feasibility of surveillance and monitoring at the SF&hyph;DODS. EPA has therefore determined that the Site Management and Monitoring provisions of the Final Rule are fully feasible to implement. 6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area, Including Prevailing Current Direction and Velocity, if any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)] Current meter studies indicate that any residual suspended solids from disposal operations at SF&hyph;DODS will move primarily north-northwest, away from the continental shelf and the GFNMS. Water column modeling results, as indicated in the Final EIS, using a conservative approach ( e.g. , modeling parameters adjusted for worst case conditions) and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year, indicate that suspended solid would decrease to background levels by the time the plume reaches the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Deposition modeling using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicate that the bulk of the disposed material would deposit within the disposal site. For these reasons, EPA has determined that the dispersal, transport and mixing characteristics of the site, and its current velocities and directions, are appropriate for its designation as a dredged material disposal site. 7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects) [40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)] Under an MPRSA Section 103 permit, the Navy is discharging up to 1.2 million cubic yards of dredged material at their Navy disposal site which is contained within the EPA-preferred Alternative Site 5. No other documented disposal of dredged material has occurred within the site. However, disposal of radioactive waste containers was conducted in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5 from 1951&hyph;1954. Likewise, chemical and conventional munitions were disposed in the general area from approximately 1958 to the late 1960's at the Chemical Munitions Disposal Area. Therefore, EPA has determined that potential cumulative effects of designating a dredged material disposal site are less at SF&hyph;DODS than at the alternative sites evaluated, which did not have these historic impacts. In addition, no other discharges occur in the immediate vicinity of SF&hyph;DODS. The effects of municipal discharges from the San Francisco Southwest Ocean Outfall (5.4 nautical miles or 10.2 kilometers from shore), the City of Pacifica Outfall (0.4 nautical miles or 0.8 kilometers from shore), and Northern San Mateo County Outfall (0.4 nautical miles or 0.8 kilometers from shore) are limited to local areas near the outfalls and do not extend to the vicinity of the dredged material disposal site. Discharge of dredged sand at the Channel Bar ODMDS (3.0 nautical miles or 5.6 kilometers from shore) is also limited to that local area and is not expected to result in impacts in the vicinity of the SF&hyph;DODS. Therefore, EPA has determined that cumulative effects of dredged material disposal are minimized by designation of SF&hyph;DODS. 8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture, Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean [40 CFR 288.6(a)(8)] In evaluating whether dumping activity at the site could interfere with shipping, fishing, recreation, mineral extraction, desalination, areas of scientific importance and other legitimate uses of the ocean, EPA considered both the direct effects from depositing millions of cubic yards of dredged material on the ocean bottom within the SF&hyph;DODS boundaries and the indirect effects associated with increased vessel traffic that will result from transportation of dredged material to the dump site. Existing information indicates that the site is not a significant fisheries area, is not used for water contact recreation and is not otherwise a significant recreational area, contains no harvestable minerals, is not a potential staging ground or intake area for desalination activity, is not scientifically important in itself, and otherwise has no geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in other parts of this coastal region. Accordingly, depositing dredged material at the site will not interfere with these activities. Increased vessel traffic involved in transportation of dredged material to the SF&hyph;DODS should also cause no substantial interference with any of the activities discussed above. Even with around-the-clock disposal operations (assuming 3 trips in a 24-hour period), disposal operations would augment existing vessel traffic in the region by less than 2 percent. In addition, the potential interference with recreational and scientific boat traffic and marine resources (e.g., birds and mammals) near the Farallon Islands should be prevented by requirements that barges remain at least 3 nautical miles from the Islands. 9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined by Available Data or by Trend Assessment or Baseline Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)] Existing information and regional studies described in the Final EIS provide the following determinations: Water quality at the SF&hyph;DODS is indistinguishable from the water quality of nearby areas. Sediments contain background levels or low concentrations of trace metal and organic contaminants. The demersal fish community within Alternative Site 5 has lower numbers of species and lower abundances than the other alternative sites. Alternative Site 5 contains moderate numbers of megafaunal invertebrate species (sea cucumbers, brittlestars, sea pens) but lower overall abundances compared to the other alternative sites. Infaunal invertebrates (polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, tanaids) within Alternative Site 5 also show lower diversity and abundance compared to Alternative Sites 3 and 4. Although there have been higher numbers of marine bird and mammal sightings, and mid-water organisms including juvenile rockfishes are more abundant seasonally relative to the other alternative sites evaluated, Alternative Site 5 is not considered to have geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in other alternative sites or other parts of this coastal region. Based on these Final EIS conclusions EPA has determined that, compared to the alternative sites evaluated, this is the environmentally preferred location for ocean disposal site designation.
