This is reported by the Political Department of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna's defense ministry. [passage omitted] At a news conference today, Jadranko Prlic, the prime minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, reiterated the demands contained in the Croatian Government's letter on the overall reassessment of relations with the Muslim leadership in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He justified this by saying that Izetbegovic is continuing the Muslim offensive against the Croat-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He stressed that the Muslim leadership has stolen from the other two peoples everything that made Bosnia-Herzegovina an internationally recognized state. All Bosnia-Herzegovina consulates in the world are purely Muslim. Mr. Prlic cited the example of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb, where all 127 employees are of Muslim nationality. The world is beginning to realize that Izetbegovic is an aggressor, not a victim. Is the evacuation of Croats from central Bosnia being planned, a foreign correspondent asked Mr. Prlic. The reply was emphatic: [Begin Prlic recording] As I said in my introductory address, we shall defend those regions at any cost. Vitez, Busovaca, Novi Travnik, part of the Travnik municipality -- the Owen-Stoltenberg plan envisages these areas as a constituent part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Therefore, we will do all we can to defend these areas. [end recording] We had to pay a bloody price for our alliance with the Muslims, but despite everything, we are ready to negotiate with both the Muslims and the Serbs. The international boundaries of Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly defined, while the internal ones depend on how large an area can be defended, Jadranko Prlic pointed out.
