Gaska: `The Winner Must Think About Future Elections...'"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The reason for the interview with Seimas [parliament] Deputy Kestutis Gaska was clear. He decided not to register himself with the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. This decision was a long time in the making, and K. Gaska agreed willingly to explain the reasons that prompted him to make this choice. [Svirbutaviciute] To what faction do you belong now? [Gaska] Formally, I still belong to the LDDP faction, but I have said that I will not register with it. The question whether I will belong to this faction in the future would be more correct. No, I will not. Such is my inner principle -- I can no longer stay in this faction. [Svirbutaviciute] What are the reasons? [Gaska] My principles, as a Seimas deputy elected from the Varena region, do not comply with those of the LDDP faction. The latter works in isolation. It cannot or does not want to see anything else except the function of lawmaking. Almost all faction members have come to the Seimas according to the list and they do not have their constituents, with the exception of A. Kuncinas and N. Germanas who have their own electorate. I think that others, who do not have constant meetings with their constituents, cannot or do not want to understand their expectations. Their considerations are as follows: We have been elected, we must engage in lawmaking, and that is that. However, our constituents, who believe in the people they have elected, do not live according to such a model. A party that wins the elections must execute its program. Thus, the Seimas, the government, and the constituents must make a closed circle. [Svirbutaviciute] Would you explain the principle of this "closed circle"...? [Gaska] It is very simple. For example, I go to Varena and listen to my constituents. I select their key problem that I must raise in the Seimas, while the government must resolve it. Unfortunately, many members of our faction do not want to hear or know how these issues are settled. We must control the laws and resolutions that we adopt. [Svirbutaviciute] You work in the Seimas National Security Committee. What are your achievements in implementing the laws adopted by the Seimas? [Gaska] The situation in the Lithuanian Army is really catastrophic, due to both the lack of laws and the failure to execute them. Gentlemen commanders ignore the law, inflict psychological damage on young people, and cripple them. Where are we living? Who is responsible for all of those casual and senseless deaths? The Army is now conducting young people's genocide. No normal mother wants her child into go to the Lithuanian Army because it is ten times worse than the former Soviet Army. What are we doing? Therefore, I think that my position, as a Seimas deputy, is not adequate to the one that prevails among the community. We are too quiet, nourished, and pleased in the Seimas, while people see everything differently and ask us when we will take power and begin to govern the country. By the way, I am also interested in this. It is said that the winner must get ready for future elections. [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine the new elections or preparations for them? [Gaska] I think that our party leaders have secured seats for themselves. According to popularity ratings, there are constant top ten activists of our party who will win seats in the next elections as well. I think that the LDDP will have the ensured 10 or 15 seats always, or at least in the upcoming elections. And me? All members of the LDDP faction council are confident that they may be elected in the future. [Svirbutaviciute] You were in the LDDP program group which announced blatantly that it would work in a novel manner. One can say today, however, that there was too much ado about nothing.... [Gaska] Exactly. We shook LDDP's monolithic system and exhausted ourselves. If one wants to create something, one must reason about it. We will always be able to leave by slamming the door loudly, but what of that? We neither ruined nor achieved anything. The current decision of the Constitutional Court on the free establishment of factions will enliven life in the Seimas. The fears of the LDDP faction leaders about this law were ungrounded. We went to the elections with one idea -- to rebuild a destroyed Lithuania. We will not run over to the opponents' side or do everything differently. Adherence to the principle of monolithic unity by the faction leadership is unreasonable. Finally, internal criticism is more painful than external criticism.... [passage omitted] [Svirbutaviciute] Why have you chosen to work on the National Security Committee? Why did its members in particular begin to form the LDDP program group? [Gaska] I wanted to work in the Foreign Affairs Committee because I have strong family relations abroad. I am alone in Lithuania, while two of my brothers and sisters, and my mother live in the United States. The faction asked me not to join this committee and choose another one. I picked the National Security Committee, although I was also invited to the Budget and Finance Committee. However, I chose such a virile committee with many stormy, stubborn, and strong people. Thus, restless people gathered in this committee. This might explain why the LDDP program group emerged here. It is good because only restless people can accomplish something positive. Sometimes B. Genzelis used to reprimand me, saying: "You are restless because you have not been appointed minister." Well, one can say so. I really withdrew from the faction to avoid becoming a minister. However, politics do not end here. Who knows who will come to power in three years? K. Gaska might become minister in the new government as well. Life does not end today. Eventually, I had no aim to become minister. Our goal was to disturb the quiet life of our faction. Thus, four of us from this committee undertook this initiative. [Svirbutaviciute] Unfortunately, you failed to implement everything.... [Gaska] We may succeed in the future. I believe that there are no less than 1 million people in Lithuania who will need a left-wing party. Our goal is to fight for their votes.
