The Asia-Pacific region contains the world's fastest-growing and most dynamic economies. It is the world's largest consumer market and the biggest U.S. goods and services export market. Already over 40 percent of U.S. trade is with the Asia- Pacific region. In 1992, U.S. transpacific trade was U.S.$325 billion -- almost 50 percent more than its trade with Western Europe and three times that with South America. Over 2.3 million American jobs are related to the annual U.S.$120 billion export to Asia. Because of its huge growth potential, the Asia-Pacific region will be of increasing economic significance to the future of the United States. It will be a vast source of jobs, income, partnership, and growth for the United States in the coming years. In this context, the United States' active engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is unavoidable. President Bill Clinton laid out the Administration's blueprint for the Asia-Pacific policy in two speeches during his first Asian tour. The basic goal is to seek to build a New Pacific community. The Clinton's version of the New Pacific Community features three inseparable and intertwined pillars; prosperity based on open and free markets; regional security based on preventive diplomacy and the control of nuclear and other dangerous weapons; and democracy in free and humane societies addressing global issues. In the economic area, President Clinton listed three essentials for the New Pacific Community; a new relationship between the United States and Japan; an open global and regional economy; and commitment to democratic values. President Clinton declared that the administration's first international economic priority would be to create a new and stronger partnership between the United States and Japan and that the U.S. relationship with Japan would be the centerpiece of U.S. policy toward the New Pacific Community. Japan is America's most important ally and its second largest trading partner. Producers in each of the two countries are consumers for companies in the other. But the economic relationship between the United States and Japan is not in balance. Unlike its relations with all other wealthly developed nations, the United States has a huge and persistent trade deficit with Japan. It usually exceeds U.S.$40 billion, with a deficit in manufacturing products in excess of U.S.$60 billion. Since the two countries account for nearly 40 percent of the world's output, the state of their economic relationship is extremely important not only to themselves but also to the Asia-Pacific region and the free trading system of the world. The failure to reduce their chronic trade deficit has been threatening the vital U.S.- Japan relationship. The Clinton administration became aware of the fact that the previous trade agreements had not worked because they lacked a commitment to tangible results, and they provided no way to measure success. Therefore, the administration began to focus on not trade by numbers but by results coming from better rules of trade when it held trade negotiations with the Japanese Government. After serious negotiations, the United States and Japan finally reached an agreement on the establishment of the U.S.-Japan framework for a new economic partnership in July 1993. Under this framework, the United States and Japan will negotiate a series of agreements that will allow greater penetration into the Japanese marketplace in specific areas and will include specific timetables and objective criteria for measuring success. President Clinton acclaimed this agreement as an important step toward a more balanced trade relationship between the United States and Japan. The Clinton administration views an open regional and global economy as the second building block of the New Pacific community. That means that the United States will resist the pressures to put up walls to protect specific markets; will work to reduce regional trade barriers; and will head off regional trade blocs. In this respect the U.S. Government has made considerable success. On the global level, the international trade talks were completed with the Uruguay Round in the end of 1993. The U.S. Government achieved what it had hoped for. This breakthrough brought good news for the United States because it means more jobs and new growth. On the regional level the principle of openness of the regional and global economy is accepted by most APEC leaders. At the unprecedented meetings of APEC leaders in Seattle in late November, Clinton not only affirmed U.S. continuous, active engagement in the region but also revealed the U.S. belief that the benefits of trade liberalization underlies U.S. commitment to the New Pacific Community. In the security area, the Clinton administration believes there are four priorities for the security of the New Pacific Community. First, a continued American military presents in this region; second, stronger efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; third, new regional dialogues on the full range of the common security challenges; and last, support for democracy and open societies throughout this region. President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other U.S. officials made it very clear that the bedrock of America's security role in the Asia-Pacific region must be a continued military presence. The Clinton administration affirms U.S. bilateral security treaties with five Asia-Pacific countries: Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand. These treaties serve the interests of the United States. They enable U.S. armed force to maintain a substantial presence. While the defense budget has been cut in European and American domestic bases, the Clinton administration maintains the U.S. force level in Asia. After the closure of the Philippine bases, the United States has obtained increased access for its forces throughout Southeast Asia to facilitate the military presence there. All of these are signs that the United States is going to stay on in the region. To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the nuclear weapons in particular, and their means of delivery is the second priority of the Clinton administration for the New Pacific Community. In this respect, the United States has serious concerns about the suspected development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. It urges North Korea to fulfill its full-scope obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency, including IAEA inspections of undeclared nuclear sites and to reaffirm its commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty. The United States also pays close attention to the transshipment of missiles and sophisticated technologies. Perhaps no development is more noticeable than the new emphasis in the Clinton administration on the regional security dialogues. From the Clinton's administration's point of view, the post-Cold War has produced a radical shift in the old balance of power. The New Pacific Community must forge a new regional balance that promotes stability. Unlike the Cold War era and unlike Europe, it is not a group of blocs set against each other or some common enemy. It will help to convey intentions to each other, to erase misperceptions, and to start building confidence. In this regard, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference is regarded as a most promising forum. Clinton announced that the United States will participate as a full partner in regional security dialogues with the ASEAN and its associated members. He also made it clear that the ASEAN post ministerial conference is not the only framework in the Asia-Pacific region and it is by no means a supplanter of America's alliances or forward military presence in the region. In conclusion, the Clinton administration's Asia-Pacific policy is one important component of the American foreign policy which is undergoing an adjustment. It aims to more actively participate in the Asia-Pacific region where the United State hopes to continue to play a dominant role while paying close attention to the manner which it does so.
