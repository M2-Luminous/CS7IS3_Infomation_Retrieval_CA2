But he belongs to the Pompidou generation, and he maintained the habits of 1960's diplomacy, when there was no need to do so...." A member of the French delegation, on the plane home on Sunday [10 April], tried to describe the mistake which made the prime minister's visit to China go amiss. He was not alone. The regrets began in Shanghai on Saturday when the arrest of large numbers of dissidents had looked like deliberate provocation. Forgetting diplomatic jargon, Alain Juppe exclaimed: "It is beginning to look like a lot of people. We do not like it at all." On the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Beijing, Wei Jingsheng's arrest was interpreted merely as a deterrent measure. Seen from Paris, the Chinese authorities simply wanted to prevent the most famous of Chinese dissidents, released last year after 14 years in prison, from seizing the opportunity of this visit to give resounding interviews to the journalists who were due to accompany the prime minister. But, following the arrest of a second dissident in Beijing on Friday, just when Edouard Balladur was giving journalists a satisfied assessment of the political phase of his visit, the tough interrogations of three other dissidents in the big southern city could no longer leave any doubt. One deputy noted: "Contrary to what Balladur said in his press conference, `discretion' does not necessarily guarantee `effectiveness' when dealing with the Chinese." Another member of the delegation went further: "We came too soon. After signing the joint declaration in January which closed the dispute created by the arms sales to Taiwan, Edouard Balladur ought not to have agreed to this visit without a serious guarantee that contracts would be signed and without specific plans for political cooperation. He ought to have demanded payment in advance." One diplomat who is an expert on China explained that Balladur had come at the "wrong time." According to this expert, the approach of the fifth anniversary of the Tienanmen Square massacre had mobilized dissidents who were determined not to allow the event to pass without commemorating it. The authorities, for their part, were very nervous and allowed the police to act at the slightest move. "Li Peng," the diplomat stressed, "learned from the 1989 events that by responding too late, you are likely to face an uncontrollable situation. However, because of the social tensions created by economic modernization, he fears an even more serious crisis than five years ago. This time, he is afraid that dissidence by intellectuals will spark off a revolt by workers, threatened with unemployment, and by poor peasants more than 100 million of whom are roaming the roads." One last restrospective regret: Edouard Balladur, according to several experts talking to journalists on Saturday, was a hostage in the battle for power which is currently stirring up the candidates to succeed old Deng Xiaoping. By refusing to invite Li Peng to Paris, the prime minister gave the impression that he was choosing one camp against another. This apparent involvement by a foreigner in an internal battle was immediately punished by the arrest of dissidents. In the plane between Shanghai and Paris, the matter turned into a case of settling scores. The culprit was no longer Li Peng but the French press. Sent by the prime minister, Alain Juppe lectured to the special correspondents: "You focused on human rights and you did not see our objective. We were looking to the long term. If France wishes to establish a place on what will be the biggest market in the year 2000, it must start now. If we want to have proper political relations with a country which represents one-third of the world's population, we must take the risk of taking the first step. There were no longer contacts between the two governments. Our ambassador was no longer received by the Chinese authorities. This visit was not only useful. It was necessary." The demonstration would have been more convincing if Edouard Balladur and his entourage had sought contact with the press earlier. But, with regard to human rights, the rule was to say nothing. The prime minister did not wish to explain his analysis to the press for fear of seeming to provoke the Chinese. This was in vain, because, seeing on Saturday that the Chinese had laid a trap for him, Balladur eventually publicly condemned the arrests of dissidents as "unacceptable." Goading Another observation is the inconsistencies between some of the French statements. Before his arrival in China, Alain Juppe had said in an interview with LIBERATION that the Chinese authorities' attention would be drawn to a number of dissidents by handing over a list of names. Following the talks in Beijing between the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers, who met in private to discuss delicate matters, Balladur issued a denial that any list had been handed over. Members of the delegation had advised the prime minister to respond to Li Peng's goading by a statement as firm as the one in 1984 in which Francois Mitterrand mentioned the "symbolic case" of Sakharov during an official banquet at the Kremlin. Others had suggested that the prime minister should cut short his visit as Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then National Assembly speaker, did in Moscow in 1980. Each time the prime minister said no: The state's interest should come before its pride. But, in Paris, this attitude had the opposite effect. One final comment in the plane by one of those who accompanied Balladur: "By preferring to stick to reason, the prime minister, paradoxically, lacked realism."
