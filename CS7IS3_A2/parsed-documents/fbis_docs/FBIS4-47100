FBIS4-47100 "jpusr066___94055" FBIS-USR-94-066 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 18 May 1994 BALTIC STATES LITHUANIA Reorganization of Ministries Planned Reorganization of Ministries Planned 944K1376B Vilnius TIESA in Lithuanian 18 May 94 p 1 944K1376B Vilnius TIESA Lithuanian CSO [Article by Aldona Svirbutaviciute: "Those Who Are Able, Don't Want To, While Those Who Want To, Aren't Able"] [Text] While the new ministerial portfolios are being assigned in the lobbies, Seimas managed to ratify the future number of ministers. There will be not 18, as we reported a week ago, but 19. A Ministry of Environmental Protection will be established on June 15, and in the middle of July the Ministry of Culture and Education will be divided into two -- a Ministry of Culture and a Ministry of Education and Science. Around autumn a Ministry of Government Reform and Local Administration will be established. (Just last week it was said only two new ministers would be appointed.) Discussions are taking place in the Seimas corridors, and not only there, about potential candidates for the ministerial posts. The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] members of Seimas became acquainted with several of them on Monday at a meeting of their faction. I interviewed faction members and asked them to answer a few questions. Seimas member V. Petkevicius described Albertas Vasiliauskas, the future minister of forestry, very positively. He said that the candidate is both a scientist and a man of practical affairs, who understands very well the problems of both commercial forestry and nature conservation. "In the end, the decision on ministerial candidates is not made by Petkevicius alone or Rupeika alone. That is a prerogative of the president and the government," said the author. The faction may voice its opinion about the future candidates, but it will not be they who make the decision. In V. Petkevicius's opinion, it is necessary to split the ministries of education and culture. He said with a laugh that the present minister sits on two chairs; one day he sits with education administrators, then on the next with a group of cultural workers. A. Lozuraitis, a member of the LDDP faction's hierarchy, also gave his opinion. He said that the discussion in the faction does not constitute a final decision. It is quite possible that other candidates exist or will appear. "It is very complicated to talk about aspirants in advance, because there is often a conflict of strong, passionate opinions. You can't hide the fact that some persons are patrons of certain candidates, proposing and pushing them, while others criticize them. So this process does not have a clear procedure so far. Neither the faction, nor Seimas appoints the ministers, but there is a striving to make the search for ministers more public, respecting everyone's opinion," said A. Lozuraitis. A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, said that a businesslike conversation had taken place on Monday with the ministerial candidates, who had answered questions. According to him, the faction does not make any decisions, it can only express its opinion to the prime minister, who is the chairman of the party. A. Kuncinas said that the ministers will be discussed again in the faction and in the party presidium. By the way, we found out that the list of ministerial candidates is far longer than was known until now. A ministerial post (in the Ministry of Education and Science) is being offered to A. Lozuraitis. Asked to comment about this news, he said: - That always flatters one's ego, but one must know one's limitations. I took this proposal to be a humorous one... I don't consider it serious... - Is that possible? After all, it's doubtful that the persons who made the proposal did it as a joke. - I think that they know me less well than I know myself. A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, summarized this mini-interview: "That's the way it is. Those who could be a minister don't want to, while sometimes those who are pushing to get the post are not capable of heading a ministry... "
