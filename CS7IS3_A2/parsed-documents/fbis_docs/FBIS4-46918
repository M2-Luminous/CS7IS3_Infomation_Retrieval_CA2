Goryachev, to bring about a review by the Russian Supreme Court of a regional court decision which actually forced him to shift elections to the local legislative assembly from the spring to the fall has ended in defeat. The statute which regulates an election campaign was drawn up by the governor's subordinates with so many "stipulations" for local conditions that citizens' right to direct, secret, and equal elections declared by the Russian Federation Constitution turned out to be in question, to put it mildly. They were planning in the oblast to create a bicameral representative organ and to organize voting in two stages with the help of electors--persons entrusted by their fellow citizens to elect the deputies. This was needed for an obvious purpose: they put forward their own nominations among the other 43 representatives of the oblast administration at various levels for the 50 seats in the legisalative assembly. The protectionist articles in the local statute on elections were to contribute to their election as well. Activists of the Ulyanovsk regional center of the Russian Democratic Reforms Movement and the Simbirsk "Democratic Russia" sounded the alarm. They instituted action in a local court demanding a review of the obviously overstated powers of the administration in the Statute on Elections. The Ulyanovsk Oblast Court contended that the third branch of government is also capable of holding a consistent and independent position in observing the law. It remained only for the governor to make a complaint to Moscow. Which he did. The decision of the Collegium on Civil Matters of the Russian Federation Supreme Court set a noteworthy precedent in denying the recent appeal by Yu. Goryachev. No one has been authorized to rewrite the Basic Law of the state and adapt it to his own purposes. Alas, the costs of the elections held in the oblast are paid from the budget, and hence out of our common pocket.
