The commercial services price index (CSPI), which captures price movements for all types of services transacted between businesses, is the third price index, the first two being the wholesale price index (WPI) and the consumer price index (CPI). 2. Changes in the CSPI chiefly reflect changes in supply costs, such as real estate prices, personnel costs, and the strength or weakness of service demands by business. 3. If we compare the CSPI to the domestic WPI (commodity prices), we find that in addition to the difficulties in making judgments directly overseas, the service industry is easily subject to upward pressures in personnel costs because the service industry overall is labor intensive. If labor productivity in the service industry can be increased by abolishing some firmly established fees through deregulation, the CSPI will move a bit more flexibly.] Recent Stable Movement for the Third Price Index The commercial services price index (CSPI), created by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and announced in January 1991, tracks price statistics which show price trends for each type of service transacted between businesses. For a long time this remained a void in price statistics despite a shift toward services in Japan's economic structure. Heretofore in Japan the wholesale price index (WPI), which tracks price movements of commodities (things) transacted between businesses, and the consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the prices of goods and services purchased by households, have been employed as the representative price statistics. The CSPI, with the other two indexes, measures currency purchasing power and business trends and is a third set of price statistics, which carries with it a deflator function. The current CSPI, which uses the 1985 inter-industry relations tables as its baseline, divides 714 products into the seven categories of "finance and insurance," "real estate," "transportation," "information services," "communications," "advertising," and "other services." The identified prices as a rule are contracted prices between businesses. About 2,400 prices are currently collected in cooperation with 369 companies. In calculating the index, the weighted average (Laspeyres formula), which is determined by a fixed weight given to an article taking as the basis from the inter-industry relations table the amount of intermediate trading, is calculated and then indexed with the base year (1985) equal to 100. Although previously this was released on a four-and-a-half period basis, beginning this July the index is released monthly. If we look at the changes in the CSPI since 1985, we find that it generally moved laterally until about the middle of 1988 and then climbed upward considerably into 1991, while its movement since has settled down (figure 2). CSPI movements become clearer if we compare them to the same month the preceding year (because there are large seasonal increases in April and October when service contracts are modified, it is useful to look at movements in the CSPI in comparison to the same month for the preceding year as a basis for making judgments). According to this, after being negative for the most part in 1986, it shifted to the plus side and remained for a time within a stable range of a just less than 1 percent. However, since the fall of 1988, allowing for a temporary period of expansion in its growth rate brought on by the introduction of the consumption tax, until the end of fiscal 1990, it accelerated upwards almost in a straight line (its peak was February 1990 at 5.7 percent; however, ignoring the consumption tax, the substantive peak was December 1990 at 4.1 percent). Following this, the rate of increase turned sluggish beginning in 1991 and from this April we have seen a growth rate of barely 1 percent (figure 3). <graphic> </graphic> It is appropriate as with other prices that commercial service price movements be based on the relationship between supply and demand which in this case encompasses target services, but we do need to keep in mind the following points. Trends in Commercial Demand and Their Reflection in Supply Costs First, regarding movement on the demand side, commercial service demands change reflecting trends in business earnings, economic transactions, the distribution situation, or investment trends in construction and equipment. Basically, commercial service prices follow these occasional trends in business conditions as a result. Second are cost factors on the service supply side. Various cost factors for service providers, such as shifts in operating expenses for materials, fuel costs, and necessary real estate prices, etc., have an effect on CSPI as do increases in personnel costs and shifts in labor costs brought on by improvements in labor productivity from investments in automation. Among these, because the input weight for labor as a service category is currently high, changes in personnel costs have a powerful influence on commercial service costs (above all in civil engineering and construction, legal, and accounting service costs for "other services," software development under "information services," and passenger travel and freight shipments under "transportation"). Third, exogenous factors such as movements in interest rates and currency exchange prices, competitive promotion and deregulation mechanisms, and technological improvements have an impact on service prices in related fields. For example, both long-term interest rates for various leases under "other services" and maritime and international air freight for which numerous contracts are negotiated in foreign currencies under "transportation" have a tendency to manifest movement which reflects trends in exchange rates. Moreover, although prices in airline passenger transport under the categories of "communications," "finance and insurance," and "transportation" have on the whole been trending downward since the index was started, this appears to be the effect primarily of lower fees and commissions brought on by deregulation and the promotion of competition through competitive rate drops and financial deregulation involving new entries into the electric power transmission business. By the same token, the upward trend in the CSPI from 1988 through 1990 reflects rising wage costs brought on by a tight labor supply and expanded commercial service demands together with increased construction activity and livelier corporate earnings, trading, and distribution. Added to this was a further sharp increase in "real estate" service prices. Upward pressure on prices for "real estate" service costs such as office, store, and parking rentals can easily occur in any event given the supply side constraints at work in real estate. It is fresh in our memories how the rapid increase in demand for office and store space pushed up "real estate" service prices as land prices in the center of major cities skyrocketed during the so-called bubble economy. By contrast, we can explain the recent sluggish rate of growth during this business recession in terms of a lowering of the upward pressure on wages caused by a combination of a softening in the demand for labor, decreased corporate demand for services, and a softening in the demand for real estate. When we compare the movements in the CSPI, which is in phase with service prices among businesses, with those of the domestic WPI, which is the cost of things, there is a similar pattern on this point which reflects the fabric of supply and demand among businesses and which follows trends in business conditions. However, at the same time, the CSPI throughout has risen at a pace exceeding the domestic WPI and has reached a higher level with relatively less flexibility. The Path To Reduced Differences With Commodity Prices Regarding this, first, the drop in import prices in recent years, reflecting stable international crude oil prices and the high yen exchange rate, has created an environment contributing enormously to the stability of the domestic WPI (direct judgments are difficult to make regarding the CSPI in terms of overseas factors, given the unique nature of service activities). This and existing practices and regulations (licenses and notices), which directly relate to the setting of fees, and commercial services have influenced not a few fields, which impedes flexible price movements. Further, there are differences between the CSPI and the domestic WPI in the impact of upward pressure in personnel costs. Excluding some fields such as finance and insurance, labor productivity in the service category is lower than for the manufacturing industry. There is a high weight assigned to labor costs in the input matrix (from preliminary calculations based on an extension of the inter-industry relations tables for 1988, personnel costs nearly doubled to 35.0 percent for the CSPI subject services average as opposed to 18.7 percent for the domestic WPI). This is one factor behind the sharper increase in the CSPI than in the domestic WPI during periods of tight labor supply and for its never falling smoothly when demand for services weakened. On the other hand, should productivity increase in the future in the service industry and shrink relative to the manufacturing industry, the potential is there for the gap between the CSPI, which represents service costs, and the domestic WPI, which represents commodity prices, to shrink for the same business phases. Currently, expectations in numerous fields have burgeoned for deregulation as one pillar of our economic strategy. If we look at commercial services, we see that should relaxing or abolishing all regulations and ingrained practices move forward, prices will advance a step toward flexible responses to supply and demand relationships through the deregulation of established fees. Further, we can expect that productivity will be pushed upwards through the promotion of new entries and investments, making it easier to lower prices in the mid-term. This will bring about a rise in the level of qualitative consumption through lower prices for the consumer and the elimination of foreign and domestic price differences and will contribute to an increase in the economic well being of the Japanese people.
