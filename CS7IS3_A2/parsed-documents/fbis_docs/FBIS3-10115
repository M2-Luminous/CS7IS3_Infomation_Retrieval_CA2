Alfredo Villarreal has filed a report: [Begin recording] [Villarreal] During a news conference, Calderon Sol has decried the 24 February machine gunning of Nidia Diaz's vehicle that left her driver wounded. He has said these actions are very distressful, especially a few days before the elections. [Calderon Sol] We believe that violence is a thing of the past, that our country has overcome these violent acts, and that the Salvadoran people are tired of and reject violence. They do not even want verbal abuse, much less physical violence. We regret, decry, and reject this action. We want a thorough investigation. [Villarreal] Calderon Sol has abstained from saying whether this new action against an FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leader has political connotations; instead, he has called for an investigation, as was done in previous cases when political leaders were the targets of similar attacks. [Calderon Sol] I would not like to make assumptions, because I believe making assumptions regarding delicate matters when one lacks information is dangerous and irresponsible. What we need to do is investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice. [Villarreal] The Arena presidential candidate has called on the joint group that is investigating the illegal armed groups to include in its reports the attacks against politicians, regardless of whether they are from the right, left, or any other ideology.
