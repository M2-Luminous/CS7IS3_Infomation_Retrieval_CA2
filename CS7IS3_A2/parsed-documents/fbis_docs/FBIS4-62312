In the opinion of the deputy minister this "should remove misunderstandings and apprehensions on both sides". "I have developed an impression that NATO started to understand better after the recent events around the Bosnian city of Gorazde that real partnership presupposes serious preliminary consulations with Russia before taking decisions," he added. "Partnership for Peace is only a part of the general picture of our cooperation, although an important one," the deputy minister continued. "In this case, the sides should find a true correlation between the principle of equality of all countries wishing to join the programme for multilateral cooperation and the objective account of Russia's role and position." Therefore, the sides will put signatures under the multilateral document already signed by 16 NATO countries and 18 east European states, including eight former Soviet republics, on the one hand, and a bilateral programme of partnership between NATO and Russia, determining specific parameters of cooperation, on the other. "Regrettably," Adamishin noted, "there is much confusion about the multilateral document in our country. In actual fact, it is a statement of intention to cooperate and not to conduct hostile actions. "If we compare it with the trade and economic sphere, it is 'a protocol of intent' which should be specified and amplified. But it does not impose any obligations on either side to take joint decisions, to conduct joint operations or to standardise weapons. That is, it does not tie our hands." The bilateral document can and must be more specific, and NATO, according to Von Moltke, is waiting with great interest for the Russian side's ideas on this issue. "Nobody will be able and does not intend to thrust upon us anything in the bilateral programme, which would not suit Russia," Adamishin stressed. The deputy minister said that at today's talks, the NATO leadership spoke of serious importance it attaches to cooperation with Russia and of a desire to expand it, especially through contacts between the military. This would help the two sides "to forget the image of an enemy". NATO already reveals some secrets to Russia, which were a relish piece for intelligence services in the recent past: data banks, codes, means of communications, etc. Military and political contacts under the aegis of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council are also fruitfully developing.
