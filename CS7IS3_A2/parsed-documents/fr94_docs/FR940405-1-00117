FR940405-1-00117 FR940405-1-00013 Further, in paragraph (c)(3)(iv), OSHA believes that it is necessary to require written information which describes daily operation and management of the facility building systems which directly affects IAQ. When it comes to operations and management, organizational fragmentation within nonindustrial buildings may be further exacerbated by the lack of familiarity with the intent of the original design team whose assumptions and design intent for the HVAC system, are typically unknown. Over time, building use may differ from original design intent in ways not foreseen by the original designers. It is not uncommon for spaces to be loaded or used in ways beyond the original design intent which may adversely impact IAQ, such as putting up walls for private offices, exceeding intended occupant densities, and bringing into the space new contaminant sources. HVAC system total capacity may be able to handle these changes from original design loads but little is done to balance the available capacity among the individual zones that may be overused or underused. In addition, the employer may need to communicate design intent and performance criteria to building occupants whose expectations regarding their environment may exceed what is deliverable by the building systems. To address these issues, OSHA is proposing to require that each facility have written operations and management information whose aim is twofold. One purpose is to collect, summarize and translate design assumptions and intent into operating performance criteria that impact IAQ, such as minimum outside air ventilation rates and occupant densities. Secondly, the operations information should describe how to operate and manage the building systems so that they perform in conformance with the reported criteria. This written operations and management information replaces verbal communications and provides a training document whenever new personnel or new contractors are introduced to the site. Operating information should formally reflect changes in control strategies that typically occur in facilities to accommodate change in use or energy conservation efforts. This is an essential element because of the interdependence between outside air ventilation rate and the automatic temperature control system. In almost all buildings the performance of the ventilation system is affected by space temperature control needs. Paragraph (c)(3)(v) proposes to require a written maintenance program for those building system components that directly affect IAQ because failure to do so may result in the degradation of IAQ in the facility. A written maintenance program is believed to be necessary because levels of HVAC system maintenance vary dramatically and sometimes are deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. The following are examples of maintenance deficiencies which have been associated with IAQ problems: plugged drains on cooling coil condensate drip pans resulting in microbial contamination of pan; failed exhaust fans in underground parking garages which allow carbon monoxide to infiltrate into the building above; microbial fouling of cooling tower water from lack of water treatment with biocides resulting in legionellosis cases; and failure of automatic temperature control system resulting in lack of outside ventilation air. Maintenance of HVAC equipment, for example, may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways, lube and adjustment programs for rotating machinery, and catastrophic failure maintenance to repair/replace failed equipment. There appears to be consensus among HVAC maintenance personnel that the most successful maintenance programs, gauged in terms of system performance and life-cycle economics, are proactive rather than reactive. Consequently, OSHA is promoting preventive maintenance programs for those building system components which affect IAQ. At a minimum, the maintenance program should describe the equipment to be maintained, establish maintenance procedures and frequency of performance. Paragraph (c)(3)(vi) proposes to require a checklist to guide periodic inspections of building systems. This checklist should focus on those building system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor air quality. The checklist shall include but not be limited to inspection of the following components and performance criteria: fibrous liner used for acoustics and insulation in airhandlers and ducts should be inspected for erosion and moisture; smoke-trails testing should be performed to verify design pressurization schemes like negative pressure smoking rooms; ceiling, floor and wall surfaces should be examined for signs of water leaks which could support and amplify microbial contamination; and outside air louvers, intake paths, dampers, actuators, and linkages should be checked for obstruction.
