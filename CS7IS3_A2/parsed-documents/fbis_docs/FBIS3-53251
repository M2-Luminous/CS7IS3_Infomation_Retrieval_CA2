In a statement issued today, the Arab League said: At a time when all international and Arab efforts are being devoted to establishing permanent and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, Israel is defying the international will by continuing to establish settlements in the Arab territories. The latest was the establishment of a new settlement on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The Arab League affirmed that this settlement is considered a link in the chain of Israeli attempts to Judaize the Arab territories. It also comes in the wake of the Israeli Supreme Court's decision on 23 September 1993 to regard the al-Aqsa Mosque as part of Israeli territory. The statement said: While strongly condemning this Israeli measure because it constitutes a grave violation of the will of the international community and the resolutions of international legitimacy, particularly UN Security Council Resolution 252, the Arab League Secretariat General views this measure as an attempt to impose a fait accompli. It also views this measure as a big obstacle in the way of the current peace talks to implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which stipulates that the Jerusalem issue will be discussed within the framework of a final solution. The statement called on the international community and all the effective forces in the world to put an end to the deliberate Israeli violations in the occupied Arab territories in implementation of the principles and resolutions of international legitimacy and to safeguard the unique character of Jerusalem as a city where the heavenly religions and human civilizations coexist.
