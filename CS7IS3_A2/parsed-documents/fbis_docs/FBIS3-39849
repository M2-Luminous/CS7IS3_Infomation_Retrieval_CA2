In statements made after meeting the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzaq Rabin, Garcia Vargas admitted that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali seemed to have given priority to the cities of Tuzla and Srebrenica. However, according to the Spanish defense minister, the momentum could also take in Mostar. As for the presence of the Spanish blue helmets in Bosnia, Garcia Vargas pointed out that their presence depends on what happens in the conflict as a whole. The minister added that in this situation Spain would not act on its own, and it would fulfill its obligations -- i.e. in the short-term it would continue its work as part of the UN forces in Bosnia.
