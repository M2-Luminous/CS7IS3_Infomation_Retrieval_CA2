The Huangjuezhuang power plant will have a total installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. In the first stage of construction, two 200MW coal-fired units will be installed; the project is a joint investment construction effort on the part of the State and Sichuan Province. Construction officially began in November 1991. The No. 1 unit was among the units that would give the nation an increase of 12,000MW in 1993. The No. 1 unit will help to ease Sichuan's energy shortage and promote the province's economic growth. The plant's No. 2 unit could be finished and could begin generating power by June 1994.
