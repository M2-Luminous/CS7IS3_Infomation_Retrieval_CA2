The State Administration for Inspection of Import and Export Commodities said that it examined nearly $61 billion worth of goods during the first 10 months of last year, 29 percent more than during the same period in 1992. Starting last year, the administration began tightening inspection to make sure that goods entering and leaving the country met required standards. Officials found nearly $241 million worth of export products and nearly $1.3 billion of imported goods to be substandard. Last year, imports hit $100 billion and exports $90 billion, with foreign trade volume increasing 15 percent over 1992. The administration said that despite increased inspections, the percentage of substandard exports last year dropped from 1992, indicating an improvement in the quality of domestic products. During the first 10 months of last year, 8 per cent of inspected exports failed to meet standards, a .52 percentage point drop over the same period in 1992. The inspection authority also noted that its efforts have been conducive to the smooth development of China's foreign trade. The country's machinery products that were sold abroad were among China's top quality exports, it said. Some domestic chemical products, however, were banned from being sold overseas, officials said. Rapidly growing imports last year burdened inspectors who checked nearly $30.7 billion worth of foreign goods bought by the mainland during the first 10 months of 1993. This was an increase of nearly 40 percent over the same period in 1992. The administration said the quality of imports has improved. Only 41 per cent of inspected goods were substandard last year, versus 47.9 percent the year before. During the first 10 months of last year, farm and sideline imported products had the biggest quality control problems, officials said. According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co- operation (Moftec), growing domestic demand for industrial and agricultural products spurred China's imports last year. The government's investment in fixed assets, which was 1,150 billion yuan ($113 billion) last year, stimulated Chinese companies' demand for foreign industrial products mainly in the transportation, telecommunication and energy sectors. Meanwhile, a 500,000-ton decrease in domestic cotton production and fast-growing demand for foodstuffs also helped boost the country's purchases of foreign farm products. According to Customs figures, major imports covered machinery, electronics, light industrial, minerals and agricultural and animal by-products. Among exports, Customs said that goods going overseas improved in quality and included farm and sideline products, textiles, machinery and minerals. China also made a breakthrough in tapping new overseas trading partners, although it kept key commercial relations with Japan, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Community.
