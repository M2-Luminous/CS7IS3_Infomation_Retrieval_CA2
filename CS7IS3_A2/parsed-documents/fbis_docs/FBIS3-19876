We did not opt for terrorism because we were aware that the price would be too high and we see that now. We supported a peaceful political struggle to develop a solution to the issue until unfortunately we were stopped. Once an organization like ours, which prefers a peaceful political struggle, gets involved in terrorism it is restricted. [Bereket] You had certain opportunities, such as access to the DEP [Democracy Party] representation in the parliament. Do you think that the DEP used this opportunity to its advantage? [Burkay] I do not think that the DEP has made good use of the parliament. In the beginning they undertook demonstrative actions. They could have undertaken wiser actions. However, the DEP was not even given the opportunity for these actions. I do not think that the DEP politicians have much experience. How do you expect them to have experience when the Kurdish movement receives big [word indistinct] every three, five, or 10 years. Under these circumstances, the politically experienced are being pushed out of the political arena therefore leaving the way open for less experienced individuals who were not given an opportunity to express themselves. [Bereket] You are very cautious when assessing the recent suggestions of Apo [PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] and are refraining from commenting on the proposals submitted by the PKK. Do you believe that the real solution lies in discussion? [Burkay] The important thing is to see that the solution to this issue lies in dialogue, whatever the reasons for the PKK proposals. The issue is political, therefore political channels should be open. As we see it, this can be achieved and the chaos of today -- the dirty war -- stopped. The prospects of the country should not be wasted. The young people of the country should not die in vain. Our country should not be transformed into hell and it is possible to prevent this. The government can prevent this. [Bereket] Would you cease your struggle for independence and coexist in Turkey if the government grants you the right to establish Kurdish schools, television, and radio? [Burkay] Being considered equal means independence. I think the source of the problem is inequality and pressure. I believe that under the basis of equality everybody can live in brotherhood, and I think that the Kurds would not even think nor want a separation. I think that two peoples coexisting is much more beneficial -- for both sides -- than their separation and will stop migration. Of course, it is better to achieve success by a peaceful democratic process and therefore avoid more bloodshed. [Bereket] Why don't you, as the PSK try and emerge as an alternative to the PKK? [Burkay] We were not established as an alternative to the PKK. We were established in 1974, before the PKK, and we have our own program. We work within the framework of this program. [Bereket] Has the Turkish state approached you against the PKK? Has it searched for ways to establish a dialogue with you? [Burkay] We have sent our messages to the Turkish state and government by the use of various channels -- press statements and interviews I've done. These statements have also been published in Turkey. I sent a long letter to Mrs. Ciller when she formed the government. I indicated my views in that letter and submitted various proposals for a peaceful solution to the issue. Unfortunately, as I have said before, these calls of mine have received no responses. [Bereket] What will be the PSK's stand during the 27 March elections? [PSK Central Committee member Unal Yardimci] We have issued messages stating that patriotic democratic candidates should be supported wherever they are and that citizens everywhere should cast their votes. [Bereket] Do you believe that in case a political solution is found to the Kurdish issue the PKK will disappear and new balances established? [Burkay] We do not find the PKK's policies that agreeable. Nobody has [word indistinct] the PKK as much as us but you cannot conduct politics in Turkey without first recognizing the PKK. For that reason, the state should recognize the PKK. We are impartial in this issue. Both community and political life will be reshaped when new democratic conditions are established. There are other Kurdish organizations apart from us. It could be that other powerful Kurdish organizations may develop from the PKK and us. The road that will enable this formation should be open.
