FBIS4-36051 "drnes107_o_94008" FBIS-NES-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 SYRIA Commentary: Israeli Policy Causes Stalemate Commentary: Israeli Policy Causes Stalemate JN0206185394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1130 GMT 2 Jun 94 JN0206185394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] The logic of occupiers is the same whatever pretexts they might use to express their ideas. Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir said he wanted peace, but peace in return for peace. This means peace, plus the Arab territories Israel occupies. For his part, current Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has announced that he wants peace, but he wants peace without any commitment to comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan. This means he wants Syria to give him peace, without committing himself to abandoning occupied Syrian territory. Strangely, Rabin accuses Syria of not being ready for peace, as if peace is something detached from the Israeli occupation and the UN resolutions, especially Resolution 242, which says acquisition of land by force is illegal. The U.S. initiative that launched the peace process in Madrid, and then in the Washington talks, considered implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 the basis for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region in accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace. This exchange does not mean part of the land. It means all of the occupied land. This cannot be subject to bargaining under any security, political, or interest pretexts. If Israel really wants peace and does not want to obstruct the implementation of the U.S. initiative, it would have approved the principle of comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan in return for full peace. But Israel does not want peace unless it is subject to its expansionist logic. This is what Rabin recently stated openly when he said he is not prepared to pledge full withdrawal from the Golan to Syria. Who, then, is responsible for stalemating the peace talks and for the lack of progress in the peace process? Is it not Israel, whose leaders sometimes speak about conditional peace, and at other times about withdrawal from the Golan or about secret talks to abort the Madrid and Washington talks? Mixing the cards with Syria will not take place as Rabin hopes because Syria stands with a peace in which it will never relinquish a grain of its national soil. This fact was emphasized by President Hafiz al-Asad during the summit he held in Geneva with President Clinton, who in turn stressed the U.S. commitment to realize a just and comprehensive peace. After the U.S. emphasis of its commitment to the peace process, and in light of the Israeli positions that obstruct the implementation of the U.S. initiative, the Israeli leaders stick to the logic of occupier, thus rendering U.S. credibility hollow, especially because Rabin knows, more than anyone else, that the answer he gave to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher during his latest visit to Israel was the main reason for the stalemating of the peace talks.
