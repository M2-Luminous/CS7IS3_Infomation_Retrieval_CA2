FR940617-2-00162 FR940617-2-00093 (ii) The lead underwriter will communicate the list of the Relevant Parties to the COB; (iii) The Relevant Parties shall keep all documents prepared pursuant to paragraph 3.d.i for a period of no less than two years; (iv) Upon the request of the Division made pursuant to the Administrative Agreement executed between the SEC and the COB on December 14, 1989, the COB will require the production and the information referred to in paragraph 3.d.(i) from the Relevant Parties through the lead underwriter. The Relevant Parties will provide this information to the COB in a Comma Delimited ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) within 10 days of the request by the COB and the COB shall transmit it to the Division within 30 days from the date of the request. (v) If the Division has inquiries relating to the records provided by such Relevant Parties, it will transmit these inquiries to the COB pursuant to the Administrative Agreement. Representatives of the affected Relevant Party will be made available to respond to the inquiries of the COB. The proposed exemption to rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 shall also apply unconditionally to all transactions on the SEAQ International and any other securities market in a single country outside France and the United States to which a French issuer has applied for listing the relevant Qualified French Securities if the volume in such relevant Qualified French Security as published by SEAQ International or such other relevant securities markets is less than 10% of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security during the Reference Period. 4. General Conditions (1) For purposes of this exemption a two business day cooling-off period shall apply under rule 10b&hyph;6(a)(4)(v), (xi) and (xii) in the United States and in each Significant Market, 24 provided that trading in Relevant Securities in any Significant Market shall be subject to the exemptive relief then available in such markets, if any or the record maintenance and record production requirements contained in the letter regarding Application of cooling-off Periods under rule 10b&hyph;6 to Distributions of foreign securities (April 4, 1994) are satisfied by Relevant Parties in such significant market. 24 A ``Significant Market'' shall mean (i) (aa) SEAQ International or (bb) any other dealer market outside France and the United States for which price and volume information is published by an FFRA or (ii) any other securities markets in a single country other than France or the United States to which a French Issuer has applied for listing the relevant Qualified French Security and been accepted, if during the Reference Period the volume in either (i) (aa) or (bb) or (ii) in such relevant Qualified French Security, as published by the relevant FRRA(s), in such securities markets (as the case may be), is 10% or more of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security published by all FFRAs in (i) and (ii), FFRAs in France, and US securities markets to which such French Issuer has applied for listing such relevant Qualified French Security and been accepted, during the Reference Period. (b) The lead underwriter or the global coordinator shall promptly, but in any event before the commencement of the Covered Period, provide a written notice (``Notice'') to the Division of the following information: (i) the name of the issuer and the Qualified French Securities; (ii) whether the Qualified French Security is a CAC 40 component security or information with respect to the market capitalization and the average daily trading volume of the Qualified French Securities to be distributed; (iii) the identity of the Significant Markets where the Qualified French Security trades; (iv) if the Notice is for more than one entity, the identity of all underwriters and selling group members relying on these exemptions; and (v) a statement that the Relevant Parties are aware of the terms and conditions of these exemptions. We believe this proposed exemption would make it possible to maintain liquidity for shares of French companies throughout a public offering or private placement in the United States, while minimizing the risk of abuses of the kind at which rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 are aimed. Thank you for your assistance and the assistance of your staff in this matter. ␣␣Sincerely, ␣␣Pierre Fleuriot.
