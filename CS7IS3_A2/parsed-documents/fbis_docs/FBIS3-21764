This was reported today at a news conference by participants in a just ended seminar on the problems of drug abuse control, organized by the Ministry of Science and Education and the Council of Europe. According to Franco Marciale, director of the European Youth Centre in Strasbourg, Bulgaria should avoid the mistakes of other countries with a long history of drug abuse. Attention should be focused on the high-risk groups and the factors leading to drug addiction, Mr. Marciale believes. He emphasized that teaching a healthy way of life should be a central task for both family and school. Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three years ago. Even though the country was a transshipment point for the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe, few cases of narcotics dealing were detected inside Bulgaria until then. Over the last few years, drug dealing in this country has been on the rise. The number of drug addicts on record has gone up from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000, recent statistics show. 25 percent of pupils in Sofia have tried or are taking drugs now, Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov told the National Assembly some time ago. According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Forensic Research and Criminology with the Interior Ministry, 21.2 percent of juvenile delinquents are substance abusers, and 16.5 percent are drug addicts. The cases of drugs trafficking and drug-pushing are investigated by a specialized department with the National Investigative Service (NIS). According to its head Vladimir Stoykov, drug-traffickers and pushers can hardly be convicted as the law criminalizes offenses involving expensive goods while the prices of drugs in Bulgaria, which have not been updated for five years, are low in comparison with those in the West: a kilogram of narcotic costs 260,000 leva (about $7,000) if impure and twice as much if pure. A 0.25 g. dose of narcotic sells at 450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov says.
