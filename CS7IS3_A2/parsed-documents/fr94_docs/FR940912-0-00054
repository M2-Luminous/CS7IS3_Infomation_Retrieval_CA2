FR940912-0-00054 FR940912-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134 [T.D. 94&hyph;74] RIN 1515&hyph;AB30 Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional Services AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations by adopting final rules to implement, in part, those provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that provide for overtime and premium pay for Customs Officers performing inspectional services. This document addresses the public comments submitted in response to the interim regulations which initially implemented the pay reform provisions, and makes certain changes to those interim regulations in response to the public comments and in order to add clarity and improve the readability of the final regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin Cummings, Office of Workforce Effectiveness and Development (202) 927&hyph;1391. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) (the 1993 Act) was signed into law. Part II of Subchapter D of Title XIII of the 1993 Act (107 Stat. 668)_popularly referred to as the Customs Officer Pay Reform Amendments (COPRA)_amended section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911 (19 U.S.C. 261 and 267) to reform the overtime_and establish a premium_pay system by which Customs Officers who perform inspectional services would be compensated. In general, while the COPRA retained the basic double-time compensation rate for overtime services, its three sections (sections 13811&hyph;13813) made certain changes concerning how and when such Customs Officers would be compensated. Section 13811 (codified, in part, at 19 U.S.C. 267) amended 19 U.S.C. 261, 267, and 1450 (and repealed 19 U.S.C. 1451a) to create a new and exclusive overtime compensation and premium pay schedule for Customs Officers performing inspectional services, and required the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to prevent certain abuses that developed under the old pay system. Section 13812 amended 5 U.S.C. 8331(3) to provide additional benefits for Customs Officers; it allows overtime compensation to be included in the calculation of Federal retirement annuities, up to an amount equal to 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay limitation, and authorizes the payment of cash awards to Customs Officers for foreign language proficiency. Section 13813 amended 19 U.S.C. 13031(f)(3) to make certain adjustments concerning reimbursements from the Customs User Fee Account. On December 28, 1993, Customs published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 interim regulations in the Federal Register (58 FR 68520) to implement the provisions of section 13811 of the 1993 Act. (The provisions of sections 13812 and 13813 of the 1993 Act were not dealt with in that document; the regulations implementing those aspects of the pay reform provisions will be issued by the Office of Personnel Management and Customs at a later date.) The interim regulations amended and revised certain sections in parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134) and solicited comments concerning these changes. Three parties submitted comments regarding one or more aspects of the interim regulations. The comments received, and Customs responses to them, are set forth below. Discussion of Comments The comments received raised, in part, six areas of concern that will be responded to in this document: (1) Customs interpretation of the exclusivity clause (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)) regarding when and how shift differential allowances would be paid (19 CFR 24.16(a)); (2) whether the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' precluded considerations of other, alternative work schedules (19 CFR 24.16(b)(16)); (3) the propriety of defining ``work assignment priorities'' in agency regulations (19 CFR 24.16(d)); (4) the inclusion of workers compensation benefits in the listing of categories for which Customs Officers may receive pay for work not performed (19 CFR 24.16(e)(2)(ii));
