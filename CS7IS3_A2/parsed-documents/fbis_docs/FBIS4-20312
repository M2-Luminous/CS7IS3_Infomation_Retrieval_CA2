Many occupations servicing production are undergoing rapid growth in the rising industry. Occupations in traditional industries such as transportation, telecommunications, finance and insurance which affect production enterprises to a great extent have continued to undergo healthy growth in recent years. The appreciated value of these industries makes up about 65 percent of the total appreciated value of China's tertiary industry, and their work force makes up more than 50 percent of the labor force in the tertiary industry as a whole, making it the dominant group in the tertiary industry. New occupations in information, consulting, advertising etc., are growing. Take advertising as an example. Before reform and a greater openness, only several score agencies nationwide had the right to advertise, but the number has grown to more than 10,000 now. In conjunction with expansions in the scope of economic activity, and new discoveries in scientific technology, occupations in the information and consulting fields have also begun to open up. Increasingly, they are exerting an important effect on improving the levels of management and decision making, raising product effectiveness, and improving the efficiency and creativity of scientific research. However, because of problems in the economics management system, lack of support in its policies, and other historical factors, a proportionately low and backward status is created for the tertiary industry in the national economy, together with a lack of coordination for it with the first and second industries. Not only is development backward in those basic service industries such as transportation, telecommunications, and public utilities which directly serve production needs in cities and towns, the setup of other production services is also unhealthy and incapable of meeting enterprise needs. Add to this the lack of coordination between operations in the information, consulting, finance, and insurance industries with social development, the lack of progress in activities that safeguard society, the lack of coordination between scientific and educational activities with economic construction, and other problems. For enterprises attempting to start a tertiary industry in such a way, these factors create conditions that penetrate deep into the industry's various sections. Moreover, the enterprise is expected to shoulder many heavy responsibilities such as worker housing, medical care, cultural activities, recreation, family planning, education and jobs for worker offspring, insurance, safety, welfare benefits etc. In summary, the enterprise has total responsibility for the workers' clothing, food, shelter, and other daily activities from birth till death. Since the initiation of reforms and openness, many enterprises have blindly established many welfare type services atop the original base to increase worker benefits and income. Because of property rights and obstacles in the management system, the tertiary industry started by enterprises has chiefly been self service in a closed-loop operation, with no concern for benefits to society. As the result, the market for production services is shrunken, and socialized development of production services is curtailed. Socialization of China's production services, together with low commercialization, not only causes irrational allocation of resources and serious waste, but the way enterprises handle their own "tertiary industry," and their own "welfare" to form a "large and complete" or a "small and complete" entity causes them to shoulder some heavy baggage. On one hand, because enterprises are unable to obtain high quality production services, product improvement is affected. On the other hand, because of a structural cancer created by the enterprise taking on its own burden of a "miniature society," with too many people sharing the same pie, the enterprise's expenditures and management responsibilities are increased, making it difficult to concentrate on development and production, which in turn hinders increased productivity. Direction Taken by China's Production Services Production services make up an important component of the tertiary industry, and their growth and progress follow overall development of the tertiary industry. As the result, accelerating development of the tertiary industry is a necessary condition for enterprise survival, an objective requirement in modern management. The focus of accelerated development of the tertiary industry should be on those "cross-serving" occupations that make up the whole economic service base found during various stages of enterprise activity. Examples are those in transportation, telecommunications, public utilities in cities and towns, etc. The pace of growth in all these occupational areas is the sole factor affecting development of the whole tertiary industry. It is also the premise upon which stepped-up development of the national economy at a steady pace is based. Furthermore, it is also necessary to expend great effort to develop those specialties such as finance, insurance, consulting, information, and various technology services that serve specific phases in the enterprise' production cycle. Accelerated development of these production services is the key to rational use of enterprise capital for efficient productivity. To step up development of the tertiary industry, we must step up reforms in the present system, as well as the pace of change in enterprise operation, to truly accomplish the separation of the enterprise from politics and events, so that the enterprise can truly be an independent operation that is self sufficient and self directing. In the first place, to adapt to requirements for developing a market economy, fields such as scientific research, information, consultation etc., must be taken out from under their respective departments to become new social services. They will then provide production agencies with timely information on market changes, and forecast changing trends in market needs to help with scientific decisions and policies that must be made to develop new technology and explore new products. Next, the dependent "self-service structure" must be separated gradually from the enterprise to which it is attached, and be placed in the larger tertiary industry market under socialized management. By doing so, the burden on the enterprise is lessened, structure is simplified, and personnel and expenses are reduced, thereby increasing productivity. Third, a protective social welfare net must be established to reform the presently practiced health care, labor protection, and retirement systems so that enterprises can shed the responsibility of these benefits and services that should rightly be provided by society. Fourth, the pace of economic legislation must be stepped up, various rules and regulations strengthened, and a societal system of surveillance, auditing, and consulting services perfected, to maintain economic order and enforce strict administration and execution of the law to assure the healthy conduct of all economic activity. Accelerating the pace of tertiary industry development provides the important assurance that the goal of continued economic growth for China is realized. It is also the precondition for establishing a socialist market economy and the objective requirement for modern management in the information age. At any rate, it is commonly recognized that accelerating this industry's development is an enormous task that affects the overall picture. In June 1992, the Central Committee of the CPC (Communist Party of China) and the State Council issued a resolution on accelerating the pace of development in the tertiary industry. In his report at the 14th Plenum of the CPC, General Secretary Jiang Zemin had emphasized that an important indicator in a modernized economy is how a tertiary industry is flourishing, and for this reason, we must exert great effort to stimulate its rise. The essence of this conclusion also illuminates the objective trend in man's development of a social economy and changes in social structure, and clarifies the role and effect of the tertiary industry in the modern economy. Because the Central Committee and the government both strongly emphasize development of the tertiary industry, many specific policies and measures have appeared, for development of the tertiary industry in China to be regarded in a new light. As the focus for accelerating the pace for tertiary industry development, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council on Accelerating the Pace of Tertiary Industry Development" mentions occupations in four areas. They are: 1. Occupations and services requiring low capitalization, of high efficiency, quick returns, and high volume that are closely related to economic development and the people's livelihood. 2. New occupations closely related to scientific and technological progress. 3. Occupations and services that improve peasant character and raise their standard of living, as the tertiary industry at the rural level is presently comprised chiefly of occupations providing services before, during and after agricultural production. 4. Comprehensive and innovative basic services and occupations that contribute to development of the national economy. Innovative services are formed from many different kinds of specialized services. As the result, some people refer to them as "mixed-type services," whose development accompanies the rapid growth of many types of services just described. To adapt to the needs of economic development, the direction and goal taken by China's production services must 1) adapt to the multiple facets of demand; 2) be of high quality; 3) be consistent; and 4) lower the cost of service. To realize these goals, the service industry must implement six changes: that is, to be externalized, organized, mechanized, standardized, informed, and systemized.
