All the songs of hatred that are being sung about him seem incapable of stopping his victory procession. Last week in Moscow, Zhirinovskiy conducted an exhaustive tete-a-tete with former U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom President Bill Clinton had sent to the Russian capital to discover Zhirinovskiy's real thoughts. Nixon expressed his approval of Russia's wish to regain its great power position and of its claim for equal treatment. We present, exclusively for DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN- ZEITUNG readers, an article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy about his plans as future Russian president: The most ridiculous accusations have been leveled against me recently, mainly by the German media. I have been accused of everything except cannibalism and beastiality, in other words sex with animals. If I were to reply to every single abnormal insinuation, I would be doing nothing but countering the perverse fantasies of press people who have obviously been watching too many Hollywood movies. The nationally aware and historically enlightened Germans are clever enough to know what certain "media" understand by the term "truth." But critical-minded persons will notice that, despite the fact that the media "report" on me so often, I seldom have the opportunity, even in Germany, of uttering a few sentences by way of explanation. At the very most, strings of words are brought into play meant to "prove" exactly the opposite of what I really said. Sometimes my statements are mistranslated. Mostly downright lies are said about me. My good German friend Dr. Frey is now giving me the chance to speak out in plain terms, and without censorship. I am happy to take advantage of this opportunity in order to answer a question that must beset very many Germans: What is this man Vladimir Zhirinovskiy going to do when he becomes president of Russia, the biggest country in the world? Will I destroy Germany with nuclear bombs or assume leadership of the world together with the Germans? People accuse me of both, often in the same breath. This is utter nonsense. The truth is that I want a strong Russia allied to a strong Germany. For this purpose, military strength is also required, or else we shall become a banana republic dictated to by foreign powers and ridiculed at our expense. Indeed we wish to be fearsome, but only to those who want to attack us. I want a Russia that is respected in the world, a country that people cannot ignore whenever they want to. I envisage good cooperation with Germany in defense technology. A new armed struggle between the Germans and the Russians must be firmly ruled out. What do I want in industry? As much private initiative as possible, as much state interventionism as necessary. We want none of the rapacious capitalism where international bosses pocket all the money and the masses simply vegetate in poverty. I think the social market economy concepts of Professor Ludwig Erhard, developed during World War II and implemented in many spheres since then, contain sound ideas. As president, I will also maintain the best possible economic relations with the Germans. We Russians, with our enormous natural resources, and the Germans with their know-how are ideal partners. A German-Russian economic partnership would certainly bring an economic miracle to both countries. Regarding social policy: I do not want a social system in Russia in which a wafer-thin minority acquires untold riches whilst the man in the street gets nothing. As far as the social security system is concerned, the policy of Bismarck is a pattern for me. Regarding cultural policy: Here, I want a Russian self-awareness. I will certainly oppose the flooding of our country with the decadent trash that is showered upon us, mainly from the United States. The readers know what I mean, because the Germans are also recipients thereof. I am not at all concerned with sealing Russia off from foreign cultural influences completely, but there must not be an excessive flow of this cultural influence. Our great Tchaikovsky combined German romanticism with Russian national music, and thereby created masterpieces of Western music. That is just one of many examples. Regarding foreign policy: He who is peaceful toward us has nothing to worry about, but he who wages war on us should know that Russia under my leadership will trample every invader underfoot. The Russians and Germans could establish an invincible defense union. The heroism of German and Russian soldiers, so often proved in history, will, together with a joint defense policy, frighten off any potential aggressor. Bismarck is also an example for me in foreign policy. When the German-Russian partnership I am aiming toward has come about, we will be able to discuss Kaliningrad and find a solution that conforms to German interests. The territorial change to Germany in 1945 was not a final act of history, and certainly not a final act of wisdom. Just as his predecessors did before him, President Clinton said in his inaugural speech that the United States shall lead the world. We have no intention of adopting a similar role for Russia. We want a completely sovereign Russia that possesses its rightful place in our hemisphere. To quote the great Prussian King Frederick II, everyone should be happy in his own way. One last word. I am not concerned with delivering empty sentences in a manner to which certain Russian and also German politicians have grown accustomed. I do not use underworld vocabulary that is understood by only a few initiated persons. I try to express myself in such a way that my people know what I want. The Germans, too, should know that I love my people and country above everything else, just as nationally-conscious Germans love their nation and their fatherland. If is out of this love that I desire eternal friendship between the two great western peoples, the Germans and the Russians.
