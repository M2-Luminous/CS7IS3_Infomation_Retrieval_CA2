The fighting is continuing with a great momentum and with high morale. What is rumored by the media of the secessionists, liars, and charlatans, the advocates of apostasy and secession, is baseless. Their units have been liquidated, whether in Abyan, the 20th Brigade, the Madram Brigade, or the [YSP] militia and party units here, as well as all of the units they sent to Abyan such as the 30th Brigade, the Unity Brigade dispatched from Hadhramaut, and the 5th Brigade that arrived from Aden. These units were confronted with firmness, faith, and with high morale and a great number of them were destroyed. The enemy is being utterly defeated. Its defeat has been reflected in its psychology. It has now started to hit cities and civilians with missiles and artillery. We have avoided fighting in cities because we regard ourselves as protectors of people and citizens. We have avoided that in order to preserve citizen's lives and property. But the defeated and the confused ones choose civilians as their victims.
