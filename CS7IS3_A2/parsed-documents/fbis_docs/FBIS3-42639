This marked the end of the prolonged conflict between NTV and Ostankino; the mutual reproaches, the struggle for the president to sign and then recall the edict on turning the channel over, and the backroom games will go down in the history of domestic television. Now the viewer can judge the work of the new television company: no longer just one program a day but 60 hours a week. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent Yuriy Zubtsov speaks with NTV president Igor Malashenko. [Zubtsov] Igor Yevgenyevich, do you not perceive a certain irony of fate in your achievement of your desired goal? After all, in a certain sense you are obliged to Zhirinovskiy: It is thought that it was his victory that undermined the position of the main opponents of turning Channel 4 over to you--Vyacheslav Bragin and Mikhail Poltoranin. [Malashenko] I would like to believe that even if the elections did have an influence, it was somehow different, that, possibly, some understanding emerged in the corridors of power: If one is to be in command of television and not relate to it as a sphere of professional activity, it will produce results opposite from those expected. And a professional television service, not one that is politically committed or subject to anyone's beck and call, can make a much greater contribution to the establishment of political stability than one that is prepared to scold and praise on order. But perhaps these are only my own daydreams and the real reasons were much more transparent. But still, I would like to believe this. [Zubtsov] How do you arrange your cooperation with the programs left over from the previous Channel 4? [Malashenko] At the present time all the main points have been agreed upon and we are just about to sign an agreement with the Association of Independent Television Producers, which includes above all ATV, Ren-TV, and ViD. According to its conditions we will acquire their output for six hours a week. They have distributed this time among themselves as follows: four hours for ATV and one hour each for Ren-TV and ViD. Let me emphasize that we are purchasing their programs in the same way as, for example, we buy artistic films in America. [Zubtsov] And according to what principle do you select one program or another, say, "Vremechko" or "Sunday with Dmitiriy Dibrov"? Does their quality suit you? [Malashenko] The viewer is the main one to evaluate the programs. I am the manager and it is my business to make financially justified decisions which coincide with the interests of the audience. Tastes are always subjective. But the viewer watches these programs and so they must be presented. Moreover, we absolutely do not want to cut the old off at the roots. On the contrary, a certain continuity is important to us. Channel 4 has its own viewer who is accustomed to certain programs and there is no point in rejecting them. [Zubtsov] Even before the president's edict on turning the channel over to you there were rumors going around Ostankino to the effect that NTV was just about to gain a chunk of air time through the courts. Now there are similar conversations regarding the Russian channel with respect to "Russian universities." Does the same lot await them? [Malashenko] There can be no question of any kind of expansion. But here is what we intend to do to expand the network reached by the channel. Today it encompasses more than 40 million viewers and our investors are prepared to invest money in the creation of new transmitters and expansion of this network. I hope that by the end of the year this figure will increase. But this kind of expansion will hardly encroach on anyone's interests. [Zubtsov] It is known that the sum Channel 4 was to have paid to the Ministry of Communications for air time last year was about 360 million rubles, 50 of which was for December alone. This year the rates for state television companies have been increased approximately 1.5-fold. And how much will NTV be paying? [Malashenko] I cannot give you the precise figure, but these rates are much higher for us than they are for Ostankino. [Zubtsov] Incidentally, during the period of the struggle for the channel many of your opponents were asserting that NTV investors were on the verge of financial ruin and that to obtain Channel 4 and make advertising prices much higher than they are in St. Petersburg was the only possibility of rectifying the situation. [Malashenko] I would like very much for that to be the case, because if it were, we would soon become remarkably profitable. But for now we are doomed to bear colossal costs, and along with us--our investors as well. This is work for the long-range future. And as for advertising, the rates for it will indeed be high--relative to Russian prices and the prices of the former Channel 4. We have a purely market situation here. I never tire of repeating that state companies sell advertising time at reduced rates. The services of the Ministry of Communications, say, are paid for by the state to that same Ostankino, and this, incidentally, makes up 80 percent of Ostankino's budget. Nobody is paying for us. And while increasing the prices for advertising we understand that we can attract the advertiser only through the quality of our programs. Plus--through expansion of the broadcasting network. Although our prices are still, of course, lower than on Channel 1. [Zubtsov] We have finally gotten around to the programs themselves. One cannot but admit that NTV has made an impressive start. What next? Do you plan to create new programs of your own? Tell us, incidentally, about Konstantin Erist's transfer to your team. [Malashenko] I know nothing about Erist's transfer. We simply acquired for demonstration a large package of his "Matador" programs like, incidentally, many other popular programs from various years. The expansion of the team is proceeding but in the direction of the information service--a correspondents' network is being created throughout Russia and the first NTV correspondents' points are being opened up abroad. And we intend to produce only information programs, creating the first truly high-quality and professional information service on domestic TV. We shall buy everything else, which leaves a great deal of room for maneuvering. If the ratings drop for, say, some program on ATV or ViD--we will stop buying it and buy another one. Large-scale production of our own programs involve a dictatorship of the producer: we have invested money in the program and we have to put it on the air regardless of how interesting it has turned out to be. But for us everything is determined by the viewer's interest. We are waiting impatiently for the first ratings and sociological studies so that we can find out how the interest is distributed between domestic and foreign movies, old and new films, artistic programs and programs from the past. We will plan our subsequent work on this basis since we have the opportunity to do that.
