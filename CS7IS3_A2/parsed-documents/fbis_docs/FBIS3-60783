According to the study Iniden conducts every month, the figures give obvious evidence of Shining Path's weakening condition. The report says that the main reasons behind this weakening are the constant deployment of security forces and the outburst of violence in September, the first anniversary of Abimael Guzman Reinoso's capture. There were 19 deaths as the result of terrorist actions during November, while in October there were 70 victims. This means that deaths due to terrorism dropped by 85 percent. Most incidents occurred in Lima, Ancash, and Huanuco Departments. A total of 478 individuals lost their lives as a result of the political violence in the country during the year. The collapse of Shining Path terrorism is visible in the Upper Huallaga region (San Martin-Huanuco). In that region 202 of President "Gonzalo's" followers recently surrendered under the terms of the Repentance Law. Iniden reports that last month the police captured 240 alleged terrorists who were later sent to the appropriate police departments for further investigation. A considerable number of terrorists were sent to Lima and other regional jails. It is estimated that there are 600,000 displaced people throughout the country. In Ayacucho, 52,500 families left their homes and lands as a result of terrorist violence; in Junin 17,000 families had to leave their homes; in Huancavelica 14,500 families left the region; and in Apurimac 13,000 moved out for the same reason. A good number of these families have begun to return to their lands as a result of the decreasing level of violence.
