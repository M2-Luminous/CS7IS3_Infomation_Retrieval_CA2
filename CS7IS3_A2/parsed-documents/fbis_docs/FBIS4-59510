FBIS4-59510 "drnes094_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 15 May 1994 ISRAEL `Expectations' From Christopher Visit Previewed `Expectations' From Christopher Visit Previewed TA1505152394 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 15 May 94 p A1 TA1505152394 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Aluf Ben, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gay Bekhor] [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will apparently visit Jericho on 17 May in order to get a first-hand impression of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. Christopher prefers not to focus exclusively on the negotiations between Syria and Israel during his current Middle East tour. It was originally proposed that Christopher visit Morocco with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres but the trip was canceled after Morocco's King Hassan explained that he had no intention of taking steps to normalize relations with Israel. Officials in the American peace team suggested that the secretary of state visit Jericho, and Israel expressed no opposition. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has explained to the U.S. Administration that he has no intention of making further declarative steps toward Syria and is now waiting for a positive reaction from Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the Israeli peace proposal. Israeli sources say that "the ball is now in al-Asad's court." Sources assert that by declaring his readiness to evacuate settlements in exchange for peace and to implement a significant withdrawal on the Golan Heights, Rabin had taken large steps to meet the Syrians half way, while Damascus had continued to adamantly insist that Israel declare its readiness to carry out a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights before any progress in the negotiations. "The proposal handed to Christopher during his last visit to Syria was more detailed and practical than in the past; however, as far as its content there was no change in the old Syrian position," the Israeli sources noted. The sources said that Christopher would make it clear to al-Asad that Syria would have to take steps to promote the negotiations with Israel and at the same time prove that it had changed its policies with regard to terrorism and the drug trade. The secretary of state will arrive in Damascus today and in Jerusalem tomorrow. He will probably meet Prime Minister Rabin tomorrow evening and again on Tuesday [17 May]. According to the reports which have reached Jerusalem, Christopher does not plan another shuttle trip between Damascus and Jerusalem and will leave for Cairo on Wednesday. [passage omitted] [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew in a report by Pe'erli Shahar and Natan Gutman on pages 1 and 8 notes that "A different aspect of the negotiations with Syria that will be raised in the meetings with Christopher is the scope of commitments and guarantees the United States is prepared to give Israel in exchange for its withdrawal on the Golan Heights. This entails strategic cooperation, real-time satellite information, and of course, an estimated $5 billion in financial aid to strengthen Israel's defense and security systems."] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, will arrive in Israel this evening and meet tomorrow with the prime minister prior to Secretary of State Christopher's arrival. Yesterday in Washington, Rabinovich said that Israel expected Syria to accept the basic idea behind the "package" principal. Rabinovich said that he does not anticipate any progress in the negotiations without agreement on this issue. Rabinovich explained that although Syria cannot be expected to agree to every detail in the package, it must accept its underlying principle as well as an essential part of it. Commenting on Syrian media reports, Rabinovich said yesterday that on the eve of the secretary of state's visit, Syria was seeking to paint a bleak picture of the situation in a bid to pressure Israel and the U.S. Administration. [Later in the same report mentioned above, 'AL HAMISHMAR reports that "Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, said that he was not surprised by the criticism leveled by the Syrian press at the Israeli package of proposals for an arrangement on the Golan Heights. `It is not surprising that the Syrians are trying to portray the situation in bleak colors on the eve of the secretary's visit. This is a transparent attempt to pressure Israel and the U.S. Administration,' Rabinovich asserted. "The ambassador pointed out that there was a great deal of wisdom in the U.S. policy of lowering expectations from Christopher's shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem because many further visits were anticipated and one should not expect a breakthrough or dramatic progress on every visit. When he was asked to define Israel's expectations from Christopher's visit, Rabinovich said: `The purpose of this visit is to create the necessary energy to promote the negotiations and facilitate a substantive round of direct negotiations between Syria and Israel.'"] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said over the weekend that there was no guarantee that Christopher's visit would lead to changes in the negotiations with Syria. "The proposals submitted by Syria up to now are definitely not earth shattering; however, there are certain dynamics in the air and we need to continue trying to promote the negotiations with them," Peres said.
