But the impression is being created that it may not be for all. How else to explain a situation where 16 young men from last year's fall replacements for the National Guard of Ukraine were immediately sent home as unfit to serve, and 78 were sent for medical examination to determine their fitness? Incredibly, among the diseases with which the draftees were commissioned were stomach ulcers, cardiosclerosis, oligophrenia at the stage of mild debility, arthrosis and even psychopathy. Just what guided the physicians of the draft commissions, if they knowingly signed the documents on the supposedly satisfactory state of the health of the sick people? They must bear that responsibility as malefactors, among other things, since one such falsification ended tragically for Guard soldier Dmytry Reznyk, who died in December of last year from a perforated stomach ulcer. Strange? Only in November of that same year, after all, the military medical commission of Zavodskyy Rayon of the city of Dnipropetrovsk has officially established the full fitness of the youth to serve! Why recall today these sad events, six months old? The new recruits will soon be welcomed. Reports are coming in from everywhere on the completion of the work of the groups for preliminary selection that were working in contact with the regional military commissariats. Certain oblasts have already sent the lists of the candidates selected. There is no assurance whatsoever, however, that the military commissariats are sending namely those youth to serve in the NHU. The experience of the prior draft--when, for example, the Ternopil city military commissariat sent only three of the 42 draftees selected for the National Guard--forces one to have doubts again. The indoctrination of the draftees, their moral and spiritual qualities, their abilities and the state of their health require especially careful attention today, as was emphasized by Guard Colonel Vasyl Romanovskyy. That is possible, however, only provided there is personal contact with the future soldiers. Financial difficulties unfortunately hold sway here as well. The shortage of funds has led to the fact that business trips connected with preliminary selection have been cut back to a few days, while the transportation that could accelerate and improve that work is effectively lacking. So how many populated areas can you cover on foot in five days? So they have to familiarize themselves, as a rule, not with people but with their personal files. They are often highly falsified. It becomes a vicious circle. The Guard is ready to receive its young replacements. The difficulties that are expected as a consequence of the quantitative imbalance between last year's and this year's replacements have even been taken into account. The training centers of the National Guard of Ukraine are awaiting their new recruits, and the officers are prepared to begin the training of the newcomers and to educate them as true Guardsmen.
