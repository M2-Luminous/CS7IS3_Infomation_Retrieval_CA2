FR940527-1-00081 FR940527-1-00014 G. Disproportionate Share Adjustment (§412.106) Section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act provides for additional Medicare payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low income patients. Section 1886(d)(5)(F)(vii) of the Act, as added by section 6003(c)(1)(B) of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and amended by section 4002(b)(1) of Public Law 101&hyph;508, specifies the formula for determining the disproportionate share adjustment percentage for hospitals that are located in an urban area and have 100 or more beds, or are located in a rural area and have 500 or more beds. The statute establishes different payment formulas for different years, including a change in the formula for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. Regulations concerning the Medicare disproportionate share adjustment are set forth at §412.106. Under §412.106(c)(1)(i), a hospital that is located in an urban area and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area and has 500 or more beds, must have a ``disproportionate patient percentage'' of at least 15 percent to qualify for a disproportionate share payment adjustment. Section 412.106(d)(2) sets forth the formulas for determining the disproportionate payment adjustment factors applicable to these two groups of hospitals. We are not proposing changes to any part of §412.106 in this proposed rule. However, we wish to ensure that hospitals are aware of the revised payment formulas that will take effect in FY 1995 pursuant to the statute. Specifically, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, any such hospital with a disproportionate share patient percentage greater than 20.2 percent will receive a disproportionate share adjustment equal to 5.88 percent plus 82.5 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate share patient percentage. H. Changes Affecting Essential Access Community Hospitals (EACHs) and Rural Primary Care Hospitals (RPCHs) (§§412.109, 485.602, 485.635, and 489.102) On May 26, 1993, we published a final rule to implement the EACH program (58 FR 30630). The rule set forth the requirements for designating certain hospitals as EACHs or RPCHs, the conditions that an RPCH must meet to participate in Medicare, and the rules for Medicare payment for services furnished by EACHs and RPCHs. The final rule implemented section 1820 of the Act, as added by sections 6003(g) and 6116(b)(2) of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and revised by section 4008(d) of Public Law 101&hyph;508. The amendments were intended to promote regionalization of rural health services in grant States, improve access to hospital and other health services for rural residents, and enhance the provision of emergency and other transportation services related to health care. Since the publication of that rule, we have identified several necessary additions to the EACH/RPCH provisions. First, to provide for orderly review and adjudication of disagreements about whether a facility's designation has been terminated properly, we propose to specify under new §412.109(e) that a determination by HCFA that a hospital does not meet the criteria for EACH designation, or that a hospital's EACH designation should be terminated, is subject to review under 42 CFR part 405, subpart R. We also propose several clarifying changes to the definition of ``direct services'' at §485.602, as well as clarifying references in §485.635, the condition of participation on provision of services. These revisions merely would restate more clearly our existing policies under which the services listed in §485.635(b) (``direct services'') must be furnished by employed staff, not under agreements or arrangements. In addition, we are proposing to revise the range of laboratory services that an RPCH must furnish as direct services. In a final rule with comment period published on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63533), we revised the RHC regulations at §491.9 to eliminate, as required direct services, tests not classified as waived under the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA). (See 42 CFR 493.15.) We made these changes in the RHC regulations because the CLIA program introduced participation requirements that may cause some RHCs to withdraw from the program, creating a shortage of available medical care in some areas. Because RPCHs typically are located in rural areas similar to those served by RHCs and serve similar patient populations, and because the RPCH designation criteria in section 1820(f)(1)(H) of the Act state that RPCHs must meet the requirement for direct provision of routine diagnostic services in the statutory definition of ``rural health clinic,'' we believe it is appropriate to impose the same requirements in both settings. Therefore, we propose to revise the RPCH regulations at §485.635 to require the RHCs to provide directly the following laboratory services: (1) Chemical examination of urine by stick or tablet method or both (including urine ketones); (2) Hemoglobin or hematocrit; (3) Blood glucose; (4) Examination of stool specimens for occult blood; (5) Pregnancy tests; and
