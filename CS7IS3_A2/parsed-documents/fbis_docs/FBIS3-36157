Answering journalists' questions during a news conference, the vice premier declared that that proposal, which is contained in a report drawn up by academicians Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov, and Stanislav Shatalin, was dictated by nothing more than political expediency. "I don't think there is anything in the document that merits serious government discussion," he added. Anatoliy Chubays also stated that economists (meaning the leaders of the Russian Central Bank) who seriously propose that a fixed exchange rate should be set for the ruble "are not suitable for responsible work in the Russian leadership." Speaking of the balance of forces within the reformed Russian government, Anatoliy Chubays described it as "very difficult." But the positions of these forces, he continued, "are not set for all time to come." "The very fact that Fedorov and Gaydar have moved on has already brought about a situation in which the arduous and thankless function that they performed will be taken on by other members of the government. So I would not be in a hurry to state that the reformers in the government have suffered a complete reverse and that they have no resources left," the vice premier stressed. Anatoliy Chubays announced that he has no plans to leave the present Russian government. "My plans are to do everything possible to see that the government conducts the reform policy for which I have worked within it for the past two years." He also said that he has "good, working" relations with Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Anatoliy Chubays added that he can find a common position with them, even though there are differences of approach.
