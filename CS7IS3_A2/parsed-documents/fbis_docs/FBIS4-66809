FBIS4-66809 "jpnea027___94050" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 21 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA BJP Executive Meets in Hyderabad BJP Executive Meets in Hyderabad Press Conference 94AS0274A Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE in English 21 Mar 94 p 4 94AS0274A Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE English CSO [Excerpts] Hyderabad, March 20--The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] will begin preparations for the forthcoming elections in 10 States on Monday, when the party's National Executive will discuss the poll strategy at length. Briefing newsmen about the deliberations of the first session of the Executive meeting here on Sunday [20 March], the party general secretary and spokesman, Mr Krishan Lal Sharma, said the party's Central Election Committee will hold a meeting on Monday morning to chalk out the programme. [passage omitted] Mr Sharma said the main issue on the first day's agenda was the economic scenario in the country, including the Dunkel's proposals and the post-budget situation and its fall-out. He said the Executive would come out with a resolution in this regard. To a question, he said the party would hold a massive rally against the Dunkel proposals in New Delhi on April 6 and the Executive would discuss the preparations for the rally. Though the party had held several dharnas and rallies in different States, this rally would be its first major programme at the national level. The rally would prevail upon the Centre not to sign the Dunkel draft as it would be detrimental to the farming community, he said and added that the party would decide the future course of action after April 6. Replying to a volley of questions on the issue, Mr Sharma said the party would wait for the outcome of the March 29-30 special session of the Lok Sabha before taking an official stand as to whether it would demand the withdrawal of India from the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). He denied the reports that there was confusion within the party over India signing the multi-lateral trade treaty. "What was the need for the government to take such a hasty decision to sign the agreement. It should have discussed the issue with the Opposition," he opined. He said the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] would not approach other Opposition parties to launch a common struggle against the Dunkel proposals. "We cannot take the initiative in this regard as all other opposition parties are against us. If any of them invites us to share the platform, we will accept it. But unfortunately, there is no indication at all about a united action programme against Dunkel among themselves," he said. To a question, Mr Sharma said Ayodhya remains top on the party agenda. The issue has brought in polarisation of political forces in the country between secularists and pseudo-secularists. It had given the BJP a break in the political scene, he said. However, the issue was not discussed at the present Executive meeting, he added. The BJP National Executive meet began in the morning with the welcome address by the State unit president, Mr V. Rama Rao, which was followed by felicitation to the veteran leader, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, for his achievement in thwarting the attempts of Pakistan in raising Kashmir issue at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights at Geneva recently. Later, the party president, Mr L.K. Advani, delivered the inaugural address. The Executive adopted the resolutions and other issues on the agenda to be discussed during the three-day meet. Later, the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mr Kalyan Singh, presented a report on the deteriorating law and order situation in his State during the last 100 days of Mulayam Singh Yadav's rule. He told newsmen that as many as 65,000 crimes were committed during this period, which included 2,259 murders, 1,050 kidnappings, 2,000 robberies, 565 dacoities and 49 rape cases.
