European deputies; legislators from various countries; Guillermo Bedregal, the Bolivian Chamber of Deputies president; George Melikjanz [name as received], editor in chief of the Russian newspaper IZVESTIA; former Tunisian Minister Faiza Kefi [name as received]; and other renown intellectuals and politicians from Europe, America, and Africa are participating in this conference. A group of Chilean center and left-wing politicians presented a document for discussion by the conference that will end on 9 January. It was sponsored by International Christian Democratic Union and the European Union. The document includes issues such as ethics, politics, and new humanisms; international economy and solidarity; and peace, security, and disarmament. The document points out that technological change and capital operations represent basic aspects of today's life. In the case of Chilean, this may be translated into the fact that 25 percent of national assets are in the hands of foreign entrepreneurs. This begs the question: How much sovereignty is a state forced to give up if it seeks to attract massive volumes of foreign capital? The document also indicates that there still is "an overwhelming contrast between the standard of living in rich countries and in poor countries -- even though the wealth of the former, to a large extent, has been generated by the work of the latter." The document adds: "There are regions of our planet which seem to have been deprived of all possible benefits that result from the progress derived from an international free trade system." This is the case, for example, in sub-Saharan Africa where conditions still exist that prick the consciences of the rest of the world." [no opening quotation marks as published] The document concludes: "The ethical imperative of our times is to create a humanist civilization that will respect mankind and harmoniously integrate him and his fellow men and into the natural, religious, economic, and cultural environs" to prevent him from becoming a "slave of economic, political, and cultural systems that do not respect" the "values and rights" of humanity. Chilean intellectuals like Roberto Garreton, Carlos Hunneus, and Claudio Troncoso are among the signatories to the document.
