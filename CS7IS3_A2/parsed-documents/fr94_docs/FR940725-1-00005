FR940725-1-00005 FR940725-1-00001 The NRC would use the statement of purpose and need as a basis for its decision standard in weighing the differences between license renewal and the various alternatives involved. Final determinations concerning alternatives in the GEIS would involve the following decision criterion: NRC would use the information on environmental impacts to reject the license renewal option only if the data concerning environmental impacts and alternatives, including the no action alternative, indicates that it would be unreasonable for the NRC to preserve the option of nuclear power generation for future decision makers. For the no action alternative, the NRC would reject the license renewal option only if the environmental impacts of license renewal were so much worse than those of other sources of energy that the NRC would be justified in eliminating the nuclear power plant as a tool for future energy planners. It would not be necessary for the NRC to find in the GEIS that existing nuclear power plants will be the preferred source of energy. The NRC would only have to find that the environmental impacts of nuclear plants place them within a ``reasonable range'' of future energy options viewed from the perspective of environmental impacts. If, in an individual relicensing action, new and significant information created a doubt concerning previous conclusions in the GEIS, the NRC would consider that information to determine if the previous determinations in the GEIS were no longer valid for that particular plant. This decision method used in the recommended approach would allow the NRC to take a hard look at the environmental impacts of the proposed action and, at the same time, demonstrate an appreciation of the primacy and expertise of the States in the area of energy planning. This proposed standard for decision making in the GEIS would differ from current NRC practice for application of NEPA at the construction permit and the operating license stages and in the proposed amendments to 10 CFR Part 51 for license renewal. Currently, at the construction permit stage, the NRC compares the proposed action and the alternatives using a cost-benefit analysis which includes consideration of the need for power and other economic considerations related to power generation. Under the current approach, the NRC rejects the licensing action if the NEPA analysis demonstrates that an alternative is ``obviously superior.'' The recommended approach would avoid NRC determinations on such economic issues and, instead, focus NRC's analysis in the GEIS on the environmental impacts of license renewal and the associated alternatives. For the purposes of the license renewal GEIS, the proposed approach would replace the obviously superior standard with a standard which requires the environmental impacts of the alternatives considered to be so superior to the impacts of nuclear power as to justify the preclusion of nuclear plant operation as an option for future decision makers. In other words, based on the analysis of environmental impacts, the proposed action must be in the ``reasonable range'' of alternatives in order to justify NRC approval. Whether the definition of purpose and need proposed for the license renewal stage should also be applied at the construction permit and operating license stage is under review by the NRC staff. That determination will be made separately from the license renewal rulemaking. The NRC staff believes that of the options considered, the recommended approach will resolve concerns expressed by the States and meet the original objectives of the rulemaking, i.e., to increase regulatory efficiency and stability. The NRC notes that the primary elements of this approach are a departure from past NRC practice as applied at the construction permit and operating license stage. However, the proposed purpose and need statement and the reasonable range decision standard represent an approach to this issue which reflects the differing set of circumstances pertinent to decisions about continued operation of existing nuclear power plants. The NRC staff believes that the definition and explanation of purpose and need and the identification and consideration of alternatives is consistent with the trend of current NEPA case law which allows an agency to consider an applicant's wants when the agency formulates the goals of its own proposed action (see e.g., Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey , 938 F.2d 190 (D.C. Cir. 1991); City of Grapevine, Tex. v. Dept. of Transportation , 17 F.3d 1502 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). Therefore, the staff believes that its approach will address the concerns of the States and meet the requirements of NEPA at the same time. Within 30 days from the close of the public comment period the NRC staff will report on the comments received. If the public comments indicate opposition to this approach or the desirability of making significant modifications to the approach, the NRC staff will seek Commission guidance. Otherwise the NRC staff intends to proceed with incorporation of the recommended approach in the final GEIS and the final rule.
