At the end of the session, Minister Yosi Sarid said that 1994 may yet turn out to be the most important year in the history of the State of Israel, during which peace agreements will be signed between Israel and all its neighbors. Ministers estimated that the intense political activities might heighten the efforts of terrorist elements to thwart the political process. Our correspondent Udi Segal reports on the political portion of the cabinet session: [Begin recording] [Segal] The weekly cabinet session ended about an hour ago, and most of it was devoted to a comprehensive political-security briefing by IDF intelligence elements, headed by Chief of Intelligence Major General Uri Sagi. Based on these intelligence assessments, most ministers sounded cautiously optimistic. [passage omitted] Minister Hayim Ramon believes that some components of the Iranian and Iraqi threat may be neutralized through political action on the Syrian track. [Ramon] The most significant conventional threat is posed by Syria, of course. That is why it is so important to reach a peace agreement with Syria and extricate it from the circle of war. [Segal] Turning to more immediate matters, the cabinet discussed the ongoing negotiations with the Arab partners, mainly the Palestinians, and the understandings reached by Peres and 'Arafat in Oslo. Cabinet ministers believe there is a chance for progress, but there are still numerous difficulties on the way to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. [Construction Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer] The prevailing view, to which I fully subscribe, is that sooner or later we will overcome the difficulties and the Israeli-Palestinian agreement will get on the road. This cannot be said of the Syrian track seeing that, as you know, the talks are scheduled to resume tomorrow but because of the death of Hafiz al-Asad's son, Syria is having problems and an agreement may very well be delayed. However, I believe that after one or two sessions we will have enough indications about the seriousness of Syria's intentions. I believe that if he had not had enough reasons, al-Asad would not have met Clinton. [Segal] Ministers Yosi Sarid and 'Uzi Bar'am asked the prime minister to explain to them why he sent Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur to announce his decision to hold a referendum about the Golan to the Knesset before notifying the cabinet. Rabin noted down their criticism. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January adds that "the IDF intelligence briefings indicated a real Syrian commitment to the continuation of the political process. Several ministers expressed the view that a breakthrough in Israel's relations with Syria should be expected because Damascus was determined to extricate itself from the cycle of war, improve its relations with the United States, and enter a period of calm in the Middle East."]
