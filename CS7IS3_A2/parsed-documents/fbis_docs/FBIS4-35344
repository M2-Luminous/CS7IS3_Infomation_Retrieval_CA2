Some of his possessions were looted. The statement said this must be considered as the beginning of a unique type of terrorism, oppression, and arbitrariness. In an official statement issued by its secretariat general, and distributed in Aden yesterday, the Yemeni Unionist Alliance Party said that it was not really concerned about television interviews with some of its members or the issuing of statements which did not come from its leadership. It stressed that the party ranks everywhere were first for stopping the war and then forming a modern union based on the pledge and accord document.
