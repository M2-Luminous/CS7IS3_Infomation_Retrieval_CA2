Starting from this premise, can you envisage a Foreign Ministry leadership in which coalition factors are asserted? [Kovacs] I could envisage such a leadership. It is true that there are no basic differences between the two programs regarding the main goals, the mentality, the means, or the style. I can envisage a leadership in the Foreign Ministry in which one party provides the minister and the other the political state secretary, although the statements by the MSZP so far are generally in favor of "one-colour" ministries. My personal opinion is that in some cases dual leadership is perhaps more comfortable, namely that the minister and the political state secretary do not belong to the same party. One can also envisage a solution in which one party has the position of minister and the other party the position of chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. I know from experience -- because I have filled this position for the last one and a half years -- that the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee also has an opportunity to influence foreign policy. [Lambert] Looking at the recent past, we can say that the Foreign Ministry was under the strong influence of the prime minister. Now, if we start from the premise that Gyula Horn will be the prime minister, a politician who has serious diplomatic experience, how will this be reflected in the leadership of the Foreign Ministry? [Kovacs] In most countries, the prime minister takes an active part in shaping and implementing foreign policy. There are a lot of summit meetings, including NATO meetings, meetings in the NATO Cooperation Council, meetings between the European Union and the associate members, the Western European Union, and the CSCE, meetings in which the prime minister has to participate. Prime ministerial meetings also represent the summit in bilateral relations. As for Gyula Horn, he has indeed spent most of his life in the area of foreign relations. If I became the head of the Foreign Ministry, this would not be a problem for me, because I have been working with Gyula Horn together for many years, and we understand each other well, and I think we also complement each other. [passage omitted] [Lambert] The programs of both the SZDSZ and the MSZP carry the proposal to incorporate the Ministry of International Economic Relations into the organizational framework of the Foreign Ministry. What are the chances of such a development now when increasing exports is one of the major tasks of our economic policy, and the aforementioned ministry could play a role in this? [Kovacs] Actually, in its current form, the Ministry of International Economic Relations has become obsolete. Foreign trade is no longer a monopoly and this ministry lost a series of functions that used to be important in the past. Therefore, I think it is logical to envisage the incorporation of some of the tasks of this ministry into a future "economic top ministry," and some other tasks into the Industry Ministry and the Trade Ministry, and the foreign activity should come under the authority of the Foreign Ministry, as is the case in most countries. In this case, the current commercial representations abroad would be incorporated into the respective embassies. [Lambert] If I am correct, the National Information Office is already considering a possible halt in its activity. Could you confirm that this is also an MSZP view? [Kovacs] The MSZP has not yet examined the situation of various government offices and government-affiliated offices. My personal opinion is that the activity carried out by the National Information Office in recent months only harmed Hungary's international evaluation, so it is certain that this body cannot function in its current form and with its current personnel. [Lambert] How do you envisage the contacts with the Hungarians living beyond our borders? [Kovacs] Support for the Hungarians living beyond our borders in their endeavor to receive constitutional and legal guarantees for their rights is one of the major directions of activity in the foreign policy concepts of the MSZP. Thus, it is absolutely natural that the government must be ready for close cooperation. We must, however, develop these contacts without discrimination, namely with all the legitimate organizations of Hungarians in Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Vojvodina, Croatia, and Slovenia, and not only with parties, trends, and personalities that are politically and ideologically close to the Hungarian government. Unfortunately, this has been the practice in the past four years. [passage omitted] [Lambert] As chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, you repeatedly criticized the Foreign Ministry for failing to provide sufficient information about the diplomatic steps under consideration. From your own experience, how do you envisage future parliamentary control over the Foreign Ministry? [Kovacs] I have indeed criticized relations between the Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Committee, but I also recognized the fact that these relations have steadily improved in the past four years, as we have learned the laws of a multiparty parliamentary democracy, both government party members and opposition members. We had to learn what it means to be a government party member and an opposition member and how to tolerate each other's situation and views to a certain extent. In view of these experiences, I believe things will work better in the next parliamentary cycle, because the MSZP and the SZDSZ -- the two parties that will now form a government coalition -- have opposition experience, and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] -- parties that will now be in the opposition -- also have governing experience. Therefore, we have a mutually better understanding of each other's situation. [passage omitted]
