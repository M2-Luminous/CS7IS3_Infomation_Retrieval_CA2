"You have a consolidated program for political democratization and you are also continuing to develop a very disciplined system for managing the economy," declared Claes, who has been on a visit to the Czech Republic since Sunday [20 March], following his talks yesterday with his counterpart, Josef Zieleniec. "I am of the opinion that the declaration issued by the 12 in Copenhagen last June, which laid down strict conditions for the admission of countries like the Czech Republic, may play a historic role in this," he added. [Vesely] Does the entire European Union have the same attitude toward the Czech Republic? [Claes] Anyone in West Europe who thinks we can live on our own, as if on some island paradise and in isolation from the rest of the continent, is very naive. The movement toward integration has various motives; however, we have to stimulate it, because it is simply in our interest to do so. [Vesely] The negotiations on expanding the European Union are becoming increasingly difficult. Would it not be enough -- at the moment -- just to have a common market? [Claes] With regard to expanding the Union, it will be necessary first of all to fortify the existing European structure and to reinforce its foundations. This is not possible merely by strengthening the economic union. [Vesely] What about the experience of the European Free Trade Association? [Claes] The states represented by the four current candidates -- Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- indeed belonged to this free trade zone. However, after a certain time, they themselves recognized they need greater integration and a higher level of cohesion. They also recognized that this cohesion can only be guaranteed by a political union. All its signatories must speak unanimously later. Naturally, after this common point of view is reached by democratic means. [Vesely] Are they being considered as a group or individually? [Claes] In Prague, in particular, it is appropriate to emphasize that, in preparing for the next stage of expanding the European Union, we will -- obviously -- not negotiate as one bloc with another bloc. At this stage of accepting new members, we are not negotiating with the Scandinavians and the Austrians concurrently and under the same conditions. It was, and still is, possible that the outcome could be the Union's expansion to only 14 or 15 members instead of to 16 members. [Vesely] Will this course of action also apply for Eastern candidates? [Claes] Obviously, we will not be able to negotiate with the Eastern candidates as if they comprised a single bloc of states. Therefore, it is tenable that the Czech Republic may fulfill all the conditions at a time when the other states are still unable to do so. It is possible that the next stage of expanding the European Union will take place step by step, state by state. I think that this is the important message I can convey to you. It does not only concern your country, but is also associated with the issue of the quality of the European Union.
