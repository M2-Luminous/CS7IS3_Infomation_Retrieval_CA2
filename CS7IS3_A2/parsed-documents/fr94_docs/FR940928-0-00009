FR940928-0-00009 FR940928-0-00002 Six of these comments were in favor of the proposal. Four of these commentors were shippers/packers/growers from Washington State, one from Idaho, and one from California. One commentor who felt that the standard should allow some skin breaks asserted that, ``We felt that these were very good quality apricots and would have been received by our Canadian customers and they would have been very well satisfied with our quality just like our customers in the United States.'' Another commentor stated that ``This injury is slight, and does not detract from the quality or appearance of the fruit, but under present U.S. grade standards it can not be marketed.'' A comment from a grower in Idaho suggested extending the definition to hail damage. The proposal considers a broken skin due to hail to be considered as serious damage. However, the grower suggested providing a 3/16 inch aggregate surface area and 1/16 inch depth maximum allowance to broken skins due to hail injury. Also, a grower/packer/shipper from California commented that although they intended to maintain their current level of quality, they did not object to the proposal to lower the grade standards. ``If Washington state apricot shippers perceive a market for their apricots with reduced grade standards, then they must be allowed to access that market. Lowering the export grade standard does not require export buyers to purchase product with more defects. It does, however, provide them with an option for access to possibly more product at a potentially more attractive price to consumers. Although this may result in reduced market share for California apricot shippers, it must not be the intent of grade standards to grant favor to one shipping region over another. The dynamics of the marketplace must prevail without the intervention of excessive grade standards that prohibit a mutually beneficial transaction between a buyer and seller.'' Eight comments were received which were against the proposed changes regarding skin breaks. Six of these comments were from grower/packer/shippers in the State of California, one comment from the California Apricot Advisory Board (CAAB), and one comment from the National Association of Perishable Agricultural Receivers (NAPAR). One grower from California commented, ``My experience with skin breaks (cuts and stem punctures) on mature apricots is not good. Discoloration and rot begin to form almost immediately after a skin break occurs at harvest time. This severely shortens the already short shelf life of the damaged apricot. Neither the retailer nor the consumer benefit in such a situation.'' Another grower commented, ``We feel that if growers and shippers such as those in Washington are allowed to ship lower quality and potentially disease-vulnerable fruit the opportunity to build a growing and reliable export market will be severely retarded.'' The CAAB noted in its comment three reasons for objecting to the skin break changes: (1) ``Increasing the size and depth of skin breaks, stem pulls and bruises will further reduce the grocery trade's confidence in U.S. Apricots *␣*␣* Questionable and erratic quality of apricots is still one of this industry's serious problems.'' (2) ``The next several years will see a substantial increase in the production of apricots both in California and Washington. This means that export potential will be needed to absorb this volume growth. Fruit that has greater damage tolerances at present will severely threaten our ability to utilize this vitally needed outlet. Export markets take longer to reach increasing the danger of fruit spoilage from wounds.'' (3) ``It can't be stressed enough that the risk of infected fruit spreading to entire containers and even loads by the time they reach their destination is a potential problem far beyond that of approving just a few damaged apricots at point of inspection.'' NAPAR's comment summarized its viewpoint with the following statement, ``We oppose the removal of fresh cuts, stem puncture and stem pulls from the FREE FROM defects clause in both grades, U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2. These defects will permit pathogenic microorganisms to enter the product at shipping point, developing during transit, distant terminal markets, storage and or at retail outlets and develop into decay or serious discolorations resulting in great losses to the receivers and retailers. Additionally and not of lesser importance, if we allow the marketing of apricots in a world wide produce marketing system, we can expect other countries to request to import into the United States fruits of the same poor quality or otherwise unsalable product. To prevent foreign countries from requesting to import to the United States product of this quality and condition, we should maintain a strict U.S. Standards for Grades of all commodities grown in the United States of America.''
