According to Yushkov, the way from Afghanistan to Tajikistan will become easier due to opening of the mountain pass in spring. The CIS defense ministers agreed to carry out the earlier agreements on stabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. For instance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan will bring their military contingency to Tajikistan.
