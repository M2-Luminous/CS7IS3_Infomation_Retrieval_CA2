In his words, Kravchuk is to assess the results of the first round of voting in Crimea shortly. The pro-Russian candidate Yuriy Meshkov won that round, collecting twice the number of votes (about 40%) than his runner-up Nikolay Bahrov, the Crimean Parliament's Chairman. In Jamilev's opinion, the Ukrainian leadership "made several mistakes in regard to Crimea." The main error, according to him, was "Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as an autonomous republic after a referendum on January 20, 1991." The Majles leader foresees possible conflicts in the peninsula, if Meshkov becomes president of Crimea. He called Meshkov "a hypocrite without principle" and said that "Kiev is aware of that." He revealed that "the Majles leadership has been in close touch with Kiev by telephone." He believes that "Crimean chauvinists are backed up by some elements in Russia morally and materially." "To avoid tension with Ukraine," he stressed, "Russia should somehow restrain the Crimean separatists." One such measure, in his view, could be Moscow's pledge not to make territorial claims to Ukraine. At a session in Simferopol today, Majles is to announce its position toward the second round of presidential elections scheduled for January 30 in Crimea.
