We now present the report he has dispatched to Baku: [Begin recording] [Nabi Ogly] Have you studied the recent packages for the settlement of the Karabakh dispute? Can you comment on the matter? [Demirel] We are confronted with conditions that change every day. The Armenians cannot achieve anything by fighting and occupying Azerbaijan's territory. Turkey cannot agree to the occupation of Azerbaijan's territory. The Armenians are neighbors of Turkey and Azerbaijan. They have been entrapped. In view of that, the most reasonable approach by Armenia would be to agree to abandon its attempts to occupy part of Azerbaijan's territory by force. The Armenians have occupied a significant part of Azerbaijan's territory. No solution can be found to resolve the dispute if they do not withdraw. The Armenians may rely on whoever they wish, however, they are faced with significant problems. Fighting a war with Azerbaijan is depleting their resources. It is a fact that 1 million people in Azerbaijan have become refugees. That is a pitiful and shameful situation. I cannot think of anything more tyrannical than forcing those people to abandon their homes and property. Azerbaijan is the side that has suffered. An injustice has been done to that republic. Finding a peaceful solution to the dispute will, as I have already mentioned, depend on the Armenians' withdrawal from all the occupied territories, including Terterskiy, Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy, Lachinskiy, and Shushinskiy Rayons. Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is acknowledged by the entire world. Regarding the situation in Karabakh, the status there can be discussed later. [end recording]
