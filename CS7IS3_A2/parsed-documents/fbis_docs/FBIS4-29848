Indeed, how much possibility is there for a war to break out on the Korean peninsula? Generally speaking, it may be senseless to try to reach a "clear-cut" conclusion about the possibility of a war breaking out. Perhaps this is why the authorities concerned at the Ministry of National Defense [MND] have come up with the following projection on North Korea's recent military movements: "Whereas there is very little likelihood of a total war breaking out," the authorities stress, "the possibility always exists that some limited accidental warfare might be provoked." Based on the following data, the MND argues that there is little likelihood that a total war might break out: First of all, although it has supremacy in terms of the number of troops and the amount of weapons, North Korean armed forces are ill-prepared to carry out total warfare due to the lack of practical exercises on the part of the Navy and Air Force and due to the limited logistical stockpile of military supplies and ammunition. In particular, what is also important is that North Korea's self-supply rate for oil and food-- which are essential in a war--is 40 percent and 60 percent respectively. Second, the ROK armed forces and U.S. Forces in Korea have a considerable level of combined combat capability of handling the initial stages of North Korea's surprise attack. Third, the MND has judged that while the United States is firm in its intention to punish North Korea, those countries--including China and Russia--which in the past supported North Korea, have already stopped providing it with military aid, and even if they should continue to do so, would be very passive in providing future aid. The MND stated: There is very little likelihood that `a second Korean war' will break out due to a combination of North Korea's military status, the capability of the ROK and the United States to cope with a contingency, and the positions of neighboring countries. According to the MND, there are now only about 10 out of some 260 signs which indicate a possibility that a war might break out on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the present tense situation does not warrant being worried. But, the MND added: The possibility remains of a limited military conflict caused by an accidental provocation which the unpredictable North Korean regime might commit with a view to finding a breakthrough in the process of solving the nuclear crisis. The MND feels, in particular, that we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of a limited military conflict escalating into large-scale warfare. According to the MND, as far as the international community's sanctions against North Korea regarding its nuclear issue are concerned, we are actually worried that North Korea might try to blockade the five islands, including Paeknyong Island, in the West Sea, or bombard the ROK Forces stationed near the ceasefire line. Accordingly, the MND has regarded the remarks--which the North Korean authorities have recently made--not as the expression of their will to provoke a war, but as aimed at staging psychological warfare attempted at creating among South Koreans, a fear of war and an atmosphere for opposing hard-line sanctions against the North. In recent months, North Korean authorities have made tough-line remarks such as: "We will regard UN economic sanctions as a declaration of war,"; or "sanctions are a war, a war is merciless"; or "when a war breaks out, South Korea will be devastated by smashing attacks." Some officials have also pointed out that a war on the Korean Peninsula is likely to break out with a preemptive strike against North Korea by the U.S. rather than by North Korea's reckless provocations. The so-called preventive war theory has been regarded as one of U.S. Government's options since U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry made the following remarks in April: "If North Korea should continue nuclear development, we are ready to conduct a bombing raid on its nuclear facilities." In dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue, the United States's position is to maintain control over nuclear development even if it entails having to go to war, while the ROK is of the opinion that a war on the Korean Peninsula should be prevented by any means. This is an important difference between the two countries. We also cannot rule out the possibility of a conflict in the national interests of friendly nations at a decisive moment.
