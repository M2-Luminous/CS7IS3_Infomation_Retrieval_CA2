The most important of them is the treaty on the merger of their monetary systems and on the functioning of the joint monetary system. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told journalists that the treaty did not infringe on the interests of either country. He emphasized that it was a treaty of equal partners. Kebich admitted that the National Bank of Belarus did not quite approve of the documents. One of the articles of the treaty is inconsistent with the country's Constitution saying that only the National Bank had the right to print money and issue credits. Kebich said that this article would be amended accordingly. Kebich said that if two-thirds of the Belarusian parliament did not approve the Moscow agreements, the government might call a referendum on the issue. In his words, the signing of the package marked the end of a marathon. IF Note: Kebich wants the referendum to be held simultaneously with the June 23 presidential elections. He told INTERFAX that, according to sociological polls, a majority of the country's population supported a monetary union with Russia. Kebich is said to stand a good chance of winning the presidential race. A high ranking government expert told INTERFAX that the treaty would have a significant impact on the presidential elections. He thought that the attitude towards the merger of the monetary systems would be the dividing line in the elections. He thought that a favorable political environment was necessary for the merger. The expert did not rule out the possibility that in the aftermath of the presidential elections the new political leaders of Belarus would make a political statement on the merger. IF Note: The merger will proceed in stages. At the first stage which would start on 1 May 1994 Russia will lift customs duties in trading with Belarus. Minsk will reciprocate with lifting the payment of all kinds of transit duties on Russian goods and will let Russia use strategic military bases on Belarusian soil. At the second stage, which is expected to start after the presidential elections in Belarus, the assets and liabilities of the Central Banks of Russia (CBR) and the National Bank of Belarus will be merged. Only the CBR will operate as a bank of issuance. Within certain limits Belarusian citizens will be able to exchange the national currency for Russian rubles.
