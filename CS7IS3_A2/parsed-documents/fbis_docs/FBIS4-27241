According to the regulations, all Vietnamese business establishments which are legally registered and are capable of operating representative offices will be licensed. Overseas representative offices should be put under the administrative authority of the state representative organ in the country concerned. The minister of trade has the authority to renew, withdraw, and cancel licenses for overseas representative offices. The minister of trade is also charged with the management and inspection of the overseas business representative offices. The regulations on the overseas business representative offices also stipulate the necessary period of time for the Ministry of Trade to consider whether to approve or reject applications to set up representative offices. In cases where business establishments had representative offices open before these regulations, their owners should prepare new applications under the provisions of the new regulations.
