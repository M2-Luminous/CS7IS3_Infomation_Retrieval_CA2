Utec Rector Mauricio Loucel said that among the approximately 2,061 citizens polled from the nation's diverse sectors, a total of 1,800 people--mostly of the younger generation--expressed their interest in the coming elections. A total of 40.2 percent expressed their preference for Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] party president and presidential candidate. Nevertheless, 56.6 percent of those polled said that the current government has not met its promises. Likewise, 22.2 percent of those polled expressed their preference for Ruben Zamora, FMLN-CD [Democratic Convergence]-MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] presidential candidate, followed by Fidel Chavez Mena, PDC [Christian Democratic Party] presidential candidate, who obtained 14.1 percent. Chavez Mena slid, however, by 3.4 percent since the previous poll was conducted, Loucel said. The Utec rector added that candidates Jorge Martinez from the MU [expansion unknown] and Edgardo Rodriguez, from the MSN [expansion unknown] continue to obtain 10 percent in their favor. This represents a gap too large to overcome in the coming days. According to the results, the political parties most likely to have representatives in the Legislative Assembly are: ARENA, in first place, with 35 percent in its favor, followed by FMLN-CD-MNR, with 23.4 percent, and in third place, the PDC [Christian Democratic Party], with 15.2 percent. With regard to the voting card, of the 1,800 interested in the coming elections, 88.55 percent have the voting card, while 11.45 percent do not.
