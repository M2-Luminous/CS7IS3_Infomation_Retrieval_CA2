Israel insists that neither of the parties raise any demands that contravene these understandings. Speaking at the end of today's cabinet session, the prime minister said that the draft formulated in Cairo was not an Israeli position paper, but rather understandings reached at the most senior level between Israel and the PLO. It is inconceivable, Yitzhaq Rabin said, not to honor understandings reached at such a level and to then start haggling about them. This kind of situation, Rabin said, raised doubts about whether there was any point at all in reaching such understandings. If the Palestinians reject the understandings, Rabin said, everything is open.
