The president of the corporation, Neil Gerardo, expressed his anxiety at this circumstance in a letter to Congressman John Mica (Republican, Florida), which has been made available to the ITAR-TASS office in New York. The document notes in particular that the company's management became concerned when one of its staff in Belgium reported the details of a Reuter interview with LDRP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in which the latter declared for the first time that Russia had an ultra-secret offensive weapon called "Elipton." The description of this mysterious weapon given by Zhirinovskiy turned out to be similar to the "MRX" defense technology developed in the "Gerardo International" laboratories. "Our company, like many other institutions that are developing high-technology weapons systems, knew of and welcomed the actions of the U.S. Government's intelligence departments in monitoring our lines of communication, because this met the aims of national security," the letter pointed out. "Today our anxiety has increased even more after the arrest of Aldrich Ames on suspicion of supplying secret information to Moscow. We in 'Gerardo International' have done everything possible to keep the 'MRX' production methods a secret. However, after the events that have taken place we fear that the technologies of this system have been 'blown'. We call on Congress to carry out a thorough investigation of this urgent matter. We should like to know how many people, and precisely who, have access to information on the 'MRX' production technologies." The ITAR-TASS correspondent called a representative of "Gerardo International," but he flatly refused to comment on the letter, saying that as yet he had nothing to add to the above version.
