He pointed out that this war brings losses not only to Yemen but to all Arab countries. In a press statement in Cairo today, Mr. al-'Attas said that consultations and deliberations are taking place on the issue of recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. This step has been imposed by the war which was launched on the south by the Sanaa rulers. Al-'Attas added that we demand a halt to this war and withdrawal of the forces to their positions before 22 May 1990. Then dialogue could begin on all matters which concern Yemen and how to tackle various issues, either the traces of the war or the future of Yemen. Mr. al-'Attas refuted that elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] had carried out mediation independently from the YSP leadership. He pointed out that there were national elements, with Mujahid Abu-Shawarib [deputy prime minister for internal affairs] among them, who earlier conducted consultations with several personalities outside the homeland. When some ideas began to evolve, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dissuaded these personalities from continuing their efforts. Mr. al-'Attas welcomed any Yemeni or Arab efforts. He added that he preferred to submit the Yemeni cause to the UN Security Council and he affirmed that the Security Council can assist in stopping the war.
