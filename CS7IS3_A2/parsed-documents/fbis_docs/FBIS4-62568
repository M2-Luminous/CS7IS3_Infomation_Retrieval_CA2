Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, who today held a meeting with the president of Serbia, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent this in an interview today. [passage omitted] The Russian deputy prime minister [Vitaliy Churkin] said that the president of Serbia is in favor of submitting issues relating to the future structure of Bosnia and the territorial demarcation for consideration by the Bosnian Serbs themselves. Vitaliy Churkin is of the view that "they understand that what they are now being offered wholly corresponds to their interests, and that it is unrealistic for one of the Bosnian sides to demand more than half the territory for themselves. In general, he added, percentages are no longer a subject of negotiations. The percentages have been designated; now it remains to mark these percentages on the map, and the sides will be assisted in this by the international contact group." The problem of disengaging the sides in Brcko was also discussed with President Milosevic, and, as I understand it, the Serbian side agrees to UN peacekeeping forces being deployed in this region, taking account of territorial particuliarities, Vitaliy Churkin announced.
