FR940412-1-00016 FR940412-1-00004 13. OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent the unintentional dislodgement of a suspension rope from the slot in a strut. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on the feasibility of complying with such a requirement. If such a requirement is promulgated, should OSHA specify the use of a bolt and nut that are at least 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in diameter for this purpose? Also, Should OSHA prohibit the use of tie wires for this purpose? 14. OSHA is concerned that suspension ropes used on the above-described scaffolds could be damaged through contact with the struts or the overhead longitudinal structural members found in tanks. Accordingly, OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent damage to suspension ropes from contact with the struts or the overhead longitudinal structural members. To what extent do the procedures currently used to rig such scaffolds prevent damage? What, if any, changes to rigging procedures or equipment are needed? 15. OSHA is considering setting minimum requirements (such as length, diameter, thickness (wall thickness for pipes), shape, or type of material) for the struts used to support the above-described scaffolds. What, if any, minimum requirements should the Agency set for the struts? To what extent would struts currently in use satisfy any such requirements? 16. OSHA is concerned that scaffolds designed by persons lacking the necessary skills and knowledge may prove to be unsafe. Accordingly, OSHA seeks comment on the level of expertise that should be required for persons who design scaffolds and scaffold components. Should OSHA require that scaffolds and scaffold components be designed by a registered professional engineer? Should OSHA require that scaffolds and their components be designed by a person who is ``qualified'' as defined in ยง1926.32(l) (see discussion of Item B, above)? 17. OSHA is considering prohibiting the performance of heavy structural repairs and steel erection from the above-described scaffolds to prevent situations where an overload could occur. To what extent are structural repairs and steel erection performed from such scaffolds? How reasonable would it be for OSHA to require that any such work be performed using other means of access? 18. Proposed paragraph ยง1915.252(e)(1)(i) requires that employees on catenary scaffolds, float scaffolds, and needle beam scaffolds, all of which are non-adjustable scaffolds, be protected by personal fall arrest systems. Since the above-described scaffolds and interior hung scaffolds in general are also non-adjustable suspension scaffolds, OSHA is considering requiring the provision of personal fall arrest systems for employees working on the above-described scaffolds. The Agency is also considering requiring personal fall arrest systems for suspended scaffolds in general. To what extent are such systems currently provided to and used by affected employees? 19. OSHA is considering requiring the use of guardrail systems on the above-described scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks information on methods that are currently used to provide guardrail systems on those scaffolds. To what extent are the ropes used to suspend the scaffold capable of serving as vertical supports in a guardrail system? 20. In what types of shipyard operations, other than for blasting and painting, are the above-described scaffolds used? 21. Does the use of the above-mentioned scaffolds expose employees erecting, dismantling, or using them to any unique hazards? If so, what are those hazards, and how can the employer prevent them or protect employees from them? 22. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be secured at the bottom of the tank. To what extent are suspension ropes currently being secured? What methods are being used? What other methods would be appropriate? 23. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be kept in a vertical position while employees are on the scaffolds. To what extent are suspension ropes currently kept in a vertical position? What methods are being used? What other methods would be appropriate? 24. OSHA is considering requiring that platform units used on the above-described scaffolds be secured to the supporting struts. To what extent are those scaffolds currently secured to the supporting struts? What methods are used or can be used for securing the platform units to the struts? E. Inspection of Scaffolds Proposed paragraph ยง1915.252(d)(3) requires that scaffolds be inspected as follows:
