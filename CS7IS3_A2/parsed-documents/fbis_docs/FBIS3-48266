From the start of this year, China reduced the tariff on short greasy wool from 15 percent to 10 percent, in recognition of the exchange rate effects of the recent float of the Chinese currency. Australia's trade minister, Peter Cook, and the primary industries minister, Bob Collins, say although the decision is subject to review in 12 months, it is a constructive development they say will help maintain wool's position as a textile in China. China also decided last November to reduce from 20 to 15 percent its tariff on wool tops. Australia has actively lobbied China on wool tariff reductions, including representations from Prime Minister Paul Keating during a visit to China late last year.
