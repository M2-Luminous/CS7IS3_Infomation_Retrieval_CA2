According to Vasev, Russia's proposals for Dniester settlement are based on recommendations worked out by the CSCE mission in Moldova and take into account the interests of both sides to the conflict. Dniester leader Igor Smirnov said yesterday Tiraspol found unacceptable some aspects of the Russian proposals. The document was also subjected to criticism by certain Moldovan politicians who assessed these proposals as "pro-Tiraspol." "We believe our proposals can lay down the basis for negotiations," Russia's envoy stressed. "However, we are not too self-assured and understand they may be adjusted in the course of discussion in order to reflect the compromises reached," he noted.
