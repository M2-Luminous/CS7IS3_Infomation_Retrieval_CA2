FR940503-0-00012 FR940503-0-00003 Under §563b.3(c)(8), the amount of stock that officers, directors and their associates can purchase, in the aggregate, is limited to between 25% to 35% of the conversion stock, based upon the total asset size of the converting association. In addition, existing §563b.3(c)(6)(i) allows any one or more tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans to purchase in the aggregate not more than 10% of the total offering of shares and allows such purchase regardless of the number of shares to be purchased by other parties. Current OTS policy also permits management stock benefit and recognition plans (collectively ``MRPs'') to purchase up to 3% or 4% of the conversion stock, depending upon the association's capital position. 12 Current OTS policy limits the combined ESOP and MRP purchases to 10% to 12% of the conversion stock, depending upon the association's capital position. OTS policy also permits management to be granted stock options in an amount up to 10% of the shares issued in the conversion. 13 Finally, the OTS recently, on a case by case basis, has imposed specific percentage limitations on the amount of stock that may vest with individual officers and directors. 12 See FHLBB Office of General Counsel Questions and Answers on Part 563b: Conversion and Employee Stock Benefits Plans at 4, 6 (May 1987). 13 Id. Given that mutual savings associations currently seeking to convert generally are well-capitalized, the OTS has become increasingly concerned that the association's management may be undertaking conversions for reasons other than the need for capital. Some thrift insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their associations and mutual account holders to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits as cheaply as possible in the conversion process. In addition, in some cases the issuance of conversion stock to a MRP lessens the opportunity for depositors to obtain conversion stock. Finally, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at aftermarket trading prices, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression that management is structuring an excessive compensation package. While the OTS believes there are valid business reasons for thrifts to adopt MRPs and stock option plans in order to attract and retain qualified management, these plans are now more appropriately implemented subsequent to the conversion and with shareholder approval. The OTS is therefore substantially revising and codifying its policies regarding the establishment of MRPs and stock option plans during the conversion process in new §563b.3(g)(4). The new provisions require that any decision to implement MRPs or stock option plans after conversion be voted on and approved by a majority of the shareholders no earlier than the first annual meeting following the conversion. The rule further requires that thrift subsidiaries of mutual holding companies obtain a vote of a majority of stockholders, other than the parent mutual holding company, to approve such plans. 14 The provisions also prohibit the use of conversion stock to fund MRPs, require that MRPs be awarded and stock options be granted only after shareholder approval is received and require that stock options be granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. In addition, any intention by management to implement MRPs or stock option plans within one year of conversion would be (1) required to be fully disclosed in the proxy soliciting and conversion stock offering materials, and (2) subject to the prior approval of the appropriate OTS Regional Director. Finally, the regulation codifies the OTS's current policies regarding permissible amounts that may be included in stock option and MRP plans formed within one year of conversion. Codification of these policies is designed to provide clear guidance in this area. 14 In this regard, §10(o)(8)(B) of the HOLA requires that a mutual holding company, which is generally controlled by the management of its thrift subsidiary, must own more than 50% of its thrift subsidiary. Thus, absent a disinterested stockholder vote requirement, management will be able to ensure approval of its compensation plans. G. Prohibition on Merger Conversions Under §563b.10, a mutual savings association may convert to stock form by merging with an existing stock association or by becoming a subsidiary of an existing holding company. In this type of conversion, the account holders of the mutual savings association, instead of being offered the opportunity to purchase stock of the converting mutual association, are instead offered the opportunity to purchase shares of the acquiring stock association or holding company. The structure of these transactions raises unique issues not involved in other types of conversions. These include the adequacy of the consideration paid by an acquiror; whether a ``control premium'' should or can be incorporated into the valuation of the mutual savings association; the treatment of the mutual account holders in connection with the distribution of the acquiror's stock; whether mutual account holders should be able to purchase the acquiror's stock at a discount and the amount of such discount; and the appropriateness of management compensation and stock incentive packages offered by an acquiror to coax the mutual association's management into the merger conversion.
