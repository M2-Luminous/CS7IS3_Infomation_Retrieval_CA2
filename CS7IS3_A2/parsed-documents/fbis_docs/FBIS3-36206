This was stated at a briefing by G. Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry Department of Information and the Press. A document distributed by FRY representatives in Vienna notes that the Yugoslav Army does not plan to deploy additional categories of heavy weapons or operational systems on its territory in 1994, the Russian Foreign Ministry representative reported. "The provision of data about the stationing of troops and their armaments in conditions of constant combat action in Bosnia and Herzegovina is evidence, in our opinion, of the FRY's commitment to solving the problems of military security and stability in the region," Karasin noted.
