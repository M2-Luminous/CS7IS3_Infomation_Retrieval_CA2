FR941216-2-00118 FR941216-2-00069 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,887] Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Kingstree, South Carolina; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On October 31, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 9, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 43867). New findings from the company show that company imports of gloves from Malaysia and tray products from Mexico have adversely impacted the company's workforce at Kingstree, South Carolina. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 7th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30897 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
