V. Bunin and prof, Dr Tech Sci I. A. Kovalev, Moscow State Academy of Geological Prospecting; UDC 622.27.001.5] [Text] A department of exploitation of deposits of rare and radioactive metals was organized on the initiative of professor, Doctor of Technical Sciences G. N. Popov at the Moscow Institute of Nonferrous Metals and Gold in 1949. The tasks of the department included training mining engineers having facility with the specific features of underground exploitation of uranium and rare metal deposits and scientific personnel of a high qualification in this field, and providing methodological assistance to mining enterprises and to planning and research institutes. In 1963 the department was transferred to the Moscow Institute for Geological Prospecting, where to this date it has been training mining engineers specializing in underground and combined exploitation of ore deposits. Students are taught on the basis of individual training plans distinguished by a high volume of training in geological disciplines, in the use of geophysical methods in mining, and in the specific features of combatting occupational diseases and protecting and making integrated use of the subsoil. Training of mining engineers specifically for exploitation of stratified deposits was started in 1989. Each year the department accepts two groups of students. Training of foreign students was started in 1992 (India, Libya, Chad, Bulgaria etc.), in connection with which a student group for the training of specialists of a broad profile--mineral deposit exploitation--was organized. Forty-seven doctorate dissertations were defended, 145 candidates of technical sciences were matriculated, and over 3,160 mining engineers were trained at the department. The multifaceted activity of the department's collective embraces a wide range of work. One of the most important directions in the work of the department's collective is supporting the training process with textbooks and training aids of a modern scientific and technical level. The department is constantly working among students to attract them to scientific research. Students are prepared for independent research, and they present reports at scientific conferences within the framework of a student mining circle. The scientific interests of all instructors, associates and graduate students are oriented on developing and improving the procedures of underground and surface mining of nonferrous, rare metal and diamond deposits. Fundamental research completed by the department's collective since 1963 is described below. In the field of underground exploitation of mineral deposits. A complex of research aimed at improving the procedures of mining Altay polymetallic deposits was carried out under the leadership of Prof. G. N. Popov, merited worker of science and technology. A broad complex of scientific research aimed at substantiating and creating new procedures and equipment for hydraulic transportation of mineral raw materials for a number of enterprises in rare metal industry and ferrous metallurgy was carried out. The technical possibility and feasibility of drilling conveyor extraction of ore from thin sections of sandy clay uranium deposits were substantiated. Systems of descending layered excavation employing hardening filling for exploitation of uranium deposits presenting a fire danger were actively introduced. A cycle of work to substantiate sensible use the reserves of ore deposits was carried out under the leadership of Prof. V. A. Simakov. In this case the concept ``sensible use of reserves'' was refined by the inclusion of the time and intensity of developing deposits into it, in addition to full extraction of useful components in the entire extraction-processing cycle. A procedure was proposed for optimizing development of mineral extraction, in which the intensity and time of deposit development ensuring minimum outlays on acquisition of the end product at a prescribed production volume over the years of the period of optimization, within the bounds of allocated materials and monetary resources, are determined. A new indicator was introduced to describe the quality of development of deposits in terms of the degree of fouling of ore by enclosing rock--the coefficient of introduction of enclosing rock, which is the ratio of introduced rock to extinguished reserves. In distinction from the known dilution coefficient, its magnitude does not depend on loss of ore during mining. A procedure of optimizing the level of losses and dilution during mining based on compensational outlays to obtain metal underproduced in one of the variants was created with regard for the proposed coefficient. Solving this problem on the basis of the profit from a tonne of diluted reserves, where metal prices are established at the level of long-term marginal costs, is a particular case of this procedure. The results of this research made up part of a project for which the group of authors, including Prof A. V. Simakov, was awarded the State Prize for 1983. Research on generalizing the minimum industrial and flank content of the useful component at operating and new deposits had important significance to lead and zinc industry. The impermissible scatter of their values was revealed. A proposed means of ordering the values of these indicators at deposits provided for a significant savings of resources. Research on the possibilities of grade-specific mining showed that enterprises frequently do not mine ore by grades, which significantly reduces the economic potential. Scientific research is acquiring special importance to mining enterprises in the time of transition to market relations, when allocation of production reserves on the basis of sensible use of the reserves of deposits in terms of the time and intensity of deposit development, loss and dilution of ore during mining, establishment of requirements on the ore, grade-specific and selective mining, and exploitation equipment and procedures are becoming especially important. The procedures for developing complexly structured ore deposits by an underground method were developed under the leadership of Prof. I. A. Kovalev: - a phased method of conducting scientific research when planning and introducing new mineral extraction procedures and improving existing ones; - a complex of measures for improving systems of sublevel breaking making it possible to preserve the stability of worked rock in the course of developing chamber reserves; - a procedure for removing reserves without leaving chamber pillars behind, which raises the effectiveness of developing steep deposits of low and moderate thickness with insufficiently stable enclosing rock; - a scheme of preparing a story in which it is divided into blocks with geometric parameters determined by the stability of the worked rock mass; - a means of directed crack formation along the outer boundary of a chamber to reduce the seismic action of explosions. In the field of open-cut exploitation of mineral deposits. The following were developed under the leadership of Prof. Yu. I. Anistratov: - a special procedure of open-cut exploitation of diamond deposits in Yakutia, where the quarry flanks are steep (the Mir and Aykhal quarries, the Internatsionalnaya and Udachnaya tubes), for which Yu. I. Anistratov was awarded the USSR State Prize; - a procedure for developing deposits to a considerable depth (over 500 m) in stories with intermediate quarry flanks close to the extinction angle (introduced at a number of quarries in nonferrous metallurgy); - an explosion-less procedure for mining crystalline raw material at kimberlite deposits of Yakutia and Arkhangel Oblast using drilling cutter-loaders; - a method of laying out quarries with a personal computer using standard elements; - an energy-based method for selecting and justifying full mechanization of mining operations at quarries; - a means of exposing working horizons of mountain quarries with underground workings (Khibiny, Tyrnyauz); - a method of evaluating the influence of open-cut mining on the environment, and of developing procedures providing for ecological balance. The following were developed under the leadership of professors B. P. Yumatov and Zh. V. Bunin: - a sensible and safe procedure of open-cut mining for combined (surface-underground) exploitation of ore deposits (objects of research and introduction--the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Works, the Tselinnyy Mining and Chemical Works, and the Tyrnyauz VMK [not further identified]); - procedural directives on establishing requirements on minerals in the course of exploitation of ore deposits by the open-cut method (objects of research and introduction--the Sorsk Molybdenum Works, the Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentration Works, the Agarak Mining and Concentration Works); - a procedure and a package of applications programs for planning the basic parameters of quarries with a personal computer (for use in a system for automated planning and control of quarries): the outer and intermediate boundaries of quarries, the sensible direction for developing the work zone, and the calendar plan of mining operations (objects of research--the Sorsk Molybdenum Works and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Works); - the theoretical principles of planning phased development and reconstruction of ore quarries (the Sorsk Molybdenum Works, and the Muruntau quarry of the Navoi Mining and Concentration Works).
