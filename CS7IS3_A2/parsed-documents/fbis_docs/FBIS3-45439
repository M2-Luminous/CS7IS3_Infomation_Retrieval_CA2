First, rice prices in coastal areas went up and, in the meantime, rice prices in China's major producing regions, such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, also rose in succession. In December, shock waves of grain price hikes in southern China spread to the north and influenced prices of other varieties of grain, such as wheat, corn, and edible oil. During the 15 years of reform and opening up, panic buying in a small number of localities, triggered by the fluctuation of some commodity prices, was not an unusual occurrence. But because this time the problem was with grain, a special commodity, the shock it caused to the people was naturally much bigger. Moreover, this disturbance affected an extensive area. It quickly sparked the concern of the entire society and grain prices became a hot topic. Those who had shown a relatively high degree of tolerance toward increases of some commodity prices due to price reform, also found it hard to keep cool this time. The State Council was very concerned about grain prices. In late December, the State Council held a special work meeting and decided on a number of measures to keep grain prices under control. It made some stipulations, such as setting a ceiling on retail prices. The promulgation of these relevant measures quickly reversed the situation. The grain shock, which had lasted several months while constantly spreading far and wide, was gradually appeased. This also indicates that the country has sufficient grain reserve and is able to roll back grain prices to a rational level. Nevertheless, how did this shock begin? Information supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture indicates that 1993 was a fruitful year for agriculture. With the exception of reduced cotton output, total grain output reached a record high and new grain purchased by the state and put into storage was roughly the same as last year. What is the reason for these big increases in grain prices in a year of bumper grain harvests? The authorities here believe that the fluctuations in grain prices at present are not a problem of grain production. An in-depth and cool-headed analysis is necessary on this issue. It is right to say that the supply of agricultural products in various localities on the mainland is sufficient, but prices of agricultural products are relatively low. Cheap grain harms the peasants. In these years, peasants in major producing regions find grain cultivation less and less lucrative, or even lose money growing grain. Since reform began 15 years ago, grain prices have been adjusted a number of times, but because prices of agricultural industrial products have been rising too fast in the meantime, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural prices did not narrow, but has widened. In recent years, the growth rate of peasants' income has been visibly lower than that of the urban population. In this context, the peasants' wish to increase grain prices to some extent is completely understandable. But while peasants waited for price increases and hesitated to sell their grain too early lest they lost money, consumers, for fear of big price hikes next year, wanted to buy more grain and put it aside. Grain dealers, who deal between the producers and consumers, and state-run grain enterprises, in their capacity as the main channels of state-managed grain circulation, were naturally very aware of such a mentality among producers and consumers. Both wanted sales prices of grain to go up so that state-run grain enterprises could make up for losses they had suffered over the years as a result of the state subsidy policy to some extent, and individual grain dealers would have a chance to make more profits. Furthermore, some circulation channels at the moment are not very smooth. As a result, grain prices spiralled upwards. The above-mentioned circumstances were the inherent causes of the grain price hikes. Here, one can easily recognize that although some elements were not entirely irrational, these price fluctuations are very abnormal and the main cause is psychological. Certain erroneous beliefs are worthy of attention. At present, problems are largely found in the circulation field. If grain prices are too low, this is not conducive to grain production, so they should be raised to an appropriate degree and step by step. But fluctuations that are too fast and too drastic will pose a disadvantage to both producers and consumers and may cause shocks to other commodity prices. They are also very negative for the implementation of many of the reform measures that are about to emerge. The idea held by some people that "price hikes are harmless" is wrong. Grain is a commodity, but a special commodity. If grain is not brought into the market system, there is no future for grain production. In the process of moving toward a market system, we should explore special methods for managing this special commodity and establish special means of regulation and control. The mainland has a population of 1.2 billion and food is still first things first. Even the slightest problem in this respect may jeopardize social stability and undermine the overall interests of reform. Therefore, some men of insight here believe that the fluctuation in grain prices this time is not necessarily an entirely negative event: It is a reminder to relevant quarters that in the course of establishing a socialist market economy, grain, as a special commodity, should be managed with special methods. It goes without saying that we must never backtrack. The only way out is to deepen the reform. The grain shock not only provides a topic for people working in the grain production and circulation fields to ponder, but also sets a serious question for people in all circles on the mainland: Are we prepared for this big switch toward a market economy? Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and State Council have time and again advised cadres at all levels and the general public to be fully prepared for a market economy. A market economy is a stormy ocean and we lack the necessary knowledge and competence to sail on this ocean. When this great vessel of ours embarks on its voyage toward the ocean of the market economy, all the crew, sailors, and passengers must be prepared and learn to sum up experience in practice. Only in this way can we reach our destination in triumph. Practicing a market economy does not cancel the need to strengthen management, still less does it warrant a laissez-faire attitude. We must conduct well the necessary macroregulation and control in accordance with the laws of the market. This is a topic which is derived from the grain shock that is being discussed by people here. I have talked about it briefly in the hope that it will throw some light on your understanding of the situation on the mainland. [Signed] Bao Xin [Dated] 28 December 1993
