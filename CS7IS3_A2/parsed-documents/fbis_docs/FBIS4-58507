Exaggerated issues were raised and written about regarding the switchboard after it was rebuilt and put into operation. True, there are some problems with the operation of the switchboard. The communication departments and officials assume responsibility for this. But most of the problems are essentially due to the difficult conditions through which our struggling country is passing, such as the unfair economic embargo imposed on Iraq, which has caused the suspension of all imports. Other problems are due to the subscribers themselves. Still, communication department officials have not stood with their hands tied. These strugglers have accomplished brilliant creative feats that we highly respect. They represent new technological creativity in very complex fields. The engineers and technicians of the Communications Ministry displayed skills worthy of every Iraqi's pride. The instructions of struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and protect him, on Iraqi prudence and creativity have had a great effect in prompting the strugglers of the Ministry of Transport and Communications to be creative regarding the switchboards and communications equipment in the country. They creatively cannibalized some parts and modified others to help restore most communication systems in the country. Regarding the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, we heard many complaints after the announcement of the rehabilitation of the switchboard. The general complaint is that there is no dial tone in the phones. Others say telephones are often disrupted. To learn about this and to learn the truth about the matter, to obtain more practical details on how the switchboard operates, and to learn about the measures taken by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and about the minister's personal interest in the subject, AL-THAWRAH conducted this interview with Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad, Transport and Communications Minister. We also accompanied him on a field tour of the switchboard. Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad began the interview by saying: The previous switchboard, that is the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, was a crossbar type with a capacity of 20,000 lines. It was commissioned in 1976 and was not expandable. That switchboard, along with several other targets -- communication centers, switchboards, and microwave and coaxial stations -- came under enemy attack during the unfair 30-state aggression. The switchboard and its annexes were completely destroyed The minister continued: The switchboard was rebuilt in two phases: first, the switchboard's building was reconstructed; second, an electronic switchboard was constructed in two months and put into operation on 23 November 1993 with a capacity of 27,000 lines and the possibility of further expansion. This electronic switchboard replaced the old switchboard which, as we said, was totally destroyed. Intensive efforts were made by ministry teams, which worked day and night to reconstruct this switchboard. I told the minister: Let us begin from this point. How was the switchboard reconstructed and operated? [Murtada Ahmad] Engineers, technicians, and workers in all departments of the Ministry of Communications launched a struggle campaign to confront the unfair economic conditions facing our struggler country due to the odious blockade. They rolled up their sleeves and, guided by the instructions of struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and protect him, turned his instructions on Iraqi prudence and creativity into reality. They relied on repairing and modifying destroyed equipment and adding their own skills in this field. Thus the switchboard was finally installed by an unusual process, due to the lack of proper equipment. This situation resulted in some disruptions during the modification process. [Abu-Kamil] So, some disruptions occurred during the modification process due to lack of proper equipment. Hence the delay in operating some of the telephone lines? [Murtada Ahmad] Yes. But there are other reasons that delayed the operation of several other telephone lines, such as faulty cables and wires in the telephone network, which was out of use for more than three years; loss of a great deal of information about subscribers; transferring telephones to new addresses, and faults in the subscribers' own telephone equipment. Despite all that, some 18,750 telephones have been been restored to service. [Abu-Kamil] You said some unusual processes were used to activate the switchboard, due to the circumstances of the blockade. What are the usual processes followed in operating electronic switchboards and how did you circumvent these processes? [Murtada Ahmad] The usual processes followed in installing and operating electronic switchboards essentially depend on subjecting new equipment to quality control tests for a period of time to prove they are functioning well before installing them in switchboard centers, in order to forestall any subsequent problems. When we rebuilt the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, we did not have new equipment to use in the switchboard. We also did not have the equipment to carry out quality control tests. We had to resort to other methods, such as obtaining equipment and parts by repairing or modifying damaged or destroyed equipment. This led to the emergence of the problems during the actual operation of the switchboard. The ministry's team of engineers and technicians are making extraordinary efforts to pinpoint and resolve these problems. Efforts are being made to provide better telephone service, despite the circumstances of the blockade and the lack of necessary spare parts. [passage omitted] After this interview, I accompanied the minister to the 14 Tammuz Switchboard. It was around 2200 hours at night. The visit to the switchboard was not included in the program of my meeting with the minister. However, the minister asked me to accompany him in order to watch the switchboard at work. [passage omitted] The minister ran through the daily record of complaints from subscribers and checked the number of telephones that were repaired. Then he personally called the telephone users that were actually repaired that day. He selected 10 telephone numbers at random and began calling them to make sure that the repair work had been done. He spoke to subscribers and asked about service in general. After making sure that those telephones had indeed been repaired and restored to service, he met with the employees and issued his instructions on providing the best service to subscribers. The minister checked the work of the switchboard and its employees. He was told employees had worked day and night for several days. Our visit to the switchboard was on 9 April 1994. On that day, 450 complaints were recorded and 350 of them were dealt with by 2300 hours. [passage omitted]
