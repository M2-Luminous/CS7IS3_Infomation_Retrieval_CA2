Russian Military Will Receive Legal Status"] [Text] The persistence of the Dniester region leaders in trying to hound General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, from Tiraspol has so far been yielding the opposite results. In Moscow yesterday, Moldova Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli discussed, among other questions, the problem of concluding a Russia-Moldova agreement on temporary status for the Russian army. Should the document, whose draft has already been approved by Boris Yeltsin, be signed, the positions of the 14th Army and its commander would become as strong as they have ever been. The more than two-year presence of the 14th Army on the territory of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, on the one hand, has constantly energized anti-Russian sentiments in Moldova, and on the other, has served as a reliable lever with which Russian leaders have been trying to divert Chisinau from thinking about uniting with Romania. Stating the readiness to pull out the 14th Army, Moscow at the same time linked this question with the progress of settlement of the Dniester conflict. Given the sharpness of the present differences between the sides, this formula virtually means an indefinite presence of the Russian military in Moldova. It is not surprising that, unable to get rid of the Russian military, Chisinau would wish at least to put certain limits on their activities in the Dniester by concluding a special agreement on legal questions pertaining to a time frame for the presence of Russian military formations on Moldova's territory. No details of this documents are known so far, but the political circumstances in which it was approved by Boris Yeltsin are remarkable. On the one hand, Moldova is in for parliamentary elections where, many believe, supporters of an independent state within the framework of the CIS would score victory. At the same time, the conflict between the authorities of the Dniester Moldovan Republic and General Lebed has led to the 14th Army commander's transformation from a hero of the Dniester to an "enemy of the people" and "traitor." Now, after the signing of the agreement with Moldova, the general and his soldiers would be under Moscow's and Chisinau's legal protection whereas Tiraspol's influence on the 14th Army would virtually be reduced to zero.
