Kovalevich and Candidates of Technical Sciences A.M. Bukrinskiy and V.P. Slutsker (S&T Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety) under the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric] [Abstract] The development of the nuclear power industry in the country can be conventionally split into three stages. During the first stage (first generation AES power units with reactors VVER-440 and RBMK 1000) normative regulation of safety was mainly based on the general industrial experience and experience in the development and operation of military nuclear units and research and experimental reactors. During the second period (second generation VVER 440 and RBMK 1000, and VVER 1000) problems of AES safety were dealt with more thoroughly, based on domestic and foreign experience in the development and operation of first generation AESs. At this stage construction of nuclear power units was governed by ``General Safety Requirements for the Design, Construction and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants'' (OPB-73), which on the whole corresponded to similar documents of other countries, for instance, to the then in effect U.S. ``General Design Criteria for AES''. In 1982 the OPB 73 was revised and replaced with OPB 82, but the safety concept practically had not changed. Also during this stage normative technical documentation (NTD) dealing with radiation safety of the operating personnel and population at large was developed. In 1987 a ``Summary List and Plan for the Development of Rules and Standards Related to Nuclear Power'' (SPPNAE 87) was approved. It took into account the available experience in the development and operation of nuclear equipment, as well as the consequences of the Chernobyl AES (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) accidents. This third (current) period of the development of nuclear power is characterized by more stringent requirements to ensuring AES safety. As of 1990, OPB 88 replaced OPB 82. The work on OPB 88 coincided in time with the development of ''Basic Principles of Ensuring Safety of Nuclear Power Plants'' (INSAG-3) by the International Consulting Group on Nuclear Safety under the auspices of the IAEA General Director, which made it possible to take into account the international experience in solving problems related to ensuring safety. The article explains in greater detail the new safety concepts set forth in OPB-88 and describes work on the development of Integrated NTD that regulates problems of ensuring safety of dangerous nuclear and radiation facilities.
