Minister of Information Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the talks were open and candid, but that tangible results have yet to be achieved. [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, I think that the meetings were very open, very candid. They dealt with down-to-earth issues. It was very much businesslike. We have agreed that we agree on the basic principles and the guiding aims for our internal dialogue. However, we feel that this is necessary but not sufficient. What is sufficient is to arrive at tangible and practical steps that people can feel, make a difference of their own lives. And we assure them that the process of negotiations is going to ensure their own concerns. [Reporter] Dr. al-'Anani: Do you think that the king's last speech has put a lot more pressure on the PLO to deal with the issues that are still in the air with the Palestinians and Jordanians? [Al-'Anani] I do not need to analyze his majesty's motives. I think that the speech of his majesty was very clear, very candid. He was showing a great deal of concern that we need more coordination, and this coordination is not only a Jordanian demand, but it is a Jordanian as well as a Palestinian demand. [Reporter] When do you expect the signing? [Al-'Anani] We expect that we should continue to negotiate. [end recording]
