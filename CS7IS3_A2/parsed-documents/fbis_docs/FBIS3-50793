These refugees would remain in the camps while the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala determine the best path to follow, according to Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales. The minister recalled that for 12 years, Mexico has given shelter to many Guatemalan refugees. He also noted that some of these are "guerrillas" who have crossed into Mexican territory and have been received as refugees. As evidence of this, he continued, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] rebels are living in Mexico and have established organs of influence, such as the news agencies CERIGUA and ENFOPRENSA. Nevertheless, the military leader said: "I hope the situation the Mexican brothers are going through changes when the rebels understand the damage they are inflicting upon the population. In turn, they will have to take measures aimed at dialogue and reconciliation to spare residents more death and suffering." Defense Minister Confirms URNG Support Defense Minister Enriquez Morales stated yesterday that reports about the military logistical participation of the URNG within the Zapatista National liberation Army (EZLN) have been confirmed, as stated by Mexican authorities. Mexico's Attorney General's Office told the media covering the events that URNG combatants are participating in the attacks on the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, because one of them was captured. The defense minister said that this confirms our feeling. There is no official information on URNG involvement; however, the possibility that the URNG may be furnishing weapons and supplies to destabilize Mexico, as they cannot do in their own country, has not been ruled out, Enriquez concluded.
