The House issued a statement saying that its members and the rest of the nation denounce the use of force and all those responsible, directly or indirectly, for fanning the flames of sedition among the sons of the same nation. A responsible source at the Yemeni Defense Ministry says that Yemen will only overcome the complications created by the fighting in 'Imran camp, north of Sanaa, through solidarity among all patriotic and democratic forces concerned for the country's safety and unity. Reports speak of more fighting between rival army factions at a military base situated north of Sanaa. Tank battles erupted between forces loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bayd in what was described as the worse fighting in Yemen's history since its unification four years ago. The outcome of the fighting is still unclear, but reports say that about 30 tanks were destroyed and other tanks were captured. Hundreds were reportedly killed or wounded. The Aden-based South Military Command has issued a call for an immediate end to the fighting, warning that fighting may spill over to other parts of the country, raising the prospect of a destructive civil war.
