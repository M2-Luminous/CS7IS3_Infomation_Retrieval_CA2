[Vyunov] I have been to many outposts during my military career, but this is my first visit to a Cossack outpost, and one called "Lyubo" at that (he laughs). But we are military men, so let's get right down to business. If you don't have any objections, Boris Aleksandrovich, I will begin with a question. The Russian defense minister and the commander in chief of the Border Troops, in accordance with a Russian presidential edict, have drawn up a list of units and subunits that, beginning this spring, will be manned primarily by Cossacks. In addition, we now know the results of the experiment in creating army formations in areas where Cossacks have traditionally lived, such as the Transbaykal region and the country's south. Our northwest region has certain special features. There are no Cossack settlements here, am I correct? Aren't we in danger of failing the attempt to create and man Cossack formations, Boris Aleksandrovich? [Almazov] Vladimir Isayevich, such concerns are unnecessary. Let me begin by saying that there is no shortage of young and old ethnic Cossacks in our region. There are tens of thousands of them here on the territory of the five oblasts and Karelia. That the region has no areas in which Cossacks are densely concentrated, with the exception of St. Petersburg itself, is another matter. There is no question that it is harder for us to revive the Cossack traditions and way of life here than in areas where there are Cossack associations and where Cossacks populate entire villages to this day. But I don't think one should dramatize the situation. The Russian President has issued an edict on state support for the Cossack movement, and we intend to implement it. For example, the Cossack Administrative Commission that I head (the Commission is a part of the St. Petersburg city administration), in conjunction with the City Military Commissariat, has devised a procedure for registering Cossacks who live in the city. Since serving in Cossack units is a purely voluntary affair, we decided that conscripts and reservists, on reporting to a Military Commissariat, have to declare that they are Cossacks and state that they would like to serve in the Cossack subunits now being set up. Accordingly, Military Commissariat officials are required to make a notation in the conscript's or reservist's documents. Then the Military Commissariats, working with the city administration's Cossack office, decide his fatec -- whether to send him to a Cossack unit or not. We hope that after this selection process the troop and border units will, in terms of their training and morale, soon make themselves known as the cream of the crop in the Russian Army and its Border Troops. [Vyunov] Well, God willing, as they say. But we border troops also have another interest when it comes to the Cossack movement. I have had occasion to review the draft charter of the Russian Cossack movement. It says that only a Russian citizen who, on completing his compulsory or contractual service like everyone else, registers as a member of a Cossack village community, takes an oath, and begins Cossack irregular service will be considered a Cossack. As we know, that service differs from traditional army service in that a Cossack has his own parcel of land, private farm, or other equivalent farm. It would be good if a Cossack and his family, after completing his service at a border post, for example, could receive such a parcel near the state border. For us it would be very important to thus acquire a second line of border defense. This is because our current border zone is at best made up of neglected villages or unpopulated altogether. It is very difficult to serve under these conditions. [Almazov] I wholeheartedly support your proposal. That is precisely how we see the continuation of Cossack service upon the completion of compulsory or contractual service in army or border units. The draft charter stipulates that Cossacks who live near the border are responsible for defending it. They must have the right, if required by the situation, to detain intruders and to turn them over to the Border Troops. For Cossacks performing irregular border service are militarily subordinate to the border district and under the civil jurisdiction of the ataman board of his Cossack community. But to make this possible, the state and the Border Troops command must provide Cossacks with weapons, equipment, and ammunition and grant them certain rights in addition to their responsibilities. [Vyunov] I agree. And this is why it is essential to lay a legislative foundation for all this as soon as possible. I don't think the technical and organizational side of the matter is going to pose any special difficulty for us. We are prepared to hold training sessions with such contingents and to help them maintain equipment. And that's not all, we'll also help Cossacks bring in their harvests. Again, I think this will benefit both sides. For example, why should Cossacks have to haul their products hundreds of kilometers away to a city when we ourselves can buy them for our border outpost personnel and the families of officers and people serving under contract? [Almazov] As regards the legislative foundation, you yourself know how hard it was just to push through the presidential edict on state support for the Cossack movement. But even after taking effect, it does not solve all our problems. There has to be clear-cut regulation of relations between regional administrations and Cossack missions at the local level. And it is especially important to achieve this in border regions. We and the Border Troops command must work together to uphold Cossacks' right of priority with respect to settling in border areas. These days, with people in the ex-Soviet republics leaving their familiar spots (and there are many Cossacks among them), it will not be very hard to do this. And let's not rule out the possibility of creating such settlements among our regional Cossacks as well. Not very long ago I read in a newspaper that Cossacks are already prepared to try on green caps. I think they look good in the caps, and not just green ones. We will like all border service. After all, the Cossacks have safeguarded Russia's borders since olden times. And we are prepared to rear our young generation, your young people, military personnel, and new recruits in this spirit. [Vyunov] That's great! Let's create a working group to coordinate efforts to enlist Cossacks for border service and to create Cossack settlements along the borders. And in order to ensure that this work continues, I think that we have to look to not only Cossacks of conscription age but also adolescents. Incidentally, you yourself have this in mind. Let's go about this in such a way that a brother goes to an outpost to relieve a brother. You select the kids, and we'll help you organize study groups and young border guard clubs. We'll work together to set up training camps during summer vacation that will be sure to capture the youngsters' imagination with the romanticism of serving on the border. [Almazov] Great! We don't need to put any of this off. We have a lot of work to do in the time that remains until the spring conscription. Most importantly, we need to carry out our first conscription in a very organized fashion. This will be the starting point for the establishment of Cossack border service in our region. Right? It's not enough to say that we are Cossacks, we have to prove in deed that, like our forefathers, we remain faithful to our main calling in life -- to serve the Fatherland wholeheartedly! And that's what we will do!
