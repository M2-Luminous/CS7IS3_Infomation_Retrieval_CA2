Raising both his arms and holding them wide apart above his head he said: "We have done it. We have become a major party." In a single bound, the D66 doubled its vote. Consequently, the D66 party in the Second Chamber will now make an historic leap forward, from 12 to 24 seats. Never in its history had the party earned more than 17 seats. Referring to the opinion polls, which for months had been dubbing the party for victory, Van Mierlo said: "From the promised land we have arrived in the land of reality." Week after week, that promise implied more than the result which ultimately emerged from the elections. At its highest point in the polls, the party scored 34 seats in the Chamber. Only a few weeks ago, there was careful speculation about the possibility of Van Mierlo's party becoming the largest in the country. And on the morning of the elections, the democrats still rated 27 seats in the opinion polls. The outcome of the election, according to Van Mierlo, constituted "an historic disaster for government policy." He also viewed the result as a signal for change, saying: "Now at last there is talk of an unprecedented shift in Netherlands politics. This is highly significant. And it is an historic victory for a party that during its 28-year existence has always called for renewal. We will make the most of the situation." By the way, Van Mierlo is sticking firmly to his preference for a purple coalition, a government comprised of the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and D66. The D66 leader responded cautiously to the question of whether it was inevitable that PvdA leader Kok, the head of the largest party in the country, would become the new prime minister. "It would be the first time that a party which incurred such a loss would provide the prime minister," said Van Mierlo. "On the other hand, Kok certainly has what it takes to become prime minister."
