The proposal would allow Pakistan to take possession of dozens of F-16 fighter planes it has already paid for but never delivered because of a Congress amendment, according to the NEW YORK TIMES today. The amendment bans military aid to Pakistan unless the U.S. President can certify that Pakistan neither has nuclear weapons nor is trying to develop them. U.S. officials were quoted as saying that the proposal is part of a policy to stem the spread of nuclear arms in South Asia. The proposal implicitly recognizes that the U.S. has failed to prevent Pakistan from developing the ability to build a nuclear weapon and now is trying constrain the country's nuclear program, the newspaper said. Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that her country would not give up its nuclear program despite pressure from the United States.
