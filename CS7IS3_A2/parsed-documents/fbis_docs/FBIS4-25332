The conference called for severely and promptly punishing all kinds of serious criminal elements in accordance with the law to create a more favorable social environment for reform and development. Ren Jianxin, CPC Central Committee Secretariat member and Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] chairman, chaired the conference and relayed important instructions from central leading comrades. The conference was jointly held by the CCCMPS, the CPC Central Committee Organization Department, and the Public Security, Justice, and Civil Affairs Ministries to further implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural work; disseminate advanced experience in upholding material and spiritual civilizations simultaneously to achieve economic development and social stability; arrange to make concentrated efforts to improve public order in rural areas where it is not good; and vigorously strengthen comprehensive management of public order to further improve the public security situation in the countryside and promote all-round development of rural work. In his speech, Luo Gan, state councillor and CCCMPS vice chairman, pointed out: Today, our country is in an important historic period of reform and development. Good public order and stable social environment are important conditions for reform and development. All these years, the party Central Committee and the State Council have always regarded agricultural, rural, and peasant issues as fundamental issues affecting the overall interests of the party and country, and they have adopted a series of effective measures to promptly and appropriately resolve the prominent issues in rural work. This has promoted rural stability and development. Luo Gan said: In recent years, many localities have rectified public order in many rural areas where it was not good. The CCCMPS has also made arrangements to combat thieves, pursue and annihilate "train and highway bandits," and launch other special struggles closely related to public order in rural areas. Some results have been obtained. The current situation of public order in rural areas is generally good, although in some local areas problems of public order are fairly prominent. It was learned that the current work on rectifying public order in rural areas will focus on cracking down on offenders of serious crimes in four areas: 1) Evil forces of hooligans, particularly gangs of hooligans and burglars, as well as criminal rings with the characteristics of secret societies [he she hui 7815 4357 2585]; 2) bandits on trains, cars, and ships, as well as criminals who commit murder, robbery, explosion, rape, and other violent crimes; 3) criminals who sabotage railroads, telecommunications, power, and production facilities, or who commit other serious crimes such as stealing or robbing state properties; and 4) criminals who transport and sell narcotics, organize prostitution, kidnap and sell women and children, and manufacture or disseminate pornographic materials. Luo Gan stressed: In conducting the work of rectifying public order in rural areas, party committees, governments, and departments concerned at all levels should fully understand the necessity of strengthening comprehensive management of public order in rural areas, persist in severely and promptly punishing all kinds of serious criminal elements in accordance with the law, implement legal and educational measures against people who break the law by committing minor offenses, strengthen forces in towns and townships in charge of comprehensive management of public order, extensively and profoundly launch activities to manage villages according to the law, and improve and strengthen work of publicizing the legal system among peasants. In particular, it is necessary to make vigorous efforts to strengthen village party branches and village committees and to build self-governing organizations of the masses to institute a system of responsibility in managing public order so that there are truly people who are in charge and attend to the work of comprehensive management of public order. It is necessary to establish and perfect crime prevention mechanism in society, encourage the masses to combat bad things and bad persons, and mobilize and organize the masses to build up grassroots organizations and quickly change the face of public order. Luo Gan asked all localities to closely combine efforts in rectifying public order in rural areas with efforts to vigorously develop the rural economy, improve public order to safeguard economic construction in rural areas, and promote the building of spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations. He asked them to strengthen rural public order from the sources by carrying out economic construction and the construction of spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations and by consolidating and developing the achievements made in rectifying public order in rural areas. Zhang Siqing, CCCMPS vice chairman, and persons in charge of departments concerned attended the conference.
