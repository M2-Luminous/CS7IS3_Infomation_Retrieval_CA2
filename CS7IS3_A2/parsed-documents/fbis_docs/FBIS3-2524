Li Peng made the remark here while delivering a government work report to the annual session of the Eighth National People's Congress. China will always be a reliable force for the preservation of regional and world peace and will never seek hegemony, Li added. In his report, the premier elaborated on the current international situation, the relationship between China and other countries and China's principled stands on many major international issues. On the international situation, Li Peng said that the world is moving increasingly towards multipolarity. In general, the international situation is becoming more relaxed, and development is now a more prominent issue. Economic interest is becoming a primary consideration in international relations. Peoples around the world share a common aspiration for the relaxation of tensions, cooperation, development and progress. However, the world is far from tranquil. The major tasks for the international community are still to maintain world peace and promote economic development, Li added. He said, "in this complicated and changing international situation, China has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of peace and has made fresh progress in its diplomatic work. It has continuously expanded its friendly relations and cooperation with other countries, and its prestige has steadily grown. It has played an important role in maintaining world peace and promoting economic development." Recalling the further strengthened good-neighborly relations with surrounding countries, the premier said the friendship between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has grown. The mutually beneficial cooperation with Japan, Russia and the Republic of Korea has been steadily expanded. China has also made new progress in its relations with countries in Southeast, South and Central Asia. At the same time, Li said, China's friendly relations and cooperation with other Asian countries and with the great number of developing countries in Africa, Latin America and the South Pacific have developed further. Li Peng said that relations between China and the West European countries and the European Community have again been improved. Sino-German relations have entered a new stage of development and a new chapter has been opened in Sino-French relations. There are broad prospects for economic cooperation and trade between China and the west European countries, and so long as the two sides work together, bilateral relations between China and each of those countries will continue to grow. Normal and stable relations between China and the United States not only serve the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large, Li Peng said. He said, "we should consider these relations from a global perspective, looking beyond this century. We maintain that differences should be settled through dialogue on the basis of mutual respect. So long as the principles stipulated in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques are strictly abided by and efforts are made to enhance confidence, reduce trouble, expand cooperation and avoid confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will continue to improve and expand." As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Li Peng said, China has actively participated in international affairs and played a positive role in such matters as settling international disputes through peaceful means, protecting the environment and promoting social progress. China stands for expanded economic cooperation and trade, enhanced South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue. It advocates the complete prohibition and destruction of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, proposes that all nuclear powers conclude a treaty undertaking not to be the first to use such weapons and supports the effort to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty through negotiations, Li Peng said. China does not engage in the arms race, nor does it participate in any military bloc or seek a sphere of influence. It supports the idea of conducting dialogues on matters of security and cooperation in Asia and the Pacific and has made contributions to that end. Li Peng pointed out that no matter how the international arena changes, China will not swerve from its position of upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, nor will it change its policy of developing friendly relations and cooperation with other developing countries. "Ours is a diversified world. It is essential for countries to recognize the differences in their social systems, ideologies, cultures, traditions, national characteristics and religious beliefs, to respect each other, cooperate with each other for their mutual benefit and develop state-to-state relations on the basis of the universally recognized norms. On human rights issue, Li said China values human rights and is willing to discuss the matter with other members of the international community on the basis of mutual equality. However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs under any pretext. The Chinese Government supports the latest resolution adopted by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain countries for putting pressure on the developing countries in this regard. He said the Chinese people will continue to work together with all other peoples around the world to establish a new international political order and a new international economic order that are just and equitable, to maintain world peace and to promote common development.
