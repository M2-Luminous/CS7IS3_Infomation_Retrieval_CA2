The Swiss concern Ringier owns a Czech-based joint stock company of the same name which publishes the best-selling newspaper in the Czech Republic, the tabloid BLESK. Besides this it has a 51 percent stake in the daily LIDOVE NOVINY and the regional paper MORAVSKOSLEZSKY DEN. Among other media publications controlled by Ringier are the weekly RESPEKT, PRAGUE NEWS, TENIS REVUE, CESKOMORAVSKY PROFIT and TYDENIK TELEVIZE. MLADA FRONTA DNES, the serious Czech daily with the widest circulation, is published by MaFra in which the French company Socpresse -- publishers of the French newspaper LE MONDE -- has a 48 percent stake. Socpresse additionally has stakes in five regional newspapers. Most of the regional papers in the Czech Republic are controlled, however, by the Bavarian concern Passauer Neue Presse which, according to the DENNI TELEGRAF article, owns many Bavarian regional dailies which are close to the conservative CSU party. Passauer Neue Presse has a large stake in the Czech holding company Vltava Labe Press which publishes papers such as JIHOCESKE LISTY, SEVEROCESKE NOVINY, HRADECKE NOVINY, as well as the national magazines MLADY SVET and KVETY. The agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY is 65 percent owned by the German Mittelrhein Verlag Bohemia, which also controls 86 percent of the tabloid EXPRES. A number of specialist economic publications are controlled by a concern called Euroexpanzion, created by Germany's Handelsblatt and the American Dow Jones company (which publishes THE WALL STREET JOURNAL). Euroexpanzion owns 45 percent of Economica, the company which publishes the Czech economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, and the periodicals EKONOM and FINANCE. Among Czech publications in which no foreign capital is involved are RUDE PRAVO, a left-leaning daily in which the editor-in-chief has the majority share, the right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK, DENNI TELEGRAF, which is owned by Investicni a Postovni Banka [Investment and Postal Bank] and PRACE, in which the trade unions have the majority share. The daily SVOBODNE SLOVO is published by the Melantrich publishing company, 97 percent of shares in which belong to the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS). But the new law on political parties will oblige the LSNS to renounce its share and the daily will most likely be taken over by private individuals, DENNI TELEGRAF writes.
