Mr. Fukuda said that during the 30-minute meeting, he made a general review of the developments in the peace process and Japanese-Jordanian relations. Noting that Dr. al-Majali visited Tokyo last month and "impressed the (Japanese) government of the difficulties facing Jordan resulting from the Gulf war," Mr. Fukuda said his country stood ready to extend assistance to help the Kingdom overcome its economic difficulties. Speaking in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Fukuda, who is on a Middle East visit billed as a familiarisation trip, recalled that his prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, had promised Jordan to help it alleviate its foreign debt burden. "The promise meant that Japan will make more assitance available to Jordan since (Tokyo) is in no position to write off debts," Mr. Fukuda explained. Japanese assistance was discussed during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, Mr. Fukuda said. But he declined to be specific. However, he confirmed that Japan was "in the final stage" of granting an $80 million loan to help develop Jordan's energy sector. "We also touched upon other potential projects and programmes which will be of mutual interest," he said. Japan holds about $900 million of Jordan's $6.88 billion foreign debts. Most of the Japanese part of the debts is in the form of soft loans for long term at nominal interest rates extended during and after the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991. Japan attaches high importance to its relations with Jordan because of the Kingdom's key role in the Middle East peace process and its "geopolitical" features, Mr. Fukuda said. "We are watching with admiration the efforts demonstrated by Jordan to advance the peace process and also towards a free market economy," he said, adding that Japan also appreciated the Kingdom's participation in international peacekeeping operations. By coincidence, he said, during a trip to the Dead Sea on Tuesday he met a Jordanian officer who served with the U.N. force in Cambodia, where Japan also maintains an army unit. The officer, whose name was not immediately available, spoke about his time in Cambodia and of his meetings with Japanese counterparts, Mr. Fukuda said. The encounter, the Japanese minister said, "is the kind of experience" that one enjoys and gives an added personal dimension to bilateral relations. In the broader context of Japanese contribution to the Middle East peace process, Mr. Fukuda noted that Tokyo has pledged $200 million in assistance to support the Palestinian self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) deal. "This is not a political statement, but a firm commitment," he said, adding that $25 million of the aid were already disbursed in the public health and health sectors in the occupied territories. "We are in a hurry to disburse the rest of the amount, and we are in continuous contact with the World Bank and others," he said. Asked whether Japan shared a reported international feeling that there are no "credible" Palestinian institutions to channel the more than $2.2 billion aid pledged at a donor's conference in October, Mr. Fukuda said: "The legal requirement of the Japanese assistance has to be met; afterall it is tax-payers' money. We have to be satisfied on our side that the...assistance is spent for the purpose for which it has been allocated and intended." Mr. Fukuda, who arrived here Monday overland from Israel through the occupied West Bank, said he had met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, his deputy Yosi Beilin and other Israeli officials as well as Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories, including members and advisors of the peace negotiating team. "These meetings were very enlightening to me," given the fact that it is the first visit to the Middle East after taking office, Mr. Fukuda said. Japan is playing a key role in the multilateral phase of the Middle East peace process. in addition to chairing the multilateral working group on the environment, it is vice-chairman of the committee on regional economic cooperation and water. Japan is also a member of the working groups on refugees and arms control. Japanese officials accompanying Mr. Fukuda said two meetings were planned in Cairo next month, of consultative committees of the multilateral phase, to discuss "a series of specific ideas" for specific projects involving regional cooperation in various fields. Asked how he viewed the progress of the peace negotiations between the Arabs and Israel, Mr. Fukuda said: "It is important to be optimistic." Expressing hope that the peace talks would eventually lead to a just and fair peace settlement in the region, he added: "Nobody is going to benefit from failure (of the peace process), but everybody will lose from failure."
