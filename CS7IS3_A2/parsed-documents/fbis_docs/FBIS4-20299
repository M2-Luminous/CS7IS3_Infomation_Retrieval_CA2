In the coming new year, Chinese people follow our cultural traditions to discard the old and welcome the new, and sincerely look forward to the party and government to carry on the party's fine traditions, wash away the harmful filth which has stained the institutions of the party and government, and achieve better results in the various tasks of building socialist modernization. We highly endorse the suggestion of a high-ranking Chinese leader that in implementing a socialist market economy, we should study well what socialism means and wear the "socialist" hat properly. That is to say that if we are truly working toward socialism, we should not view socialism simply as a matter of wearing, or not wearing a hat by that name. In fact, there are some cadres who fail to clearly differentiate socialist market economy from capitalist market economy to the extent that in words or deeds they often toss aside the socialist "hat." There are also those who, having other objectives in mind, openly advocate steps which will greatly weaken and even dismantle the collective economic system and, using open or covert tactics, attempt to carry out privatization. Such theories and actions are harmful to building socialist modernization; these, along with the unhealthy tendencies manifested in the party and the increasingly serious corruptions seen in the society during the last few years, all show a trend that, if allowed to develop unchecked, will lead to considerable dangers and therefore cannot be treated lightly. To China and its people, 1994 should be a glorious year as well as a year of serious challenges. It is a glorious year because the anti-corruption struggle launched under the party and central government's leadership will gradually penetrate to the grass-root levels; because the "Decisions on Certain Issues Pertaining to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System" promulgated by the 3rd plenum of the 14th CPC Congress will extend reform to the lower levels; and particularly because the publication and subsequent organized studies of the third volume of "Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works" will raise the ideological consciousness among the broad masses of cadres and people who, armed with such a weapon, will counter and overcome the various unhealthy tendencies and launch a forceful struggle against the reactionary forces which utilize peaceful overture tactics against China in the international arena. If all party and government cadres, particularly the leader cadres, thoroughly study and completely understand the ideological viewpoints of comrade Deng Xiaoping, they will in their work be able to emphasize the good points, correct any shortcomings, and carry out the party's basic line in a concrete, correct and comprehensive manner, and the result will certainly be greatly elevating the party's prestige among the masses and strengthening the close relationship between the party and the people. Why do we say that the coming new year is also a year of the most serious challenges? Because in terms of economics, politics, ideology and other areas, numerous serious problems still require solutions, and some of these urgently, such as sharp drop in production, trade abnormalities, monetization out of control and increasing inflation; we must pay close attention to such problems and guard against their impact on the entire process of economic construction, reform and opening up. In restructuring the economic system and accelerating economic development by intensifying reform, we should aim to speed up the pace of making adjustments while maintaining stability, for we cannot afford to allow chaos to develop by accelerating development. In restructuring state-owned enterprises and establishing a modernized enterprise system, we should protect the primacy of the collectivized system, particularly the central core of state-owned enterprises from being weakened or dismantled. In summary, stable economic development is the foundation for political stability and unity, and must therefore be managed effectively. With respect to the anti-corruption struggle currently underway, this is a difficult major task which runs into much resistance, particularly because in many large and major cases, the people and projects involved are very complex, which make it very difficult not only in indictment and investigation but also in sentencing and punishment. In many localities, departments and work units, there are cases of malfeasance, corruption, abuse of authorities, embezzlement, giving and receiving bribes on the part of some cadres and working personnel; the fact is that such corrupt behaviors and activities which violate the law and regulations have become habits after many years, and some guilty persons not only are not ashamed, but are proud of their activities of making more and more money, using clever tactics and spending lavishly. In the anti-corruption struggle, such people not only feel no remorse and admit no guilt but on the contrary try to resist punishment by seeking assistance from their superiors and subordinates, friends and colleagues. At the same time, many trades and businesses act irregularly or illegally in apportioning costs, levying penalties, collecting fees, raising prices and using all kinds of ways to defraud and take advantage of the people; although some regulations have been issued to deal with these problems, because of the size of China and its population, these abuses cannot be controlled or stopped outright. Therefore, in the anti-corruption struggle, we must be resolute in our determination, and must concentrate all possible strengths, extend a helping hand to the masses, and adopt severe and thorough measures to overcome the many difficulties, before we can achieve greater results. We will need to be more forceful in establishing the ideology of communism and in firmly supporting the party's ideological political work which is at the heart of the socialist system. In recent years, the ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization has not disappeared but rather has intensified in certain respects, and it retains the danger of once again polluting the country; but yet, there are some stubborn supporters of liberalization who, under the slogan of intensifying reform, spread the harmful viewpoints of privatization and total westernization among the masses, and serve the cause of the Western reactionary forces which attempt to bring about changes in China's system of socialism under the pretext of peaceful evolution. The above has demonstrated that many serious and urgent problems still confront us, and that we must accept these serious challenges and, through testing by them, continue to make forward progress. To solve the above-mentioned series of important problems is not only the hope of the Chinese people but also the desire of the rank and file cadres. If leader cadres of our party and government, particularly the high-ranking leaders, themselves share the hope and desire of the broad masses of people and cadres, they need only to solve the problems people are dissatisfied with and do well the things which benefit the people, they will have accomplished their missions. An ancient proverb states that one anticipates danger while living in peace. For a nation, even when the economy is developing, the political situation stable and the people well off, [the government] should from time to time consider whether any disasters, emergencies or dangers which escaped detection may be threatening. The proverb is a warning to those in political power not to be proud of or self-satisfied with what they may have achieved, [a point which] many elderly revolutionary leaders of our party have also earnestly admonished us in the past. Today's situation and the tasks at hand are very much more complicated than ancient times, the changes are much more rapid, and we must constantly maintain a very alert frame of mind, not overestimating what we have accomplished or overlooking problems which still remain, but making due assessment of the difficulties we face, if we are to gain the benefits and avoid the pitfalls. Communist Party cadres must anticipate danger while living in peace, not only because many yet to be resolved problems still confront us as we go forward, but also because in the world at large, class struggle has by no means disappeared, only the methods of struggle have changed. In our relationship with the monopolistic capital classes in the West, we now emphasize unity as well as struggle. In economics, cooperation and unity are the key: More exchanges, more businesses, the more we learn from them the good things we ourselves can use, the better; but in terms of ideology and politics, struggle unfortunately cannot be avoided, and our struggle is directly mainly against the reactionary forces that try to eliminate communism in China, for the eyes of the reactionary forces are sharply focused on Chinese Socialism, and they will not be satisfied unless and until the Communist movement is completely destroyed within this century; these reactionary forces will intensify pursuit of their peaceful evolutionary strategy, and the Chinese people must constantly and strictly guard against and resolutely resist their open tactics and covert schemes and the various types of attack. Naturally, because of the costs and benefits involved, different developed capitalistic countries in the West have different attitudes toward China, and we cannot treat them all as one group. When we talk about anticipating danger while living in peace, we are following the principle of seeking truth from facts; we should neither exaggerate the difficulties involved nor make up dangers where none exists and consequently lose our faith. At the same time, after considering all possible dangers, we should redouble efforts in our struggle to correct all mistakes and shortcomings, do well in all the things that need to be done by overcoming various difficulties, and make the party even stronger in terms of ideology, politics and organization; proceeding from an effective system of law, we should strengthen management, increase efficiency and heighten the prestige of democratic dictatorship of the people. At the same time, by vigorously strengthening the conditions for ideological political work, we should mobilize the enthusiasm for building socialism among the broad masses of people, popularize again the traditions of struggling against all hardships and preserving against all odds, and help the people sweep away the unhealthy ideology of money worship, extreme individualism, self-indulgence, making of large gains from little labor and all kinds and manners of corrupt behaviors and practices that are being promoted in today's society. From this it can be seen that our demand is not only to anticipate dangers, but to get rid of these dangers and restore stability and peace. In the new year, with joint efforts by the entire party and all the Chinese people, given the prerequisite political stability, we should strive to maintain forward progress and momentum in the tasks of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
