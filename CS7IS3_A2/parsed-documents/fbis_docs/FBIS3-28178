One of the traitor Kim's crimes is that he has bartered away the national interests, rushing headlong along the road of dependence on foreign forces, the news analyst says and goes on: Whenever an occasion offered itself, such as "summit talks" and "security consultative meeting" with its American master, his clique begged them to shelve the "U.S. troop cutback plan" and did not hesitate to sell off the national interests for this purpose. The puppets have committed criminal acts, prettifying the U.S. forces as a "war deterrent", "apostle of peace". It is the traitor Kim Yong-sam who promised the American master behind closed doors to open the rice market and finally signed the memorandum of agreement on the opening. The rice market opening will drive the South Korean agriculture to total bankruptcy, cut off the lifeline of the six million peasants and exert a catastrophic influence on the economy as a whole. The pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries of the puppets are arch crimes putting their predecessors into the shade. The traitor Kim absolved Japan of its past crimes and made a clean sheet of the question of compensation to the "comfort women for the army", crying for "establishment of new South Korea-Japan relations" not bound to the past, and committed a criminal act of flinging the door open wider for its economic reinvasion. All the more hideous is the fact that he has been trying to do harm to fellow countrymen with the help of foreign sword. Raising a hue and cry over the fiction of "suspected nuclear development of the North", the puppets have left no stone unturned in a bid to stifle the North in league with foreign forces. They have raised the North's "nuclear problem" at the UN and other international organisations to seek "pressure" and "sanctions" against the North. Facts vividly show how many treacherous crimes the traitor Kim has committed during not a long period of his office. The people will never pardon the group of traitors to the nation.
