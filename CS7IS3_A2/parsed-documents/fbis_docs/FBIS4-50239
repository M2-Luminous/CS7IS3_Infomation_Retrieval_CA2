At the conclusion of the forum, entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Brace Up, Carry Out Down-to-Earth Work, and Speed Up Development," Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a speech in which he emphatically stated: We should strive to integrate ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at opening up new vistas. To this end, we should persistently and unswervingly carry out ideological emancipation and concentrate our efforts on removing the following four ideological obstacles: 1. The remaining ultra-Left ideological influence that can still be found in some areas, units, and comrades across the province. Some areas, units, and comrades are still arguing about the definition of socialism and capitalism; 2. The old concepts from which some comrades have yet to ideologically free themselves. Some comrades still find themselves more comfortable with the planned economic structure; 3. The lack of initiative, enthusiasm, morale, and a strong sense of discipline on the part of some comrades. Some areas and units are still plagued by slow growth and poor efficiency; 4. The habit among some comrades of giving empty talks and refusing to do down-to-earth work. Some comrades have even adopted an irresponsible attitude toward the party cause. Secretary Liu Fangren noted: We should strive to integrate ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at opening up new vistas. To achieve this, we should redouble our efforts to push ahead with ideological emancipation in the following six areas: 1. To firmly bear in mind that "development is the last word" and more expeditiously push ahead with overall economic growth; 2. To further expand opening up to the outside world and try to invite more foreign investment; 3. To make redoubled efforts to readjust the operational mechanism and improve large and medium state-owned enterprises; 4. To strive to push forward growth in the non-state-owned economic sector; 5. To bravely and creatively push forward pioneering work in light of actual local conditions; 6. To further ideological emancipation in selecting, promoting, and appointing more competent cadres and building stronger leading bodies. In conclusion, Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: In the months ahead, we should devote more energy to the following three work areas: 1. To closely combine the ongoing general theoretical discussion with all sorts of current tasks, and gear the ongoing general theoretical discussion to improving all sorts of tasks and opening up new vistas; 2. To strive to speed up overall growth and mobilize all comrades to correctly understand the current provincial situation, brace up, strengthen confidence, clearly define a new train of thought for the province's overall growth, and put forward more proposals aimed at rejuvenating Guizhou and making the Guizhou people more prosperous; 3. To strive to make flawless work arrangements aimed at avoiding unbalanced, superficial, and false growth, and set and follow strict work requirements.
