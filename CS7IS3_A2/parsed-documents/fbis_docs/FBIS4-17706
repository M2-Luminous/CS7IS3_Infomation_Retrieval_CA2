Following the welcoming ceremony at the airport, Walesa and his entourage went to the Antakalnis city cemetery where they paid tribute to the memory of those killed for the freedom and independence of Lithuania. Then the Polish president met Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. A treaty "On Friendly Relations and Neighborly Cooperation Between Lithuania and Poland" is expected to be signed on Tuesday. Its draft was prepared for several years. The differences in views on the historic developments taking place 70 years ago were the main obstacle in preparing the treaty. The Lithuanian side wanted that the period from 1920 to 1939, when Vilnius and its suburbs were part of Poland, be described in the treaty as "occupation". The Polish side disagreed with the wording. The speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament told Interfax before the visit that the arrival of Walesa and the signing of the Lithuanian-Polish treaty should put an end to the past relations and become the basis for the development of good relations in the future. He said that the visit by the Polish leader would help an early integration of Lithuania into the European structures, the development of a mutually advantageous cooperation between the two states. According to the Lithuanian statistics, in 1993 Lithuania exported to Poland goods to the sum of about $33.6 million which is 2.8 pct of total export. The country imported goods from Poland to the tune of about $9.1 dollars (about 0.7 pct of total imports).
