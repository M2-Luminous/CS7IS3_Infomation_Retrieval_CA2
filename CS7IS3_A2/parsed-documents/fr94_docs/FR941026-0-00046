FR941026-0-00046 FR941026-0-00017 The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of DOT is unnecessary. There are about 12,300 licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTV) in the U.S. Although some may operate towboats on ocean (domestic-trade) waters, many of those vessels are manned by licensed masters or mates. OUTVs on ocean waters already must complete radar-observer courses [see 46 CFR 10.464(e)(2)], but they must do this only once. This rule will require certain licensed OUTVs to obtain radar-observer endorsements, which must be renewed five years after the month of issue [see 46 CFR 10.480(f), below]. Roughly 15,000 masters, mates, and OUTVs will each need to complete a radar-observer course or a Radar-Operation course sometime during the five years after the effective date of this rule to comply with 46 CFR 15.815(c), below. Those completing the radar-observer course will need to renew their endorsements every five years to continue to work on radar-equipped towboats of at least 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) in length. Certificates from Radar-Operation courses will not be valid with licenses dated after February 15, 1995. Consequently, persons using the Radar-Operation certificate to satisfy 46 CFR 15.815(c) will need to complete radar-observer courses when they renew or upgrade their licenses_if they intend to continue working on radar-equipped towboats of 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) or more in length. A Radar-Operation course, at least four hours in length, is designed to indoctrinate operators with regard to basic uses and interpretation of radar. Radar-observer courses, courses approved by the Coast Guard and completed by applicants seeking radar-observer endorsements on their licenses, range in length from four hours (renewal only) to five or more days. The radar-observer courses and corresponding endorsements are separated by area of operation: Rivers, Inland Waters, and Unlimited (any waters). Expenses to complete the different courses will vary, depending on the courses selected, the sources of training, and the applicants' abilities. In-house courses should cost less than courses offered by independent schools. Unless their employers offer the courses, OUTVs likely will bear the expense for the training, and complete it on their own time. Tuition might cost up to $100.00 a day, and miscellaneous expenses for travel, meals, and lodging will sometimes accrue too, at $20.00 to $100.00 a day. Since the endorsement is valid for five years, the expense may be spread over five years as well. For example, if the typical OUTV completes a Radar-Operation course before February 15, 1995, for $50.00 and then two years later, when renewing his or her license, completes a Radar-Observer (Rivers) course at a cost of $480.00 (three days of training, lodging, meals, and miscellaneous expenses), the expense for the first seven years will be about $530.00, or $76.00 a year. For subsequent five-year intervals, the expense will fall to about $14.00 a year, due to the shorter length of the renewal course ($50.00 tuition + $20.00 miscellaneous expenses = $70.00 divided by five years = $14.00). Hence, over 30 years, training 15,000 licensed individuals will cost about $440,000.00 a year. Since about 450 new OUTVs are added each year (at $480.00 each), $216,000.00 must also be added each year to arrive at the total expense for the towing industry_$656,000.00 a year. Statistical research has shown that American society is willing to pay $2,600,000.00 to save even just one life. Therefore, even if only one life is saved each year by this rule, the benefit outweighs the expense by about $2,000,000.00 a year. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This interim rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the provisions of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, however, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities. This interim rule places its burden on individual OUTVs, not on their employers, which may, but need not, take it on themselves. The Coast Guard expects that, of the employers that will take it on themselves, few if any will be small entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no adverse economic impact on small entities. If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think it qualifies and to what degree this rule will economically affect it. Collection of Information This interim rule contains no new collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ]. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that the rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and concluded that, under ยง2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub-ยง2.B.2.1. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B that clearly has no environmental impact. A Determination of Categorical Exclusion is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
