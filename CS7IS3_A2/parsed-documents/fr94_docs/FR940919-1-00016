FR940919-1-00016 FR940919-1-00006 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards for Palletization AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Postal Service published in the Federal Register on August 18, 1994, a proposal to amend Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the preparation of mail on pallets, 59 FR 42536&hyph;42540. The proposed revisions are intended to establish consistent standards for all classes of mail prepared on pallets. Such standards should result in the lowest combined costs of handling palletized mail for the Postal Service and its customers while facilitating consistent service for palletized mailings. The Postal Service requested comments by September 19, 1994. Owing to the needs of the mailing public, from whom several requests for additional time were received, the Postal Service is extending the comment period to November 3, 1994. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed or delivered to the Manager, Business Mail Acceptance, U.S. Postal Service Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Room 8430, Washington, DC 20260&hyph;6808. Copies of all written comments will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 8430 at the above address.
