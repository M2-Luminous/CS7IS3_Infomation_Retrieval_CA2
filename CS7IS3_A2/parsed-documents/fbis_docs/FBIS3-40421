The agreement was signed at the inauguration of FELIX last month and the beam time is payment in kind for two United Kingdom-built undulators. The undulators were intended for a British free electron laser project that was cancelled in 1987. The Rijnhuizen laboratory is part of the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). Work on FELIX started in 1987. The Dutch Ministry of Education and Science paid 13.4 million Dutch guilders [FL] (about 5.7 million pounds) capital costs and is spending another FL4 million per year to turn FELIX into an international user facility - the agreement with the United Kingdom is the first step. FELIX actually started operating in 1991 and the first experiments started late in 1992. According to FELIX project leader Wim van Amersfoort, the facility is oversubscribed by more than a factor of two. The plan is to operate FELIX 42 weeks of the year (16 hours a day, five days per week) and the annual running costs are expected to be about FL3.5 million. A free electron laser (FEL) is a cross between a synchrotron and a laser. Synchrotron radiation is produced when a beam of relativistic electrons is forced to oscillate in a magnetic field. The core of a FEL is an undulator, a device that produces more intense synchrotron radiation than other arrangements of magnets. If mirrors are placed at each end of the undulator, the radiation can be stored in the resulting cavity and made coherent. Bunched electrons travel through the undulator, amplifying radiation produced by previous bunches. One of the mirrors is partially reflecting to allow the FEL radiation to escape from the cavity. FELIX operates between 6 and 110 microns in the infrared and is used for experiments in atomic physics, molecular physics and chemistry, solid-state physics, surface physics and chemistry, medicine and biomolecular spectroscopy. The wavelength is tuned by changing the electron energy or the magnetic field in the undulator. It is tunability over a wide range of wavelengths that give FELs their advantage over other radiation sources. FELIX actually has two undulators and two linear accelerators. Its output consists of micropulses - infrared pulses with durations between 0.5 and 10 picoseconds and peak powers of 10 megawatts. The micropulses are separated by 1 nanosecond and form macropulses which can last as long as 6 microseconds and contain thousands of micropulses. There are between six and ten macropulses per second. Twenty percent of the time on FELIX will be used for studying FELs themselves. The FOM group plans to produce micropulses with durations of hundreds of femtoseconds and to extend the wavelength range to 300 microns - shorter wavelengths in the 1 to 20 microns range are already covered by the CLIO free electron laser at Orsay in France. Rijnhuizen has also started work on a free electron maser (FEM) as a megawatt source of tunable millimetre waves. This would be used to heat and control magnetically-confined fusion plasmas in tokamaks. Completion of the FEM project, which is being carried out in collaboration with laboratories in the former Soviet Union, Russia and Germany, is expected in 1995.
