Tretyakov: "Say No If You Cannot Say Yes. What Is the Head of the Kremlin Thinking About?" [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev risked asking the president of Russia a most difficult question for Boris Yeltsin regarding the creation of a Eurasian Union, which undoubtedly in language more understandable to all simply means the recreation of the USSR (naturally--no irony intended--a democratic one, with a market economy, and with realistic, in the sense of being realistically measured out, sovereignty of the member states). The president of Russia became very thoughtful. Boris Yeltsin never liked to and does not know how to respond to direct questions (since the autumn of 1991). If he is forced to do so he does it not even evasively (that is, in a Marxist dialectic manner, as Gorbachev did) but simultaneously giving two contradictory answers. With reference to the existing well-known decree issued by Yeltsin, for instance, presidential elections will take place in Russia in June 1994, whereas in accordance with transitional articles of Yeltsin's constitution--they are scheduled for June 1996. Thus Yeltsin did not say yes to the president of Kazakhstan, (and will not do so). He did not say no (and will not do so). He will not say, "no, but..." either, or "yes". Sooner or later at some point he will say: "The Eurasian Union must be created." Somewhat later, at another point he will say: "By the will of the people who elected me I am, above all, the guarantor of the state sovereignty of Russia and therefore the Eurasian Union must not be created." Let all the voters and foreign politicians scratch their heads in bewilderment: What could it mean? It means nothing. There is simply no answer. After someone starts some kind of a union--a Eurasian, a Soviet, or even a Euroafrican one, then we will think of something. It appears that scientific terms this is called a reactive policy. Yeltsin rejected any policy based on his own initiative from the time when he understood that the promised sovereignty (as much as can be borne) was almost borne away. The question concerning the Union, however, is a serious one. Nazarbayev, as undoubtedly one of the most sober-minded and far-sighted politicians, raised it in a thought-out manner, guided by many reasons four of which appear to be the most important ones. First of all Mr. Nazarbayev understood that in his lifetime he would not be able to raise Kazakhstan to a level of material prosperity, and especially to any stellar levels, without Russia (or some other superpower)--that is unrealistic. Secondly the imperial memory of "democratic" Russia will not dissipate very soon--it is best to reunite than to inevitably drift toward an inevitable confrontation. Third, the "Russian question" (especially with the inability of Russia to resolve it not only in the near abroad but even on its own territory) sooner or later will create an "explosion" in Kazakhstan within its current artificial borders. Fourth, China is quite near to it--a few more years and the Moscow suzerain will appear as a kindly father compared to the Beijing uncle. In other words Nursultan Nazarbayev feels something that they do not even suspect in the Kremlin, or rather, they do suspect it but like a burnt child, dread the fire since it will be necessary to do some work, bear responsibility, and share power. Nursultan Nazarbayev realizes that in the next presidential elections in Russia, in Ukraine, in Belarus, and in Kazakhstan itself, and perhaps in a number of other republics of the former USSR, there will be politicians running, and in some cases winning, under the slogan of a peaceful recreation of the Union within reasonable boundaries and in reasonable forms, who simply cannot be classified as radicals, extremists, or even communists. It is absolutely clear, and Nazarbayev knows it, that under Yeltsin and Kravchuk in Ukraine no Union will be created(Belovezhskaya Pushcha syndrome). But Nazarbayev looks ahead, into the future not of specific presidents, but that of Kazakhstan and Russia. In the latter case--beyond the Kremlin. In addition to that, of course, Nazarbayev has good odds--he did not take part in the liquidation of the USSR and the proclamation of a sexless CIS out of its shapeless fragments and Alma-Ata, naturally, does not have its West Ukraine as does Kiev, nor a morbid thirst for power above which there is only God (for atheistically raised Yeltsin, there is not even that), as in the case of the president of Russia. It is characteristic that the talkative Moscow press greeted with virtually total silence a proposal by the president of a country which was recently accused by it of infringing on the rights of Russian voters in parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan. The silence of the Moscow press, just as the silence of the head of the Kremlin and of practically the entire Russian political Olympus, constitutes the inability and fear of honestly and openly responding to an issue which is becoming the main political issue for the country (which is becoming increasingly more evident): What is to be done with the wounded "affectionate and gentle beast"--the Union, still alive and ensconced in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha? Is it to be nursed back to health? Frankly finished off, or, whilst we bashfully look the other way, allowed to expire while at the same time we attempt to enter Europe. Perhaps directly into Western Europe? It is not necessary to answer that question, while limiting oneself to a secret strategy (for fools, which rather resembles a tactic) of chopping pieces off property of "fraternal republics" weakened more than Russia. Even the Bolsheviks did not conduct such a cynical policy--they were perhaps more aggressive, but also more honest: Whatever they could not swallow, whatever they could not claim on the basis of serious historical tradition of a state (Poland, Finland, Baltic states), they let go. There are two questions, however, which cannot be ignored: Russians outside the borders of current Russia and Russian soldiers perishing in the pacification of warring sides on foreign territories. Sooner or later these questions will have to be faced. The Kremlin remains silent. It is afraid to say yes. It is afraid to say no. It does not want to bring the Russians home (the economic indices are deteriorating) and cannot do so (it does not know how to achieve economic success even without them). But it will help support the increasingly nationalized organs of power of the sovereign nations, theatrically lamenting that there are few Russians over there and that everyone is compelled to speak the national language there. What language should the British parliament use--Japanese? Why then should the Ukrainian one use Russian? It is too bad that the Kremlin wall was not built by the ancestors along administrative borders of the RSFSR. It would have been simpler just to sit behind it.
