Samonte] [Text] Portfolio investments infused into the country by non- residents last year went up 298 percent to $2.257 billion from the previous year's $566 million. Latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures furnished BUSINESS WORLD also indicate an uptrend in new foreign equity infusions last year, which can be attributed primarily to the improving investment climate. Fresh foreign equity infusions into the country in 1993 climbed 42.7 percent to $334 million, from the previous year's level of $234 million. Almost half of the new foreign investments, or $43 million, financed projects undertaken via the build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme, the figures showed. Although a positive trend in foreign direct inflows was noted, the Philippines continued to pale against some Southeast Asian countries. Based on World Bank figures contained in a 1994 report on financial flows to Asian countries, the Philippines barely accounted for a tenth of net foreign direct investment flows to Indonesia in 1992. Save for Thailand, which experienced a slight investment drop in 1991 but had since posted positive strides, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia reported steady investment inflows since 1986. In 1992, foreign investments in China stood at $11.156 billion; Indonesia, $1.774 billion; Malaysia, $4.117 billion; Thailand, $2.115 billion; and the Philippines $228 million. The advocacy group Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) said foreign direct investments -- and not the net transfers in external debt -- are a better indicator of structural improvements in the country. "Recent researches in international trends suggest the flow of foreign direct investments have increasingly been responsive to structural factors such as the availability of an educated and highly skilled work force, market size, quality of infrastructure, and level of industrialization," it said. Arguing against what Finance Undersecretary Romeo L. Bernardo earlier heralded as a success in government's efforts to maintain the positive trend in the country's external debt situation, the FDC said the positive net transfers posted by the economy last year was mainly traced to the debt service reduction package under the Brady deal and the low interest rates then prevailing in the global markets. "The trend can turn out to be the reverse because no commensurate increase in direct foreign investments is apparent. It is also not clear how this flow of capital can be sustained in the medium-term, given that it is initially only a result of the recession in the United States and elsewhere," the FDC said.
