[Alfonso] "He expressed our solidarity and said we share in their sorrow at this sad and difficult moment that Central America [as heard] is experiencing following the (?tragedy) in Huila and Cauca. As you know, a series of tremors have rocked that area and have resulted in heavy damage. In his letter, the commander in chief expresses to President Gaviria our feelings of fraternal understanding and adds that we share in their sorrow. At the same time, he says the Cuban Government is ready to send, at a moment's notice, an 18-person unit including doctors and technicians who are trained in this type of situation. The commander in chief has placed this unit at the disposal of the Colombian authorities should they need it." I must add that the Cuban Public Health Ministry has formed the unit. Through its spokesman, the Cuban Foreign Ministry also expressed its pleasure with the recent statements by various international organizations regarding the lifting of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. Miguel Alfonso spoke, in particular, of Resolution 356 approved by the SELA [Latin American Economic System] Council. [Alfonso] "This resolution is significant because it is the first time that SELA has approved a resolution directly rejecting something. As you know, SELA is an economic organization and all Latin American countries are members of this organization which Cuba helped found in 1970. This resolution, a copy of which you will receive shortly, not only supports the recent resolution issued by the UN General Assembly [UNGA] -- as you know, the UNGA approved its resolution in November -- but it also strongly urges the United States to lift the economic, commercial, and financial blockade on Cuba." Likewise, Miguel Alfonso talked about the two paragraphs of the final declaration issued by the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] ministerial meeting held in Cairo, Egypt. [Alfonso] "Paragraph 161 strongly urges the expeditious and efficient implementation of the resolution that was approved not only in [words indistinct] but also in 1992 by the UNGA regarding the U.S. blockade of Cuba. ``There is another paragraph [words indistinct] in which the NAM foreign ministers call on the developed countries to put an end to the generic implementation of all the unilateral coercive measures against developing countries. ``I believe it is important we view this within a single context. These are not isolated things. The Cuban Foreign Ministry has observed that the international community is more frequently repudiating this measure which for more than 30 years has been affecting not only the economy but also the human rights of the Cuban people.'' Alfonso also talked about the various lobbying actions conducted on Thursday by several U.S. congressmen, academicians, politicians, and members of nongovernmental organizations in favor of the lifting of the blockade. [Alfonso] "I believe that the most important of these actions was the discussion of Cuba held in the U.S. Congress, specially in the U.S. Senate amphitheater. They talked about the situation the blockade creates for Cuba. The people who organized the day for lobbying in the United States had planned to hold approximately 35 meetings with U.S. congressmen, senators and members of the House of Representatives, to explain to them the impact the blockade has on Cuba and the need to adopt legislative and other measures to ensure that the blockade becomes something of the past." In responding to several questions asked by reporters, Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, talked about recent statements made by the Honduran foreign minister, which were favorable for Cuba. [Alfonso] "We have been seeing a series of reactions lately and it has become evident that it is no longer true that Cuba is isolated or that it is a country that cannot muster support and understanding from other countries. These reactions are coming not only from countries in the area, but from outside the continent as well." Alfonso was also asked to appraise the meaning of the possibility that the Canadian Government will lift its embargo on Cuba. [Alfonso] "We have learned that the Canadian Government will formally announce it will renew the aid it stopped a few years ago. This is significant because Cuba is confronting an economic situation and it does not take a genius to see that it is a difficult economic situation. This decision will contribute to improving the standard of living of the Cuban people. All aid to Cuba is very welcome." These were some of the statements made by Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, during a meeting with the local and foreign media.
