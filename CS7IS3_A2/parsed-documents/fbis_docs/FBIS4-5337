In a letter to the U.S. President on the situation of the Korean peninsula, representatives of the front said the U.S. concern over the possibility of "nuclear arms development" by North Korea was a flamboyant hypocrisy. The letter said: "The `nuclear issue' of Korea must be resolved peacefully only through a fair dialogue, not by pressure, military threat or economic `sanctions.' "The U.S. Government and Congress must abandon such dangerous games as the provocation of a new war."
