The head of the Russian foreign political department recalled that Russia had put forward a proposal to convene a multilateral conference on the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, and it is currently being debated along with other ideas. There is a proposal to introduce sanctions. We believe that, unfortunately, this can happen but this would be an extremely unfavorable turn of events, as much as the DPRK's complete break with the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the Russian minister said. That is why, he continued, we propose to hold a conference so that one does not have to resort to these extreme measures, although, of course, the situation is very alarming and the announcement of the DPRK leaving the IAEA is a highly negative event. I must say, Kozyrev added, that IAEA guarantees are enshrined in the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and not in an agreement with the IAEA itself. I do not think that everything has already been lost and hope that the door is still ajar. That is why we think that the conference might give an opportunity to all its participants, including the DPRK, to find a better solution than the decision to break the nonproliferation regime, which will make confrontation with the world community unavoidable.
