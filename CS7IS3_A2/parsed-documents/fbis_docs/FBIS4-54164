The poll's outcome showed that the Hata Cabinet gained a 51.6-percent approval rating, the fourth highest approval rating following the Hosokawa, Tanaka, and Miyazawa cabinets. Meanwhile, the outcome of the poll showed a 34.2-percent disapproval rating of the Hata Cabinet. Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet, the surveyed said: "The Hata Cabinet appears to be intending to do something new," or "the Hata Cabinet is better than the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinets." Explaining reasons for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, more than of 40 percent said: "The prime minister holds no real power" or "the Hata cabinet is unstable." In this way, many of the polled revealed their criticism of influence wielded by Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN undertook an emergency telephone opinion poll in late April right after the Hata Cabinet was inaugurated. The poll at the time showed a 56.8 percent approval rating of the Hata Cabinet. The latest poll was conducted as part of the YOMIURI SHIMBUN'S regular monthly poll. According to past polls on cabinets conducted shortly after their inauguration, the Hosokawa Cabinet gained a 71.9-percent approval rating in the September 1993 poll, the Tanaka cabinet won a 60.5-percent approval rating in the October 1992 poll, and the Miyazawa cabinet gained a 60.5-percent approval rating in the November 1991 poll. As a result, the Hata Cabinet's approval rating in the latest poll is the fourth highest following the rating of three successive cabinets. The Hata Cabinet's approval rating is the seventh highest compared to the approval rating of all cabinets, far exceeding the 49 percent approval rating of the Suzuki Cabinet in the September 1980 poll. Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet, 36 percent of the polled said, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be intending to do something new"; 32 percent said, "The Hata cabinet is better that the LDP cabinets"; 30 percent said, "The Hata cabinet is eager for political and economic reforms"; and 25 percent saying, "The prime minister is trustworthy." Explaining reasons for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, 42 percent of the surveyed stated, "The prime minister holds no real power"; 41 percent stated, "the Hata Cabinet is unstable"; and 32 percent stating, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be doing nothing." Looking at the Hata Cabinet's approval rating by sex, 54 percent of the females surveyed approved of the cabinet while 49 percent of the males approved, showing the same ratio given to the Hosokawa and Kaifu Cabinets. Looking at the support rating by party, 26 percent of the polled supported the LDP; 11 percent Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 7 percent the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]; and 3 percent the Japan New Party, Komeito, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. The Japan New Party, which once had the second highest support rating following the LDP, suffered a sharp fall in the support rating after Mr. Hosokawa resigned as prime minister and one legislator after another have quit the party. The SDPJ, which backed out of the ruling coalition, suffered a minor fall in its support rating from the previous poll without increasing its rating. Shinseito and the LDP increased 1 percentage point in their support rating from the previous poll.
