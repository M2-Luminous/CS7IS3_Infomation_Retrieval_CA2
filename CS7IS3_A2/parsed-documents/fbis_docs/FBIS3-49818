Under Abdic's leadership Moslems from the Cazin Krajina declared the autonomous province of western Bosnia in September last year in defiance of Izetbegovic's war option. They urged for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which broke out in April 1992, to be solved through negotiations with Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats with whom Abdic signed seperate peace accords. The fiercest fighting is reported by local Moslem media of the Cazin Krajina to be going on around Trsce and Trzacka Rastela, places taken three days ago by the Abdic forces. The autonomous province agency ZBIA reports that Izetbegovic forces have launched an all-out attack but that they cannot penetrate the lines held by the Abdic forces and have therefore sent several sabotage and terrorist groups to try to get into Velika Kladusa, the political center of the province, and arrest Abdic. The agency reports that one of the groups was eliminated in the vicinity of Todorovo, by Velika Kladusa.
