The Archangel Oblast Environment Protection Committee is suing the cosmodrome for 1.2 billion rubles over the detachable stages of launch vehicles that have been falling down for many years near the coastal village of Koyda carrying remains of fuel. The case was examined by the arbitration court, which agreed with the arguments of representatives of the space industry that the amount of economic damage suffered by the territory should be calculated more thoroughly. It has been decided to have an independent inquiry.
