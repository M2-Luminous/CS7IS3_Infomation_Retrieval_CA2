Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, confirms in talks with VREME that the development of events in Bosnia directly influenced his decision to travel to Pale. [Djindjic] We had an agreement in principle even earlier to discuss with the leaders of the republic of Srpska the forming of the Democratic Party in this territory. When the ultimatum was declared, it seemed to us natural to go to Pale and thus express our solidarity with the people in the republic of Srpska. [Komlenovic] How was your idea on the founding of the party accepted in Pale, and what else was discussed? [Djindjic] We agreed not to found the party until the war is over. We agreed that the forming of a real political party in the territory of the republic of Srpska at this moment could mean disloyal competition with the Serbian Democric Party [SDS] along with the danger of creating confusion among the members of this organization, which, because of the conditions under which it operates, resembles more a blend of a national movement and the state administration than a political party. In addition to this, we discussed the future government system and relations between political parties in Serbia and the government leadership of the republic of Srpska. We wanted to introduce a little relaxation in relations and bring into question the monopoly of the Socialist Party of Serbia in relation to the Serbs in Bosnia, which, it seems to me, is suffocating them somewhat. Anyhow, if the SDS were a political party in the traditional sense, I do not believe that it would be close to the Socialist Party of Serbia -- communist and socialist ideas are not popular among the people of the republic of Srpska. On the other hand, the mention of the republic of Srpska spurs nonconfidence in some opposition circles in Belgrade. We want to establish correct relations with the SDS and to lay a foundation for our future cooperation. [Komlenovic] The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, did not miss a single opportunity to express unreserved support for Milosevic on the eve of the elections, in spite of frequent attempts by the opposition to ingratiate themselves with him -- it is sufficient to mention the support of the Democratic Party of Serbia when the Vance-Owen plan was rejected or Seselj's aid in suppressing the military uprising in Banja Luka. Have you seen any additional reliable indication that Pale's views on the political scene in Serbia may be changing? [Djindjic] I think that something is changing. Before the last elections the leadership of the SDS and the republic of Srpska did not explicitly support the SPS. The support of Serbs from Bosnia was up to now addressed to Milosevic as a candidate for the president of Serbia and not to his party. The problem is that many opppsition parties in the republic of Srpska have the reputation of being unpatriotic. We wanted to destroy exactly this thesis and show that radical demagogy and crude language are not a proof of patriotism, that national interests can successfully be protected by the policy of peace, and that the division into "patriotic" and "unpatriotic" parties is not justified. There are no unpatriotic parties in Serbia. Anyhow, we differ both in our presentation and party mentality from the political organizations which had previously been coming to visit the republic of Srpska, but our interlocutors (we talked with Mr. Karadzic and 15 people from the political and military leadership) told us that no one has been received as well as out delegation thus far. Eight hours of conversation in a single day must mean something. [Komlenovic] It is increasingly heard in public that the diplomatic action in connection with the NATO ultimatum and the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from positions around Sarajevo, represent, in fact, Milosevic's defeat. Is it also your impression that Karadzic has slowly started to become independent in relation to Milosevic? [Djindjic] Of course. Maybe this should not be interpreted as a Milosevic's defeat but as a process of maturation: The republic of Srpska does not need a guardian. The greater the pressure of Milosevic and the FRY on the Bosnian Serbs, the greater the pressure of the international community on the parent state. Thus, by making Milosevic and Yugoslavia move away from their present diplomatic positions, the need for additional pressure on the Serbs will decrease and the economic blockade will become meaningless, which is good. It would be best if Milosevic would declare that he is withdrawing from the Geneva peace negotiations. Thus, it would be clearly shown that Yugoslavia is not involved in the conflict in Bosnia and that the republic of Srpska can represent its interests alone. [Komlenovic] At the beginning you said that you spoke with Radovan Karadzic on the future setup of the state. Whose state? [Djindjic] We agreed that the republic of Srpska should be joined to Serbia. A transitional solution should be found, and everything should be carried out with the consent of the international community, which I think will not oppose this option if peace is concluded. Thus, we talked about the future setup of the joint state, which should not be burdened with the ideological dogmas of socialist bureaucracy. Our common assessment is that this state should be parliamentary and democratic. I emphasize that we would be more moderate than our interlocutors as regards the time frame for changing the ideology.
