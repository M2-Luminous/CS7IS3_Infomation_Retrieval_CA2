[Hupka] Its first president was a native Pomeranian, the second was a Sudeten German, and I, the third, am a Silesian. The foundation is governed by Article 96 of the Expellees Union, which states that the expellees' cultural heritage should be documented, cultivated, and kept alive in an ongoing process. It is often said that the year 1945 was "year zero" for the Germans, that some new process began at that time. I do not hold that view. The expellees carried with them invisible baggage of their own culture. It is our task to keep that culture alive. We are not interested in preserving it in museums, and we do not deal exclusively with the past. Among other things, the foundation organizes competitions for the best short stories and academic dissertations that deal with the present time and look into the future. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Apart from organizing lectures on the architectural heritage in Poland, do you also envisage helping financially to restore cultural heritage sites? [Hupka] Of course, money is needed if we are to save such places as, for instance, Lubiaz Castle from falling into ruin. But first and foremost we are concerned about making everyone aware of the importance of this cultural heritage site and informing the public about its present condition. We could mobilize financial assistance through well-planned joint action. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Many such sites in Poland suffered neglect in the past decades, but we must not forget that the most extensive damage to material and intellectual cultural goods was done by and during the war. Is the concern that Germans show over these goods now an attempt at atonement? [Hupka] Perhaps we should formulate this problem differently. For us, the originating force behind our action is the Polish-German good-neighbor treaty, which, among other things, obliges Poles and Germans to assume joint responsibility for goods representing cultural heritage. Jan Jozef Lipski was aware of this obligation when he wrote: "The principal duty is to prevent deterioration and destruction of material objects of cultural heritage. To tolerate and allow their deterioration, to undervalue their cultural significance only because they do not belong to `our' culture, or to attempt to `erase' their German origin is to show Polish patriotism in a very unfavorable light." So our concern for these goods is not some kind of atonement on our part, as you suggested, but attests to our determination to put into practice the provisions of the Polish-German treaty. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Before the treaty was signed, the Expellees Union protested against it very strongly. Have you by now accepted its provisions on good-neighborly relations and inviolability of the existing borders? [Hupka] Once a treaty is signed by both sides, it must be respected. It must be acknowledged, recognized, and accepted. We are all opposed to the sort of thing that is currently happening in Yugoslavia and to the ethnic cleansing taking place there. In the same way, I am opposed to the idea of expelling people from their homeland. Let me recall here the words spoken by Vaclav Havel, who said that the expulsion of the Germans was not an act of squaring accounts for the wrongs suffered but one of revenge. It is my wish to see Poles and Germans jointly condemn the expulsion of the Germans as a criminal act. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] But was not the war that led to it the ultimate crime? [Hupka] Of course, the war was a crime perpetrated against us all by Hitler and Stalin. Nevertheless, you must remember that the invasion of France and Belgium was a crime, too, yet no one was expelled from those territories. One crime should not generate another. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Do the expellees want to return here? [Hupka] The right to one's homeland and to self-determination is a recognized right and, as such, should be respected. Once Poland has become a member of the European Union, everyone will be able to decide where they want to settle. The problem will automatically cease to exist. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Is this why Germans are so eager to see Poland join the European Union? [Hupka] We are all Europeans. We cannot place Poles lower than the Danes, or any other nation. Everyone in Europe should belong to the Union, and there are no hidden agendas in what I am saying. However, some people in Germany, just as in Poland, are opposed to the idea of "accelerated" integration. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] People in Poland associate your name unequivocally with revisionism. However, for some time now your utterances have seemed to acquire a more conciliatory tone. Does this mean that you are changing your views? [Hupka] We have never been advocates of revanchism. I have not changed, nor have I ever expressed anti-Polish sentiments. It was just that my views were presented and interpreted by others in that way for the past 40 years. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] How do you like what you see in Polish Silesia nowadays? Have you noted any changes for the better in recent years? [Hupka] This is my fifth visit here since 1990. Of course, many things have changed for the better. But I should say that things are still not changing fast enough. It could be that this assessment is colored by my temperament. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] What do you think of the recent incident provoked by skinheads in Dziewkowice or the disruption of the celebrations commemorating the 3 May Constitution and the Silesian uprisings, which happened recently at St. Anna's Mount? [Hupka] We are, of course, very critical of these incidents. We call such phenomena nationalism and chauvinism, but we do not generalize their occurrence and claim that they represent a specifically Polish trait. Those people are simply extremists. We are equally opposed to similar things happening in Germany now, such as attacks against the Turks, and we would not like these phenomena to be generalized and held against all Germans, either. We want to bring down barriers, not erect new ones. [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Thank you for talking with us.
