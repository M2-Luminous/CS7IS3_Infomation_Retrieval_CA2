They generated a tidal wave of optimism about the future of international relations. Fervent talk about a rapidly changing world was the order of the day when we entered the present decade. However, little was done to determine and shape the dynamics and scope of the change. It was, more or less, taken for granted that it would turn out to be for the better. This did not prove to be the case. Accordingly, the creation of a new and desirable international system continues to top the political agenda as the most challenging task of our times. The erosion by armed conflicts at the regional level of the global security edifice, is the most urgent threat which we have to confront and to overcome. For, without mutually reinforcing regional orders of peace and stability, we cannot put together the building-blocks of collective security on the world scale. Europe's new security framework has to be conceived under an umbrella of a strengthened world organization. The interlocking institutions making up Europe's post-Cold War security architecture have, to date, achieved no apparent success. However, it would be unfair to blame the conceptual blueprint for their failure. Without an adequate supply of fuel in terms of political will on the part of its members, no organization can make substantial headway towards realizing its aims. Had the requisite political will not been in short supply, these institutions could have done a lot within the scope of the mandates provided to them by the CSCE and the UN on several instances during the recent years in connection with some of the ongoing crises. Recent events and developments prove that little can be done to prevent a further deterioration of the security situation in the Euro-Atlantic area if the full weight of NATO's capability and assets are not brought to bear on conflict-prevention, effective crisis-management and peacemaking. NATO's role should not be confined to declaring readiness for support to peacekeeping. NATO should act in the name of the international community, when mandated by the UN or the CSCE, for repelling aggression and rolling back the territorial and other consequences alone or in coalition with extra-alliance countries or organizations. Moreover, NATO should take the lead in negotiating and "extracting" the mandates required to execute such functions. The surest way to conflict-prevention is for the international community to be able to suppress adventurism before it widens. We think that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) may serve as a vehicle for promoting a new cooperative order among its participating states by dealing with specific issues as outlined in its work plan. Turkey's approach to security rests on the principle of its indivisibility. In this respect, we consider the formula "Partnership for Peace" as feasible and relevant to the present transitional period. Under this formula, the cooperation and relationship encompassing all the European, Caucasian and Central Asian states will certainly be enhanced. Such an arrangement holds more far reaching opportunities than the NACC. While NATO remains vital for European security, the CSCE, as a complementary organization, will share the role of improving and maintaining stability on the continent. The CSCE will continue, as a larger frame, to play a major role in the future architecture of Europe together with other international organizations such as NATO, NACC, the European Union, the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. A European society rooted in a pluralistic democratic system of governments that unites our peoples through common ideals and principles should be the goal to achieve. The challenge of further spreading and consolidating democracy, making sure that the contemporary norms of international behavior are respected, and, to that end, the adaptation of the global and regional organizations to the needs of our times, top our list of priorities. We have witnessed how fragile the sense of freedom which comes from throwing off totalitarian rule has turned out to be. It is now once again admitted that building democracy is a difficult task. We should all engage ourselves more tangibly and generously in the efforts of the post-communist countries aimed at transforming themselves into genuine democracies. In order that the top priority of propagating democracy may be achieved, a series of challenges have to be grappled with simultaneously. In this context, I should also mention the need to strengthen preventive diplomacy, to curb excessive arms transfers, to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to combat terrorism more effectively. The North Atlantic alliance has been in the forefront in adapting itself to the post-Cold War environment. In fact, this process of rapid adaptation started following the sweeping changes during 1988 in the CSCE countries. NATO took on board bold and far reaching decisions at its Copenhagen and London meetings with a view to responding adequately to the challenges. The search for a new role and for joining arms with our former adversaries took a distinctive shape at the NATO summit held in Rome in November 1991 with the adoption of the alliance's new strategic concept. The creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) at the first NACC ministerial in December 1991 coincided with the demise of the Soviet Union and with the appearance of new partners on the international scene. These new partners gained their long sought but hardly expected independence and sovereignty in a very short span of time. The North Atlantic alliance and individual allies tried their best in helping our new partners to overcome the difficult period of transition and state building. Both the expertise of each allied country as well as financial resources have been made available to our partners. NACC has been instrumental in this process. It not only provided them with a forum for intense consultation on security related issues and for solving potential crises but also devised tangible programs for cooperation on key topics. NACC work programs developed with the participation of all partners have made substantial contributions by addressing important specific needs of our partners like defense conversion, peacekeeping, crisis management, information exchange and access to NATO science programs. The alliance at its last Brussels Summit adopted the Partnership for Peace (PFP) concept and invited all NACC partners as well as other CSCE countries willing and able to contribute to the program to join it in a new and qualitatively enhanced form of partnership. Up to date, 20 countries signed the PFP framework document and displayed in unequivocal terms their determination to benefit from this new form of partnership and cooperation. Others are expected to join in the coming weeks. PFP with its non-discriminatory approach to all potential partners, yet providing room for self-differentiation, is suitable for all. Furthermore, presentation documents to be presented by partners and individual partnership documents to be prepared jointly by the partner concerned and the alliance make this new program flexible enough to meet the specific needs and capabilities of each partner. This basic feature of the PFP should be preserved and no special status or privileged position should be accorded at the outset to any prospective partner. The pace and intensity of the cooperation with each partner within the framework of the PFP will largely depend on the capability and willingness of the partner concerned. Thus the relations between each partner and the alliance will undoubtedly have specific features. In this era of interlocking institutions it will be futile to try to evaluate contributions of several European and Transatlantic institutions. Each played its fair share in the post-Cold War configuration. The European Union, the EU and the CSCE made substantial contributions. Nonetheless, one can easily assert that NATO, with its unique capabilities and its integrated structure, has been on the forefront in extending its hand of friendship to our partners. It has also been first to set up new mechanisms geared towards enhanced cooperation like the NACC and the PFP. Times of change are fraught with new challenges and uncertainties. The world order as defined by the parameters of the Cold War has disappeared. The international community is faced with a new type of security challenge as witnessed in the former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. Ethnic tensions and long suppressed animosities resurfaced. It is very difficult, if not impossible to argue that the international community and its institutions, be it the UN, NATO or the European Union, have shown the necessary resolve and determination in the face of these new challenges in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan. In both cases the international community has let the aggressors go unpunished and capitalize on their gains, achieved through invasion, murders, rape, "ethnic cleansing." When use of force was necessary, the international community shied away from employing it until when it was too late. Thus the credibility of all international organizations from the UN to NATO to CSCE has been enormously eroded. Potential aggressors drew their lessons. They now believe that "aggression pays" They have seen that the international community can enter into futile debate and sit back and let the territorial integrity and even the sovereignty of its fellow members like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan be trampled upon. The stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those related to the survival of the Bosnian state and its people. They include the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic and religious warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic state invalidates this hope, and with it the fundamental principal of the Western institutions. If we allow aggression and adventurism to get away with the crimes they have committed in Bosnia, the post-Cold War disorder may worsen. Should Bosnia fail, not only the Balkans, but the whole of Europe will bear the bitter aftereffects. Another destabilizing development is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Huge amounts of conventional arms deliveries to some specific areas and countries is yet another source of instability, at least for their neighbors. Nevertheless, the interdependent world we live in does not permit us the luxury of closing our doors to the outside world and living peacefully in our affluent societies. Any crisis is bound to affect us eventually. Turkey, located in an unstable region, feels this threat perhaps more imminently than others. Finally, the ever-increasing gap between the South and North is another potential source of instability, the effects of which are being felt by mass migration and by the problems inherent in it. If the international community has the political will and acts accordingly, these negative trends could be reversed in medium to long term. However, we should shed away the present inertia and refrain from putting undue emphasis on petty internal bickering. A European security architecture is beginning to emerge. It should be based on the long cherished principle of interlocking institutions in which all actors will have important roles. Nonetheless, the international community needs to be more aware than it is today of the problems of peace and security in a turbulent world. It needs the political will to confront the dangers and the determination to acquire the necessary institutional and financial resources, or to put into use the existing unique capabilities of the North Atlantic alliance. It goes without saying that NATO will need a clear mandate from the UN and/or the CSCE for non-article "V" contingencies. Partnership and cooperation between all security related institutions are vital to safeguard common interests. Tolerance, cooperation, solidarity, non-discrimination and an equitable sharing of responsibilities and burdens must be the cornerstones of a system based an the principles of the UN charter and the Helsinki Final Act. NATO is needed and able to address the new security challenges. - It must provide security and stability in a world that has become more unstable. - It must prevent, manage and resolve crises and conflicts. - It must prevent Europe from sliding back into renationalization and fragmentation and into the destructive logic of alliances and counter-alliances. - It must enhance its cooperation with its new partners. - It must keep transatlantic relations working smoothly and effectively. - It must ensure the effective implementation of existing arms control agreements and the full compliance to their provisions by all parties. None of these challenges can be met without the alliance. First, the transatlantic relationship is the most stable geopolitical asset in the world. It brings together two principal centers of democracy and liberalism. A more stable world cannot be achieved without an alliance of these power centers. Our partners turn to NATO because of their appreciation that NATO and only NATO can provide the stability they need. Second, regarding the need for effective management of major conflicts, diplomacy is deemed to fail if it is not backed by a powerful politico-military instrument. Needless to say that NATO needs the joint political will of its members to act. However, once the political will is there, there is no other effective instrument than NATO. Third, one of the effective achievements of NATO has been to put an end to the centuries-old habit of European power politics by providing an Atlantic framework. By contrast, the dissolution of the alliance and the disengagement of the United States could undermine the European integration process. This would be damaging not only for the allies on both sides of the Atlantic, but would also gravely affect the political and economic transition of partner countries. Fourth, NATO provides the key forum for coordinating and harmonizing transatlantic policies in the broadest sense. This role should be maintained and enhanced. Finally, NATO is the only mechanism to deal with new challenges, as these challenges exceed the capabilities of any single nation.
