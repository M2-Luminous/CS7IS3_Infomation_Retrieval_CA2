In a comment published today, the newspaper noted that Rabin announced he had never said anything about Israel's readiness to withdraw from all the territories of the Syrian Golan Heights if Damascus agrees to reach a comprehensive peace with the Jewish state. During the negotiation rounds in Washington, Rabin repeated this promise over and over again. The newspaper adds that on the Israeli-Palestinian track, Rabin has also issued threats and warnings, sometimes convincing and at other times flagrant, even after implementation of the first stage of the autonomy agreement between the PLO and Israel started. The newspaper explained that as regards Lebanon, the Security Council issued Resolution 425, which stipulated the need for the Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon. In addition, despite the fact that negotiations between the two sides started in Washington and officially still exist, Israeli attacks on Lebanon continue. In fact, they have reached the stage where Israeli commandos kidnapped a southern Lebanese leader from his home publicly and with eyewitnesses to testify. Concluding its comment, AL-AKHBAR stated that the Israeli practices confirm that all Israel's claims and promises regarding peace with the Arabs are nothing more than illusions and whims.
