After the heads of the state governments were unable to reach a joint solution last night, Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (SPD) decided in Wiesbaden to take this step. Kurdish offenders were to be excluded from the deportation ban, the Hesse Interior Ministry said. The reason given by Guenther was that the situation of the Kurds in Turkey had deteriorated to such an extent that no responsibility could be assumed for the possible consequences of deportation. Guenther said the efforts of the German Government to make Turkey comply with human rights by means of a bilateral agreement were increasing doubts that deportees were at present dependent on the whim of government organs. Guenther called on the Federal Government to exert pressure on the Turkish Government to at last find a constructive, humanitarian solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey.
