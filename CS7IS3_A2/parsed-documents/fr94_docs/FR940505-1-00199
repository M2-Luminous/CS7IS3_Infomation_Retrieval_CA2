FR940505-1-00199 FR940505-1-00012 Previous analysis of the episodes was used to establish ``across-the-board'' reduction targets of 40 percent VOC and 40 percent NO X from a 1987 emissions baseline in order to attain the ozone standard. This translates to emission targets of 57 tpd VOC and 46 tpd NO X , which are used as the basis of the attainment demonstration provided in paragraph III.H.5. of this NPRM. EPA plans, however, to significantly improve the attainment demonstration included in the final FIP notice. These improvements are discussed in the technical support document, and include reevaluation of the base-year emission estimates, modeling and attainment targets by the VCAPCD and its contractor, Alpine Geophysics, partially funded by grants from EPA. When performance of the model is considered to meet Guideline criteria, the model will be used to project air quality in the year 2005, including the effect of various SIP and FIP control strategies. The results of this analysis will be used to reevaluate the amount of VOC and NO X reductions needed from each source category to demonstrate attainment. In addition, previous analysis has indicated that pollutant transport occurred from the South Coast Air Basin to Ventura during the September 5&hyph;7 episode. EPA is supporting, through grant funds to the SCAQMD, a study of the impact of the transport from the South Coast Air Basin to Ventura County. (c) South Coast ozone. The South Coast Air Basin was classified as an ``Extreme'' ozone area, based on the design value of 0.33 ppm recorded at the Glendora monitoring site. The attainment demonstration for South Coast is based on the air quality modeling performed by the SCAQMD in 1991, potentially enhanced by the addition of several additional ozone episodes. The SCAQMD's 1991 modeling covered three episodes (June 1985, August 1987 and June 1987). Based on that effort, ``across-the-board'' reductions of VOC and NO X of 90 percent and 70 percent respectively were determined to be sufficient to attain the ozone standard. More recently, several modifications have been made to the original modeling effort, including raising the height of the top of the modeling grid, expanding the domain to the east to encompass the entire non-attainment area, and lowering the level of pollutants entering the domain through the top boundary of the model. These changes will be incorporated into the 1994 SIP modeling efforts and the FIP attainment demonstration. In addition, the possibility of modeling three new episodes is being explored (July 13&hyph;15, 1987, September 7&hyph;9, 1987, and October 7&hyph;9, 1992). The September 7&hyph;9, 1987 episode represents meteorological conditions conducive to high ozone in Orange County. The October 7&hyph;9, 1992 episode is a weekend episode. The performance of the additional episodes is being evaluated and improvements are being made. However, the performance may not be adequate in time for the final FIP attainment demonstration. In case the additional episodes do not meet Guideline performance criteria, the final FIP attainment demonstration will be based on the original three episodes. The 1991 modeling effort, updated to include the model improvements as well as additional episodes, if warranted, will provide the base case for the final FIP attainment demonstration. (d) South Coast CO. The South Coast Air Basin was classified as a ``Serious'' area for CO, based on a design value of 23.4 ppm measured in 1988 at the Lynwood site. More recent data (1991&hyph;1992) indicate a lower design value of 16.4 ppm. In preparing the 1992 CO SIP attainment demonstration, the SCAQMD selected a December 5&hyph;7, 1989 episode for modeling because this episode included the first and second highest 8-hour average CO concentrations for the years 1989&hyph;1990: 21.75 ppm and 18.3 ppm. High 8-hour CO concentrations often occur during periods of high emissions, low wind speeds, and poor vertical dispersion (e.g. a temperature inversion). The CO modeling for the FIP proposal is based on the April 29, 1993 correction to the November 1992 CO SIP. The hot-spot modeling, which predicts high CO concentrations at intersections, was performed using the CAL3QHC model at four intersections. For the 2000 attainment year, the traffic volume used was the same as that used for 1989, based on the assumption that the traffic at the most heavily travelled intersections had reached a maximum and could not be increased. The results of the base case episode areawide and hot-spot modeling are shown in the table below.

The air quality for the year 2000 was predicted, using the UAM with the projected emission inventory and meteorological conditions from the selected episode. The projected air quality, displayed in the table below, shows that the NAAQS of 9 ppm would be attained at all sites based on the application of three control measures and considering the combined impact of the areawide and hot-spot modeling results.
