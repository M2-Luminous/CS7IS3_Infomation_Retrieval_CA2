You are now welcome to raise your questions. [China Central Television Station correspondent] I am from China Central Television Station. Chairman Raidi has just briefed us on Tibet's economic development. My question is: Other than relying on the assistance of the central government and fraternal provinces and municipalities, how will Tibet duly speed up its development to narrow the gap with coastal areas at the earliest possible date? Thank you. [Gyaincain Norbu] Regarding the question of how to speed up Tibet's economic development in order to narrow the gap with fraternal provinces and municipalities, I think the entire party and country should consider the overall interests -- seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, accelerating development, and maintaining stability. Tibet should also serve these overall interests in carrying out its future tasks. Guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the party's basic line, we should continue to thoroughly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and focus on the goal of fostering a socialist market economy so as to expedite reform and development and to maintain stability. To accelerate reform, we recently introduced measures to separate profits and taxes delivered by state-owned enterprises in farming and pastoral areas, as well as measures to reform the social insurance, investment, and public housing systems. These measures have injected great vitality into development. On the question of development, I think we should mainly carry out the following three tasks: 1) We should maintain the status of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation of the national economy and strive for more bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry this year. 2) We should nurture new factors for economic growth. We should concentrate on developing processing industries, foreign trade, tertiary industries, and village and town enterprises. 3) We should continue to develop the energy, transportation, and communications sectors; education; science and technology; and key infrastructure projects. We have set our future economic growth rate at 8 percent. To attain this goal, we should deepen reform and accelerate the pace of development. To this end, we should consolidate and build upon political stability and unity and create a good social environment for reform, opening up, and economic development. Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region. More than 2.3 million people of all nationalities across the region should redouble their efforts to realize the goal of accelerating Tibet's development and usher in the occasion with practical actions. [Sprinkle, in English fading into Mandarin translation] James Sprinkle of THE TIMES of London. It is widely known that... [sentence incomplete as heard] This person is the Dalai Lama of Tibet. However, in the introduction Chairman Raidi gave just now, he did not mention this Tibetan, the Dalai Lama. I would like to ask what is the status of the Dalai Lama now? How is he regarded by the Tibetan? How are the talks going? [Raidi] Certainly, every Tibetan knows about the Dalai Lama. He has been living in exile since 1959 when he took part in a rebellion and fled, and he has since been engaged in activities aimed at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear all along: He must abandon his stance on the independence of Tibet and he is welcome to return home to contribute to the country's construction. [China Radio International correspondent] I am a correspondent of China Radio International. I would like to ask Chairman Raidi about inter-ethnic relations -- relations between Tibetan and Han peoples, in particular -- in Tibet. [Raidi] Inter-ethnic relations in Tibet refer mainly to the relations between Tibetan and Han people. Tibetan and Han people have lived in peace and harmony and enjoyed equality since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951. Over the past four decades or more since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan and Han people have forged profound friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet. They have developed a new form of unbreakable socialist inter-ethnic relations. Thus they share a common fate, and can never be separated from each other. In spite of the effects of the Cultural Revolution and the all- out efforts in recent years by separatists to sow dissension among the various nationalities and to sabotage national unity -- the troubles they stirred have had some effects on national unity in Tibet -- taken together, unity, fraternity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance remain the main features of Han-Tibetan relations today. In the long history of revolution and construction in Tibet, events have repeatedly show that Han-Tibetan unity serves as a precondition and guarantee for the smooth progress and advancement of all undertakings in Tibet. Any acts aimed at sabotaging national unity are doomed to failure. In my view, this new type of inter-ethnic relations will be developed and consolidated as the policy of reform and opening up deepens in Tibet, the economy continues to grow, and living standards improve. Certainly, some people say the relations between Tibetan and Han people are terrible, that Han people dare not come to Tibet, or that Han people are being killed on sight. Nothing of the sort! Let me cite an example. Transportation in Tibet depends entirely -- 80 to 90 percent at least -- on motor transportation. The Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways are thousands of kilometers long. Sometimes cars on these highways break down, leaving some Han drivers helpless. When spotted by Tibetan people, the Han drivers have been invited to Tibetan homes and have been served [word indistinct] tea and zanba [roasted barley, a staple food of the Tibetans]. Do you know what these Han comrades say? My goodness, the Tibetan comrades are really nice. As for occasional quarreling and bickering, I believe you can find such problems in any society. Quarreling and bickering do exist. Taken as a whole, however, the relations are good. [(Huang Jikuan)] Taiwan CNA correspondent (Huang Jikuan). I have a question for [Regional Party] Secretary Chen [Kuiyuan]. Developing the economy is an important way of solving the problems of minority nationalities in Tibet. In the course of establishing a market economy, what obstacles does Tibet need to remove, and what advantages can it bring into play? Following the First Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the Eighth CPPCC National Committee last year, you led a delegation to visit various coastal provinces. Do you plan to do so this year? Thank you! [Chen Kuiyuan] Tibet is a remote region of China. Due to historical reasons and its unique geographical location, the region faces grave obstacles in developing the economy. First and foremost, the region is located 4,000 meters above sea level. A lack of oxygen high in the mountains makes it very difficult for people to carry out productive activities and economic exchanges. Meanwhile, as a result of the backward nature of its economy in the past and a weak transport and energy infrastructure, the region's industrial foundations and capabilities are lagging far behind other fraternal provinces and regions. Moreover, Tibet also lacks technology and scientific and technological personnel. Hence, during the socialist modernization drive, Tibet faces more obstacles than other provinces and regions. A very important condition for developing the economy is to open up markets. However, because of Tibet's remote location, the region has special difficulties in exploring both domestic and international markets. Therefore, the region has to exert greater efforts than other provinces and regions in establishing a socialist market economy. Tibet's advantages in developing the economy should be viewed within the context of macroeconomic environment, without which Tibet has more difficulties and fewer advantages. Under the macroeconomic environment, the state and fraternal provinces and regions have given Tibet tremendous support. To help Tibet develop itself, the state has adopted many preferential policies for the region. Under the state and fraternal provinces' help and through efforts by the people of Tibet, the quality of life of the people has improved markedly. In this way, Tibet has effectively combined the external environment with the internal conditions to develop the regional economy. We have the determination and confidence that Tibet's economy will develop together with other provinces and regions. During last year's NPC and CPPCC sessions, I befriended (Huang Jikuan), who kept an eye on my whereabouts. This year, I will visit fraternal provinces again to learn from their advanced experiences and to further promote economic cooperation between Tibet and fraternal provinces. [Unidentified correspondent] I was told that freedom of religious belief is not fully respected. What is the real situation? Would you give specific details in your answer? [Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, in Tibetan fading into Mandarin translation] Freedom of religious belief is fully respected in Tibet. There are currently some 1,400 Buddhist temples, monasteries, and lamaseries to satisfy the needs for normal religious life by the masses, with the number of monks and nuns over 30,000. Day-to-day religious activities are conducted in an orderly manner at temples. In Tibet, the majority of the people are Buddhists. Of course, there are nonbelievers too. This shows that both religious believers and nonbelievers enjoy ample freedom of religious belief. [Wang Zheren] That is the end of today's news conference. Thank you all!
