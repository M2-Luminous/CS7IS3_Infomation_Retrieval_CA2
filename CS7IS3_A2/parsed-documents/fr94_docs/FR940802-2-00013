FR940802-2-00013 FR940802-2-00011 [I.D. 071494B] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Renewal of an experimental fishing permit. SUMMARY: NMFS announces the renewal of experimental fishing permit (EFP) #93&hyph;1 to Terra Marine Research and Education, Inc. (TMRE), and participating vessels and shoreside processors. Under the renewal process, a new EFP #94&hyph;2 will be issued to authorize vessel operators, shoreside processors, and TMRE to retain voluntarily Pacific salmon caught as bycatch that would otherwise be required to be discarded at sea as prohibited species. This EFP was designed and modified to develop qualifying criteria for vessels and processors that may wish to participate in a voluntary salmon bycatch donation program being considered by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). Activities authorized under this EFP are intended to provide information not otherwise available through research or commercial fishing operations. ADDRESSES: Copies of the EFP and the Environmental Assessment (EA) may be obtained from Steven Pennoyer, Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen R. Varosi, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Issuance of EFPs to authorize fishing that would otherwise be prohibited are authorized by the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 675. The procedures for renewing EFPs are contained in the regulations at ยง675.6. An EFP was issued to TMRE to test the feasibility of mandatory retention of Pacific salmon caught as bycatch in directed BSAI groundfish fisheries that would be processed and distributed to economically disadvantaged individuals (58 FR 42947, August 12, 1993). This EFP covered the period during: (1) The 1993 directed pollock non-roe season; (2) the 1994 directed pollock roe season; and (3) the 1994 directed Pacific cod season. However, NMFS lacks the authority to require mandatory retention of salmon for this purpose. NMFS announced the receipt of an application for an EFP from TMRE in the Federal Register on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23054). The application requested authorization for voluntary retention and processing of Pacific salmon caught as bycatch in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod trawl fisheries for donation to economically disadvantaged individuals via foodbanks. The Council reviewed the EFP application at its April 18&hyph;24, 1994, meeting and recommended to the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), that the EFP be approved. The Regional Director has approved the EFP application and has issued an EFP to TMRE and the participating vessels and shoreside processors. The EFP authorizes these vessel operators, shoreside processors, and TMRE to retain Pacific salmon caught as bycatch during: (1) The 1994 BSAI directed pollock non-roe or ``B'' season fishery; (2) the 1995 BSAI directed pollock roe or ``A'' season fishery; and (3) the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod fishery, for the purpose of producing salmon products to be distributed to economically disadvantaged individuals via foodbanks. The objective of this EFP is to provide a framework for voluntary retention and processing of salmon bycatch, which is currently required to be discarded at sea, and to develop standards and criteria for vessel operators and processors who may wish to participate in a voluntary salmon donation program being considered by the Council. Classification Based on the EA prepared for this EFP, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that no significant impact on the quality of the human environment will result from this EFP. The Regional Director determined that this experiment will not affect species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act in a way that was not already considered in previous formal and informal section 7 consultations. Additional information, including gear restrictions, scientific sampling procedures, project design, and disposition of harvested fish, is contained in the EFP. This notice is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 27, 1994. Joe P. Clem, Acting Director, Office of Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18704 Filed 8&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
