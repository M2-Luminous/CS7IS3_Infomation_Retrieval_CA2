The experts agree that the present 7-meter-deep waterway at the river mouth has greatly restricted the economic growth of Shanghai, the Chang Jiang River delta and the Chang Jiang River Valley. Therefore, an upgrading project has become an imminent task. According to the study, a 12.5-meter-deep waterway will be developed. In six years, 50,000-ton vessels will be able to go freely into and out of the Chang Jiang River, whereas at present, the river mouth is accessible only to 20,000-ton vessels. The upgrading program will help Shanghai play a pivotal role in international container transport and on the other hand promote the economic growth of Shanghai and the whole Chang Jiang River Delta, experts say. The study was conducted chiefly by the Shanghai Waterway Bureau and the Nanjing Hydraulic Design Institute.
