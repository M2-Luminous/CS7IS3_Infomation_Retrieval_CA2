The thorough repairs conducted at the Rente Electric Plant, which has already reached an output of 315 megawatts or 45 percent of its capacity and has resulted in a significant reduction in power outages, deserve to be described as such. Crombet was told that electricity generation in the province will reach 75 percent capacity and be more reliable after December. Crombet warned of the adverse effect of increasing fraud among consumers who, as a result of the increase in electric fees, return to new ways to receive electricity illegally. Crombet called for a widespread campaign, beginning today and continuing until September, against citizens receiving electricity through illegal hookups and lines, mills, and other methods. Crombet added that is necessary for everyone using electricity to pay for it. Crombet also called for adopting measures to solve the problem of burned out transformers plaguing Santiago de Cuba, due to voltage shifts caused by some self-employed workers using electrical equipment in their small workshops. Crombet praised the provincial boilers efficiency program, which has attained efficiency in 115 of the 274 boilers available; developments in biogas production; and developments in hydroelectric power with 34 such small plants in operation, along with the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Dam, which will generate 2.8 megawatt-hours -- enough to supply almost the entire city of Contramaestre.
