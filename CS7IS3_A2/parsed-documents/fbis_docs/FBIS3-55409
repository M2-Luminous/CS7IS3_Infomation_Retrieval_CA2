He made this decision as a result of his meeting today in the House of the Russian Federation Government with the editors in chief of Russian publications and the heads of journalists' unions. At the same meeting, the editors in chief promised not to hold the protest action -- halting the output of a number of publications -- planned for 10 January. The 25 November government decision on reassessing among other things the value of the basic funds of printing enterprises could have led to a six-fold rise in the cost of printing services. The journalists of a number of publications threatened to strike in protest against this.
