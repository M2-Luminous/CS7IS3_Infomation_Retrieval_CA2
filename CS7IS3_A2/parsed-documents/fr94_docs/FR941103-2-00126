FR941103-2-00126 FR941103-2-00072 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34906; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;30] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Its Allocation Policy and Procedures October 27, 1994. I. Introduction On August 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')ยง 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change requesting permanent approval of revisions to its Allocation Policy and Procedures that were implemented on a one year pilot basis. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33121 (October 29, 1993) (approving such changes on a one-year pilot basis to expire October 28, 1994) (``Pilot Release''). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34644 (September 7, 1994), 59 FR 47192 (September 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The NYSE Allocation Policy and Procedures (``Policy'') governs the allocation of equity securities to NYSE specialist units. 4 The intent of the Policy is to ensure that each equity security listed on the Exchange is allocated in the fairest manner possible to the best specialist unit for that security. In its continuing efforts to enhance allocation decisions, the Exchange conducts periodic reviews of the allocation process. 5 In October of 1993 the NYSE amended its Policy on a one-year pilot basis to revise, among other things, the allocation criteria, the composition of the Allocation Committee (``Committee'') 6 and Allocation Panel (``Panel''), 7 and the Committee's disclosure policy. 4 The NYSE Allocation Policy applies to the allocation of equity securities under the following circumstances: (1) when an equity security is to be initially listed on the NYSE; (2) when an equity security is to be reallocated as a result of disciplinary or other proceedings under NYSE Rules 103A, 475 and 476; or (3) when a specialist unit voluntarily surrenders its registration in a security as a result of possible disciplinary or performance improvement action. See NYSE Allocation Policy and Procedures. 5 Subsequent to the implementation of the pilot program pursuant to the Pilot Release, the Exchange conducted another comprehensive review of the allocation process and further revised the Policy (see SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;18). These revisions include, among other things, the composition of the Allocation Committee and the Allocation Panel, the quorum requirement for the Committee, and allocation of merging companies. 6 Under the Policy, the NYSE Allocation Committee has sole responsibility for the allocation of securities to specialist units pursuant to Board-delegated authority, and is overseen by the Quality of Markets Committee of the Board of Directors (``Board''). The Allocation Committee renders decisions based on the allocation criteria specified in the Allocation Policy. 7 The composition of the Panel reflects the Committee structure and includes floor brokers, allied members, and floor broker Governors. The Panel comprises the pool of individuals from which the Committee is formed. The Panel members are selected through an annual appointment process that utilizes input from the membership. Panel members are appointed to serve a one-year term; Governors, however, remain on the Panel for as long as they are Governors.
