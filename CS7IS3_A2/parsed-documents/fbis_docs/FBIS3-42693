Analyzing Russia's monetary, credit, and budget policy, the authors of this work reach the conclusion that, on the whole, during 1993 it was possible to adhere to the "anti-inflationary direction of Russia's financial policy. A market economy exists in Russia and it can be regulated by market, that is, monetary, methods." They refute the view that the notorious policy of "shock" therapy was conducted in Russia. "By no criteria can a policy, under which the budget deficit comprising 10 percent of the GDP is financed through emission, the annual inflation is 900 percent, the population's monetary income and average wages in all sectors have grown more rapidly than prices, unemployment has remained at the level of 1 percent, and there are no bankruptcies or enterprise closures, be shock therapy," the authors of this report think. Here, perhaps, it is appropriate to add that in 1993 Russian arbitral tribunals, nevertheless, registered eight cases of bankruptcies. However, in Russia there are 220,000 enterprises, of which about one-third are unprofitable. Thus, in Russia until now there has been neither shock, nor therapy. The finance minister's report debunks a number of myths stemming "from the basic principle of socialism" about the primacy of production over the sphere of services and circulation. It lies in the fact that "at first it is necessary to raise production and to produce goods--and inflation itself will disappear." During the last one and a half years Mr. Gerashchenko has tried to convince the Russian and the international public that "Russian inflation is not of a monetary nature," but is due to the high degree of monopolism. However, it was demonstrated a long time ago that a strict dependence exists between the growth of the money supply and inflation rates and that the monetary factor accounts for 70 to 75 percent of Russian inflation. Furthermore, thousands of enterprises have already adapted themselves to the market rules of the game and the experience of the last few years has demonstrated quite convincingly that under Russian conditions a selectively structural policy degenerates into ordinary emission pumping and the extortion of preferential credits and import subsidies by lobbyists, such as Messrs. Zaveryukha, Yefimov, Shurchkov, and Glukhikh. The authors of this report quite appropriately cite ex-minister Fedorov's favorite quotation, which he got from Grigoriy Sokolnikov, author of the 1922-1924 monetary reform: "Emission is opium for the people." It is to be supposed that Mr. Sokolnikov's book, which was presented to Viktor Chernomyrdin with marked off places, as well as Ukraine's sad experience, has had some restraining effect on the government's distribution of unsecured subsidies. Now, however, after Boris Fedorov's departure from the Ministry of Finance, if Mr. Chernomyrdin wishes to follow the principal points of this book, he will have to confront the "red economic managers" almost alone. The entire question is whether the prime minister, declaring his devotion to the policy of reform, but, at the same time, proposing that the economy be stabilized by "nonmonetary methods," is ready for this. It would not be bad for the prime minister's speech writer to find out what, as a rule, the fixing of the currency rate, price restriction, introduction of a 100-percent sale of currency proceeds and of obligatory deliveries, and similar administrative pranks mean in economic practice.
