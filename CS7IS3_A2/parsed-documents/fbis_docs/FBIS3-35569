The incident was so catastrophic that it caused a swift eruption in the Palestinians' ranks. The Zionist regime immediately announced a state of emergency and put the finishing touches on the atrocity initiated by an armed Zionist by ordering its usurping soldiers to shoot at another group of Palestinians who had rushed to assist the wounded and they also joined the ranks of martyrs. We asked the expert of the News Research and Commentary Group to give us his assessment of the political dimensions of this incident: [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Ne'matzadeh, the Zionist regime is seeking to exonerate itself from the responsibility for this catastrophe by attributing it to a so-called mentally deranged or insane individual. I would like to know your opinion in this regard. [Ne'matzadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. With salutations to our dear compatriots and condolences on this shattering and soul searing incident, which has plunged the entire Islamic world in grief, I wish to state that it is natural that the Zionist regime, or any other criminal, would not wish to accept the negative consequences of a crime that he has committed. Therefore he resorts to blaming others. Israel is capitalizing on this atrocity but totally refuses to take responsibility for it. Can it be acceptable from the legal point of view that the Zionist officials are not responsible for this incident and its consequences? Incidentally, the facts are contrary to the wishes of the usurpist regime. According to international law, the convention on prisoners of war, regulations regarding occupied areas, the Zionist regime is basically responsible for the security of the residents of the occupied areas which it controls. Therefore, regardless of who has perpetrated such a crime, if the Zionist regime is not able to ensure the security of the residents in the occupied areas, it should either evacuate these areas immediately and hand them over to the owners, or it should delegate the security of the occupied areas to UN forces. Thus, such rhetoric is unacceptable in international law, and incidents with such dimensions and depth cannot be blamed on a single mentally unbalanced Zionist. In addition, the question arises: Who armed this allegedly demented individual? In principle, the arming of the Zionist residents in these settlements is a policy that the Zionist soldiers are implementing officially. It is the Zionist army that permits them to carry weapons. In addition to giving them weapons and permitting them to carry them about, the armed forces also trains them to use them. Thus, it is very easy to identify who is responsible for this incident. Aside from this, while the al-Ibrahimi shrine is under the stringent control of the usurper Zionist regime's soldiers, and the fasting Palestinian worshipers passed through strict security checks on entering, how could armed Zionists pass through such a strict security system without any coordination on the part of the usurper armed forces and plunge the innocent people into blood and dust while they are praying? Woe to their shamelessness. The Zionist regime considers itself absolved of this crime. After this incident--which is not considered an exceptional one in Palestine and is in complete conformity with the usual policy of the Zionist regime--the question that arises is: Why were the compromising Palestinians not attacked? Why did a mentally deranged individual not attack the team of Palestinian negotiators who were holding talks with the Zionist regime? It is clear that the objective was precisely predetermined. The Palestinian people are the main elements, the backbone of the people's uprising -- that is, the devout stratum devoted to Islam. Thus, the targeting of the worshipers in a mosque while praying and fasting is in complete conformity with the policy of the Zionist regime. The attack was aimed at the real enemy of the Zionist regime and therefore, the mental derangement of an individual or individuals involved is a mere fabrication on the part of political and propaganda apparatus of the Zionist regime. This is one of the usual ploys of the political and propaganda apparatus of this regime. The blaze in the al-Aqsa Mosque in 1967, the holiest mosque in Islam after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Prophet's mosque in Medina, was also attributed to a lunatic. Only three years ago, a large number of Palestinian workers were massacred, and even that was attributed to a psychotic. The character of a madman has consistently been present in the history of the crimes of the Zionists and will continue to be so. What is interesting is that we should realize that the head of the Zionist council resident in the Zionist settlement said that the main person responsible had no psychological aberrations or mental imbalance. If we are to assume that the person or persons responsible did have some degree of psychosis, then how about those who announced martial law immediately after this shattering crime? How about those who fired bullets at the other concerned Palestinians? How about those who shot and martyred those who had hastened to assist the wounded and had gathered outside the al- Khalil hospital to donate blood? [Announcer] What objectives is the Israeli regime pursuing by resorting to such actions and what does it hope to gain in this manner? [Ne'matzadeh] There are some issues the Zionist hierarchy might have in mind. First, Israel has reaped benefits from the Gaza-Jericho accord, and has already got what it wanted from the accord it signed with 'Arafat at present. Political legitimacy, international popularity, revamping of its warmongering image, official domination over Palestinian borders, highways, roads, settlements, internal and foreign security, security control and all else. So what is the importance of continuing the talks on accords? Now the time has come to once again show its true face, which is the same one that appeals to Zionist society and strengthens the Zionist regime's base inside Israel and at the same time undermines its political rivals. In addition, you witnessed that Israel has targeted the Islamists. This is in itself a message, a threat which has the support of the West. You have observed that no one has condemned the Zionist regime or said that it is responsible. At most, they just condemned the incident. [Announcer] In your opinion, what could be the repercussions of this incident? Is it possible that it will overshadow the negotiations pertaining to the 'Arafat-Israel compromise and halt this process? [Ne'matzadeh] In my opinion, this does not seem possible. 'Arafat has burned his bridges and has passed the point of no return. He does not see any recourse but to succumb to the enemy. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has sensed the danger of the possible repercussions of this incident on the talks, has invited the two sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis, to continue their talks in Washington.
