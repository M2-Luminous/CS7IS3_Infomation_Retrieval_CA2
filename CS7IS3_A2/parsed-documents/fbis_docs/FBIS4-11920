The Dolphins I was turned back amid the countdown to a meeting this week in Washington where American officials are expected to discuss a three month-old proposal to replace sea-based inspections by the U.S.led force with onshore checks by a neutral international agency. His Majesty King Husayn said Monday that Jordan required a statisfactory solution to the siege of al-'Aqabah in order to continue playing a positive role in the peace process. The increased international attention on the blockade of the Red Sea port has also brought sharp focus on the very legality of the inspections. Businessmen said that they had learnt that the interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels was a self-assumed task of the U.S. with no coordination with the U.N. Sanctions Committee. T. Gharghur and Fils, agents of Dolphins 1, said in a letter to the minister of finance that the vessel, which was carrying nearly 4,000 tonnes of soya bean meal--animal feed--was intercepted at the Tiran Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba on Friday. After two inspections of the St. Vincent-flagged ship, inspectors aboard the U.S. frigate which intercepted the Dolphins 1 ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect the lower holds where the Jordan-bound cargo was stowed and therefore could not allow it to proceed to al-'Aqabah. All the papers related to the consignment were in order and were produced to the inspectors, including details of the consignee, but the inspectors insisted that they should be able to check the bagged cargo, said a spokesman for the agents. The Dolphin 1, which was running out of fuel, could not stay around in the straits and headed for Port Suez where the cargo could be rearranged to satisfy the inspectors before returning to the Tiran Straits, the agents said. The process is expected to cost several thousand dollars to the importer. No official comment was immediately available. But the interception was certain to fuel fears that the Kingdom's repeated complaints over the negative impact of Red Sea inspection methods on its economy have gone unheeded except for repeated American promises that they would be looked into. Meanwhile, Jordanians who met with a visiting U.N. Sanctions Committee official last week said they understood that the committee had nothing to do with the actual inspections and was not kept informed of what is going on in the Red Sea. "We were amazed to get the distinct impression that the inspections are a self-assumed task of the U.S. and there was little communication, let alone coordination, between the enforcers of the sanctions and the committee," said one of those who met with Jhiang Zhang Wan, secretary of the sanctions panel, which includes representatives of all the 15 members of the Security Council. "We could not but reach a conclusion that the U.S. is mostly trying unilaterally to cater to the desires of some of the Gulf states by maintaining the sanctions on Iraq and also pressure on Jordan," said the Jordanian, who declined to be identified further. The Jordanian government has filed several memos with the Sanctions Committee raising this particular point, but no action had been adopted, diplomats said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last week that he was looking for ways to ease the impact the embargo against Iraq is having on Jordan. "We're certainly working on that," Mr. Christopher said. "We'd like to find some way to ease the burden on Jordan of these inspections... we recognise the pressure on Jordan and the disadvantages to Jordan's economy." The U.S. has always maintained that it has Security Council authorisation to enforce the sanctions which the world body imposed in August 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Legal experts have questioned this assertion, however. 'Ali al-Dumur, head of the Jordanian Jurists Association, said: "Legally there is a grey area between what the U.S. claims as the authorisation it has from the Security Council and the actual modality of enforcing the sanctions." "But in reality there is no such formal authorisation and the enforcement of the sanctions and the interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels were adopted by the U.S. in its own interpretation of how to monitor respect for the sanctions," Mr. al-Dumur told the JORDAN TIMES. Despite the argument, it is unlikely that any bid to challenge the American assertion will be entertained in the U.S.-dominated Security Council, observers say. "But that does not mean that we should shut up and put up with whatever way the U.S. wants to deal with us," said the Jordanian who attended the meeting with the Sanctions Committee official. A European diplomat said: "Jordanian patience has to be commended since (the Kingdom) put up with the status quo for more than three years before deciding that enough was enough and took a firm position." "I think most of the Euroepan countries support the Jordanian stand although it is not yet clear what individual governments would do to help the Kingdom," added the diplomat. So far, only France, whose ships often participate in the U.S.-led force patrolling the Red Sea, has publicly said that it supported the Jordanian position and that an urgent solution to the siege of al-'Aqabah had to be found.
