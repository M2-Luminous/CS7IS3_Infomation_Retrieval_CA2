In January this year, China's industrial output value chalked up 290 billion yuan (about 32.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 33.2 percent over the same month last year, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB). The first month of 1994 also saw a 22 percent increase in retail sales, with total volume topping 120 billion yuan. China's imports and exports were worth 10.5 billion U.S. dollars in January this year. The exports were 4.8 billion dollars, up 43.1 percent over the same month last year. The SSB figures show that state revenue went up 86.2 percent in January, which means a relatively comfortable balance of revenue and expenditure. However, officials of the SSB said that inflation, continuing for several months, still posed a threat to the sustainable and healthy growth of the national economy. The situation facing state-owned enterprises was also tough, they said. Economists here called on the government to continue strengthening macro-economic control so that inflation and fixed assets investment could be kept under check.
