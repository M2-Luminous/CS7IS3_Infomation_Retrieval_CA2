At least 23 people were arrested and at least several were injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel, witnesses said. Police said there were only four arrests, however, in what was the toughest crackdown on demonstrators here in a week marked by growing unrest in Indonesia over the press crackdown. For the first time, banners carried by the protesters said Information Minister Harmoko should resign if the ban was not lifted. Political sources here said the government was concerned that Keating might cause embarassment to Indonesia's leadership by raising the question of the press clampdown with President Suharto. [passage omitted] The head of the Jakarta police, Major General Hindarto, said long-standing Indonesian law prohibited the gathering of more than five people under such circumstances. A short time later, soldiers dispersed another group of about 150 artists led by the well-known artist Rendra, who were protesting the ban on the weeklies in a park near the Information Ministry. The security officials chased down the demonstrators and destroyed their banners less than one minute after ordering the crowd to disperse. [passage omitted]
