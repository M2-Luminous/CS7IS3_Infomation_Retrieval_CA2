Soon It Could Generate More"] [Text] The Ukrainian parliament adopted four different resolutions regarding the Chernobyl nuclear plant over the past four years. The station was "executed" three times (deadlines for its stoppage were set for the beginning of 1995, then 1992, and 1993); and in October 1993, the Supreme Council "pardoned" it, permitting it to function until the exhaustion of its technical resources. The last decision was forced by life itself, with the parliament just affirming it. Losing 5 percent of Ukraine's electric energy, generated by the Chernobyl plant, means death for our state -- electricity frequency is on the verge of normal levels, reaching at times 49 hertz. Experts know very well that if the frequency goes down, this might trigger a ripple effect paralyzing all industries. This is another case confirming the proverb that every cloud has a silver lining. It is not the market economy or competition but the station's dire situation that forced its staff to fight for survival on three fronts at a time -- to maintain the system of nuclear units, to prepare those units for their decommissioning, and to produce electricity with a 110-118 percent completion of its monthly production plans. As long as the government was handing out subsidies to unprofitable enterprises or even entire industries, fueling inflation, the Chernobyl plant undertook expensive safety measures and at its own cost, carried out a considerable amount of work necessary to put the plant out of commission. During nine months of 1994 alone, safety and reliability outlays amounted to 14 billion karbovanets -- one-fourth of the revenues. At the same time, production costs for one kilowatt-hour produced at the Chernobyl plant proved 1.5-fold less than at thermal electric stations, even though it pays world prices for its nuclear fuel. In terms of security, Chernobyl nuclear units today are as good as comparable Russian ones. As the honorary president of the World Association of Nuclear Plant User States (WANO), Lord Marshall, emphasized ("ATOMNAYA TECHNIKA ZA RUBEZHOM" [Foreign Atomic Engineering], No. 6, 1993), that the "safety of RBMK-type reactors was brought up to quite acceptable levels." Paradoxically, it was opponents of nuclear engineering that helped achieve this condition. Following the accident in 1986, the plant has been working under the constant pressure from the "Green" Party, politicians, media, as well as an enhanced scrutiny of foreign and national experts and monitoring institutions. In December alone, the Chernobyl plant was visited by Mykola Shteynberg, head of the Ukrainian State Atomic Supervising Committee, George Kallman, one the leading experts at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (analogous to the Ukrainian State Atomic Supervising Committee), and Morris Rosen, deputy general manager of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. During the last visit, in addition to the usual problems, a new issue was raised -- preparation for resuming the work of the No. 2 unit, which was stopped after the fire on the No. 4 turbogenerator in October 1991. That accident was caused by the malfunction of one of the electric cables, and was not connected with nuclear and radiation safety of the reactor. According to a timetable set at the station, the No. 2 unit is to be ready for reactivation as early as November 1994. Although the Chernobyl plant will again defray most of the costs, government support will be necessary because, as the station's experts say, the bloc's reactivation costs will pay off relatively quickly, funneling net profits to the state budget. However favorable the situation for the plant might be, the Chernobyl plant experts realize that the date of the plant closure is not too many years from now. This is why the decommission works will be continued. The construction of a new boiler house and a storage facility for liquid and radioactive waste will be completed. What would replace the energy potential in the north of Ukraine following a shutdown of the Chernobyl plant? The Chernihiv Oblast administration endorsed a project to build a new electrical plant near Slavutych with a 2,000 megawatt capacity. Its type and the kind of fuel will be selected during a technical and economic evaluation of the project, and subsequently put to a referendum by the local population. This is exactly how they act in civilized states when planning to build a new industrial enterprise. When decommissioned, the Chernobyl plant might still be of some value. For example, it may serve as a foundation for a facility for storing and processing nuclear waste.
