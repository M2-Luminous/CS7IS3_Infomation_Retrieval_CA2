Attending the meeting were the comrade ministers and deputy ministers of science, technology, and environment; finance; and construction as well as representatives of the National Defense Ministry. By 20 March, units working on the 500-kv powerline had completed the construction of 3,436 bases and pylons and put up a total of 1,487 km of electrical and anti-rust wire. All of the transformer and switching stations are up to 90 percent of their capacity. Comrade Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne assured Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet that all construction work on the project will be completed by 30 March, and operations will begin on an experimental basis on 10 April. The prime minister expressed his concern regarding measures to deal with the remaining work at the last transformer station in Phu Lam. He ordered the Ministry of Energy to concentrate on completing the remaining work to ensure the timely operation and technological requirements of the project. The prime minister said that because the planned deadline to complete the project has not yet expired, we need to work with a sense of urgency, but not in haste or on the precondition that the project must be officially commissioned on a national holiday. Rushing could produce regrettable results. The prime minister reminded the Ministry of Energy that while attempting to complete the project, we must also prepare for the production phase, especially the task of training cadres, technical staff, and workers. We also have to study the experiences of foreign specialists in management and operation.
