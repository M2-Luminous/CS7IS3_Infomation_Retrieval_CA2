The proposal, submitted in writing to the Tokyo high court by officials of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, is 50 million yen more than the government's original proposal. The figure is still some 300 million yen short of the amount of compensation suggested by the Tokyo high court in a compromise proposal, however. Restrictions on night flights sought by the residents were also not a part of the compromise agreement but were incorporated into a nonbinding preamble to the proposal. Hundreds of residents living near the Yokota base filed the joint action suit against the government demanding compensation and a ban on night flights. In March 1989, the Hachioji Branch of the Tokyo District Court rejected the residents' demands for a ban on night flights and compensation for future disturbances. But it ordered the government to pay 330 million yen in compensation for past victimization. Both sides then appealed the ruling, but have been in negotiations since June following a Supreme Court decision in February 1993 rejecting a ban on night flights and compensation for future noise disturbances in two earlier noise pollution suits. In November, the Tokyo high court sought a compromise by proposing an end to the night flights "in principle." Japan and the U.S. have agreed that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. should be restricted to those that are essential to the U.S. military's operations.
