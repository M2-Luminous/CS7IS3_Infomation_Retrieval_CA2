Following the Kliridhis-Lamb meeting in the Presidential Palace this morning, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the U.S. coordinator submitted no proposals or ideas regarding the proximity talks on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Kasoulidhis added that Lamb asked to hear the Greek Cypriot side's evaluation regarding the impasse resulting from the talks. Lamb described his meeting with President Kliridhis as very constructive. He said enough progress was made but refrained from identifying the topics on which there are differences. The U.S. coordinator will meet [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas in the occupied areas at noon. At 1700, Lamb will have another meeting with President Kliridhis.
