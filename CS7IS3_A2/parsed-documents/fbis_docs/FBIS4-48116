(Arnold Sebetse) spoke to him in Johannesburg. [Begin recording, in English] [Mlambo] There is nobody resigning from the top structure of the PAC, because rumors have been concocted even around the president of the PAC, which have no basis whatsoever. Even the question of our secretary general has indicated to the leadership that, perhaps because of the tasks that he will be handling as our representative in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] parliament, he ought to be relieved of his tasks, and we have said no to that aspect. [as heard] [(Sebetse)] And finally, Mr. Mlambo, President Mandela has made an offer to the PAC, a cabinet post. What is the PAC response to that? [Mlambo] Well, the constitution does not allow for that. [end recording]
