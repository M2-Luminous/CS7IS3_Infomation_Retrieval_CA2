Former Deputy Prime Minister Josefata Kamikamica, expelled from the Fijian Political Party last month, said the rebirth of the Fiji Association was a political necessity. Mr. Kamikamica accused Mr. Rabuka's coalition government of ineptitude, deception, and dishonorable behavior. Mr. Kamikamica was one of seven government dissidents expelled from the governing Fijian Political Party after helping to defeat the 1994 budget in parliament last November. Mr. Rabuka called a snap election for February. The Fiji Association plans to contest 27 of the 37 seats set aside for Fijians under the racially-biased 1990 constitution. If it gained enough support in those seats in the 33 seats open to Fiji Indians and other racial minorities, it could threaten Mr. Rabuka's hold on power.
