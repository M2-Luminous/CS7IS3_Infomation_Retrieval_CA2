He added that within a few hours there would be definite arrangements between the South African Government and Bophuthatswana for the South African Defence Force [SADF] to move into bophuthatswana and help stabilise it. The news conference heard SADF forces had been deployed in Mmabatho and more were on standby. Mr de Klerk welcomed Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope's decision to register for the elections and said he hoped this would have an immediate stabilising effect on the territory. He rejected the perception that the unrest had brought about Mr Mangope's decision to register, and attributed this to the continued negotiations between the Bophuhatswana government, the South African Government and other interested parties. SADF Chief Gen Georg Meiring and South African Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe left after lunch to appraise the situation in Bophuthatswana and would also hold talks with Bophuthatswanan's chiefs of police and Bophuthatswana Defence Force. On the violence and looting that erupted in the areas along the border of South Africa and Bophuthatswana north of Pretoria, Mr de Klerk said security forces had been deployed where warranted. Mr de Klerk said he had been in contact with African National Congress President Nelson Mandela, speaking to him twice on Friday. Mr de Klerk said there had been good co-operation between his government and the African National Congress [ANC]. The leadership of the ANC had acted responsibly and "we worked well together". The same could not be said, however, of the ANC supporters and their surrogate organisations. Information at hand pointed to their involvement in creating the situation and in fostering a volatile spirit. Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee said one facet of the unrest was the presence of elements of private armies.
