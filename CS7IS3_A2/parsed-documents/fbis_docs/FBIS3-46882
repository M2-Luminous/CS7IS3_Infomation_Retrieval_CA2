The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that Kim's speech would help provide momentum and encourage industry since it presented a policy direction aimed at expansion of infrastructure, relaxation of administrative regulations and improvement of industrial structure for ensuring cost-effectiveness. The Federation of Korean Industries [FKI] said it was proper for the government to relax administrative regulations, boost investment, increase exports through industrial peace and revive the economy. FKI said it was waiting for concrete follow-up measures to boost industry. The Korea Foreign Trade Association said that the target for improving competitiveness was timely because this is in an age of internationalization and openness, but it sought concrete measures for continual growth of exports. The Korea Federation of Small Business said the government's strong will to increase competitiveness was encouraging for small companies but it hoped more substantial measures would be taken to boost the competitiveness of small companies as they are the roots of the national economy. It expressed satisfaction that the government will form a committee on development in rural and fishery areas to advise the president how to support farmers and fishers, who may suffer the largest loss because of the Uruguay Round trade accord. The Korea Employers' Federation said President Kim had given economic activists confidence by showing a direction for the economy to follow, but called on the government to pay more interest in industrial harmony.
