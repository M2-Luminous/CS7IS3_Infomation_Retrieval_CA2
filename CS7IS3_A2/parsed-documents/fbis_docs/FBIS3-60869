They are being held in remand cells and will be transferred to Rostov-on-Don in the near future. An Interior Ministry official reports that during interrogation it emerged that the terrorists carefully planned their action. In particular, they thoroughly reconnoitered the airports at Georgiyevsk and Stravropol. Some experts think that if the criminals had managed to land at the intended point on the border with Chechnya, there would have been very little chance of catching them. Moreover, it has emerged that during one of the interrogation sessions former military pilot Anatoliy Mikheyev said there was a certain organization behind the groups' actions and that it had helped plan the crime.
