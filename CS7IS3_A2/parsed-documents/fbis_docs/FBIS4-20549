However, it outperformed the rest of the market in most of the sectors in which it is active. Piero Martinotti, SGS-Thomson's "number two," considers that his company will continue to make progress. [Della Mussia] In 1992, you covered 2.7 percent of the world market. You also covered 2.7 percent in 1993. Are you still aiming to cover 5 percent of the world market? How do you hope to achieve that? [Martinotti] Indeed, 5 percent is a limit above which a general semiconductor company can obtain structural stability. In my opinion, this percentage can even fall to 4 percent, since our Japanese competitors now have to generate some cash flow, which was not previously the case; they therefore have fewer financial options. We are concerned with maintaining our momentum: The semiconductors market is set to double every seven years; our challenge is to try and double our revenues every five years while accepting that there will be no capital increases, that is to say relying solely on our current strengths and existing product catalogue. However, our shareholders could decide on faster growth by increasing the company capital. I reckon that one-third of our 1993 profits were due to a favorable economic climate and two-thirds can be put down to internal action. Now, even if the market goes into decline, we will remain profitable in all our product lines and continue to win shares in the market. Moreover, our debt/equity ratio of just 0.285 gives a certain financial flexibility. Once again, however, it is up to our shareholders to decide whether we should grow faster, with possible takeovers of other companies. For example, this would be the case if we decided to manufacture 486 circuits. The favorable economic situation means that we envisage making shareholders' equity investments in the region of $550 million this year. If there were a crisis, we would scale down our ambitions to maintain the cash-flow. [Della Mussia] You still rank in the same position among the world's semiconductor companies. Why? [Martinotti] NS and Philips are ahead of us, but the gap is closing. Be patient. [Della Mussia] SGS-Thomson still has an enormous number of factories in the world. Is that not a handicap? [Martinotti] If we were starting again from scratch, we would doubtless shed four factories. However, we have to live in a real world. That is why we are reinvesting in Rennes, simply because, at the current time, Rennes is very profitable and will most likely remain profitable for another four or five years. At the moment we are reinvesting, too, in Rousset for five-inch chip manufacture in the area made available by the closure of the four-inch production line, in particular with an EEPROM [electrically erasable programmable read-only memory] technology for microcontrollers that we will transfer from Agrate. [Della Mussia] Will the Mitsubishi-Hitachi agreement on flash memory influence your strategy in this area? [Martinotti] Our strategy with regard to Mitsubishi remains unchanged, even if our developments were delayed by a few months and the Hitachi agreement has complicated our relations slightly. We have decided on the NOR technique, but we do have access to the DINOR and AND techniques. We will make our choice in due course. In any case, we have already defined with Mitsubishi the products that we want to manufacture together and we are currently making our technologies compatible.
