FBIS4-37144 "drnes117_c_94001" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Egypt Mubarak on Crisis in Yemen, Arab-Israeli Peace Mubarak on Crisis in Yemen, Arab-Israeli Peace NC1606104594 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0920 GMT 16 Jun 94 NC1606104594 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Bucharest, 16 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has affirmed that using force to preserve the unity of Yemen will not succeed. In an interview with Romanian television last night, President Mubarak expressed regret over what is happening in Yemen. Answering a question on his attempt to mediate in the current conflict in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I tried to mediate and exchange viewpoints with the Yemeni president, but he told me one thing and did another. In his interview with the Romanian television, President Mubarak added: I feel sorry about what is happening in Yemen. I discussed this subject with the Yemeni president many times. He insists on keeping his country united. But unity cannot be realized through force. The use of force to preserve unity will not succeed. He said they are currently trying to impose unity on the south, but they will not succeed because there will be a great deal of bloodshed and many victims, which is a terrible thing. He noted that this does not guarantee any kind of unity; unity is based on the agreement and blessings of the two peoples. The will of the people must triumph, not the will of bombs, weapons, and bloodshed. Such situations do absolutely nothing to create unity. On peace in the Middle East between Israel--an economically strong country--and the fledgling Palestinian state--which is practically starting from scratch--President Mubarak said that despite the fact that there are two countries with different growth rates, they are cooperating without any problems. In addition, the region is bursting with potential. He added that there are many possibilities, but it is too soon to discuss these issues. We are currently concentrating on the peace process and the Palestinian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese issues. He pointed out that when agreement with these countries is reached and applied, we will then think about and study ways and means of cooperation in the region. It is only natural for us to expect difficulties in the beginning; however, we cannot sit back and say that Israel is a strong country and the others are not. It is not right to succumb to this factor. Answering a question about his view of the other aspects of the peace process, President Mubarak said in his interview that, on the whole, Jordan is not the one causing complications in the process. He said: I believe that Jordan is currently negotiating with Israel. I hope they will reach some agreement in the near future. He added that with respect to Syria: I have repeatedly said that without the return of the Golan Heights to the Syrians, it is very difficult to think of the possibility of concluding a bilateral agreement. I have heard statements by Israeli officials to the effect that they will not budge an inch on the Golan Heights. True, such statements have not been made by Yitzhaq Rabin himself, but there are other officials who are making such statements. Mubarak clarified that the problem between the Syrians and Israelis lies in the absence of mutual trust. I hope these obstacles will be overcome this year, he said. I also hope that some understanding can be reached over the Golan Heights. In response to a question regarding his optimism about Syrian-Israeli negotiations, President Mubarak said: I am optimistic because there is no other alternative. We will help the Syrians any time they ask for help; we will spare no efforts in this respect. Asked whether instability in the Middle East basically results from extremist Islamic movements, President Mubarak said that there is no problem in Egypt because it has deep roots and several religions have survived in Egypt for thousands of years. We are capable of overcoming any crisis. We have encountered crises before; this one poses no problems for Egypt. He said: There are several problems in certain Middle Eastern countries; but I do not believe that the extremists are successful, because most people are against the extremists. We will overcome this problem, although it may take some time. When asked about his views on the real danger to world peace at present, President Mubarak said that the Americans and French may have more specific views regarding the international situation. As for Europe, he said that the situation in Yugoslavia and Bosnia poses an extremely serious problem, noting that a solution to the Bosnian problem is imminent. He said that at one time there was a plan to isolate the Muslims of Bosnia, which would be an extremely serious matter. He stated that it is very serious to isolate the Muslims even though they have long been allowed to coexist with other peoples of different religions. He noted that if the Muslims find themselves isolated, it may plant a time bomb in the heart of Europe. He noted that the French and British share this view, adding: I think they have avoided this danger and efforts are under way to find a solution. I hope they will find one. On the situation in Rwanda, President Mubarak said that two tribes are fighting each other there and one of them has accused Egypt of supplying arms to the other one. He stressed that Egypt is not supplying arms to either side. He noted that we had a contract last year and it was fulfilled before the crisis erupted. Another contract was signed before the crisis, but Egypt froze it when the fighting broke out. On the long-standing Romanian-Egyptian relations, particularly in the wake of the political developments in Romania during the past four years, President Mubarak said: We were concerned at first about the situation in Romania. He said: We have always maintained good ties with Romania and we were concerned that the situation there might deteriorate seriously, but it transpired that the situation has changed for the better, which is very important. He said: We have traditionally had good relations with the Romanian people. I am very happy that the Romanians are proceeding along the right path. He stressed that Egyptian-Romanian ties are currently extremely good, as they have always been, and he noted that the recent slowdown in relations was not prompted by Egypt but by the changes that occurred in Romania. He said he wished to visit Bucharest soon, noting that his last visit to Romania was a long time ago.
