Guayaquil Staff--Fernando Gonzalez, undersecretary of fisheries, emphasized that the productive sectors devoted to banana growing and catching marine resources are responsible for polluting the Gulf of Guayaquil and damaging the country's ecosystem. The fisheries undersecretary remarked: "We have been irresponsible in using these resources," and called upon those involved in these activities to participate intensively in ecosystem rehabilitation programs. He added that Taura syndrome, a disease that seriously harms shrimp production, and the pollution of the gulf are due largely to the use of chemical products. The shrimp fishermen have held banana producers responsible for Taura syndrome and for the pollution of the Gulf of Guayaquil, owing to the indiscriminate, excessive use of pesticides in the battle against the black sigatoka fungus. In Fernando Gonzalez's opinion, all this has created a conflict that should be resolved immediately, through the use of suitable methods and consensus. When the national government learned that two major sectors of the Ecuadoran economy were at stake, it ordered the ministers of agriculture and industries to work jointly to reconcile these industries. The aim is to prevent either of them from being harmed, and also from damaging the ecosystem. Gonzalez noted that the National Banana Program has devised regulations for the use of pesticides, adopting proposals from the National Chamber of Aquaculture to avoid damage to the ecosystem. Fernando Gonzalez indicated that the problem is global. The estuaries associated with the Guayas Basin have been used by many industries for a long time, and this has caused congestion in the ecosystem. Since August 1992, the National Institute of Fisheries has been monitoring (investigating) the Gulf of Guayaquil and Guayas Basin, by establishing 12 stations around various shrimp production companies. He said that, within the next few days, the institute will submit the reports received on the investigations. Undersecretary Gonzalez also cited the series of prohibitions and bans issued in the insular Galapagos Province. He noted that President Sixto Duran Ballen had sent a commission comprised of the national defense, agriculture, and tourism ministers, to determine the real problems besetting one of that province's leading economic activities, namely, fishing. He gave a reminder that there have been prohibitions in Galapagos that have not adhered to legal specifications called for in the Ecuadoran juridical system, nor to technical specifications with which they should have been prepared. The prohibitions were issued because it seemed fitting to certain authorities or parties concerned, but without any technical criterion, much less a scientific criterion. He added that the Ministerial Commission will determine the means for resolving this situation, making it possible to prevent the depredation of marine resources. Gonzalez commented: "In principle, any resource is susceptible to exploitation so long as it is done with a view toward sustained use. However, continental business firms must be prevented from going to Galapagos and hurting the interests of the Galapagos nonindustrial fleet, consisting of small insular fishermen." "The continental companies went to the archipelago, plundered the crawfish and sea cucumber, and were replaced later by others." He added: "To avoid this series of violations against the marine resources, it is planned to create a Sub-Directorate of Fisheries, with jurisdiction in Galapagos. The 56 forest wardens on the islands will be given the responsibility for being converted into 56 fishing inspectors."
