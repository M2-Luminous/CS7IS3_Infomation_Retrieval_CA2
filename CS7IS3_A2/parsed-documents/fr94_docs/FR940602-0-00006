Section 1980.451 (c) of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Applicants eligible for Small Business Administration assistance will be advised of the availability of that assistance. (j) Loan guarantee limits. Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง1980.420 of this subpart, the guarantee percentage on any BIB loan will not exceed 80 percent. (k) Credit quality analysis. In analyzing the credit quality of a proposed loan to a business that has lost assets to a natural disaster, primary emphasis will be placed on the operating history of the business, rather than its current financial condition. If the business has a sound, profitable and successful history prior to the disaster and there are reasonable projections to ensure it can operate successfully in the future, the proposed loan may be approved even if disaster losses have caused somewhat less equity and/or collateral than would normally be expected for a B&I loan guarantee. If the business appears to have had an unprofitable operation or inadequate cash flow prior to the disaster, the proposed loan guarantee will not be approved. (l) Equity requirements. The equity requirements of ยง1980.441 of this subpart do not apply to BIB loans. (m) Collateral. Section 1980.443 Administrative A. 2., 3., and 4. of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Collateral may be considered at its current market value without discount. Work-in-process inventory may be valued at the estimated market value of the finished product. All costs of producing the finished product must be included in the cash flow analysis. (n) Conditional approval. A Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 may be issued prior to receipt of specific items needed to complete an application package provided: (1) The lender and/or borrower demonstrates to the Government's satisfaction that it has a need for a prompt indication of the availability of the proposed loan guarantee and the conditions under which a guarantee are available; (2) The specific items missing from the application package will take considerable time to obtain; (3) The lender requests a commitment prior to providing the items; (4) The attachment to Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 clearly states that the commitment is conditioned on satisfactory completion of the missing item(s) and a guarantee will not be issued unless all conditions of these regulations are met; and (5) No Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 will be issued prior to the obligation date established with the Finance Office. (o) Financial statements.
