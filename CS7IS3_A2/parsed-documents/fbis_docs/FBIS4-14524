But under existing conditions, it would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the minister himself. [Mamedov] The situation on our borders is favorable at the present time. We steadfastly maintain our positions, regardless of the agreement we have reached to implement a cease-fire. Meanwhile, we have been taking several measures. A state of mobilization has been declared in the country. Troops are being instructed and trained at all training centers. We wish to establish an army. An army has to be established, regardless of whether or not there is a war. A strong country and state must have a strong and proper army. We are concerning ourselves every hour, every day, and everywhere in the Republic with establishing our army, regardless of the continuing war. [Sherifov] Is it not the state that is carrying out the work? [Mamedov] Yes, the work is being carried out by the state. That is our sacred duty. [Sherifov] Lengthy talks have been held on the implementation of a cease-fire agreement. You have participated in the talks in Moscow in your capacity as defense minister. Furthermore, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have held talks on the matter. However, a result has not yet been achieved. Can you comment on this matter? [Mamedov] The defense ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia signed an agreement on 18 February. Paragraph 3 of that agreement said that the Armenians must withdraw their military forces as soon as a cease-fire agreement came into effect. Exchanges of fire were to be halted at 0000 on 1 March and the Armenians were to begin withdrawing their military forces at 1000 in the morning. We acted accordingly and declared a cease-fire at 0000. However, they failed to withdraw their military forces at 1000 on 1 March. Russia's deputy defense minister arrived in Azerbaijan several days later. He did so after visiting Armenia. He informed us of the Armenian view that we must also withdraw from the front line. However, Paragraph 3 says that the Armenians must withdraw and leave our territory. They must go to Daghlyk Karabakh. They were not interested in withdrawing from our territories. That was not what was discussed and agreed upon. [Sherifov] The territory belongs to us. [Mamedov] Yes, the territory belongs to us. To where were we expected to withdraw? They must withdraw from our occupied territory. To where were we supposed to withdraw? Consequently, the talks failed to yield a result. [Sherifov] The Armenians violated the provisions of the cease-fire agreement, as they have done in the past. [Mamedov] Yes, that is right. They failed to comply with the provisions of that agreement. The chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet called his counterpart several days later. He informed him that he wished to meet him. I was there too. However, I did not attend the talks that were held between the two officials. Later, I heard everything they said in their disclosures. We held talks afterwards. The Armenian officials said that they agreed to comply with the agreement. They also said that they would move to withdraw from our territory within 20 days. I wish to reiterate that they said within 20 days. However, the chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet objected several days later. Meanwhile, the representatives of the Foreign and Defense Ministries of the two countries were working in Moscow. They were trying to find a peaceful way to resolve the problem. But that is another matter. The Azerbaijan Armed Forces must always serve and defend the homeland, regardless of whether a peaceful situation or a state of war exists. That is our duty. [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that the process of establishing the Army is continuing. [Mamedov] Yes, it is. Whether or not peace is established makes no difference. The Republic's Army must be established, and I am confident that it will be established. The Armenians exploited the situation in the past. They reached cease-fire agreements only to reassemble their military forces to launch new attacks to occupy our territory. The current situation is different. They recently tried to attack several times. However, they met with strong resistance and were forced to retreat after suffering casualties. [Sherifov] Cease-fire agreements were violated many times in the past. An effort was made to reach a new agreement each time. Do you have confidence in cease-fire agreements? [Mamedov] No, but a cease-fire agreement cannot be ruled out completely. The effort made to find a peaceful solution to the war cannot be abandoned. Therefore, an objection cannot be made. The territories that have been occupied through the use of armed force have to be liberated in a similar way. However, that objective may also be achieved through a peaceful approach. That would be appropriate. We do not wish to exploit the opportunities, but that does not apply to the Armenians. [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that they conclude cease-fire agreements to gain time? [Mamedov] That is right. That is what they did in the past. They exploited every opportunity to gain time to reorganize their military forces. However, we are aware of all Armenian tactics and do not wish to give them any opportunity. Had all the people concerned themselves with the war, we would have evicted them from Azerbaijan's territory a long time ago. [passage omitted]
