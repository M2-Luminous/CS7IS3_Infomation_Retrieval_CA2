[Kebich] Can you imagine entering your house and seeing that everything has been stolen? What would be the first reaction of any man? How to go on living? Where to find money? This is roughly what happened here. We had a union and good close ties. We did not have to think how to sell our products or from where to get raw materials -- everything worked perfectly. Then, we tore this union apart and found ourselves in a ransacked house. How could I resolve all these issues in these times of trouble? Every year I spent some four months in parliament arguing with lawmakers. You remember that as soon as I would enter the session hall, the issue of confidence in the government would be brought up; then lawmakers would demand a report on how we planned to overcome the crisis. It went on every minute of every day. Thus, it happened that we were in opposition to one another -- the Executive and Legislative Branches. We still do not have the vertical structure of executive power and the government cannot influence many processes in the Republic. That is why the president, who will have much greater powers, will be able to expeditiously implement his decisions and form that vertical structure. We need tough laws and their rapid implementation. [passage omitted] [Mikalay Shcherbachenya, Minsk RESPUBLIKA] The future of the society which you are going to build is primarily based on economic and political union with Russia. If you fail to form such a union, have you considered any other options? [Kebich] The building of the future society is not my idea alone -- we are building it and this is written in our Constitution. With regard to your question about union with Russia and possible options, I would be a weak politician if I burnt all my bridges behind me. There are other options, but I do not want to speak about them at this point. However I am positive and consider this the goal of the rest of my life to join our interests not only with Russia, but with Ukraine as well. If we agree to consider today as the starting point, I am sure that the union will definitely be formed within a year. [passage omitted] [Drazdow, NARODNAYA GAZETA] Russia itself, however, is speeding toward an abyss -- plants are closing down, chaos, inflation...[pauses] What is the sense of such unification? [Kebich] We are uniting our economies and not gangsterism, chaos, or bankrupt enterprises. On the contrary, we are getting access to good contacts. Russia's first deputy defense minister visited us some time long ago. He promised that Russia will provide contacts for all military enterprises. We will only take good things from Russia and leave all the bad things behind. [Uladzimir Lehankow, Minsk BELARUSSKAYA NIVA] Speaking about economic and monetary union -- discussions are being held over its fifth article. Has there been any progress in this direction? [Kebich] I declare that the fifth article will be amended and we will not tangle with the Constitution. President Yeltsin has promised that the Belarusian Bank will enjoy all the rights of a national bank. That is why the fifth article will be amended. [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter] What economic program do you suggest, being an outstanding economist and experienced politician. Will the Republic overcome the crisis by the end of 1994? [Kebich] There is a candidate who proposes a program worth two years of U.S. budgets, another one promises that as soon as he comes to power he will give each citizen $150. The closer the elections, the more generous the promises. However, I want to ask him: Where did he get those dollars? Was it a gift from someone? If it was a gift, what promises did he make to receive it? He does not have this money! That is why I want to say that by the end of 1994 we would like to stop the economic slump and improve the situation in 1995. That is why I want to say overtly and honestly: Do not believe those who promise you pie in the sky. [Reporter] How are you going to fight inflation? [Kebich] We cannot allow high unemployment. That is why to stabilize the situation we probably should not reduce inflation to 7 percent. We must curb it, and we have substantially curbed it. Everything should be done within reasonable limits.
