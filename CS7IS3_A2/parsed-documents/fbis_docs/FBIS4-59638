The Palestinian source said Nusaybah and al-Masri informed the PLO Executive Committee of their agreement on the appointment while 'Abd-Rabbuh asked a period of time to think the matter over before giving his final consent. With the appointment of those members, six other members are still to be appointed to the Palestinian National Authority Council, which consists of 24 members and is chaired by leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. Fifteen members of the council had already been appointed.
