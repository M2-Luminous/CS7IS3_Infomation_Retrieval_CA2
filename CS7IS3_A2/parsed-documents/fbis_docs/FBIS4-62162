"It is necessary to find out how do they correspond to the general settlement process which also includes Bosnian Serbs", he told TASS late on Thursday adding that "in particular, the size of the territory on which the parties plan to create the Croatian-Muslim federation needs an attentive consideration". The Russian envoy also said that the work of the "contact group" which spent two weeks in Bosnia-Herzegovina will become "an element of the general mosaic" to be discussed on Friday by foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five EU countries.
