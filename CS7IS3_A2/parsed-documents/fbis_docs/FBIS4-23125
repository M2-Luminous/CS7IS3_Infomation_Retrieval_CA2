FBIS TRENDS-24JUN94-SLOVAKIA Government's Minority Rights Bill Fails Government's Minority Rights Bill Fails SUMMARY Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's efforts to improve relations with the Hungarian minority suffered a setback when the government's legislation on using bilingual signs in Hungarian-populated areas was rejected by parliament. Vehement opposition from former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's party--the largest in parliament--and increasing pressure by Hungarian minority parties to make more concessions have dimmed prospects for easing interethnic tensions. END SUMMARY Possibly calculating that further efforts in behalf of the Hungarian minority would undercut his party's chances in the 30 September parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has indicated that other legislation to grant the Hungarian minority in southern Slovakia greater cultural autonomy might have to wait until after the elections. Following the parliament's rejection of the bilingual sign legislation on 3 June, the coalition parties announced that although they will reintroduce the bill in July, they will not make any concessions to Hungarian demands to widen the scope of the legislation (CTK, 17 June). On 14 June, Moravcik told Bratislava radio that a "solution" on the issue will most likely "be the responsibility of the future government" after the autumn elections. In an interview published in the 14 June edition of Budapest daily Nepszabadsag, Moravcik said that he "assumes" that "establishing conditions for" the signing of the European charter on minority issues will also be a "task for a new government." Apparently trying to gain support from Hungarian minority parties as well as improve relations with Hungary, Moravcik has attempted to improve on his predecessor Vladimir Meciar's tense relationship with the Hungarian minority. Shortly after he replaced Meciar in March, Moravcik announced that his governing coalition had agreed to offer some concessions to the Hungarian parties in exchange for their support of his "policy statement." Among the Hungarian demands were laws protecting Hungarian surnames and placenames and the establishment of special departments for minorities in the Education and Culture Ministries (Bratislava radio, 10 May). On 27 May, the government fulfilled the first of these demands by passing a law allowing Hungarians to enter names in local registers without the "ova" suffix normally used by Slovak women (SME, 28 May). When he introduced his policy statement to parliament, Moravcik said that his predecessor's "nurturing of national intolerance" was "alien" to Slovaks' "national character," adding that the creation of a "peaceful atmosphere" between citizens "of different ethnic backgrounds" is "of great value" (Bratislava radio, 12 April). Meciar Opposition Meciar has sought to use Moravcik's support for improving relations with the Hungarians against him by portraying the prime minister as an unwitting tool of foreign governments. Shortly after Moravcik's government was confirmed, Meciar accused it of coming to a "secret agreement" with the Hungarian parties that met "outrageous conditions" demanded by the Hungarians (CRK, 8 May). Following parliament's rejection of the proposed signpost law, Meciar accused Hungarians at home and abroad of "staking out" territory "by means of signposts" and called the government a "vassal" of Budapest (Slovenska Republika, 4 June). The 68 deputies--out of 150 in the parliament--from Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and its ally, the Slovak National Party (SNS) were instrumental in rejecting the signpost law and walked out of parliament in protest over the passage of an earlier bill on Hungarian surnames (CTK, 7 June; SME, 28 May). Hungarian Pressure Threatening to cut off vital support for the government, the Hungarian parties have put Moravcik under growing pressure to provide concessions to minorities. Tacit support from the two Hungarian parties represented in parliament--Coexistence with nine deputies and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) with five--has given the governing coalition a slim majority on many legislative issues. According to CTK, however, by either abstaining or voting against the signpost bill, three Coexistence deputies, protesting an amendment exempting villages named after Slovak historical figures, left the government one vote short of the number necessary to pass the law (CTK, 7 June). Coexistence chairman Miklos Duray linked his continued cooperation with the government to its ability to reach a compromise on the issue (CTK, 15 June). Although MKDH leader Vojtech Bugar, who is attempting to form an electoral coalition with Coexistence, had earlier condemned Duray's statement that the governing coalition was "not keeping its promises" to the Hungarians, MKDH leaders have recently echoed Duray's threat to withdraw support for the government. While Bugar had earlier stated that "even a blind person" could see that the agreement's points are being "successively fulfilled" (SME, 31 May), he asserted on 6 June that the government had "not yet fulfilled its promise" to set up minority deprtments in various ministries (SME, 7 June). Demanding that the government amend the signpost law to reflect the objections of the Hungarian dissenters, MKDH deputy Pal Farkas warned that "nobody can expect blind support from us" (CTK, 15 June). Implications With early parliamentary elections rapidly approaching, Moravcik's ability, and willingness, to pass legislation he had promised to the Hungarian parties appears to be limited. The issue of the government's relations with the Hungarians will likely be utilized by both Meciar, who is seeking to portray the governing coalition as a threat to the Slovak nation, and by the Hungarian parties, which could try to encourage a strong Hungarian turnout at the elections by playing an increasingly prominent political role. Under such pressures, Moravcik will find it difficult both to placate Hungarian demands in return for their support on vital legislative matters--such as a new privatization law--and to avoid any appearance of caving in to Hungarian demands right before the elections.
