Opposition leaders believe that the dismissal of the leadership of the Slovak Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) and the abolition of the Government's Office Control Department testify to efforts to paralyze the control system in Slovakia, Prokes said. The Slovak Parliament, at its last session, dismissed the NKU chairman and vice-chairmen. The abolition of the Control Department in the Government's Office stems from the law on state administration bodies passed by Parliament, according to which the Government's Office is no longer a state administrative organ. Former SNS deputy and NKU Deputy Chairman Petr Sokol believes that his dismissal was an act of political revenge. Sokol confirmed his intention to lodge a complaint with a civic court and not with the Constitutional Court because the dismissed members of the NKU leadership consider the approach adopted towards them illegal. Prokes said that the cancellation of the 13 privatization projects approved at the last session of Meciar's cabinet was an "international deception." It would be even bigger if "the next government would cancel the privatization projects of the current cabinet," he added. The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik had to cancel at least 13 privatization projects so as "not to lose face" given that it had consistently criticized Meciar for his steps in privatization, Prokes said.
