Chiang Tuesday [24 May] decorated the outgoing director of the German Trade Office Juergen Franzen for promoting trade and economic ties between Taiwan and Germany. Chiang said at the award ceremony that Franzen has contributed a great deal to trade relations between the two nations during his eight-year term as director. Trade between Taiwan and Germany hit U.S.$7.72 billion in 1993. Chiang said Franzen will be leaving for Singapore in June to serve as delegate of the German Industry and Commerce for the Asia Pacific region and Asian director and coordinator of the Asia Pacific Committee of German Business. He hoped that Franzen will continue to promote trade between the two nations and that bilateral trade would hit U.S.$10 billion soon. Franzen recalled the time when he first came to Taiwan in 1975 as a student. He said that he has witnessed the rapid economic growth of Taiwan and seen ties between Taiwan and Germany go from distant to close over the past two decades. German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Klaus Franke will assume Franzen's post in June.
