FR941117-2-00157 FR941117-2-00104 3. Is it appropriate in this investigation to focus on fatal crashes, fatal crashes in which there was a fire, and/or fatal crashes in which the fatalities are due to fire? Would other data provide a more appropriate basis for reaching a decision on these issues? 4. In ascertaining whether the design of the 1973&hyph;1987 GM pickups at issue here causes an increased risk of death and injury in accidents, is it appropriate to compare those pickups to other contemporary pickups (i.e., 1973&hyph;1987 Ford full-sized pickups)? To what other vehicles, if any, should these GM pickups be compared? Please explain. Issues Related to the Question of Unreasonable Risk 1. What factors should be considered in determining whether the design of the GM vehicles creates an ``unreasonable risk of death or injury'' due to post-crash fires? 2. In materials submitted to NHTSA, GM presented a series of vehicle fire rate comparisons in an effort to demonstrate that many other pairs of vehicles experience differences in the rate of fire-related fatalities that are greater than the difference between GM and Ford pickups. Do vehicle pair rate comparisons provide an appropriate basis for analyzing the issue of whether these vehicles present an unreasonable safety risk? If not, why not? If so, is the methodology used by GM the best way to analyze the issue? Are there better comparative rate methodologies for evaluating the existence of an unreasonable risk? 3. Is the overall safety record of a vehicle relevant to the issue of unreasonable risk when the alleged defect relates to a particular component or type of crash? If so, how relevant? 4. Are the extent of a manufacturer's awareness of a potential or ongoing safety risk, and the extent of a manufacturer's efforts to avoid that risk, relevant to the issue of whether an unreasonable risk exists? Is a manufacturer's failure to implement measures to mitigate or eliminate an increased safety risk relevant to that issue? 5. What weight should be given to the foregoing three factors, and any other relevant factors, in deciding whether a vehicle contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety? Other Information Sought 1. Additional information concerning post-crash fires in real-world crashes involving the GM vehicles covered by this investigation and comparable vehicles. 2. Additional information regarding GM's awareness of an increased risk of post-crash fires due to the placement of the fuel tanks outside of the frame rails of these trucks, both at the time of their design and afterward. 3. Additional information regarding efforts by GM to eliminate or mitigate any safety risk associated with the location of the fuel tanks in these vehicles, both at the time of their design and afterward. 4. Information regarding what remedy or remedies would be appropriate if the vehicles in question are finally determined to have a defect related to motor vehicle safety. As stated in the October 27 notice, persons wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Judy Taylor, Office of Defects Investigation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5326, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;2850, before the close of business on November 28, 1994. Written comments may be submitted to the same address and must be received not later than the beginning of the meeting on December 6, 1994. Because many people may be coming from other cities to appear at the public meeting, NHTSA intends to give each person who wishes to appear a reasonably precise idea of the day and time for his or her presentation. Therefore, the agency urges persons desiring to appear to notify Ms. Taylor as soon as possible in order to properly organize the meeting. Depending upon the number of persons who wish to appear, NHTSA may have to limit the time for each person's presentation or arrange for group appearances. Authority: 49 U.S.C. ยง30118.
