A tank battalion and a BMP [Infantry Fighting Vehicle] company surrendered and joined the forces of constitutional legitimacy and the protection of Yemeni unity. During the fierce battles on that axis, the aircraft of the rebellious secessionist gang made futile suicidal raids on our combat units and the city of al-Rahidah. The valiant anti-aircraft units confronted them and forced them to flee after downing two Sukhoi aircraft. The heroic men in our glorious Armed Forces are continuing their heroic acts and destroying the dens and fortresses of the forces of apostasy and secession, so the homeland of September and October will remain glorious and united with its constitutional agencies and its legitimate leadership, and with the cohesion of all members of the society in this glorious trench, the trench of freedom and justice, the trench of unity, democracy, progress, and prosperity.
