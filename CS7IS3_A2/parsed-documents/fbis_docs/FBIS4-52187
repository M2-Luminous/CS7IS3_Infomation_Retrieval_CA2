FBIS4-52187 "dreas089_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 North Korea ROK-Japan Plans for `Joint Countermove' Decried ROK-Japan Plans for `Joint Countermove' Decried SK0705110494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1051 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705110494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Foolish Dream"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet defence minister, Yi Pyong-tae, during his recent trip to Japan discussed a military "joint countermove" of South Korea and Japan with the director general of the Japan Defence Agency for "regional security", once again taking issue with the "nuclear issue" of the North. And, later, the traitor Kim Yong-sam in a "telephone conversation" with the new Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, pressed home the necessity for "close cooperation" between Japan, South Korea and the United States for a solution of the "nuclear issue" of the North. Commenting on this, an analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: The reckless military adventures committed by the traitor Kim Yong-sam against the North up until now surpass those of the successive South Korean military rulers. The South Korean puppets this time begged their Japanese master for "joint countermeasure" to harm and stifle the North under the pretext of its "nuclear issue". This is motivated by their intention to keep the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South Korea and persist in their confrontation with the North under their military support and in league with the Japanese aggression forces. "Cooperation" on the lips of the puppets means subordinate relations of tieup between the master and the South Korean traitorous forces. "Assistance" and "cooperation" "promised" by the U.S. and Japanese masters to the traitor Kim Yong-sam are all prompted by their sinister design to gratify their military strategical purpose in Asia-pacific without difficulty by putting them up as a shock force of aggression. The sycophant moves of such traitors as Kim Yong-sam who overshadows the "five traitors of 1905" now make it possible for the Japanese reactionaries to stretch their tentacles of reinvasion deeply into South Korea. The attempt of the South Korean puppets to overpower us with the help of outside forces is nothing but a foolish dream.
