In April, 1990, Pudong was listed by the Chinese central government as a development zone open to the outside world. In May 1992 the State Council put forward the strategy of making Pudong as the lead to promote economic development of the Chang Jiang River Valley. Since then, the provinces along the Chang Jiang, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan, have all taken the opportunity to speed up their own economic growth. By the end of 1993, these provinces had set up more than 300 agencies in Shanghai and nearly 2,000 enterprises from these provinces registered in the city have gone into operation, according to an official from the office of cooperation and coordination under the municipal government. In Pudong alone, the official said, about ten buildings with a total investment of two billion yuan (230 million U.S. dollars) have been jointly built by these provinces and Shanghai. Besides, over 600 construction teams from these provinces have been working in Shanghai. In 1993, 4.5 million tons of materials and commodities from Jiangsu Province was transferred at Shanghai. The province had also 760,000 tons of goods exported through Shanghai port. The value of materials Shanghai transferred for Hunan Province reached 65 million yuan. Various specialized markets established in Shanghai in recent years have become springboards for the provinces along the Chang Jiang to enter domestic and international markets. Among the members of the ten big commodity exchanges in Shanghai, such as for metals, petroleum and building materials, who came from outside Shanghai, nearly half came from the six provinces along the Chan Jiang. In addition, the stocks of 13 enterprises in the six provinces have been listed in the Shanghai Securities Exchange so far. In 1993, Shanghai's funds markets helped to provide the provinces with nearly 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars). By the end of 1993, Shanghai had invested 500 million yuan in building centers of raw materials in the provinces along the Chang Jiang and in supporting them to produce parts of the "Santana" sedan car for the car's chief plant in Shanghai. Hunan Province alone has signed with Shanghai contracts on over 500 cooperative projects. It has made use of 34 million yuan of funds and over 500 technical workers from Shanghai. These projects have helped Hunan Province to increase output value by 270 million yuan and additional pre-tax profits of 30 million yuan. Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, said recently that Shanghai would further expand its economic and technical cooperation with the provinces along the Chang Jiang in 1994.
