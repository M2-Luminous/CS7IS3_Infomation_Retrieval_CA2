Rangarajan, today proposed to bring it down by four percent before the end of the current financial year. Announcing the RBI's credit and monetary policy for the first six months of 1994-95, Dr Rangarajan said that banks had been asked to increase their Cash Reserve Ratio [CRR] from 14 percent to 15 percent in three phases. Also, the SLR [statutory liquidity ratio] would be reduced from 34.75 percent to 33.75 percent in two phases, he said. In a communication to the heads of commercial banks, the RBI stated that the increase in CRR by one percent would impound Rs 3,700 crores. The first phase, effective from June 11, would increase CRR from 14 percent to 14.5 percent; the second phase, beginning July 9, would increase it to 14.75 percent and third phase of 15 percent CRR would take effect on August 6. The proposed decrease in SLR from 34.75 percent to 34.25 percent would take effect from August 20 while it would come down to 33.75 percent in September. This would release Rs 2,600 crores which would help commercial banks with additional resources. The policy does not envisage any changes in the structure of interest rates. PTI adds: Describing the measures as a "tight policy", Dr Rangarajan said that with effect from May 16, the RBI had raised across-the-board the minimum margins on bank advances against pulses, oilseeds and vegetable oils and cotton and kapas by 15 percentage points. For commodities where there was a stipulation on the level of credit ceilings, the reference period was brought forward by one year to three years ending 1992-93 (November-October). The maximum term deposit rate on non-resident (external) rupee accounts has been reduced by one percentage point from the existing "not exceeding 11 percent" to "not exceeding 10 percent" from May 16. The banks would have flexibility, within the overall ceiling of five percent, to hold shares (including public sector undertakings equity) or debentures, with the abolishing of the sub-ceiling of 1.5 percent for holding of corporate shares. Dr Rangarajan also announced setting up of the Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI), a measure to activate the secondary market in Government securities, within the next couple of months. As per the definitional changes made in priority sector lending, the net funds provided by sponsor banks to regional rural banks would be treated as priority sector lendings and advances up to Rs 5 lakhs would be granted for financing distribution of inputs for activities allied to agriculture. The running account facility, under pre-shipment credit in foreign currency available to exporters of gems and jewellery, has been extended to other exporters with a good track record. The general line of Credit-I to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) for seasonal agricultural operations has been enhanced by Rs 400 crores to Rs 4,100 crores and to meet the increased need of the non-farm sector, the general line of credit-II has been enhanced by Rs 100 crores to Rs 750 crores.
