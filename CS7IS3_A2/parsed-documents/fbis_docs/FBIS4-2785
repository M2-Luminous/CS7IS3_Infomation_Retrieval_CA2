In 1991, the Hainan Provincial Government issued preliminary guidelines for retirement, job injury, unemployment and medical insurance coverage. The regulations have now been popularized, spreading from state-owned enterprises and some collectively-owned enterprises to all kinds of enterprises and institutions. The province has standardized insurance rates as a proportion of total salary figures. By the end of 1993, 9,298 enterprises, including 777 foreign-funded ones, had joined the insurance service system. About 732,000 employees will benefit from the services. In 1993, 189,964 retired employees in Hainan received pensions and 681 unemployed workers received relief funds from the service. At the end of last year, the Hainan Provincial People's Congress approved three sets of insurance regulations concerning retirement, job injury and unemployment. The regulations have extended their scope to government organs and self-employed businesses. Sources said that the insurance service system in Hainan has taken the lead in the development of the service in China.
