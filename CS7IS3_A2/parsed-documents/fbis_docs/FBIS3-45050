This is the highest fire death toll Guangdong Province has ever experienced since the beginning of reform and opening up, and also a disaster rarely seen in the whole country. Investigations have showed clearly that this is a major accident due to negligence, and both the foreign investors and the managerial staff of the Chinese side have unshirkable responsibility for the tragedy. Though there are only a small number of foreign-invested factories which, like Zhili, give no thought to the safety of workers, yet it has been learned that some foreign-invested enterprises, especially those operating on a small-scale, have been found to have various problems with labor protection, and they often infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of workers. For instance, the lack of labor safety devices in these enterprises has led to many industrial accidents, and the adverse labor environment has done great harm to the workers' health. In addition, many enterprises arbitrarily lengthen working hours and make most of their workers work extra shifts or hours; some arbitrarily reduce or embezzle part of workers' wages, and reduce or even cancel insurance and welfare allowances which should be extended to workers; while others punish and dismiss workers at will, and even exercise physical punishment, make body searches, and place their workers in confinement. All these will, undoubtedly, result in the resentment of workers and staff working in these enterprises, and trigger off a number of labor disputes. People in all walks of life also find things in these enterprises totally intolerable. The whole world has noticed that China is currently carrying out the principle of reform and opening up, and will go on with the principle for a long period of time to come. China opens its door wide to businessmen coming from outside the country. We extend warm welcome to foreign businessmen who make investments and run enterprises on the mainland, treat them with due respect, and try our best to make things convenient for them. Their wish to make money is tenable. Yet one thing they must bear in mind is that they must abide by Chinese laws, which includes rules and regulations on production safety and labor protection. China is a socialist country, and workers are masters of our country. By the same token, Chinese workers and staff working in foreign-invested enterprises are also masters of our country, and their political and economic rights and interests are protected by the Chinese Constitution and law. It is true that a small number of our workers did violate labor discipline, and some engaged themselves in little pilfering. What should we do with these people? We can cope with them in accordance with factory regulations, conduct criticism and education, hand down appropriate punishment, and even take their names off the books. However, no enterprise can set its regulations against Chinese law; and beating and cursing of workers at will, body searches, confinement, encroachment on personal freedom, and damage to personal dignity are not allowed by the law. Some foreign businessmen know very little about Chinese law. They believe that since the workers are hired hands, the boss and managerial executives of an enterprise can do anything they want to the workers. This is an extremely incorrect concept. Local governments and trade unions (if they have already been set up) of these enterprises should help foreign investors get familiar with relevant Chinese legal regulations, supervise implementation of these regulations, request amendments to any factory regulations that proves contrary to Chinese law, and ask for improvements to deficient conditions stipulated in labor contracts. While protecting the legitimate operation of foreign investors, we also need to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of our workers. On this issue, we should firmly speak what we must say, and stand firm on matters of principle. What we do will not scare away foreign investors; on the contrary, the number of labor disputes and various accidents can only be reduced when people stand firm on matters of principle and act in accordance with the law. Only by so doing can we base our cooperation with foreign businessmen on a solid foundation so that the cooperation can grow in a healthy way. Wise foreign businessmen also understand this point. Not long ago, two Japanese guests staying in the Shanghai Nikko Longbai Hotel suffered loss by theft. Two Chinese female workers working in the hotel came under suspicion of the hotel's Japanese managerial staff, who instigated others to conduct an illegal nude body search on the two female workers. Workers and staff of the hotel expressed their strong indignation, and urged relevant sources to handle such encroachments on personal rights in accordance with the law. In the end, the Japanese side dealt with the matter sternly: Among the three managerial staff involved, one was recalled back to his country, while the other two were punished by serious warnings and a six-month period of salary reduction; the general manager of the hotel was also given punishment of serious warning and a 10-month period of salary reduction. In addition, the hotel made an apology to the two victimized Chinese female workers and offered them financial compensation. In this way, the labor dispute was settled in a fairly satisfying manner. The way Nikko treats the mistakes made by their subordinates is worth using for reference by other foreign businessmen.
