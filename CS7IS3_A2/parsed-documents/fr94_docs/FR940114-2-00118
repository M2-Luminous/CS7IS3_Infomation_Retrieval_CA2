FR940114-2-00118 FR940114-2-00068 Bureau of Reclamation Coachella Canal Lining Project, Riverside and Imperial Counties, CA AGENCY: Bureau of Reclamation, Interior. ACTION: Notice of availability of the draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report: INT DES&hyph;94&hyph;03. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and section 21002 of the California Environmental Quality Act, Reclamation and the Coachella Valley Water District (Coachella) have issued a joint draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report (DEIS/DEIR) on a proposed canal lining project. The project involves lining the remaining unlined sections of the 70-foot-wide Coachella Canal between Siphons 7 and 14, and Siphons 15 and 32, while the canal continues to deliver irrigation water. The canal, which delivers Colorado River water to Coachella, lies in Riverside and Imperial Counties. The preferred alternative in the DEIS/DEIR is to line the existing canal while diverting the waterflow around the construction area by temporary pipes. Public Law 100&hyph;675 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to allow lining the unlined sections of canal in order to make the conserved water available in California. No Federal funds have been authorized for the project. In accordance with Public Law 100&hyph;675, Coachella and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California may provide non-Federal funding for the project under contract with the Secretary. Lining the canal would reduce seepage by approximately 31,000 acre-feet per year. Mitigation of impacts to wetlands habitat could require approximately 5,000 acre-feet per year from the canal, resulting in a net amount of approximately 26,000 acre-feet of conserved water per year. DATES: A 60-day public review period commences with the publication of this notice. Written comments on the document may be submitted to the regional director at the address below within the 60-day review period.
