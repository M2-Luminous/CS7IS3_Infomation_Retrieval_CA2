FBIS4-1338 "drafr080_cs94036" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 26 April 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Political Parties Run Final Campaign Advertisements Political Parties Run Final Campaign Advertisements Democratic Party Criticizes NP MB2404185694 MB2404185694 BFN [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 23-24 April on pages 7 and 9 carries two half-page election advertisements from the Democratic Party [DP]. The advertisements are printed on the lower right-hand corners of the pages. The page 7 advertisement says in large white letters across the top: "In 1989, these were the NP [National Party -- Nats] leaders whose government brought you detention without trial, crime, corruption and hit squads." Below this are two rows of photographs arranged around the date 1989. The photographs, with names printed underneath, are those of, top left to right; R. F. Botha, Minister of Foreign Affairs; F. W. de Klerk, State President; D. J. de Villiers, Minister for Administration and Privatization. Bottom left to right: H. J. Coetsee, Minister of Justice; G. S. Bartlett, Deputy Minister Economic Affairs and Technology; and R. P. Meyer, Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development and Planning. Below the photographs, again in large white letters, are the words: "Thankfully they're now the new National Party, and if you turn the page, you'll meet their new leaders." The print and photographs are set against a dark background. The page 9 advertisement carries at the top, in the same sequence, the same photographs of the same six people against a dark background in the same order, this time arranged around the date 1994. The ministers titles are now updated: D.J. de Villiers is identified as Minister for Public Enterprises, H.J Coetsee as Minister of Justice & of Defence and G.S Bartlett as Minister of Mineral & Energey Affairs. R.P Meyer is still identified as a deputy minister. Immediately below the photographs, in large white letters: "WORRYING ISN'T IT?" Below this runs a thick black line across the advertisement, with two columns of small printed text, the two columns enclosing the DP emblem in blue and yellow. The small-print text reads: "Look again. If FW de Klerk's `new' Nats look strangely familiar, it's because thirteen of the `new' Nats' top candidates were cabinet ministers or deputy ministers in the 1989 election -- and they've almost all been ministers, deputies, or MPs since the 1970's! These are the `new' Nats who, in 1989, promised to cut tax rates by five percent. Since then, income tax has nearly doubled. These are the `new' Nats who, since 1989, have allowed billions of rands of your money to be stolen and squandered by corrupt homeland governments. These are the `new' Nats who, in 1993, agreed to retain Detention Without Trial. Who, in another secret deal, offered the ANC the power to appoint its own judges to the land's highest courts. (Luckily the DP put a stop to this at negotiations). It's clear that FW de Klerk and his `new' Nats are just as inefficient and incapable of containing corruption as the `old' Nats. So when they promise to provide effective opposition after the election, there's good reason to be sceptical. In contrast, there's good reason to believe us when we say we'll provide effective opposition. After all, we've believed in the same principles for 35 years, so we're not about to abandon them now, when they're needed most. So vote for the Democratic Party. You'll find there's no better party on which to pin your hopes." Below the small-print text and DP emblem runs another thick black line, and below this, across the bottom of the advertisement, in large black print: "Democratic Party. Protecting you from the abuse of power."
