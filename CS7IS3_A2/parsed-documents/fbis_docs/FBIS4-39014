Russia is the only Commonwealth state that has not ratified the document. The hearings confirmed that the document corresponds to the Russian interests and aims to form common economic space in the Commonwealth to be based on market economy principles. The Russian government is offered to work for the creation of a free trade zone, customs and payment unions proceeding from the need to settle credit, monetary, currency and financial relations with the Commonwealth republics. Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin told correspondents that hundreds of Commonwealth agreements are inefficient. A new working body of the economic union should help to elaborate and implement cooperation documents, he said. Organizational economic structures of the Commonwealth are too weak, and Russia supports the initiative to create an inter-state economic committee, added Shokhin.
