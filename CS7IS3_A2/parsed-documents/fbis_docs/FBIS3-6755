Japan, going against the international trend toward detente, is accelerating its conversion into a military power and its nuclear armament and overseas expansion, thus coming to the fore as a new dangerous hotbed of war, the author of the article says, and goes on: Japan is pursuing the policy of strength behind the post-cold war scene. This is fully illustrated by the fact that the war-thirsty elements of Japan are making desperate efforts to establish a social system for a war of aggression. The Japanese rightwing conservative forces are scheming to revise the Constitution, while building up the "Self-Defence Forces" [SDF] into one of the leading aggression forces in the world through the systematic increase of military expenditures every year. Japan rattled "the bill on cooperation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation" through the Diet to legalize the overseas dispatch of the "SDF." Now it intends to create legal conditions for a war of aggression, crying for "the revision of the SDF law" and "the study and enactment of the law on the event of contingency." The nature of Japan as a new war force is glaringly revealed in its crackbrained rush for the building of a military power and its nuclear armament. Japan is far higher than any other Western countries in the rate of the increase of military expenditures. Now it has reached the second topmost rung on the global ladder of military spendings. The Japanese reactionaries are hastening at break-neck speed the increase of the fire power of the "SDF," its high-tech equipment and attainment of greater mobility and buildup of long-range operation capacity with stress on the qualitative reinforcement of the "SDF", not leaning too much to quantitative growth. Getting mad over overseas aggression, the Japanese militarists have reshaped the defensive structure of the "SDF" into an offensive one, adopted a forestalling-attack strategy in place of the "defence-oriented strategy" and expanded the operational sphere into extensive regions of Northeast Asia and the Pacific. It is nobody's secret that Japan's nuclear armament is near completion and its nuclear range will cover every part of the globe in the future. Japan, which appeared on the scene as a new war force, is now following in the footsteps of its defunct militarists who faced a stern judgment by history after launching into aggression under the cloak of "peace of the East." The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful that their policy of aggression and war will lead them to destruction.
