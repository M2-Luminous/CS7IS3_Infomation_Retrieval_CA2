He said that the enterprises' debts for gas ran to 15 trillion karbovantsy, and that was making it difficult for Ukraine to pay for gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan. A spokesman for the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers told Interfax Ukraine that the republic currently owed the Russian Gazprom joint stock company around 600 million US dollars. However, Gazprom was due to pay Ukraine 100 million dlrs for the transportation of Russian gas through Ukrainian territory. "A protocol signed by Vice-Premier Valentin Landik in Moscow in April states that our Russian partners and ourselves will make a monthly analysis of the repayment of the Ukrainian debt for gas," Kovalko said. He also said "despite the difficulties paying, Gazprom is, for the time being, supplying gas to the agreed volumes." Kovalko also said that "this will assist with preparations for next winter in that we can pump around 2 billion cubic meters of gas into our reservoirs."
