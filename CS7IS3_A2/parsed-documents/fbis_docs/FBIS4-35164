Among the experts of the region who addressed the event was Luis Lamas Puccio, who spoke for Peru on the problem of money laundering. The workshop recommended that the legalization of capital should be classified as a crime. He said this move should not be applied solely to drug trafficking money, but also to money obtained from other crimes. A series of mechanisms to identify this crime were made, as well as recommendations on bank secrecy to prevent banks and financial institutions from laundering ill-gotten money. It was also suggested that institutions controlled by banking, insurance, credit, and capital markets laws, together with enterprises engaged in construction, real estate, the marketing of vehicles, precious stones, and metals, and money exchange should help the government to identify ill-gotten assets. Mechanisms to control the marketing of real estate were also proposed. As for money laundering, the workshop recommended the drafting of a framework law based on OAS regulations regarding this crime, leaving each country of the region free to classify the crime and adopt punishments. Lastly, it was recommended that this framework law should include mechanisms, compatible with those of other countries, for the confiscation of assets obtained through money laundering and the legalization of capital, even at the request of another country.
