Responding to journalists questions at the inaugural function of Nathiagali Summer College here, the president said armed forces fully knew their responsibilities which they were fulfilling in accordance with the constitution and democratic system. The president was happy with the role being played by the armed forces. When a journalist said that those elements criticising the armed forces wanted army's interference in politics, Leghari dispelled such impression saying "there was no danger of any such interference." Asked about the need for a new legislation to check the criticism of the national institutions, including the armed forces, the president said: "Though the criticism was unfortunate but there are sufficient laws to deal with such criticism. However, if the government and legislators feel the need of more legislation, they can do the same", he pointed out. The president said continued dialogue between the opposition and government were a must for the functioning of the democratic system, Leghari said in his capacity as the president of Pakistan. It was his duty to help create harmony between the opposition and government. "It is important for democratic system to function. There should be dialogue between the government and opposition all the times", the president said adding "it will be his endeavour to create conditions to enable the democratic process to function. When reminded of the increased Indian defence budget, the president said: "we are also meeting Pakistan's defence needs". Asked about the Indian's alleged plan of a "limited war" against Pakistan, the president said: "Armed forces, government and people of Pakistan are fully capable of defending their motherland". "We know how to defend our country and our forces are fully capable to safeguard our frontiers", he concluded. Earlier, inaugurating the 19th International Nathiagali Summer College on physics and contemporary needs, the president said the freedom of thought and expression was a must for the promotion of science. A democratic order which guarantees freedom, provides a fertile soil for nurturing of science, he added. Repressive societies are not only intolerant of new ideas but in fact force creative minds to seek refugee in free societies which are more congenial and receptive to new ideas and initiatives, he added. He urged the scientists to strive to set up liberal and democratic traditions to discuss and debate the economic and technological problems facing the country and work out strategies to put Pakistan on a path of accelerated technological development. The president said systematic dialogue between leading scientists, technological experts, academicians and government functionaries had been initiated by him at the presidency and that he himself participated in the discussion. Nuclear programme: The president said Pakistan would continue to pursue its peaceful nuclear programme. "We are against nuclear proliferation and have no intention to develop nuclear weapons. Our government is firmly committed to establishing an equitable, non-discriminatory and non-proliferation regime in South Asia. Leghari said Pakistan had put forward several proposals for NPT in the South Asia but unfortunately India had not responded positively. "Pakistan will welcome and cooperate on any future proposal but its security concerns must be taken into account," he added. The president said Pakistan's nuclear programme was designed to help improve living standards of our people. We are in the process of setting up a major nuclear-based power plant at Chashma with the Chinese help. We will like to set up more nuclear power plants under IAEA safeguards, he added. Leghari said Pakistan was determined to press into service science and technology to make progress and provide reasonable living standards to its people. For this purpose he said, the government had doubled the allocation for science and increased the education budget by 45 percent. But this is not sufficient and more resources will have to be diverted for human resource development, he maintained. Earlier, Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed, chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission presented the address of welcome.
