FBIS3-4580 "dreas039_a_94036" FBIS-EAS-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ichikawa Interviewed on Party Realignment OW2602060194 OW2602060194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 2230 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a live 39-minute interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary of Komeito, by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, political commentator Kennichi Takemura, and Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studios. Kuroiwa asks Ichikawa about a realignment of the political parties and a cabinet reshuffle. Ichikawa responds: "I think it is nonsense to talk about a realignment of the political parties at the present stage. I have never consulted the prime minister about a cabinet reshuffle, but it is up to the prime minister." Ichikawa criticizes Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, saying: "At news conferences, the chief cabinet secretary has spoken of policy differences between the prime minister and his cabinet. The chief cabinet secretary has also spoken about important policy matters before the government and ruling coalition parties discuss them. His actions have created a rift within the ruling coalition parties, and this has been repeated on several occasions." Commenting on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa says: "I believe the cabinet will be reshuffled when the package of political bills are put into effect. There is a possibility the cabinet will be reshuffled before Diet deliberation of the 1994 budget bill begins." Discussing the scope of the cabinet reshuffle, Ichikawa states: "The cabinet reshuffle will not be confined to the replacement of the chief cabinet secretary. I believe many other cabinet members will be replaced." Discussing the formation of a new party, Ichikawa states: "Currently there is the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). We intend to fight in the elections by forming a new party which can take over the reigns of government." Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Sakigake (the Harbinger Party), and Komeito being merged into a new party, Ichikawa cites the difficulty involved in forming the present coalition government, but does not rule out the possibility, adding that the "SDPJ should have policies compatible with the key role it is playing in the coalition government." Commenting on Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's statement that Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the Democratic Socialist Party should field unified candidates in the next election to counter candidates running on the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito tickets, Ichikawa accuses Takemura of making such a statement, stating: "The chief cabinet secretary is in a position to hold the ruling coalition parties together. What is at issue is that he is going against the unity of the ruling coalition parties." Asked by Kuroiwa about Ozawa's vision for building Japan into an ordinary nation, Ichikawa replies: "Ozawa's vision envisions the far future." Discussing Japan's future contribution to the international community, Ichikawa says: "I believe Japan can make the contribution based only on the five principles of the PKO; this contribution can win the people's understanding."
