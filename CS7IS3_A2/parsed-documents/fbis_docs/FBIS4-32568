We decided to discuss this issue in detail and, if possible, to resolve it appropriately," said Lord Owen, cochairman of the conference on former Yugoslavia, today during his brief meeting with the press in Skopje. According to Owen, the European Union "is striving to prevent another war, in addition the Bosnian one, and that is the Serb-Croat war, which was one of the main items on the Corfu summit agenda, besides the situation in Ukraine." Owen said that Macedonia was discussed at the summit in connection with the cochairmen's and international envoys' efforts to organize direct negotiations with Greece and that Macedonia needs aid, economic aid in particular. "All of us involved in the negotiating process will support this," Lord Owen said.
