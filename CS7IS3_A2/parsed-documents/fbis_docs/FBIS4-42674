After the meeting, Yilmaz said that he and Erbakan had exchanged their views at a time when the government was weak. The RP leader, however, said that they had discussed how to eliminate the current mismanagement. The two leaders met in Yilmaz's office in Parliament following Erbakan's request for an appointment on Tuesday night. The chairmen agreed to adopt a joint stance against the coalition government's democratization package, which includes constitutional amendments. This situation has dashed the hope of the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), which gives utmost importance to the package. Since at least 300 votes are necessary for constitutional change, the coalition government, which has a total of 233 votes, has suffered a terrible blow, as it now seems unlikely that these changes will materialize. The fact that ANAP and the RP oppose the democratization package, which the SHP claims is the "only reason" why it has stayed in government, has put even the near future of the government at stake. At present, ANAP has 100 seats and the RP has 39 seats in Parliament. Despite the outside support of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the coalition parties have lost their chance to acquire the necessary 300 votes. After his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan spoke at his party's parliamentary group meeting. Noting that although ANAP and the RP had a total of 139 votes, there were more than 190 deputies who shared their views. "Those deputies are ready to topple the present government. Our colleagues in the DYP [True Path Party] and the SHP should help us in this," Erbakan said. Erbakan said that the government was trying to alter Turkey's agenda through the democratization package that was, to all intents and purposes, inadequate. He said that even Mumtaz Soysal from the SHP, professor of constitutional law, had described the package as such. Erbakan said his belief that Turkey needed a new government in order to overcome the existing situation had been supported by Yilmaz. Before his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan held "secret meetings" with some ANAP deputies, including Sadi Pehlivanoglu. The joint stance of the opposition parties and the intraparty conflicts within the coalition parties are expected to add to the speculation regarding the life span of the government.
