During the past three months, we have, in one way or another, witnessed or participated in the campaign to elect the new president of the Republic of Panama. During this time, we have seen and listened to, by virtue of multimillionaire political campaigns on television and other kinds, prepared statements, rehearsed poses and smiles, exaggerated promises, impossible assurances, election-time music, and the squandering of money to try to convince voters to favor one of the candidates. This stage, however, has now passed. The time to vote has come. In my long years as a lawyer, I have found that there is a factor that is absolutely necessary to have a good, working lawyer-client relation. That factor can be summed up in just one word: trust. To have trust, we have to know the professional. We must know his expertise, character, knowledge, experience, and courage and we must be convinced that he is not going to betray our interests. To govern a country, we need to know the same things, not only of the presidential candidate but also of those who accompany him on his ticket. Julia Suira is the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party's second vice presidential candidate. Julia Suira is an exceptional woman. She has dedicated 30 years of her life to the labor movement as a union leader in the clothing industry. She knows the intimate details of the Panamanian workers' toil, pain, sufferings, anguishes, and problems. With her, the Panamanian working class knows its interests will be protected, not betrayed, and that exploitation and abuses will not be allowed. Dr. Rodrigo Bernal is our candidate for the first vice presidency. He is a medical doctor with 40 years of experience in his field. His colleagues acknowledge that he is a pioneer in his specialty and he has had a spectacular professional life. His experience qualifies him to help us solve the health problems we will confront beginning 1 September. Dr. Bernal is a trusted man. I am a man who has practiced law for 34 years. My clients trust me. They trust me as all the people who have known me since I was a child do. My campaign manager and I have been friends for 43 years and I have never broken this trust. My first vice president and his brothers and I have been friends over 40 years and the trust has never been broken. All the people who approach me know my friends and clients trust me and that they will encounter generosity, affection, decency, and everything a man who can be trusted can offer. No one can say any of us has betrayed anyone. We give trust. In past statements, I announced I would shakeup [revolcon] everything that was wrong in this country. There were people who laughed at this expression and others said it was an unpolished one. Although I have explained this before, I want to say that shakeup is a true Spanish word. According to the Academy of the Spanish Language, in its first use it means to roll over [darle la vuelta a uno] and in its second use to defeat the enemy [vencer al adversario]. And this is what its all about. We mean to shakeup and defeat everything that is wrong in our country. The hour has come to shakeup our educational system because we have to improve our students' intellectual level and prepare them for the forthcoming century. The hour has come to shakeup public administration because it is necessary that we end corruption to make this a decent country so it can develop and be respected. The hour has come to shakeup the administration of justice because our judicial system has to be efficient, just, and expeditious. This will allow all our citizens to have confidence that the cases presented to the judicial branch are treated in accordance with the law. The hour has come to shakeup and defeat unemployment because we have to end poverty and underemployment in Panama. The hour has come to shakeup the health system because all Panamanians have the right to receive expeditious health services, not just when death is knocking at the door. The hour has come to shakeup everything that runs improperly in this country, in our Panama: garbage collection, street repairs, traffic chaos, prostitution, crime, drug trafficking, biased bidding processes, influence peddling, nepotism, lack of courtesy, lack of water, the high cost of electricity, in sum, all the things that need to be corrected to improve the catastrophic situation in which we find ourselves. The time for frivolities is over. There are six days to go before 8 May. We invite the Panamanians to start this shakeup on 8 May. Thank you.
