Taira Shibata, chairman of the Japan Civil Engineering Contractors Association and president of Nishimatsu Construction Co., told reporters the proposal to curb bids of less than fair value could restrict bid value and contravene the Antimonopoly Law. His comments were made in response to the request by Kenji Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors and president of Maeda Corp., on February 21. Shibata said fair value is difficult to define, since contractors sometimes cut their bids through active cost-reduction efforts. Low bids also mean more competitive bidding through measures to restrict the practice of bid rigging, Shibata said.
