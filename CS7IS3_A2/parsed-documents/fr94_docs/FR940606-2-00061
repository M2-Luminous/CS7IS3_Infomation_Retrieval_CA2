In our Final Rule, we retained class II annual reporting at a reduced level of detail as compared to the old Annual Report Form M. Before adoption of the Final Rule, no opportunity for public comment on the content of the Form M&hyph;2 was provided. For this reason, we are reopening this proceeding on our own motion to provide such an opportunity. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to, call or pick up in person from: Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 927&hyph;7428. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927&hyph;5721.] We conclude that implementation of our action to seek comments will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Form M&hyph;2 was adopted previously. This notice only affords interested persons an opportunity to offer comments. The Form M&hyph;2 contained in this notice will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (5 CFR 1320). Interested persons may direct comments concerning the paperwork burden and burden estimates of the Form M&hyph;2 to the OMB and ICC by addressing them to: Office of Management & Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Desk Officer for ICC (Forms 3120&hyph;), Washington, DC 20503.
