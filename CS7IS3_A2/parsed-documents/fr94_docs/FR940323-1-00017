FR940323-1-00017 FR940323-1-00005 •Add §§435.612 and 436.612 to incorporate the requirements for a State to establish income standards, and at State option, resource standards for these low-income groups and for applying methodologies to determine financial eligibility. •Revise §§435.608 and 436.608 to specify that the State agency must not require low-income pregnant women, infants, and children to apply for AFDC benefits as a condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. •Add a new §431.60 to specify the maintenance of specified AFDC payment levels as a condition of State plan approval. Revise §§435.1002 and 436.1002 to specify that FFP is not available for expenditures for Medicaid for optional groups of low-income pregnant women and infants covered under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) if the State has in effect AFDC payment levels that are less than the payment levels in effect under the plan on July 1, 1987. •Revise §440.250 on limits on comparability of services to provide that services to pregnant women in the mandatory and optional categorically needy low-income eligibility groups are limited to services related to pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning, and postpartum services) and to other conditions which may complicate pregnancy that are included under the approved State plan. •Add a new §447.60 to specify the requirements and conditions for imposing a monthly premium on the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants with family incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the poverty level and make conforming changes to §§447.50 and 447.51. Section 303(e) of MCCA added section 1902(r)(2) of the Act, which allows States to elect to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than the cash assistance methodologies for a number of eligibility groups, including the mandatory and optional categorically needy pregnant women, infants, and children in section 1902(l). On January 19, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 4908) regulations at §§435.601, 435.602, 436.601, and 436.602 to interpret section 1902(r)(2). The eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children described in this preamble are subject to the provisions of §§435.601, 435.602, 436.601, and 436.602. [ Note: On February 19, 1993, August 23, 1993, and February 18, 1994, we published notices in the Federal Register (58 FR 9120; 58 FR 44457; and 59 FR 8138) to delay the effective dates for the January 19, 1993 final rule. If, at the time we issue the final rule for these proposed regulations, the January 19, 1993 final regulations have been revised or are not in effect, we will make appropriate revisions.] We propose to add new §§435.612 and 436.612 to specify the requirements for establishing the income and resource standards for these groups and to cross-refer to §§435.601, 435.602, 436.601, and 436.602 for the methodologies to be used for determining financial eligibility. The group of low-income aged and disabled individuals discussed in section I.F. of this document also is subject to §§435.601, 435.602, 436.601 and 436.602. B. Continuous Eligibility of Pregnant Women Under section 1902(e)(6) of the Act, as added by section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87, section 302(e) of MCCA, and section 4603 of OBRA '90, States must treat any pregnant women who are eligible under section 1902(a)(10) as continuously eligible throughout the pregnancy and the postpartum period without regard to changes in income. Section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 added section 1902(e)(6) to the Act. Section 1902(e)(6) allowed States to treat any women who were described in sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) and 1902(1) as continuously eligible during the pregnancy and through a 60-day postpartum period, without regard to any changes in family income. Women covered under this provision consisted of two groups: low-income pregnant women and low-income women during the 60-day period after the pregnancy ends. Therefore, this provision covered women who applied for and became Medicaid eligible under section 1902(l) either before or after giving birth. Section 4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87 redefined the section 1902(e)(6) postpartum period to specify that the period of continued coverage extends for 60 days after the pregnancy ends, beginning on the last day of pregnancy, plus any remaining days in the month in which the 60th day occurs. The remaining days in the month provision was added by OBRA '87 for Federal matching payment and quality control purposes because, in some States, Medicaid eligibility is not terminated at any time other than the end of the month. Section 302(e) of MCCA amended section 1902(e)(6) of the Act to provide States with the option of treating any pregnant woman who has established eligibility under any eligibility group listed in section 1902(a)(10) and who, because of a change in income, would cease to be eligible, as a mandatory eligible low-income pregnant woman throughout the pregnancy and for the specified postpartum period, without regard to changes in family income. Section 1902(e)(6) now refers to ``pregnant women'' rather than ``women described in section 1902(l)(1).'' As a result, we believe it still covers the pregnant women described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) but no longer includes those women in section 1902(l)(1)(A) who first become eligible only in the 60-day postpartum period after they have ceased to be ``pregnant women.''
