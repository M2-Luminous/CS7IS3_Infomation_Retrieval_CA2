"Mr Mandela has moved about as far as he can towards meeting the Zulu leader's demands, and Mr Buthelezi is too wounded, too aggrieved, too defensive to risk a generous impulse. There is a chance of progress, but it's a slim, slim chance." Continuing, the editorial questions whether the talks that have been going on between the government, the African National Congress [ANC], and the Freedom Alliance truly qualify as negotiations and not simply "manipulation of public perceptions." At the end of the day, what the public must do is "brace" itself "for the probability that the election will go ahead without either Inkatha or the Conservative Party," and because support for the Freedom Alliance is not large enough to cause the boycott to "change the course of our history," the electorate must now deal with "the sombre prospect that they will try by terror and violence to achieve what they cannot do by democratic methods." Therefore, "the decent majority of voters must gather their courage and harden their determination to vote no matter what the threats or the terror inflicted by the violent minorities." SUNDAY NATION Plan Against Election Spoilers Urged -- "As the election campaign of the ANC reaches fever pitch, we hope the organisation has not relegated the importance of defending the country's democratic constitution after the April elections to the bottom rung of its priorities," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 February in a page-6 editorial. "We cannot recall in history anywhere in the world where there was a major rupture with an old political order and transfer of power without resistance from the old rulers." Because of this, "what is needed is a concrete contingency plan to thwart any attempt to prevent the democratic government from taking office."
