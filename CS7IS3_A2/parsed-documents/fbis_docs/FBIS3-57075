Suppositions appeared Friday [21 January] in the RESPUBLIKA newspaper. "He is definitely not in the staff of the service," well-informed sources said and added that the basic principles of the NSS remain unchanged -- former KGB leaders cannot be employed in Lithuanian security. Experts said, however, that Karinauskas may have been invited for consultations when certain structures of the NSS were being created. The 1st KGB department was engaged in espionage. Experts characterize Karinauskas as a "Western-minded" person, who has considerable experience of work abroad and is a "top level professional." Experts said Lithuanian national security services often lack such features.
