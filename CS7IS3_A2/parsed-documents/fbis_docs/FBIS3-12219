Israel's replies to these queries would help the organization decide its position regarding the continuation of the peace negotiations. The list of questions was handed to Major General Dani Rothschild by Palestinian delegate Sa'ib 'Urayqat. The questions deal with the confiscation of the settlers' weapons, the evacuation of the settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, and the stationing of an international force in the territories. At today's cabinet session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that Israel could meet the Palestinian demands on certain issues; however, other demands, such as the stationing of an international force in the territories, would be rejected.
