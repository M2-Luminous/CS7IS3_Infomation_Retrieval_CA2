The commanders will discuss illegal migration and drug trafficking across outside borders of the commonwealth states. They will also examine principles of cooperation in logistic supplies to border troops. The meeting will last two days. Turkmen president Saparmurat Niyazov received the commanders on Monday morning. At the reception, the Turkmen president pointed to the importance of political factors which, emerging under the influence of new processes, affect positively relations between neighbouring states. He instanced relations between Turkmenistan, on the one hand, Russia and Iran, on the other, which, "thanks to mutual respect and trust, opened a possibility to find ways for settling all problems, including border issues". Niyazov singled out the factor of inviolability of the present borders as a guarantee of peace and quietude, stressing that his recent talks with Iranian President Rafsanjani "revealed full concurrence of the two leaders' views on these and other issues of cooperation". "While touring the world, we saw that there were no borders with barbed wire anywhere. They remain only as a heritage of the former Soviet Union," Niyazov noted. He expressed hope in this connection that the present Ashgabat meeting and the following ones will bring closer the solution of problems existing on CIS borders.
