"The United States strongly support China's accession to the GATT and membership in the WTO (World Trade Organization). But we support China's accession on the basis of China's willingness to enter the GATT on the terms of the GATT. Where China's trade regime is not consistent with the GATT, it must change," Gardner told a session of the 27th international meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC). He said the U.S. wants to "see China emerge strong, prosperous and stable" and is seeking a "balanced way for our two countries to develop a sound, cooperative relationship". "We are working with China over our differences so we can move forward together. We want that effort to succeed," he added. To a question whether he sees it reasonable for China to be requested to undertake the obligations similar to that of the developed countries regarding China's reentry into the GATT, Gardner said the U.S. thinks that "there can be a transition time" and the U.S. is willing to negotiate about the matter.
