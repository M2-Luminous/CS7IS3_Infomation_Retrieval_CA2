COMERCIO E ACTUALIDADE magazine, which is published in Luanda, yesterday described as corrupt three ministers in the government headed by Marcolino Moco. Those ministers are: Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos, Territorial Administration Minister Paulo Kassoma, and Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance and social reintegration. COMERCIO E ACTUALIDADE magazine also reports that those three government officials have formed a building society that participated in the construction of four factories on the outskirts of Luanda costing the Angolan Treasury some $10 million. That magazine also accused Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos of having received a large commission from the recent importation of farming tractors. In addition to these developments, Roberto de Almeida, an MPLA-PT deputy to the National Assembly, has asked the government to open an inquiry into the recent importation of 300 Mercedes Benz vehicles intended for Luanda government officials. Roberto de Almeida described that measure as irresponsible and counterproductive in view of the country's current situation, marked by a deeply impoverished economy, serious food shortages, and a very high inflation rate.
