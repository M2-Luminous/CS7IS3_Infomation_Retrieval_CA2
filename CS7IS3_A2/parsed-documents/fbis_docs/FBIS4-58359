[Basindwah] I think certain elements of the party responsible for touching off the crisis will insist on maintaining it. They could have ended it when they got most of their demands. However, perhaps they want to remedy the situation, and perhaps they want more. Therefore, I expect the crisis to last for a long time, until it turns into an internal party dispute. Then, there will be a relaxation. [Al-Mu'ayyad] Will this relaxation prevent a military explosion? [Basindwah] The crisis could get worse and then abate again. Some limited military clashes could also take place. At worst, there might be individual assassinations. I can say for sure, however, that there will be no civil war or separation. Separation means war, and no one wants war in Yemen, unless God deprives sane people of their reason. Separation is a crime; civil war is a dire catastrophe. [Al-Mu'ayyad] It has been argued recently that a federation, rather than a merger of unity, is the only way out of the crisis and the guarantee to prevent separation. Is this an objective view? [Basindwah] With due respect to those who promote this view, I think that federation is the first step toward fragmentation and disunity. In addition, why do we need federation when we are one unified people who share the same origin, religion, and language. We do not have ethnic, religious, or native-language minorities. Let alone the fact that we have coalesced in one melting pot of long struggle, generation after generation, in view of our sense of unified national belonging. Yemen is one country, not two; one people, not two. The best evidence of the unity of land and people is that we used to view the north as one part, the south as another. We never regarded them as two countries or states, even when each of them was a separate state. In addition, why call for a confederation when the accord document stipulates that the country should be divided into regions, each enjoying local government. [Al-Mu'ayyad] Do you expect a new government to be formed to implement the accord document and restore order? [Basindwah] This might happen if the crisis continues unabated. [Al-Mu'ayyad] What about the mediation efforts being made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE]? [Basindwah] Their good offices are continuing. Ambassador Badr Hammam, the assistant foreign minister and envoy of the Egyptian president, has continued his meetings in Sanaa and Aden since his arrival in Yemen on this his third visit. Perhaps the purpose of his visit is to gauge conflicting views and determine points of agreement to crystallize a plan for reaching an agreement before calling any meeting. [passage omitted] [Al-Mu'ayyad] Has a date been fixed for a meeting between the president and the vice president, and when do you expect it? [Basindwah] The reason why the leaders in Cairo and Abu Dhabi are in no hurry to invite the president, his deputy, and Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, is because they want to make sure it will succeed, lest its failure should lead to more frustration on the part of the Yemeni people and the Arabs. There is no doubt, however, that Egypt and the UAE can help us overcome the crisis and heal the rift in the relationship between the parties of the ruling coalition. [passage omitted]
