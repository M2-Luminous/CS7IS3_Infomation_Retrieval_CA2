FR941220-1-00020 FR941220-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [CA82&hyph;1&hyph;6509; FRL&hyph;5125&hyph;4] Monterey Bay Ozone Nonattainment Area; Clean Air Act Section 182(f) Exemption Petition AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to approve a petition submitted by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) requesting that the Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area (Monterey Bay Area) be exempted from the requirement to implement oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). In accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act or CAA), the Monterey Bay Area may be exempted from the NO X reduction requirements where the Administrator determines that the net air quality benefits are greater in the absence of NO X reductions from the sources concerned or that additional NO X reductions would not contribute to attainment of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone in areas outside the ozone transport region (OTR). The MBUAPCD is using three years of ambient monitoring data to demonstrate that additional NO X reductions in the Monterey Bay Area would not contribute to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The EPA is proposing to exempt the Monterey Bay Area from the requirement to implement NO X RACT and the applicable NO X general and transportation conformity requirements. The EPA is proposing approval of this action under provisions of the CAA regarding plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing on or before January 19, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Chief, Stationary Source Rulemaking (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air & Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Copies of the exemption petition are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Applicability The MBUAPCD submitted the NO X exemption petition to EPA on April 26, 1994. Final approval of the petition exempts the Monterey Bay Area from implementing the NO X RACT and the NO X general and transportation conformity requirements of the CAA. Background On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO X emissions are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM (57 FR 55620) entitled, ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO X Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred to for further information on the NO X requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. Section 182(f) of the Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182 (c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These requirements are RACT and New Source Review (NSR) for major stationary sources in certain ozone nonattainment areas. The RACT requirements for major stationary sources of VOCs are contained in section 182(b)(2), while the NSR requirements are contained in section 182(a)(2)(C) and other provisions of section 182. Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document). There were no NO X CTGs issued before enactment, and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO X sources since enactment of the CAA. Section 182(a)(2)(C) requires submittal of NSR rules incorporating the new preconstruction permitting requirements for new or modified sources. The RACT and NSR rules were required to be submitted by November 15, 1992. The Monterey Bay Area is classified as a moderate 1 nonattainment area for ozone; therefore this area is subject to the RACT and NSR requirements cited above and the November 15, 1992 deadline. On April 21, 1993 the State of California was issued a finding of nonsubmittal for MBUAPCD for the section 182(f) NO X RACT requirements. 1 The Monterey Bay Area was redesignated nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The MBUAPCD identified two categories for which major stationary sources of NO X exist and rules are required. These categories apply to NO X emissions from utility power boilers and minerals processing kilns. The MBUAPCD submitted Rule 431, Emissions from Utility Power Boilers on November 18, 1993, and Rule 435, Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Kilns on September 28, 1994. The rules were found complete by EPA on December 27, 1993 and October 21, 1994, respectively, and EPA stopped the 18-month sanctions clock for the NO X RACT requirements on October 21, 1994. On April 26, 1994, the MBUAPCD submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the Monterey Bay Area be exempted from the requirement to implement the NO X RACT measures pursuant to section 182(f) of the CAA. On July 21, 1994, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments requested that EPA also grant an exemption from the NO X conformity requirements, also pursuant to section 182(f) of the CAA. The exemption request is based on three years of clean monitoring data from 1991 through 1993.
