Male and female citizens; on the occasion of the advent of 'Id al- Fitr it gives me pleasure to convey to you my most sincere greetings. We ask that God may bring us to the next 'Id with prosperity and blessings and that he will inspire us with the wisdom and ability to serve the country and restore tranquillity and prosperity to our people, and security and stability to our country which is experiencing a difficult period in its history. Brothers and sisters; I have had the opportunity to stress that Algeria is in need of all its faithful sons who are earnestly concerned for it and are eager to restore it to its true place among nations, and who do not spare themselves on its behalf. [passage omitted] Thanks to these sacrifices the country will be victorious over its enemies who are criminals, traitors, and mercenaries. On behalf of the state and in my own name, I express to them full and effective solidarity with them. I also express the solidarity of the state and its officials with the Armed Forces staff, the security men, and all the sections of society, the women and men who are still loyal to the covenant of 1 November 1956 [outbreak of the armed revolution]. Citizens, men and women; the month of Ramadan which is considered as one of the pillars of our holy religion has been spent by the Algerian people in difficult circumstances as a result of violence, and in the climate of an acute economic crisis. However, our people have been able to overcome these trials thanks to the strength of its faith, its love for its homeland, and attachment to its unity. The faith and determination of the Algerian people are the two pillars on which the action of the state is based in order to entrench a new era beneficial to all Algerians. Brothers, sisters; I will continue work relentlessly and without any hesitation to reinforce the institutions of the state, restore security, and realize national concord and solidarity between all Algerians, and in order to undertake the reforms liable to revive the national economy. In this framework, we will also continue the fight against violence and criminality on the one hand, and promote serious dialogue with all the parties that respect the Constitution on the other, with a view to restoring stability to the country.
