He added that the West is trying to deny the Serbs their right to self-defense. "They passed their resolution to ban flights, even for pregnant women and wounded and exhausted people. They do not even think of opening Serb airports, although they want to open Tuzla airport, through which they would send vast quantities of weapons, ammunition, and mercenaries to the Muslims," he said in an interview to KRAJISKI VOJNIK. "We are going to discuss Tuzla airport bilaterally as well as with representatives of the international community in the context of making Banja Luka airport and other airports in the Srpska republic operational," is his categorical message in the interview which the magazine of the 1st Krajina Corps will publish toward the end of this week. In his words, the West "will do many things although they do not need Tuzla airport since they are already successfully using the airport in Ancona, Frankfurt, and so forth. Every day and night they are airdropping everything the Muslims need. They are delivering the same things through all kinds of convoys." In Mladic's opinion, the West will take advantage of the fabricated problem of Tuzla airport in order to bring pressure to bear on Serb policies, the Serb people, and their army. "The West is implementing its plan for dismantling the former Yugoslavia and crushing the resistance of our people in various ways, devised in protracted wars in Africa, Asia, and other continents." Mladic is of the opinion that the West believes in its own mission of arranging the world in line with its criteria. If what they have done thus far is anything to go by, we can expect new threats, he said. Asked about the NATO ultimatum, he said that there is a great deal of manipulation surrounding this word: "At a meeting with General Jean Cot I saw NATO's decision. It does not mention the word ultimatum. Nor is it addressed to the Serb side alone ... NATO had no reason to take such decisions or to issue ultimata to the Serb side because the Serb people have not declared war on anyone, because the Serb people are conducting this war in the same way they conducted previous wars -- following a declaration of war by our previous neighbors under the conductor's baton of their sponsors among the ranks of German and Islamic countries." "I believe that the West has not `learned a lesson from its disgrace' in saying that a state that was a founding member of the United Nations no longer exists and that its external borders are no longer valid, which denies the Serb people's right to have its own state, although it had a state long before those who are now deciding our fate." Speaking about having placed the Serb artillery under UN control, General Mladic stressed that the Serb side has again displayed a maximum of understanding to find a solution to the crisis in a peaceful way within the UN Security Council. "... Our weapons will be under UN control, which does not mean that we will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will defend ourselves with all means at our disposal and ... the guarantee of our survival is not someone's will, but our force and our unity." Asked whether NATO air strikes against Muslim and Croat positions are possible, Mladic replied he does not think so, because "they cannot strike against their satellites." "They are their extended arm," he said. "Muslims and Croats were trained in their countries and are carrying out their tasks in the Balkans. It is true that they started fighting between themselves, but the West will calm them down in another way. They have other trump cards for them." Mladic assessed the deployment of Russian UN troops in Sarajevo as "a significant event in the international political arena," saying that a major power is rightly at the center of developments. The presence of the regular Croatian Army in former Bosnia-Herzegovina is worrying and the situation cannot be resolved until these forces are withdrawn outside the borders of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. "By pursuing the disastrous Croatian Democratic Community policy and by resurrecting the ustasha movement on the territory of former Croatia, the Croats brought the Serb people into an unenviable position by attacking them. But neither are the Croat people in a better position, because on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina they live in 14 separate enclaves, forced to fight," General Mladic concluded.
