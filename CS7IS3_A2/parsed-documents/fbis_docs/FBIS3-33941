Ya'ir Fidel, our economic correspondent in Tel Aviv, was apprised of this fact by a business source connected to the political process. This sum will furnish one-third of the Palestinian authority's budget. The source of the money will be port taxes, fuel surcharges, other taxes, and national insurance dues, which will be collected for the Palestinians by Israel.
