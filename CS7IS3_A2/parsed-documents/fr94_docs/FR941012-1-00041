FR941012-1-00041 FR941012-1-00009 CMVs that are in compliance with safety and size and weight regulations and have their administrative paperwork in order have an opportunity to greatly increase inspection efficiency and effectiveness. Information on the status of a CMV's registration, safety inspection, and operating permits, can be encoded and transmitted to the POE as an electronic signal via an automatic vehicle identification (AVI) transponder carried in the CMV. The POE's receiver would decode the signal, and officials would review the CMV's status on the spot. Drivers whose CMVs' safety status or administrative records needed to be reviewed would receive a signal to enter the POE or weigh station. Drivers whose CMVs are in compliance may receive a signal to bypass the site. However, they may still be required to enter for a safety inspection. The outcome would be a more selective review process which would enable POE officials to focus their resources to deal with vehicles with safety and size and weight infractions or vehicles that are not in compliance with other administrative requirements. Use of AVI transponders would also provide economic benefits by saving motor carriers time, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement, reducing paperwork, and increasing uniformity of enforcement. Environmental benefits would be gained from fuel savings and reduced CMV emissions. The goals of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are to reduce congestion, increase efficiency, and enhance the safety of users of major highway corridors through the application of a network of advanced highway, vehicle, and communications technologies. Both programs are multi-State partnerships of public and private sector interests. ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, currently in progress, and HELP/CRESCENT, completed in late 1993, were two of the first in a planned series of operational tests within the Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO) element of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Program (formerly known as the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) program). HELP builds on the foundation of the multistate, multinational CRESCENT research effort to design and test a heavy vehicle monitoring system that integrates automatic vehicle identification, classification, and weigh-in-motion. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs will allow CMVs which are equipped with transponders, and which are in compliance with safety and administrative requirements, to travel any segment of their respective instrumented highways at mainline speeds with minimal stopping at weight/inspection checkpoints. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, electronic clearance decisions at points along the corridor will be based on the information obtained at the point on the corridor where the vehicle first enters, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials and safety records in each State. For HELP, the electronic clearance decisions will be based on data collected from weigh-in-motion devices embedded in the mainline highway pavement or on bypass ramps, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials and safety records. ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 covers the entire length of I&hyph;75 and Canadian Highway 401 (Ontario). The HELP/CRESCENT demonstration operated along the I&hyph;5 and I&hyph;10 corridors in several western States from Washington to Texas. Under HELP, the former CRESCENT highway corridors are being expanded to include segments in Utah and Colorado. AVI Device The AVI device proposed for use in both programs is an electronic transponder designed to send and receive signals from a CMV to POEs and safety inspection sites. The signals contain information such as the identity of the motor carrier, the gross weight of the vehicle, and the status of the vehicle's registration and fuel tax payments. The transponder only transmits when it is in the immediate vicinity of a licensed transmitter and is directed to do so by that licensed transmitter under the provisions of 47 CFR 90.239. When an inspection official decides whether the vehicle should enter or bypass the POE, a signal is transmitted from the official's workstation to the CMV. This is displayed to the CMV driver in the form of a clearly visible signal from red and green lamps on the transponder's face. The transponder also provides an audible signal to the driver. The transponder measures 3.3 inches (84 mm) high by 4.4 inches (112 mm) wide by 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep.
