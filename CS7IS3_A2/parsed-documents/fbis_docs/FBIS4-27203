Ichikawa, arch ally of coalition architect Ichiro Ozawa, told a news conference, "I cannot approve of a reconfiguration of the current administration only to achieve the goal of enticing the SDP back into the coalition fold." The veteran politician was commenting on a decision by the SDP during a meeting in Tokyo of local representatives nationwide to try to reintegrate itself into the government if the current coalition agrees to replace its cabinet lineup with a new one. The SDP meeting adopted the strategy of forcing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to disband his minority cabinet by offering to marshal 74 SDP legislators behind his administration and transform it into a stable majority government. The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 over the secret formation of a large non-SDP parliamentary voting bloc in the House of Representatives. Ichikawa expressed opposition to an SDP threat to support a possible no-confidence motion against the Hata administration unless Hata agrees to voluntarily disband his cabinet. A no-confidence motion, if approved by a majority of the lower chamber, would force Hata to choose between disbanding the cabinet or calling a snap general election. "Forcing a dissolution of the lower chamber while the current multiseat constituency system is still in place would amount to crushing reform, whatever rationale they may cite for it," he said. Ichikawa expressed irritation at burgeoning rumors that some quarters in the SDP may take advantage of the popularity of incumbent Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to marshal liberal and left-leaning politicians behind him in a new political party. Yokomichi "should give up the governorship immediately by suspending his term as governor responsible for administration for the prefecture of Hokkaido, if he wants to enter the central political community," he said. "Unless Yokomichi speaks from his heart (about the political agenda), it is pointless to speculate (on his move)," Ichikawa said.
