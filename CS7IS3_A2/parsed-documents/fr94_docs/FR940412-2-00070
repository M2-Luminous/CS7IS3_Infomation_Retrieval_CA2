Take notice that on March 31, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised sheets: First Revised Sheet No. 23, First Revised Sheet No. 24, First Revised Sheet No. 25, First Revised Sheet No. 26, Southern states that the above-referenced tariff sheets are being filed with a proposed effective date of May 1, 1994, in compliance with the requirements of the Stipulation and Agreement approved by Commission order on March 23, 1989 in Docket Nos. RP83&hyph;58&hyph;000, et al. Southern states that the proposed tariff sheets reflect adjustments to Southern's fixed take-or-pay surcharge in order to reconcile projected interest recovered during the past twelve-month period with Commission prescribed interest rates in effect during the period, and to remove tariff sheets to recover Southern's fixed take-or-pay surcharge attributable to settlement payments made directly by Southern. Southern states that copies of Southern's filing were served upon Southern's customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of Southern's filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
