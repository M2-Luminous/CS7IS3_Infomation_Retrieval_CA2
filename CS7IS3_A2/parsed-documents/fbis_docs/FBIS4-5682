The Agency of Energy and Natural Resources of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) summoned Kashima President Hachiro Obata to deliver the warning over the company's 152.5 billion yen worth of loss, agency officials said. The agency told Obata to prevent a similar recurrence and devise company restructuring plans soon, the officials said. Wild fluctuations in yen-dollar rates since the mid-1980s have made forward exchange trading often risky and many oil firms, including Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., have reported huge losses from such deals. Showa Shell's loss, disclosed in February 1993, prompted a MITI hearing on other oil distributors and refiners, but Kashima failed to report its losses at that time.
