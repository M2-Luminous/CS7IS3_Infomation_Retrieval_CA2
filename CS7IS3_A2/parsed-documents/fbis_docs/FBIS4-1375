Although the operation of disarming people possessing weapons illegally has already begun, these weapons and people possessing guns continue to cause damages. Yesterday, three rockets landed in the area of Ngagara, a quarter neighboring the militias' stronghold of Kamenge where the disarmament operation has begun. One of the rockets reached a house and it smashed its roof which collapsed into the living room but causing no casualties although two persons were inside the house. The remainder of the rocket touched another house across the street and made a hole in the roof. The two other rockets exploded in the air and made no damage. In the southern part of the capital, gunfires heard over the weekend had caused unrest in the areas of Musaga and (Kanyosha), and some people may have already been killed. All began with gunfires which were heard and compelled the Hutu population to flee, thinking it was the militaries who were shooting. On seeing this movement, the youth belonging mainly to the Tutsi group began to loot the deserted houses. Then the Hutus came back to retaliate and killed one young man, a killing which gave way to generalised insecurity in the whole area. Until late yesterday, tension remained high but the situation was calm this morning.
