Itamaraty's priority is to expedite the Geneva talks aimed at achieving a complete ban on nuclear tests. Itamaraty has instructed the Brazilian negotiators to take steps to ensure that the treaty addresses the ban on two fronts: on the one hand, to prohibit countries that still do not have nuclear weapons from making tests with a view to mastering the technology; and on the other, to prohibit countries that have already mastered the technology from making tests to develop new generations of nuclear weapons. Heading the group of 21 developing countries at the Geneva talks, the Brazilian Government believes the treaty on the ban of nuclear tests will be concluded early in 1995. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: "We hope the stumbling blocks standing in the way of the agreement will be rapidly removed so we may all contribute to having mankind eliminate the nuclear threat." Countries like Great Britain, France, and China have objected to the ban on nuclear tests at the Geneva talks.
