They opted to determine first how a United Nations-sponsored arms register would fare out. Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino, who attended the recent special ASEAN senior officials meeting in Bangkok, reported that ASEAN member-states have taken a cautious stand on the Philippine proposal since it was wider in scope than the existing UN arms monitoring mechanisms. "More or less we felt that the UN arms register should be allowed to see how it works first," Severino said. The UN arms register is limited to monitoring exports and imports of major weapons system such as missiles, tanks, and combat aircraft. The Philippine proposal includes the exchange of information among ASEAN member-states on the indigenous production of conventional arms systems and military expenditures.
