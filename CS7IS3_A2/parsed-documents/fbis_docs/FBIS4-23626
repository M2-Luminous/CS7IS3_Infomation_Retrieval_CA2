Around 80 policemen armed with assault rifles burst into the group's premises in the northern suburb of Ikeja and ordered all personnel out of the offices and cut off all access to the building, an AFP correspondent at the scene reported. The Concord, the group's flagship daily, has stepped up its criticism of Nigeria's military regime over the past week, calling for the restoration of democracy and the formation of a government of national unity under Abiola. The millionaire businessman, widely seen as having won the presidential poll on June 12, 1993 that was subsequently annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, was preparing to declare an alternative government when he was placed under house arrest early Saturday morning. The Concord group comprises around a dozen publications.
