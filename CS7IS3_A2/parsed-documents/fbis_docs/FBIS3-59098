In a speech delivered to businessmen in The Hague, he urged that countries bound to the EC with association agreements should be welcomed into the Community as full members. A text of the speech was distributed here. Brittan said that the association agreements signed by the EC in 1992 with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria would create a free trade area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea. But he said it was crucial that the Community open its markets wider to East Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union to promote economic progress, democracy and stability there. "The future of the European Community itself depends on integrating (East European) countries into a prosperous and stable common future. It is as much in our interest as theirs," Brittan said. Brittan also called on EC countries to retain faith in their target of a single currency, to work harder on aligning their economies, and to lower interest rates to promote economic recovery.
