FR941227-2-00144 FR941227-2-00093 5. On or about December 19, 1985, Drexel and Mr. Trotman consented to the entry of a final judgment and order of permanent injunction (the ``Injunction'') in an action commenced by the SEC. Civil Action No. 85&hyph;9855 (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York). The activities forming the basis for the Injunction took place from approximately November 1981 to June 14, 1982, during which time Drexel acted as co-lead manager for two public offerings of securities issued by Flight Transportation Corporation (``Flight''). The SEC's complaint alleged that Drexel and Mr. Trotman violated sections 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with Drexel's due diligence investigation for the underwriting of approximately $25.6 million of securities issued by Flight in June 1982. The complaint alleged that the registration statement Flight filed with the SEC for these securities contained materially false and misleading statements relating to the group charter business, including among other things, the statement that Flight's $23 million group charter business comprised approximately one-third of Flight's revenues, when, in fact, the group charter business did not and never had existed. The complaint alleged that Drexel and Mr. Trotman placed undue reliance on the statements of Flight's management and failed to verify independently the existence of Flight's group charger business by not contacting the customers or suppliers of the group charter business. The terms of the Injunction required Mr. Trotman to submit his due diligence work for review by Drexel's underwriting assistance committee for a period of four months and for Drexel to submit its written due diligence procedures for review by outside counsel for an opinion as to the adequacy of the procedures. 6. On December 20, 1985, the SEC issued a temporary order under section 9(c) of the Act which exempted Drexel from section 9(a) with respect to the Injunction. On February 24, 1986, the SEC granted Drexel a permanent order under section 9(c) of the Act. 2 2 Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 14862 (Dec. 20, 1985) (notice and temporary order) and 14954 (Feb. 24, 1986) (permanent order). 7. In 1990, Kidder proposed to hire Mr. Trotman as co-head of its health care group. On May 24, 1990, the SEC issued a temporary order under section 9(c) granting Kidder relief from the prohibitions of section 9(a) resulting from the Injunction. On June 20, 1990, the SEC granted Kidder a permanent order under section 9(c). 3 3 Kidder, Peabody & Company, Inc., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 17509 (May 24, 1990) (notice and temporary order) and 17545 (June 20, 1990) (permanent order). 8. In the capacity of his employment with PaineWebber, Mr. Trotman would be expected to advise and assist PaineWebber's corporate clients with their corporate financing, acquisition, and disposition needs. Together with a team of investment banking specialists, Mr. Trotman would solicit investment banking clients, perform due diligence investments of corporation in connection with proposed underwritings, acquisitions, or dispositions, work with counsel to prepare underwriting documents, solicit prospective investors in connection with securities offerings, and structure, price, and otherwise negotiate the terms of securities offerings. 9. PaineWebber requests: (a) a temporary order exempting it from the provisions of section 9(a) for a period of up to 90 days following the date of the order to relieve it from any ineligibility under section 9(a) by reason of the employment by applicant of Mr. Trotman; and (b) a permanent order granting the request relief. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person from acting in the capacity of employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor for any registered investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment trust, or registered face-amount certificate company, if such person is, by reason of any misconduct, permanently or temporarily enjoined from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. A company with an employee or other affiliated person ineligible to serve in any of these capacities under section 9(a)(2) is similarly ineligible by reason of section 9(a)(3).
