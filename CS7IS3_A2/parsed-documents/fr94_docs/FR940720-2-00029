FR940720-2-00029 FR940720-2-00020 Financial Assistance Award: Dr. Carl A. MacCarley AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94CE15583 to Dr. Carl A. MacCarley. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $99,886 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of an indirect sensing technique for closed-loop diesel fuel quantity control. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by Dr. Carl A. MacCarley is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The inventor, Dr. Carl A. MacCarley, who will be principal investigator, will use his existing facilities for electronics development and vehicle system fitting. In addition preliminary testing will be done at California State Polytechnic University by special arrangements. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.
