He was reacting to the 45th Sudeten German congress held in Nuremberg last weekend, at which German Finance Minister and chairman of the government Christian Social Union (CSU), Theo Waigel, expressed himself for the abolition of the Benes decrees. This idea was also supported by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber and chairman of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft Franz Neubauer. Mock and Neubauer referred to earlier statements by Havel. "President Vaclav Havel declared his resolute stance -- that it was impossible to abolish the Benes decrees -- even in his statement mentioned" (at the Nuremberg congress), Spacek said. He added that quotations of Havel at the congress were inaccurate. To prove this, Spacek recalled a statement made by Havel during his visit to Austria in March 1993, in which the Czech president said: "Given the time interval separating us from the issuing of the decrees, my stance towards them is critical, but this does not mean that these ancient legal acts can be simply annulled or abolished." Spacek said it would be premature to evaluate the Nuremberg congress in the nearest days, and therefore Havel could not be expected to do so.
