Li Chien-chuan, director of the Fisheries Department of the Council of Agriculture, said that there are currently 117 Taiwan fishing boats operating in squid fishing grounds near Argentina. He said 42 are licensed by the Falkland Islands, 39 are licensed by Argentina, and the remaining 36 have licenses from neither Argentina nor the Falkland Islands and can only operate in international waters. Li urged the unlicensed ships to stay away from Falkland Island and Argentine waters to avoid being attacked. His remarks followed the attack last Friday by the Argentine Navy on a Taiwan fishing boat that had allegedly been poaching in Argentine waters. The Kaohsiung-based fishing boat, the Chin Yuan Hsing, reportedly sank off the coast of San Julian after being attacked, and its crewmembers were rescued by another nearby Taiwan fishing boat, the Chin Chuan Hsing. Taiwan Government officials are still investigating the incident. Li said that the government will take action only after a full investigation is completed.
