They are bringing new forces and hardware all the time and are constantly attacking Bihac and the Cazin commune. (?Four) brigades of the Serbian aggressor reinforced with police units from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Drvar, and 200 artillery pieces of various kinds have already been on the offensive for five days now, destroying civilian facilities and (?pounding) every millimeter of the defense line. The attacks with 155-mm howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, tanks, and mortars of all calibers are horrific, but the defenders, who are defending the Bihac region and Bosnia- Herzegovina bare-handed, have put up heroic resistance. In brief, this is the picture of what happened on the (?Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac last night and this morning. The chetniks are attacking in waves, treading over their dead comrades, and leaving them behind. This illustrates sufficiently that their intentions are to enter Bihac. There is hand-to-hand fighting. According to the old recipe, the chetniks are trying to make up for every failure to breach the lines by attacking civilian facilities. According to the unconfirmed reports, several civilians have been wounded. Some of them have been killed. There are a large number of wounded defenders. Material damage is immeasurable. The Assembly of the Bihac Commune and the Command of the 5th Corps have again contacted the UN and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] vehemently protesting, reminding the sleepy international community of the fact that it has declared this very region to be a protected zone, of Resolution 836, of the bloody rampage of the Serbian aggressor, and of the suffering of the innocent. Stocks of food have long ago run out. The overcrowded hospitals are without medicines. Humanitarian aid has not arrived for a long time. This is all being watched with indifference by those who issued new ultimata and alleged threats yesterday. Will the new massacres, victims, and suffering of a nation again be allowed in front of everyone? The morale of the defenders, the heroes of the 5th Corps, is exceptional. The support of the people from all sections of the free parts of the region is limitless. There are more and more volunteers who are arriving to join the units to defend, as they say, their region and human dignity with their bodies. While we are reporting fierce hand-to-hand fighting is under way on the (Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau and Barakovac. Artillery shells are showering down on every part of the defenders' line and the entire Bihac region. A message is being sent from every part of this region: Bihac will be defended, regardless of the fact that more chetniks are being brought. According to information available at present, some 2,000 chetniks are on their way.
