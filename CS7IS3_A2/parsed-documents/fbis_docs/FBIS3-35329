[Rabin] President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa had an important and special role in bringing about the success of the Cairo agreement. They did not deny us the time or the effort. They were partners in the talks and presented proposals for the settlement. We accepted and adopted some of them. President Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, the president's aides, and Egypt had an important role. I like to personally thank them and also to convey the Israeli Government's thanks. [Hasan] What issues have remained outside of the Cairo agreement? [Rabin] First, we reached agreement on many points in Cairo. I believe that this agreement represents a big step forward, especially with regard to the implementation of the first stage of the "Declaration of Principles" agreement, I mean the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. We agreed in Cairo on all disputed issues, such as responsibility for external security, the crossing points, management of the crossing points, and the size and division of areas in the Gaza Strip. As to Jericho, there is a map of the region. But 'Arafat has the right to raise the issue of Jericho's size in the meeting that will take place between me and him when we sum up all the contents of the agreement. On the other hand, other issues remain pending, such as the problem of security for the Israelis and Palestinians on the major roads in Gaza. There are also other issues mentioned in the Declaration of Principles, such as joint projects and the Palestinians' own projects near the Dead Sea in an area that we will agree on. As to religious issues, the Christian holy places in Jericho will be under Palestinian authority. Jewish ones will remain under Israeli authority. For the record, the Cairo agreement did not discuss at all the establishment of the Palestinian police, its size, or its mode of operation in Gaza together with the Israeli police. For example, if an agreement is concluded, there will be joint action between us and the Palestinian police even on the major roads that will be built for the Israeli settlements from Gush Qativ to Lintserim in the Gaza Strip. There are also talks about the establishment of the first centers for coordination between the Palestinian forces and the Israeli forces, which will take care of security matters, the formation of the Palestinian police and its size, and setting up observation posts for ships and fishing. We are not against the Palestinians having a number of ships for guard duty in the sea. All the above issues have not been discussed yet and no agreement has been reached on them so far. As to civilian affairs, Gadi Zohar on the Israeli side and Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side met in Taba to discuss issues related to the transfer of authority from the Israeli civil administration. This will start with electricity, particularly as electricity in the Gaza Strip comes from Israel. Water and communications issues were also discussed. [Hasan] Are you interested in having economic relations with the Palestinians? [Rabin] My interest is focused on setting up a free economic body between the two sides. Naturally, we must take into consideration some of their reservations and some of our reservations as well. However, this body must be one economic entity before the world. The Palestinian side wants its economic relations to be linked more to the Arab countries. On our part, we have our own views, such as supervising the Palestinian work in Israel. There are issues that have not yet been agreed on, such as that of currency. This is one of the demands submitted by the countries that will be giving aid. It is not our demand. In the past, the Arab countries gave financial aid to the PLO. But today, the countries that will finance projects in the area need to know about those projects. They also need to know the various channels of the projects and to make sure that the funds reach their targets. The Palestinian authority must define the means through which the funds should arrive, such as the development bank. For example, we get U.S. aid and we must present all receipts showing how the funds were used because these countries need to know for which projects the funds have been used. Israel will not interfere in such matters between the Palestinians and the countries contributing to the projects in the area. [Hasan] Have the government of Israel and you personally delineated the area of Jericho? [Rabin] We signed a map today. With my consent, Shim'on Peres sent a message to 'Arafat in which he said that the issue of Jericho's area and 'Arafat's request to expand that area will be discussed after summarizing the agreement's provisions. Our stance is clear with regard to the map, but it is possible to discuss ways of enlarging Jericho's area. However, we are not currently discussing this issue. It will be postponed until a meeting is held between myself and 'Arafat before signing the agreement's provisions. During the Cairo meeting, we agreed on many points, including the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord. [Hasan] Increasing the area of Jericho would make it easy for many Palestinians in the occupied territories, who view the Cairo agreement as Palestinian concessions to Israeli security demands, such as the Palestinian People's Party, which first supported the Declaration of Principles but later joined the opposition. [Rabin] Even in Israel there is dissatisfaction over the Cairo agreement. This is natural. There will always be people who oppose any agreement containing a settlement. There was indeed a settlement. When I present this settlement to the [Knesset's] Foreign Affairs Committee, it will be criticized by some members. [Hasan] Will the Israeli Army withdraw by April, or is even that date not sacred to you? [Rabin] I do not want to procrastinate in the talks for one day, but at the same time I do not want an agreement that ends in failure. We have to remember that concluding an agreement with an Arab state will always raise an argument about the nature of peace. And after agreeing on this point, we will have to work out an agreement about the borders because there can be no agreement without border demarcation. Then come the security arrangements and the normalization of relations. After an agreement is concluded, it then becomes the responsibility of all parties concerned, Arab and Israeli, to preserve this agreement, as was the case with Egypt. But with regard to the agreement with the Palestinians, which involves stages--the transitional period, the first stage of the Declaration of Principles, and then the overall agreement--things are more complicated. This is because we are trying to achieve peaceful coexistence between two entities: a Palestinian entity and the Israeli entity in the territories. We must remember that the Israelis are spread all over the territories and lead a daily life alongside the Palestinians. There are tens of thousands of Palestinian and Israeli cars that face each others everyday. If we do not create a clear-cut understanding from the beginning, it will be difficult to control this situation, which could doom the agreement from the start. But if we want to prove that it is possible for us to live side by side in peace under this agreement, despite all the difficulties and opposition from the Palestinian and Israeli sides, we must reach a clear-cut and accurate definition of all details. Otherwise, the situation may explode at any time over any small problem. For instance, if there is a road accident involving a Palestinian car and an Israeli car, how should we handle the matter and in which court? We have to find solutions for all such small problems right from the start, or else we will regret it and the agreement will fail. I emphasize my desire to make the agreement work. It is better to delay its implementation for one month until the positions for us and for the Palestinians are clear and agreed on, particularly regarding the matters that may cause things to explode. The real discussion is not between myself and 'Arafat, and not even among the senior officials, but between the Palestinian and Israeli citizens in their daily lives. [Hasan] Are you confident that Yasir 'Arafat will be able to control things in the occupied territories? [Rabin] We basically presume that the Palestinians will have to do their jobs and play their role. We also believe that 'Arafat can control things. I will not appear to be helping him in these things. We expect 'Arafat to live up to this responsibility with the help of the Palestinian police. There also will be some joint cooperation between us on some issues. 'Arafat is a full partner and he must play his role as we play ours. With our cooperation, we will be successful. [Hasan] How do you want the Palestinian police to be structured? [Rabin] This issue is still under discussion in the Taba negotiations. I have just received the first working paper. But I want calm negotiations between the two sides without the media. Making statements to the media and being criticized will impede the negotiations. Therefore, I will not go into details with you about the size and number of the Palestinian police. But I can say that the atmosphere that prevailed during the negotiations was positive. The negotiators discussed all aspects of the Palestinian police establishment with regard to its size, number, authority, the stages of its deployment, and the buildings that will be handed over so that it can organize itself and assume its responsibilities. [Hasan] What kind of cooperation will there be between you and the Palestinian police? [Rabin] First, each side will do its duty. For example, there are a quarter of a million Palestinians in Gaza city who have to respect law and order in the interest of the Palestinians and prevent terrorist actions. On our part, we will prevent the Israelis from taking any illegal actions. We will give the Palestinian police all the areas where there are Palestinians and all the refugee camps. Regarding responsibility for international borders between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in the Rafah area, we have delineated these borders in such a way as to have the minimum level of Palestinian population centers. The Palestinians there will be in charge. [Hasan] Are all the Israeli security demands included in the Cairo agreement? [Rabin] The most important thing is that we reached an agreement. We want to make progress in implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement. [Hasan] The situation in the occupied territories is deteriorating. There are daily killings and repression at the hands of the army and the reaction of those opposed to the agreement increases when Israelis are killed. Why, then, the delay in implementing the agreement? [Rabin] Let us first clarify who is carrying out these operations. They are the Palestinians opposed to the agreement, such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, some of the opposition Palestinian elements, and some of the Fatah Hawks who refuse to obey the orders coming from Tunis. They will continue their operations because they are opposed to the agreement. Therefore, we should take care to make the agreement clearer. If we do not clarify matters further, the operations will continue without control and the situation will blow up one day. Don't believe that Israel is not subjected to danger; it is subjected to danger just like the PLO until calm prevails. I am not asking the PLO to shoulder the responsibility for actions carried out by the opposition elements in the area. But when the PLO assumes responsibility in an organized way, then I will ask it to shoulder full responsibility as it says in the agreement. [Hasan] Regarding Fatah's Hawks, the reason they joined Hamas and Islamic Jihad is the army's repression against them, especially after some of them had surrendered their weapons to the army. But the army continued to chase and even assassinate them. [Rabin] I don't want to go into the details. They, too, are being pursued more by Palestinians than by Israelis. This is an internal struggle. I believe that the current stage will see several struggles in the area. Israel remains responsible for dealing with this situation until the Palestinian police officers are deployed. Then it will become responsible for maintaining law and stability in Gaza. [Hasan] Will the army continue to pursue the wanted Palestinians? [Rabin] There are some wanted people who stopped their activity after 13 September 1993. Scores of them have returned to their homes. Unfortunately, Abu-Rish, a wanted Palestinian, was killed by mistake but the rest are unharmed. I am sorry for what happened to Abu-Rish. Those who continued the acts of violence after 13 September will be treated in the same way as those who oppose the agreement and who practice terrorism. [Hasan] Are you and your government concerned about opening the door to dialogue with Hamas and if so on what conditions? [Rabin] I am prepared to hold a dialogue with any party that is ready to join and back the agreement on the Declaration of Principles and that abstains from undertaking terrorist operations. [Hasan] Are you trying put out feelers to Hamas? [Rabin] There are no attempts to put out feelers, because Hamas' positions are known and categorical. Not even the PLO has succeeded in holding talks with Hamas. [Hasan] Could the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin help turn over a new leaf with Hamas and make things easier for the PLO? [Rabin] I don't think so. But if Shaykh Ahmad Yasin changes his positions, supports the agreement, and calls for a halt to terrorism, the issue could be discussed. Shaykh Yasin's position is the opposite of this. [Hasan] Will all the Palestinian detainees be released, especially now that we are in the month of Ramadan and since this issue is of interest to every Palestinian? [Rabin] I repeat: The release of all or some of the detainees is part of the negotiations to implement the agreement on the Declaration of Principles. Some of them have committed murder. I do not want to get into details now. [Hasan] Do you link their release with progress in the talks? [Rabin] Yes of course. [Hasan] Your position has changed in this regard. Why? [Rabin] It has always been my personal position to link the release of detainees with progress in the talks and with another demand we want the Palestinians to meet, that is, providing information on the Israeli soldiers who went missing in the Sultan Ya'qub battles of July 1982. [Hasan] Are you first awaiting an answer regarding the Israeli soldiers? [Rabin] The release of detainees depends on the issue of the missing soldiers. What we are being asked to do is to release detainees who were locked up 10 years ago. If we are discussing events of 10 years ago, then it's mutual. [Hasan] How many Palestinian detainees are in Israeli jails? [Rabin] Approximately 9,000. Every month, some of them are released while some others are detained. [Hasan] Will their release make 'Arafat's job and that of the supporters of the peace process in the territories easier? [Rabin] It might make things easier but at the same time it would step up the terrorism undertaken today by Palestinians. I do not encourage terrorism. I will release no one who has been involved in terrorism because he will go back and do it again. Some Hamas people who returned from the Marj al-Zuhur area [in south Lebanon] have been detained again. [Hasan] The deportation and then repatriation of 415 Hamas members enhanced their position. Were you wrong to deport them and has the age of deportation ended? [Rabin] I think Hamas was on a path toward enhancing its position over the past two years. Today they carry the opposition banner, even though they are not the only ones opposed to the agreement. The deportation constituted a blow that weakened them. But there will always be new cells. If we fail to reach an agreement and the PLO and the Palestinian police do not get to the territories, things won't be clear. I believe in our partner's ability to preserve law and order in the areas that will fall under its control. [Hasan] Will you repeat the closure of the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza? [Rabin] I support enforcing the closure despite the presence of 50,000 Palestinian workers, 20,000 from Gaza, who work in Israel. This number does not include businessmen and doctors. I believe the economy will deteriorate if Gaza is closed. But if operations persist inside Israel, I will reconsider the issue. I do not want to have to close the Gaza Strip. But if terrorism directed at Israelis continues, I regret to say that my primary responsibility is to protect Israel's security. [Hasan] Why do you link the issue of the Palestinian agents with the release of Palestinian detainees and prisoners? [Rabin] Of course I link the two things because those who cooperated with us are entitled to the same privileges that will be granted to those who tried to harm Israel. [Hasan] It is the custom to try those people who cooperate with the occupation against their own people. Why should the fate of an agent be linked with that of a struggler who fought the occupation? [Rabin] People who conducted terrorist operations were tried everywhere. [Hasan] Are you talking about agents who betrayed their people and cooperated with the occupier? [Rabin] They did not betray their people. An agent is a person who opposes terrorism. [Hasan] Is Israel willing to absorb these agents? [Rabin] We are willing to take whoever wishes it. [Hasan] You recognized the existence of a Palestinian entity, a Palestinian flag, and a Palestinian anthem. Why then do you object to the establishment of a state? [Rabin] The others are no symbol of sovereignty. There are many such entities around the world but none of them is a state. There are far more Kurds than Palestinians. Are Iraq and Turkey willing to recognize them as a state? Our target today is to implement what we agreed upon at the Madrid peace conference during the first transitional period. A timetable took shape in the Declaration of Principles prepared in Oslo and signed in Washington. This timetable applies to a period no later than two years from the implementation of the comprehensive agreement--Gaza-Jericho First. Then we will begin negotiations on the final solution. [Hasan] Can the duration of the self-rule and the transitional period be shortened if peace and order prevail in the region? And will you abstain from objecting to the establishment of a Palestinian state in that case? [Rabin] Right now I adhere to the Labor Party positions, which oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. We maintain this stance. But we did not object to the integration of the Palestinian entity with Jordan. [Hasan] Do you support a Palestinian-Israeli confederation? [Rabin] I support all proposals for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. When we reach an agreement and succeed, many possibilities not proposed today will be available. [Hasan] The main issues for negotiation, such as the [1948] refugees, Jerusalem, the settlements, the 1967 refugees, and water, have not yet been practically discussed. How will these problems be solved? [Rabin] Why should I discuss special scenarios when we already have one that is agreed upon? I am against the Palestinians' right to repatriation. I want to tell you that you are posing questions that I prefer are not posed. My position is clear: Why should we discuss subjects we agreed with the PLO not to discuss now? We are not trying today to solve problems that have existed for 100 years. Let us begin with the transitional period, which has never before been offered to the Palestinians. Israel gave the Palestinians this solution, which is only interim, not final. We are not against the Palestinians proposing the shape of the final solution but we tell them to begin with the first step, a chance they have never been offered before. Why, when between 1949 and 1967 the West Bank was under the control of Jordan and Gaza under Egypt, wasn't a Palestinian state established? The West Bank, Gaza, and east Jerusalem were under Arab rule. Did Israel prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state then? As for Jerusalem, it must remain united and under Israeli sovereignty. [Hasan] Were you wrong to start building settlements in 1967? [Rabin] There are settlements. We as a Labor Party opposed their establishment, while others supported it. This is a fact. The agreement with the PLO deals with the interim period, during which all the settlements will remain. [Hasan] Why have you not met President al-Asad? [Rabin] That's not up to me. President al-Asad opposes not only such a meeting, but also contacts between the foreign ministers. Syria prevents direct contacts between us. Syria is making a grave mistake. I do not expect President al-Asad to do what President al-Sadat did and visit Jerusalem but it is difficult to convince the Israeli people that Syria is interested in peace when, at the same time, it is not prepared for high-level meetings. Syria is making no confidence-building statements. For example, Knesset member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah sought permission to travel to Syria along with a small delegation of Israeli Arabs to extend condolences to President al-Asad on his son's death but the request was turned down. This is not a confidence-building step. The Syrian Government and President al-Asad showed no readiness for peace. [Hasan] Will you approve the return of poet Mahmud Darwish and 'Arafat's adviser 'Ammar Shattur to Israel? [Rabin] I have received no official request in this regard; I know nothing about this. When I receive a request, I will discuss it. [Hasan] Have Israel's relations with the Arab world improved since the Oslo agreement? [Rabin] No doubt there is a new atmosphere and there are meetings. I believe that in the next few months the multilateral working groups will meet in Oman, Qatar, and Tunisia. Who would have thought before the signing of the Declaration of Principles with the PLO on 13 September 1993 that we would go to those countries and meet representatives of Arab states that have no relations with Israel to discuss building a regional peace? I think this is an important change and there is a general change in the Arab world. [Hasan] Will your government bring about a just and comprehensive peace with the Arab world? [Rabin] This is our objective. Within the framework of the Madrid conference, we called for a comprehensive peace with Israel's neighbors in addition to Egypt and the Palestinians. I believe that if progress is achieved with Syria, which is changing its way and method for peace [as published], that will boost the peace with Arab countries that have no border with Israel, such as Tunisia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, and Lebanon [as published]. But it is hard to imagine that Libya and Iraq will accept such a step.
