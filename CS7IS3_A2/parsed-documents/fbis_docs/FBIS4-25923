Yeltsin's comments came as he met with entrepreneurs in the city of Blagoveshchensk in the Far East Amur region of the country, on the border with China. "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the expense of the state budget are over," Yeltsin said. "It is necessary to find one's own resources to survive since living on subsidies under market conditions is a shame." He explained that Russia's current task was to transfer the macro reform to a micro level which is aimed at attracting investment to boost production and solve social problems. Earlier today Yeltsin visited the Blagoveshchensk shipbuilding yard where he talked with the workers and management. He promised to help seek customers for larger fishing seiners while suggesting the yard should also make small boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders. Yeltsin arrived in Blagoveshchensk on Tuesday [14 June] for a four-day working visit. He is also scheduled to visit the local Republic of Tuva.
