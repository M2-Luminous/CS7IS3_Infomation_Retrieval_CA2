ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The FHWA is adopting regulations to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA) as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA). The regulations include Federal standards and procedures which the States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations that (1) specify highway routes over which placarded non-radioactive hazardous materials (NRHM) may and may not be transported within their jurisdictions, and/or (2) impose limitations or requirements with respect to highway routing of such hazardous materials. Included are amendments to the procedures in 49 CFR part 397, subpart E, relating to Federal preemption and waivers of preemption, and new procedures for the resolution of disputes involving State or Indian tribe NRHM routing designations. States and Indian tribes are also required to furnish updated NRHM route information for publication by the FHWA. The existing motor carrier regulations with NRHM routing requirements have been incorporated into this regulation, along with the new requirements which require motor carriers to comply with the NRHM routing designations of States and Indian tribes. The intent of these requirements is to ensure that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting requirements of various jurisdictions. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Pamela K. Deadrick, Hazardous Materials Routing and Special Studies Branch (HHS&hyph;13), Office of Highway Safety, (202) 366&hyph;8788; or Mr. Raymond W.

Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except for legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 16, 1990, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;615, 104 Stat. 3244) was enacted and amended the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA) (Pub. L. 93&hyph;633, 88 Stat. 2156). The FHWA was delegated the responsibility by the Secretary, as published in the Federal Register (56 FR 31343, July 10, 1991; 49 CFR 1.48), to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the HMTA (now codified at 49 U.S.C. §§5112 and 5125 (1994), Pub. L. 103&hyph;272, 108 Stat. 745). This included the rulemaking and program responsibility for hazardous materials highway routing, with the exception of currently pending applications for inconsistency rulings and non-preemption determinations which remain a responsibility of the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA).
