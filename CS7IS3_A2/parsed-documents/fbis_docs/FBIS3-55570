The Contours of Russia's Strength"] [Text] The many centuries of Russian history teem with military upheavals -- attacks, aggression, and intervention. There have often been people around who wanted to test the strength of our statehood to "breaking point." The country's fate has often hung by a thread -- and only the Army's military might and the mass heroism of the people saved our dying country. In this respect the special, close attention and impassioned and burning interest which Russian society has always shown for issues of military policy and the country's defense doctrine are understandable. The recent collapse of the seemingly immovable foundations of life and philosophy, accompanied by the major shifts in the international military-strategic sphere, has exacerbated these problems still further. That is why the impatience with which the emergence of the new Russia's military doctrine -- promised by the president more than a year ago -- is entirely understandable. The "Main Provisions of Russian Federation Military Doctrine" examined at the Security Council's 3 March and 6 October 1993 sessions and introduced by Presidential Edict No. 1833 of 2 November have finally appeared in the press. Quite frankly, when you read certain parts of the document you may doubt that it is talking about the armed forces of an independent and sovereign state -- the service of some abstract "world community efforts" and "different collective security organs" is imposed so blatantly. The following provisions are quite simply discouraging: "in order to safeguard military security the state resolves the following tasks: ...providing backup for operations by the UN Security Council and other international organizations." Will our state henceforth really be just an organ to serve Security Council operations; will UN interests really take precedence over our own national interests? On reading the document it is alarming to learn that the Armed Forces are given the role of guaranteeing so-called "democratic transformations" -- in other words, the Army is called upon to use its bayonets to maintain a regime pursuing an antinational, antistate policy and, consequently, to wage war against its own country's citizens. The Army does not have such functions in any state other than a dictatorship. This cannot be acceptable for Russia -- not only because of its historical traditions, but also because of the people-based [narodnyy] nature of the Army. Despite all the political upheavals in the USSR and Russia, despite all the gibes and mockery, the Army has accomplished the impossible -- it has remained intact following the collapse of the Union, when it found itself in the situation of being an "army without a state." This is all the more impressive given that this mortal blow was followed by a campaign to divide up the living Army between the newly "sovereign" republics, to extort new oaths, and to bribe and blackmail the officer corps. The Army's position among the people has remained firm, despite the fact that certain crack teams of elite forces riddled the country's top state organ with bullets before the very eyes of a stunned world. The scorn and hatred of their fellow soldiers are the everlasting companions of these splittists. The Russian Army saved itself thanks to the powerful patriotic instinct of our officers and men, and to the fact that the backbone of the command staff is made up of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Tatars -- the peoples who laid the foundations of our great state. This also applies in full to the millions-strong army of scientists, managers, engineers, and workers in the military-industrial complex who never cease to astonish the world by producing the most modern equipment and armaments in a country where everything has seemingly collapsed for good. Conceptually a military doctrine, by definition, represents the socially accepted totality of the state's views on the goals and nature of a possible war, of the preparations for it by the country and the Armed Forces, and of ways of waging that war. It should define the enemy or enemies with which military confrontation is possible, what might be the aims and nature of such a war or wars, what armed forces the state requires to conduct hostilities successfully, and what are the main areas for their organizational development and the procedure for preparing the country for different military conflicts. In general terms a state's military doctrine is based on interrelated military-political, military-strategic, and military-technical foundations. A detailed elaboration of military doctrine as a guide to action for the various state structures, ministries, and departments responsible for the country's protection "by force" presupposes an extensive description of the practical organizational, legal, financial, and other mechanisms which guarantee the effective transformation of the state's military potential into specific factors of its Armed Forces' combat might. At the same time, its fundamental political section -- compact and clear-cut -- can be briefly set out in the form of a number of theses. I do not plan to assess the published document from a purely military or military-technical standpoint. To certain specialists it seems quite constructive and in line with the realities of our difficult transitional period. But when it comes to its political tenets it looks -- sadly! -- more than dubious in respect of a whole series of positions that are of fundamental importance for Russian security. The tumultuous events of recent years have fundamentally altered the geopolitical situation in every aspect -- from the ideological to the economic and the religious. These changes could not fail to affect the military-political sphere, the situation in which can now be described in terms of the following highly important factors: 1. The collapse of the USSR. The disappearance from the geopolitical arena of such a powerful military-political entity has led to a major deformation of the "force field" of all world politics. The global balance of power established in the world as a result of World War II and for which mankind paid with tens of millions of lives has been irreversibly destroyed. The bipolar world system based on the strategic priority of two equally great "power centers" -- the USSR and the United States -- has become a thing of the past. 2. The abolition of the Warsaw Pact. This military bloc -- the counterweight to NATO in Europe -- served to maintain the military balance of power on which world stability has been based for the past 40 years. Its collapse is the second factor, following the collapse of the USSR, that marks a fundamental change in the military-strategic situation in the world. 3. The qualitative increase in U.S. geopolitical positions. As a result of the disappearance of the Soviet "power center," the United States has to all intents and purposes managed to carry out a fundamental revision of the results of World War II in its favor, to use its influence to fill the military-political "vacuums" that have emerged in the world, and to adopt in the international community the role of undoubted global leader in terms of all the most important power parameters. In abstract terms our national interests in the immediate future would be best served by well-intentioned partnership relations with America in all spheres -- including the military sphere -- provided that the relationship is one of equal rights and mutual advantage. That is beyond dispute. What is at issue is the question of how realistic it is to try to ensure the long-term stability of these relations without sacrificing Russia's state priorities. Thus, while making the utmost effort to develop Russo-U.S. cooperation in the political and economic spheres, we simply do not have the right to forget that our military might, which ensures the proper respect and attention of our partner, will in this case be a very constructive factor in such bilateral relations. It would also be irresponsible to forget that, since World War II, every U.S. military doctrine -- whether the strategy of "massive retaliation," "realistic deterrence," or "flexible response" -- has been subordinate to the idea of global hegemony. Even back in 1945 President Truman stressed in a message to Congress that the victory in the war had left the American people "confronting an urgent and permanent need to assume world leadership." In January 1993 the U.S. defense secretary submitted to Congress a document entitled "U.S. Defense Strategy for the Nineties: The Regional Dimension." This document recognizes "maintaining a high level of armed forces' combat readiness" and a deterrence potential across the range of possible conflicts as being "extremely important to maintaining the U.S. leading role, with which it can shape the future." Given the overall trend for a shift in emphasis in armed forces' organizational development away from confrontation with the USSR (now Russia) toward "countering regional threats," the "Defense Strategy" recognizes that "deterring nuclear attack should remain the top priority." Under these conditions it is necessary for the Russian military doctrine to envisage symmetrical combat capabilities for our Army. 4. The strengthening of the NATO bloc and its new quality. The evident desire of a number of Central and East European countries to join NATO, the lack of any realistic counterweight to its military might in Europe following the Soviet troop withdrawal from Germany and Poland, and the attempts to expand the bloc's sphere of responsibility and win a UN mandate for "peacekeeping operations" in "hot spots" in Europe and even the CIS all demonstrate that NATO aspires to the role of military-political referee in the vast geopolitical area stretching from Greenland to the Persian Gulf. 5. The emergence of a European geopolitical center. Following the end of the Cold War, the importance of the United States as guarantor of European security is to a considerable extent being lost, which makes it possible to predict the galvanization of an independent "Eurocentric" policy within the EC. In its many centuries of confrontation with Russia, Europe -- particularly West Europe -- has always seen itself as an integrated whole. The trend toward integration among the European states, should it result in the creation of a viable and lasting union with a unified military-political structure, could in the future substantially influence the geopolitical force picture by forming a new, European "power center" that would be fully competitive with America and Russia. For Russia this means that it is necessary to safeguard the security of its European borders in light of the fact that these will be borders with a united Europe. "The border between Europe and Russia is an obligatory measure in order to avert the possible emergence in Russia of a temptation to move against the West," [prodvinutsya na zapad], Guy Sorman, the well-known French political scientist and economist, believes, expressing a view that is widespread among the European political elite. The active attempts by certain NATO and EC forces to integrate Central European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and so forth -- into their structures should also be seen as part of this concept. "A strong and independent Europe should be created not against Russia but without Russia" -- that assertion of Sorman's could reasonably claim to be the fundamental slogan of European policy in the foreseeable future. It is no accident that the talk of a "united European home" and a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals" -- which Western leaders used to love using with Gorbachev -- came to nothing so quickly. Even the remaining supporters of a "big Europe" involving Russia see such a geopolitical combination merely as a means of restraining the Russian giant's development. "Russia will become a fully healthy and viable great power 40 years late," Doctor Herbert Kraus, the Austrian political scientist and analyst, warns. "It is inevitable that it will rival and be predisposed to conflict with the EC.... If we want to save the next generation from this, we must start acting today. Right now we can peacefully defeat Russia, which is the key to the entire surrounding area.... We who are facing recession will obtain highly valuable technical material and a ready sales market!" This group of factors, linked to the Soviet Union's loss of the Cold War and to the considerable shift in the geopolitical balance in the West's favor, could be termed a group of "purposeful changes," since it is the result of a deliberate policy pursued by the "developed countries" throughout the postwar era. This policy, in turn, undoubtedly has its historical roots in the West's centuries-old military, economic, and ideological practice of "containing the Russian threat." This traditionally meant that the Russian state should follow their national interests. It would be logical and entirely justifiable today if the new Russian military doctrine stipulated that its Armed Forces had the capability to counter new military threats on the continent.... The "purposeful change" factors by no means exhaust the results of the global changes of recent years. The most powerful "side effect" of the weakening of the historical Russian "power center" has been the controlled growth in regional threats, which are now casting doubt on the ability of the Cold War "winners" to respond appropriately, and are threatening to nullify all the strategic advantages won by the West during the Soviet "perestroyka" era. Quite recently U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin admitted at a press conference that the end of the Cold War, contrary to expectations, had made the world even more vulnerable than before. "The old Soviet threat, although very dangerous, made for a certain degree of comfort," he stated. "The old principles worked very well...." But these principles do not work under the new conditions of universal regional instability, and the Pentagon has been forced to urgently revise the concept for the use of its strategic nuclear forces, since under the new conditions this concept has become virtually meaningless." [no opening quotation marks as published] "We are all facing one common problem today -- growing global discord," Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former U.S. national security adviser, warns. The latest book by this analyst who is influential in world circles is entitled "Out of Control. Global Turmoil on the Eve of the 21st Century." It is imbued with a sense of acute alarm about the avalanche of uncontrollable changes that are occurring. And the geopolitical bloc which we are accustomed to calling the "West," which seemed monolithic during the period of tough anti-Soviet confrontation, is starting to display internal cracks. The many centuries of infighting among the European powers, which ended in the 20th century in two terrible world wars, did not disappear in the face of the "Soviet threat" but merely took a back seat. Today, on the eve of a major new rearrangement of spheres of influence, this infighting is again making itself felt -- and so actively that it is calling into question the effectiveness of the mechanisms to create a "united Europe." Moreover, many analysts specializing in elaborating predictions about the changes in the geopolitical sphere are pointing to the fact that by the end of the century there will be an exacerbation of the United States' relations not only with China and India but with its current allies -- Germany and Japan. Their claims are based on the fact that the U.S. economy will continue to be uncompetitive against the German and Japanese economies not only in the European and Asian markets but in the traditional American market too. The United States will have no way to resolve this conflict other than by political and military means. And the possibility of Russia's being involved -- on the American side, of course -- in "pacifying the recalcitrants" cannot be ruled out. In a recent interview Margaret Thatcher expressed the conviction that the Maastricht Treaty would "inevitably lead to the establishment of German domination of Europe." According to the "Iron Lady," this frightens her a lot, because she believes that Germany has never abandoned the idea of achieving world domination and that "the Germans are very stubborn people who ultimately always get what they want." The united German colossus alarms French politicians just as much, although they try not to advertise the fact. A major factor in any possible global destabilization remains Islamic fundamentalism, which is rooted, apart from the religious sphere, in the Muslim peoples' natural indignation at interference by the "developed countries" -- above all, the United States -- in their internal affairs. There is a growing environmental crisis, and world conflict is increasing after "simmering" for many years between the rich, prosperous North and the hungry, poor, debt-laden South. Thus, along with the controllable factors of "purposeful change," the geopolitical and military-strategic sphere is being influenced increasingly strongly by the virtually uncontrolled group of "risk factors," which are a consequence of the overall destabilization of the international situation and constitute a major obstacle to a predictable, evolutionary development of events. The struggle between these two trends will, clearly, continue to determine the direction of world politics in the next few years. There is only one force in the modern world capable of decisively influencing this struggle. In the military-political sphere it is implemented through a range of measures aimed at universally establishing a "new world order." And its basic structures are international, supranational, and suprastate organizations -- first and foremost, the United Nations with all its subsidiary and ancillary institutions. The ultimate aim of the cosmopolitan elite comprising the organizational nucleus of the "new world order" is to create a unified global network of planetary control -- a kind of world superstate run from a united center and enjoying legal priority over "local" legislation. The world's press is actively discussing the question of the "legitimate basis for intervention." All this makes it possible to assume that the trend toward the forcible limitation of the state sovereignty of "disobedient" countries will be developed and honed in the very near future. Moreover, it is necessary to clearly understand that the "developed countries" today see the "new world order" primarily as a way to reinforce their leading position in the international community. Nonetheless, it is obvious that at some point the processes of global political integration will conflict with the interests of the national state elites in these very countries -- the United States, Germany, or Japan. If the world's behind the scenes powers directing the integration processes succeed in overcoming this conflict, their entire might will be thrown into controlling further "purposeful changes" in the geopolitical and military-strategic spheres in the context of the "new world order." But if they fail, it is quite possible that the world's elites will use all their influence to expedite the strengthening of "risk factors" with a view to "detonating" the situation, exploiting the results of the general turmoil, and achieving at a time of global crisis what had proved impossible under an evolutionary development of events. On the basis of all this it seems logical and justifiable that the political foundations of Russia's defense doctrine should be laid down, taking account above all of the following provisions: The qualitatively different geopolitical and military-strategic situation requires a radical and comprehensive reevaluation of the military doctrine of the "Soviet period," which was based on the bipolar system of a world balance of power. The abandonment of the excessive geopolitical ambitions which exhausted the country's economy and were often dictated not by its national, state, or historical interests but by ideological claims to the rapid "victory of world socialism," presupposes the active reorientation of the Armed Forces to the priority of confronting regional threats to our security. Provided, of course, that we unconditionally maintain our strategic military potential at a level where it can guarantee to inflict "unacceptable damage" on any potential aggressor. At the same time, the historical continuity of our "patriotic defense mentality" in all its spheres -- from military-political theory to military-strategic practice -- should also be ensured. In reality this means recognizing that Russia's security could continue to be safeguarded only in the event of its Armed Forces' being ready to independently and effectively counter the full range of potential force threats -- from the global to the regional, local, and even internal. 2. [no number 1 as published] The prospects for military organizational development should take proper account of the alarming trends in international politics. Analysis shows that in the foreseeable future the military-political situation in the world will be defined by collaboration and confrontation between the three such trends which we previously dubbed "factors of purposeful change," "risk factors," and "new world order factors." Not one of these trends is favorable for Russia, coincides with its long-term economic, political, or military interests, or promises us anything new in the future other than more unrest, worry, and diverse threats. And a readiness to use force to counter such threats, along with a vigorous peacekeeping policy to avert them, seems to be the most effective combination of the various means of safeguarding Russian security. 3. The Russian military strategy that has been adopted in the light of present-day conditions can be characterized on the whole as a strategy of "defense sufficiency" founded on the political basis of "healthy national pragmatism." This means that: a) The immediate period of Russian development should be seen primarily as a period of stabilization during which it will be necessary above all to minimize the damage done to the country by the ill-conceived and undistinguished actions of politicians over the past few years; mechanisms for mobilizing all of society's potential with a view to getting the country out of its profound systemic crisis as quickly as possible will have to be elaborated; priority attention to the internal problems of social revival and national regeneration will have to be guaranteed; any kind of external state activeness will have to be reduced to a necessary minimum to rule out the possibility of Russia's getting dragged into the activities of any supranational international organizations whatsoever which claim a right to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states; and the military activeness of the country's Armed Forces will have to be very strictly limited to the framework of Russia's national interests, for the purposes of whose protection they should have the necessary technical, organizational, and legal base. b) The material and personnel resources channeled into defense should be determined on the basis that the most important task in this sphere is to prevent any further deterioration in Russia's military-political and military-strategic positions in the world arena. The events of recent years have revealed that we lack reliable military allies, therefore the priority avenue of military organizational development should be to safeguard the country's security against both direct military aggression against it and regional threats associated with local areas of military-political instability escalating into the threat of a comprehensive geopolitical crisis ("global turmoil"). 4. Along with the concepts of "healthy national pragmatism" and "defense sufficiency" the key terms in the Russian military doctrine, defining its practical features, could now be the concepts of "vital interests" and "potential enemy." It would be expedient to introduce the latter term in place of the term "probable enemy," which was discredited during the Cold War. If the term "probable enemy" is taken to mean states or alliances of states that were viewed as hostile in the unjustifiably ideologized system of references that prevailed earlier, then the concept of a "potential enemy" could be stripped of its "state affiliations" and acquire a concrete meaning independent of ideological predilections -- exclusively in conjunction with detailed and justifiable military-political forecasts. The existence of potential military threats in the modern world is obvious and generally accepted. Consequently, the introduction of the proposed term should not unjustifiably concern anyone since it does not affect the overall defensive nature of our military doctrine. At the same time, it makes the processes of shaping specific aspects of the state's military policy and the day-to-day combat training of Russia's Armed Forces substantially easier. In turn, the concept of "vital interests" makes it possible to render the military organizational development process clear and purposeful wherever its requirements cannot be adequately reflected with the help of the simple "potential enemy" definition. These interests -- understood to be Russia's legitimate right to stake a claim to a geopolitical or regional balance of power which would safeguard its security and territorial integrity -- can exist in areas where a "potential enemy" is simply absent. They may also be made the basis of our military policy in areas where friendly relations with local states, mutual loyalty, or other factors rule out the possibility of any other view being taken of the situation and require a flexible approach to the safeguarding of Russian security.... It would be naive to believe that this brief review could cover all of today's military-political problems. Moreover, Russia's current position is so vague and complex, so unstable and changeable, that any claims that the highly important provisions determining the country's military security which we have tried to formulate here are final would look very dubious. Nonetheless, it is necessary to define right now the future basis for our defense doctrine, to outline its specific forms, and to map out the general direction of its evolution. It is the specialists' job to elaborate the military-strategic and military-technical aspects of military doctrine, it is the politicians' duty to elaborate the military-political provisions. But we must not refrain from emphasizing that the Russian Army's future lies solely in its link with the people [v yeye narodnosti]. No mercenary force -- and this is demonstrated by the experience of manpower acquisition for the Special-Purpose Militia Detachment -- is capable of defending the people or of winning their support. We are obliged to preserve universal military service for Russia's citizens. We are compelled by life itself to foster in Russian citizens a sense of patriotism, pride in their motherland, and a readiness to defend it. We must preserve and augment the state's defense capability and the Army's combat readiness. It is necessary to clear away many obstacles and "democratic" prejudices in this area.
