Rep. Kang Sin-cho, chairman of a fact-finding subcommittee of the National Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Reunification, made the remark after attending a closed-door meeting with government officials. He said Moscow is demanding that Pyongyang improve the human rights of North Koreans working at logging yards in Siberia. "On-the-spot examination by the fact-finding subcommittee of the Siberian logging yards is a delicate matter related to diplomatic relations between South Korea and Russia as well as inter-Korean relations. Therefore, we plan to decide on when to go to Siberia after fully consulting with the government," he said. Pyongyang is negotiating with Moscow to renew their forestry agreement which expired at the end of last year, but Russia is demanding that a new provision securing the human rights of North Korean loggers be added to the new pact. Some 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are working in Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, with hundreds having escaped to roam throughout Russia or seeking asylum in South Korea.
