FBIS4-28849 "dreas114_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Papers Assess Carter's Visit to North Korea Papers Assess Carter's Visit to North Korea SK1406064994 SK1406064994 BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 14 June publish editorials, reports, and articles on former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's upcoming visit to North Korea. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "North Korea's Withdrawal from IAEA and Carter's Visit to North Korea." The editorial notes that Carter, who is expected to meet North and South Korea's presidents at a time when the North Korean nuclear issue has become the top world issue, can be regarded as the most important nuclear envoy. However, the editorial states that North Korea, while waiting for Carter, chose a hardline position, namely the withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, instead of making an appeasement gesture, and put a wet blanket on the expectations for Carter's visit, thus causing people to worry about the possibility of Kim Il-song taking advantage of Carter's visit. Recalling Kim Il-song's past tactics to selectively invite Americans and give them the warm treatment, the editorial stresses that Kim Il-song's propagandistic remarks have more falsehood than truth as shown in the case of North Korea's promise to allow the IAEA's nuclear inspections. The editorial points out that "even if the United States begins to support North Korea's light-water reactor, North Korea will undoubtedly continue extracting plutonium from the so-called 'military facilities' while pretending that it froze the extraction of plutonium only in a certain reactor." The editorial then calls on Jimmy Carter to keenly be aware of this situation during his visit to North Korea, and not be dragged into Kim Il-song's deceitful tactics. The paper concludes that "at a time when the people think that there is no other means but sanctions, Carter's visit may be the last opportunity for North Korea. North Korea should not attempt to use Carter just as it has used other people who visited North Korea in the past." CHOSON ILBO also publishes on page 4 a 1,500-word article by reporter Kim Tu-sik, under the headline "Carter's Visit to North Korea--What He Should Do and What He Should Not Do in Pyongyang." The article notes that the people are hoping that during his visit to North Korea, Carter will clearly convey to the Kim Il-song regime the resolute will of the international community for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem. The paper expresses the hope that "Carter will emphasize that only when North Korea immediately allows the 'special inspection' of two undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon as demanded by the ROK and the United States, can North Korea get rid of the sanctions crisis." The paper then stresses that "Carter should urge North Korea to make public the record on the extraction of plutonium in the past and detailed additional information on the operational plan of the reactor in Yongbyon." The article adds that Carter should raise the issue of reform and openness of the North Korean society, as well as its human rights issue. As the points that Carter should refrain from doing, the article emphasizes that Carter should not give a wrong message that may encourage North Korea's hopes; should refrain from causing North Korea to misunderstand that he is a special envoy of the U.S. Government, and should not exaggerate the result of his visit to North Korea. The paper concludes by saying that our government will inform Jimmy Carter of our aforementioned hope before he crosses Panmunjom on 15 June. The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "We Call On Carter To Grasp North Korea's True Intention." Attaching importance to Carter's meeting with Kim Il- song during which mutual messages may be exchanged, the editorial expresses the belief that he is the last nuclear special envoy of the U.S. Government, although he stated that his visit is strictly personal, in view of his past role in U.S.-Syrian relations and in negotiations for the Ethiopian war. Pointing to a possibility for North Korea to take advantage of his visit for a peace offensive to evade sanctions and for gaining time, the paper asks Carter to precisely inform North Korea of the international community's demand and to grasp North Korea's true intentions, whether they are aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and receiving support for a light-water reactor, or at ultimately pursuing nuclear development. The paper also calls on Carter to raise North Korea's human rights issue while in Pyongyang since he was known as the president for human rights, and to demonstrate his ability in blocking North Korea's nuclear development since he blocked the ROK's nuclear development plan while he was in office. The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,600-word article by reporter Ko Tae-song, entitled "The Government To Cope With the North Korean Nuclear Issue Based on Sense of Reality." Pointing to recent delicate and cautious changes in the government steps to deal with the North Korean nuclear problem, the article states that the government appears to be turning from a hardline position by favoring sanctions to the attitude of accepting the reality that requires active participation of China and Russia, and this government attitude is reflected in viewing Carter's visit to North Korea. The article notes that the government was at first worried about a possibility of Carter being dragged in by North Korea's delaying and propaganda tactics but is now trying to take the best advantage of his visits to both North and South of Korea for directly conveying the worries and warnings of the international community and of our government to North Korea on its nuclear problem. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 1,200-word article by reporter Yi Song-chol, entitled "Carter's Role--Half Affirmative, Half Negative." The paper notes that the government's view on Carter's visit to North Korea is more on the negative side at the moment because his visit may give unfavorably impact our security strategy when sanctions are being discussed at the UN Security Council. On the contrary, some people are hoping for his positive role because he maintains special relations with the Clinton administration and because North Korea expressed the will to invite Carter since 1991. The article refers to remarks made by Professor Kim Yu-nam from Danguk University on the possibility of Carter taking a certain U.S. message accepting the North Korean demands. However, the article says: "Most experts point out that the success of Carter's visit depends more on what kind of message North Korea will give him rather than on whether he will bring a message with him or not and than on his role as a mediator."
