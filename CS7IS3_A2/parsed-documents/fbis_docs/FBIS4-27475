The showdown coincided with the resignation of four Phalang Tham MPs from the coalition whips committee. The pullout was, however, described as a normal procedure following Phalang Tham's election of a new executive committee. Newly-elected Phalang Tham Secretary General Udon Tantisunthon remained the only Phalang Tham Party member in the whips' panel. On Tuesday, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, a former deputy city governor, attacked Chuan for his failure to reach a compromise with Chalat. "It's a shame for Thailand to have such a stupid prime minister," the Phalang Tham hardliner said. Phalang Tham leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian described Chaiwat's statement as a personal opinion. But reaction from powerful Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang appeared more controversial. "We can't say who is right and who is wrong in this matter. Everybody can express his opinions," Chamlong said. Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa, a Democrat, charged that Chaiwat had bad intentions towards the both government and hunger striker Chalat. "I don't want to see someone take advantage of Chalat's hunger to attack the government. It is not fair to Chalat or the government," Aphisit said. Chuan played down the issue and said he would not raise the topic at the next Cabinet meeting. "I haven't read (the newspapers)," the Democrat leader said. "Anyway, I don't think I will talk about it at the Cabinet. It's not that important." But at a party for all coalition MPs hosted by the New Aspiration Party, Chuan gave a speech which was seen by many as an indirect message to Phalang Tham. "Storms arrive every time Parliament convenes a session," Chuan said at the Emerald Hotel party. "I believe this time they are not serious. But the most important thing is for all of us to stick together in our ship. People assigned us to bring this ship in to shore and we have to do it. We must land on the Thai shore, not Bangladesh's. And nobody should abandon the ship with the intention of being the only survivor." Chamlong was conspicuously absent from the party. Another Democrat, Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, reacted furiously to Chaiwat's comments. Asked if he would ask Phalang Tham to reprimand Chaiwat, Trairong replied: "I dare not do that. Political parties should respect each other. I know the shoulds and should-nots of etiquette. I'm not that kind of low-life." Democrat secretary general Sanan Khachonprasat said Chaiwat's statement was "nonsense" and added that Bunchu would take care of the issue. Chaiwat's unexpectedly strong remark heightened wild speculation about Phalang Tham's possible role in Chalat's controversial hunger strike. Although Bunchu has tried to distance his party from Chalat, the activist has been strongly supported by party hardliners who wrested control of Phalang Tham's executive committee last weekend. Over the past two days Chuan has implied that Chalat's campaign for a new Constitution had escalated into a collaboration of some sort with himself the ultimate target. Special Branch police sources backed Chuan's statement yesterday, saying Chalat's fast was creating circumstances which might lead to an eventual antigovernment crusade. Chamlong has been actively trying to seek a "way out" for Chalat. But the Phalang Tham founder's suggestion that government MPs join to draft a new constitution was rejected by the Democrats and other coalition leaders as impractical and unconstitutional. Pro-democracy groups, a power base for Chamlong, have closed ranks behind Chalat, demanding that the government abolish the present Constitution and promulgate a new one as called for by the activist. As the number of sympathizers has gradually swelled at the protest site in front of Parliament, so have fears of possible political unrest. Chamlong admitted yesterday his party was trying to help Chalat, but added that it was also in close contact with coalition partners. Sources said Chamlong had also told Phalang Tham members not to turn their individual support for Chalat into a political stand of the party. Chaiwat yesterday insisted that he had criticized Chuan because the prime minister had failed to clearly explain why the government could not comply with Chalat's demands. "A leader must defuse problems, not allow small ones to grow into big ones," he said. The four Phalang Tham MPs who quit the coalition whips committee are Sarit Santimethanidon (Khon Kaen), Sutham Saengprathum (Nakhon Si Thammarat), Tinnawat Marnukkaphithak (Bangkok) and Thamrong Saengsuriyachan (Bangkok).
