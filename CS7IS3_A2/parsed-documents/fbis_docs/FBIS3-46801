Throughout the course of its heroic birth and growth, our Army has proven itself worthy of being called a revolutionary army. It has always remained loyal to the party-initiated undertaking and the interests of the masses and has won the people's trust, assistance, and loving care. Now, as we enter the stage of building and defending the socialist fatherland, our Army has to undertake a new and very heavy task; namely, building, consolidating, and enhancing our combat strength while simultaneously participating in production to contribute toward firmly maintaining political stability and promoting socioeconomic development. With a thorough understanding to the Seventh Party Congress Resolution and the party Central Committee Third Plenum Resolution on national defense and security in the new situation, our entire Army has made serious and very great efforts to apply these resolutions to life. As a result, we have achieved initial but very important results and made marked and steady progress toward building our military organization into a revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army step by step. Since the conclusion of the Seventh Party Congress, the international and regional situations have developed very quickly and have become complicated. They have had a very great impact on our people's task of building and defending the socialist fatherland. These days, our country enjoys peace and stability. The renovation undertaking has brought about important achievements and opened up great prospects. The factors of instability, however, have not yet been eliminated. Through the "peaceful evolution" strategy, hostile forces abroad are collaborating with reactionary elements at home to carry out their dark scheme, aimed at abolishing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. They have directed their offensive spearhead against us on all fronts, especially on the politico-ideological front, in a bid to sow disunity between the Army and people, depoliticize the Army, and neutralize party leadership over the Army. That situation requires our entire party, people, and Army to heighten their vigilance, strengthen national defense capabilities, and consolidate the people's armed forces in order to stand ready to cope with every eventuality and firmly defend our national independence, revolutionary gains, and socialist regime. Over the past three years, thanks to our party's correct renovation policy and our people's efforts, we have made comprehensive achievements in the national renovation undertaking. We have overcome the socioeconomic crisis to a very great extent. Our annual economic growth rate has increased considerably and steadily. Broad sections of the population have had their standard of living improved. Those socioeconomic achievements have created the conditions for strengthening our national defense capabilities, ensuring political stability, and consolidating the people's confidence in party leadership and their determination to pursue the socialist path chosen by President Ho Chi Minh. Along with the common efforts of our entire party and people, our Army has made a worthy contribution to building and defending the socialist fatherland, especially in the task of consolidating our national defense and security capabilities. Over the past three years, by fully understanding the party's policies and resolutions as well as the new revolutionary tasks, our Army has continued to build and consolidate its strength in all fields in order to enhance its revolutionary nature and combat strength and stand ready to defend the fatherland in the new situation. Due attention has been paid to the top priority task of providing politico-ideological education to cadres and combatants in order to enhance their political background. First of all, we have improved both the form and content of the educational campaign to promote everyone's awareness of the good nature and fine traditions of our Army. As a result, our young cadres and combatants these days not only take pride in their fathers and elder brothers, but also firmly maintain and develop these fine traditions. Due importance has been attached to our efforts to enhance the political awareness of cadres, especially key cadres. Learning activities have already been organized in the framework of the Political General Department's curriculum. Constant efforts have been made to keep everyone abreast of the revolutionary situation and the Army's tasks, especially to make everyone fully aware of the need to heighten vigilance against the enemy's dark schemes and maneuvers. Besides politico-ideological education, we have taken uniform steps to build and revamp the party, consolidate and enhance the quality of cadres, and renovate the forms and contents of the political indoctrination program in our Army. As a result, we have strengthened the leadership role and militancy of grassroots party organizations and created conditions for a strict application of the principle of absolute party leadership over all aspects of Army-related activities. Thanks to the satisfactory measures mentioned above to carry out politico-ideological education and strengthen the party's leadership over the Army, our cadres and combatants have remained steadfast in the face of the enemy's psychological warfare maneuvers and the difficulties, challenges, and major changes in the international situation. They have constantly believed in party leadership, firmly maintained their combat determination and goals, and always proven themselves worthy of being called a reliable and loyal force of the party and people. As for the goal to revamp the militancy of the armed forces in order to meet new requirements arising from the task of defending the socialist fatherland, our entire Army has, over the past three years, done many things of very fundamental and important importance for further development. With the motto of building an armed force of appropriate personnel strength and of high quality, we have continued to reduce the personnel strength of our regular force, consolidate and rearrange various units, readjust the personnel strength of our armed services and combat branches, and achieve a balance between our main force and our local force to suit our strategic disposition on a national scale and in each sensitive areas and to meet the demand for ensuring sufficient on-site combat force for various defense areas and a mobile combat force capable of coping with all the situations that may arise in any areas in the country. Troop training has been affirmed as a central task. Since 1989, our entire army has continued to renovate the contents and organizational methods of training with the motto of providing basic training in a realistic and steady fashion and with the concepts that training must be practical to combat, that lessons of experience obtained from the past two wars of resistance must be applied in troop training, that training must be conducted in such a way as to develop democratic principles and to promote a sense of voluntarism and creativity among trainees, and that close combination must be achieved between training and indoctrination and between theory and practice. Our entire Army has applied these mottos and concepts scrupulously and creatively. As a result, the quality of troop training has further developed in an increasingly steady fashion. In particular, over the past three years, we have paid attention to training troops in our Army's traditional tactics, such as the tactic of using a small force to defeat a larger enemy and the tactic of using rudimentary means to triumph over an enemy with sophisticated equipment. Therefore, in training, our efforts have been directed at attaining the goal of ensuring good combat skills for every soldier and every detachment. Soldiers must be well-trained in detachment-level combat and in coordinated combat involving various armed services and combat branches. In order to evaluate its training quality, combat effectiveness, and combat readiness, our entire Army has, over the past three years, conducted many military drills involving units of various sizes, from the detachment to divisional levels. With these military drills, the Army has further improved the organizational and leadership skills of its cadres and has enabled cadres to familiarize themselves with "combat." Also through training, we have drawn on many good lessons of experiences, including experience on our residual shortcomings, in order to ensure better training for troops. The results obtained in troop training and indoctrination have helped concolidate the determination and confidence of cadres and combatants in their bid to fulfill their task of defending national independence and sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the fatherland. Along with renovating our training, we have also vigorously deployed our research on science, technology, and military arts. We have initially resolved a number of problems arising in combat and decided on the course for ensuring adequate equipment for troops. In combat, we have concentrated on summing up lessons of experience obtained in the two past wars of resistance. On this basis, we have been able to deploy and develop our activities to suit the existing principles of our people's warfare and our national defense. We have made appropriate investment in the research and perfection of the methods of fighting in defense areas for all the three categories of troops. We have also stressed studying and getting to know the enemy. Therefore, information on the enemy, including his equipment and weapons, military doctrine, and combat tactics, has been promptly exploited to serve our research activities. This has created a basis for us to map out our counterpolicies and countermeasures. Ensuring equipment for troops to meet existing and long-term requirements is a new and difficult issue for our Army. Proceeding from studying our realitic capabilities to learning the experience obtained by countries with situations similar to ours, we have basically been able to come up with appropriate policies and lines. As an immediate task, we must concentrate our efforts on preserving and maintaining satisfactorily our existing equipment. As for obsolete and degraded equipment, we must study ways to exploit to the fullest whatever is left. Meanwhile, we must study the possibility of modernizing various kinds of weapons and equipment to suit our combat tactics. In the long run, we have been and are building a national defense industry to manufacture the most essential equipment and weapons for our troops. All these policies have been implemented by our entire Army with great efforts and encouraging results have been achieved. The scientific and technical cadres in the Army have made worthy contributions and successfully carried out many valuable scientific and technical projects. Although building a regular army is a goal that has been followed for many years now, the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Military Commission recently issued a directive urging our entire Army to further step up this move aimed at effecting an important change for the better in the direction of military standardization. All elements of the Army, ranging from agencies to units, have concentrated on providing leadership and guidance to troops and come up with substantive measures. Therefore, positive changes for the better have been initially noted in both the thoughts and actions of our cadres and combatants. Efforts to ensure logistics for support of standardization have been intensified and as has the budget earmarked for this. Therefore, all the systems governing room and board and dress code for troops have been improved. In particular, efforts to ensure unified specifications for military uniforms such as color, design, and quality have shown remarkable improvements. Troop management has also been given constant attention by various echelons. Therefore, changes for the better have been noted in the maintenance of various systems of daily routine, official work, and observance of military ceremonies and bearing. The number of troops violating military discipline or deserting their units has dropped sharply. The Army's achievements scored in the past three years after the meeting of the seventh national party congress in military building, training, and combat readiness have proved the great efforts exerted by our cadres and soldiers. These achievements are very fundamental and they are creating a firm foundation for subsequent development steps, despite some remaining problems and shortcomings in our new requirements and duties. In few week's time, our Army will observe its 50th anniversary, the age of many past challenges and experiences. We are confidently building an Army that deserves the party and people's expectation from an Uncle Ho Army of the people, by the people, and for the people. To meet that expectation, in the coming years, we have to make more fundamental improvements to fulfill our both current and future requirements and duties and to change our revolutionary army to a regular, efficient, and modern army for the protection of national independence, sovereignty, and integrity and for our goal of making people prosperous, nation powerful, and society civilized. The most important thing is the education on politics, ideology, national tradition and patriotism, and army tradition to make our cadres and soldiers resolute in their ideology and fighting spirit and vigilant at enemy conspiracies and tricks when they try to neutralize the politicalization of our Army before invalidating our armed forces. The party leadership over the Army must be further strengthened to ensure that, in any situation, the armed forces are absolutely reliable and loyal to the party and national interests. The Army must increase its socioeconomic activities and mass mobilization work to improve its public relations, unite with the people, and preserve its nature as an army of the people and one who fights for the people. The improvement of our Army's capacity for fighting is an urgent issue. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate all our efforts to accomplish these tasks: 1. Further accelerating the military standardization: We must thoroughly understand the contents and requirements of military standardization. Standardization is not only a formality but also a necessary demand for a revolutionary army to create high unity in conception and action, from military organs to units and from cadres to soldiers for the creation of a combined strength. Military standardization is a long-term undertaking. But in 1994, we must strive to standardize the practice in military training, combat readiness, and personnel and equipment management. Especially, we must establish working regulations for each military position. We must introduce uniforms for the entire Army, creating a new image worthy of the honor and pride of an heroic army. Together with fine uniforms, we have to train the troops in military protocol, proper behavior for soldiers, and working relations according to Army regulations. 2. Further improve military training: All units must understand that military training is a regular and permanent task in peace time. In the past three years, due to the reform of the training programs, methods, and organization, we have achieved relatively complete results with useful experiences. On that basis, we need to bring the technological and tactical skills to a higher level. We must continue to provide soldiers with fundamental, practical, and sound training suitable to the particular duties of each unit. For the main force, we must train soldiers to fight with assigned weapons by themselves and together with other Army branches and forces. For the local and militia forces, we must train them to fight in small units and attack the enemy's area, logistic establishments, and storage facilities, how to maintain social order and security, and how to protect the government and people at the grassroots level. In the training process, the creativity of each cadre and soldier must be developed to make them become more flexible and active in combat. The training must concentrate on current requirements in order to enhance their capacity to deal with all forms of military intervention by enemy forces when they try to provide support to peaceful evolution and violently overthrow activities of reactionary domestic groups. 3. Continuing to build completely strong units according to five requirements set forth by the National Defense Ministry. Through review, experiences drawn from exemplary units should be widely applied in the remaining units. We have to do our best to eliminate weak units and stop desertion. Experience proves that if there is a close coordination between recruitment units and local authorities in troop management and education and in dealing with deserted soldiers, the desertion problem will be overcome. Better care for spiritual and material life is also very important to help the soldiers feel more attached to their units and to carry out their duties. The building of completely strong units must be linked with efforts to improve party building work and other movements to create great change in each military unit and the entire armed force. Consequently, the three duties of military standardization, training, and building are closely linked in a chain reaction. Therefore, in the implementation process, all units need to carry out uniform planning for these three duties. They must not look down on any duty, but consider the military standardization a regular and permanent task. Soon, the Army will celebrate its 50th anniversary. The entire force should launch emulative movements to improve the sense of responsibility in all cadres and soldiers. They should urge each other to do their best in their military achievements to take the Army to new heights to meet the expectations of the party and people in protecting independence, sovereignty, and national integrity and maintaining peace and stability for national construction and development. Their goals continue to be to make people prosperous, the nation powerful, and society civilized.
