Trustworthy sources say that an agreement was not reached on any of the subjects under discussion. For this reason, no final documents were signed. The issues obstructing relations between Russia and Kazakhstan fall into three areas. First, there are legal issues relating to citizenship and the rights of Russians in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev once again said no to Kozyrev's latest initiative on dual citizenship. The possibility of a compromise is being discussed. The second issue is military-political cooperation. Kazakhstan is insisting on an economic quid pro quo for the removal of nuclear weapons. Third, and lastly, there is Baykonur, which is still a stumbling block in relations between the two states. The plane carrying the Russian foreign minister's delegation, accompanied by Kazakh representatives, has just landed at Krayniy airport, Leninsk. Today, Andrey Kozyrev will familiarize himself with the situation at Baykonur. The talks are proving difficult. The Kazakh side does not agree that Russia should lease the Cosmodrome for 99 years. According to some reports, Russia is being offered a lease of about 20 years. Russia's Defense Ministry regards this as completely unacceptable. Furthermore, Kazakhstan is seeking the demilitarization of Baykonur. It does not want to entrust command over it to the Russian military authorities. Kazakhstan hopes to carry out a global commercial program at the cosmodrome. Naturally, this does not accord with Russia's strategic interests either. Kazakhstan's latest bold condition for Russia's use of Baykonur was the proposal that, in return for a lease on the Cosmodrome, it would receive military equipment from Russia at half-price. Finally, Kazakhstan has completely refused to recognize Baykonur and a number of test ranges as Russian military bases, something that Moscow is insisting on. Nevertheless, we must set an example by proving that we can conduct a fruitful dialogue, as well as argue and stake claims, Andrey Kozyrev said, probably without feeling especially hopeful, judging by the Kazakh side's recent behavior.
