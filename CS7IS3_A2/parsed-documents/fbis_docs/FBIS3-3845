What is its attitude toward the tax-sharing system? Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao, who is also a deputy to the National People's Congress, said: We are all for it! When asked by these reporters about the tax-sharing system, Zhao Zhihao replied by raising a hypothetic question: "If the State lacks financial resources and a competent national defense and is confronted with disasters, which localities will be able to solve their problems by themselves? Without a sense of overall situation, it will be difficult for the state to achieve development. If the state runs into difficulties and pressure is coming from the outside, which localities can solve problems in lieu of the state?" Zhao Zhihao continued his response by making a comparison: "It is an long-acknowledged fact that Shandong has rich resources and good natural conditions. Prior to reform and opening up, however, Shandong was always associated with the word `poverty,' and people always called us "poor Shandong men." The total economic volume of Shandong is now ranked second among other provinces in the country. What do we rely on? It is all due to the positive state policies of reform and opening up, and Shandong has benefited from these good policies!" After pondering the matter for a while, Zhao Zhihao made some weighty remarks: "If the state runs into financial difficulties, we should keep the cardinal principles in mind, take the overall situation into account, and help the state get over the difficulties. In wartime, 220,000 martyrs from Shandong Province sacrificed their lives, and today, it is our duty to make some contributions. Shandong will only be one of 30 provinces in China, even when it becomes richer. A single flower cannot blossom, but hundreds of flowers can." Zhao Zhihao told these reporters that, as a governor who was also in charge of financial work, he started conveying the importance of financial work to financial officials at all levels throughout the province: We cannot collect less money than we should; nor can we collect more. We must turn in the required funds to the central authorities and never can we be vague in this respect. Some localities widened the tax base and made too many levies in order to receive more repaid funds after tax from the central authorities, but Zhao Zhihao opposed this practice. He said: "This is not only a serious violation of discipline but is also an irresponsible act toward the enterprises. If enterprise circulating funds are all considered the base figure, how can enterprises develop their production, and what can they do in the future?" Zhao Zhihao made his final remarks: "Taking the overall situation into account precisely means taking long-term interests into account. Our enthusiasm should be used to seize the opportunity for development offered by the current reform in taxation and readjust and optimize the economic structure so as to tap new financial resources.
