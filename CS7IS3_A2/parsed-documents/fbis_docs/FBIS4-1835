Government Information Office director-general Jason Hu urged mainland authorities to face the accident "honestly" and "responsibly." The charred corpses of 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland Chinese guides and six crewmen were found piled in one room of a tourist boat on March 31. The boat was on a cruise of Thousand Island Lake in Zhejiang Province when the still unexplained deaths occurred. News of the accident was not released until two days after the event occurred, and all Taiwan reporters were barred from examining the boat or any of the 32 corpses after the boat was removed to a shipyard in Chunan, Zhejiang. Zhejiang security officials also destroyed film of the site taken by a TV reporter from Taipei's China Television Co. The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taipei's non-official conduit for mainland-Taiwan relations, Monday urged mainland authorities to reconsider a Sunday decision to bar SEF officials from even visiting the site. SEF counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in a fax Sunday to the SEF, made only perfunctory reference to the incident and did not detail reasons for the fire and death of the tourists. The deaths are widely believed to be the result of foul play, possibly the work of thieves who took advantage of lax police presence on the lake. Meanwhile, about 50 family members of the victims arrived Monday in Chunan to help police identify the corpses. Angered with the mainland's handling of the case, the family members have demanded the mainland authorities make public the true cause of the accident, allow SEF personnel to the site, and respect the relatives' wishes regarding the handling and transport of victims to Taiwan.
