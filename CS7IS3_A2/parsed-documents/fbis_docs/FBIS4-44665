This is something never before witnessed in Europe and not even among international commercial launchers, including the U.S. What is more, among the 15 commercial satellites being loaded onto the European rocket this year are half of the 15 satellites that Hughes (U.S.), the world's leading manufacturer of telecommunications satellites, is supposed to deliver to its customers in 1994! But in late January at Kourou, Aerospatiale is going to kick things off with a double Ariane 4 launch carrying two "Made in France" geostationary telecommunications satellites. They are the Eutelsat 2/F5 belonging to the European organization Eutelsat and, preeminently, the first Turkish satellite, Turksat 1A, that the French manufacturer is also supposed to deliver in orbit to Turkey. As a result, as a direct customer of Arianespace, Aerospatiale will therefore, for the first time, enjoy the privilege of having its name painted on the European rocket for which it is also the principal manufacturer in its capacity of industrial architect and project manager. In fact, the contract signed three years ago with Turkey by Aerospatiale provides for "turnkey" delivery of two satellites launched by Ariane as well as two ground control stations (equipped and personnel trained). Therefore, Aerospatiale is supposed to deliver the first operationally ready Turksat to the Turkish Post and Telecommunications [P&T] towards the end of February 1994. 34 Tons of Satellites The launch was scheduled for 20 January but was pushed back "a few days" by Arianespace on 17 January in order to check out a couple of irregularities in the cryogenic third stage orders sequencer that occurred during the previous flight (V62) in mid-December 1993. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ariane 1994 Flight Manifest | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FLIGHT |DATE |LAUNCHER |PAYLOAD | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V63 |Late January |AR44LP |Eutelsat 2/F5 (Eu-| | | | |rope) + Turksat 1-| | | | |A (Turkey) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V64 |Late February |AR44LP |Intelsat 7/F2 (In-| | | | |ternational) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V65 |Late March |AR44L |Solidaridad 2 (Me-| | | | |xico) + BS-3N (Ja-| | | | |pan) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V66 |Late April |AR42L |Telstar 4/F2 (ATT/| | | | |USA) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V67 |Mid-June |AR42P |PAS 2 (PanAmSat/U-| | | | |SA) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V68 |Late July |AR44LP |Brasilsat (Brazil)| | | | | + Turksat 1B (Tu-| | | | |rkey) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V69 |Late August |AR44L |DirecTV 2 (Hughes/| | | | |USA) + Thaicom 2 (| | | | |Malaysia) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V70 |Late September |AR42P |Astra 1D (SES/Lux-| | | | |embourg) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V71 |Late November |AR44LP |Brasilsat B2 (Bra-| | | | |zil) + Eutelsat 2/| | | | |F6 (Europe) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |V72 |Late December |AR42P |PAS 3 (PanAmSat/U-| | | | |SA) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Editor's note: Four types of Ariane 4 are used with two solid propellant b-| |oosters (42P), two or four liquid propellant boosters (42L or 44L) or four | |mixed boosters (44LP). | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This 63rd Ariane flight (in 14 years) will also be the 35th AR4 launch (in 5.5 years) since it was put into service in June 1988. Thirty-three of those 34 launches were successful (97 percent). V63 will be the 10th launch in the AR44L version. The 419 t rocket is supposed to carry a 4179 kg payload (including adapter) for launching the 1880 kg Eutelsat 2/F5 and the 1783 kg Turksat 1A. The satellites stacked under the shroud will be launched (in that order) into orbit at 200-35,934 km/7 degrees and then propelled by their own motor into geostationary orbit at 36 degrees E and 42 degrees E. [Boxed item] Hughes Shows Confidence in Ariane In 1994, Hughes Aircraft will entrust more than half of its telecommunications satellites (eight out of 15) to Ariane 4 (see table). This is the first time that the American firm, a world leader in the sector, will place so many satellites on the European rocket. As a result, Ariane will become the world's leading launcher of telecommunications satellites with 15 of the 21-23 "satcoms" (65-71 percent) scheduled for this year. The others will be launched by the new Japanese H2 (one), the U.S. Delta 2 (one), and the U.S. Atlas (two or three). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hughes Satellites To Be Launched in 1994 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DATE |SATELLITE |TYPE |CUSTOMER |LAUNCHER | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |February |Galaxy 1R |HS-376 |HCI |Delta 2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |March |Solidaridad 2 |HS-601 |Mexico |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |April |UHF/UFO-3 |HS-601 |US Navy |Atlas 1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |May |ApStar 1 |HS-376 APT |Sat |LM 3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |June |PAS 2 |HS-601 |PanAmSat |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |July |Brasilsat B1 |HS-376W |Brazil |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |August |Thaicom 2 |HS-376L |Thailand |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |August |DirecTV 2 |HS-601 |HCI |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |September |Astra 1D |HS-601 |SES |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |October |MSAT 2 |HS-601 |AMSC |Atlas 2A | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |November |Brasilsat B2 |HS-376W |Brazil |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |November |UHF/UFO-4 |HS-601 |US Navy |Atlas 2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |December |PAS 3 |HS-601 |PanAmSat |Ariane 4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |December |ApStar 2 |HS-601 |APTSat |LM 3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |? |Optus B3 |HS-601 |Optus |?? | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Editor's note: Ariane 4 launch dates are intercalated on the basis of the | |Arianespace schedule | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Both of the costly satellites and their launcher will be insured through French broker Faugere & Jutheau for a record value of $360 million. The next flight (V64), also with an AR44LP, is scheduled for 23 February, to launch the large 3.7 t Intelsat 7/F2. That will be the heaviest one launched this year by Ariane. The least heavy will be the Shinawatra (Thailand) Thaicom 2 weighing 1080 kg. This year the Hughes spun HS-376 will occupy half the Ariane flights with eight of its 15 satellites on the European rocket that will also launch two satellites manufactured by Martin Marietta Astro Space (Telstar 4/F2 and BS-3N) and one by Space Systems/Loral (Intelsat 7/F2) for a total of 11 satellites "Made in USA" out of 15 (73 percent). The other four satellites will be Aerospatiale's own. Total weight of those 15 "satcoms" is 33.9 t. The ERS-2 also enjoys priority launching this year. But the European radar-observation satellite is supposed to be launched only in January 1995. Other satellites have also been postponed until next year, especially the Measat 1, Amos-1, Italsat 2, Telecom-2C, two Intelsat 7A and ISO. By the end of 1994, therefore, Arianespace should have launched 72 of the scheduled 99 Arianes, including 44 Ariane 4's out of 71 (including 50 from lot P9). Therefore, there will be 27 Ariane 4's left to launch and 22 of the 37 satellites currently on order. This does not include new future orders that could lead Arianespace to order (between now and the end of the year) a few more additional AR4 to meet the demand before the arrival of Ariane 5 in less than two years. The European operator has also already planned to order, this year as well, the 14 first serial AR5 for operational flights beginning in 1996 (cf. A&C No. 1455).
