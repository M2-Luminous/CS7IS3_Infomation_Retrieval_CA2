Speaking at a luncheon meeting in Tokyo, sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Mieno said there were signs of improvement in the domestic economy, centering on personal consumption. Mieno, however, said the central bank is still unable to determine an economic pickup before key indicators are analyzed closely. Steady progress in stock adjustments suggests the groundwork is being laid for economic recovery, he said. Mieno also said the central bank sees no need to change the official discount rate for now from the present 1.75 percent per year.
