Yun, an official at the office of the senior presidential secretary for political affairs, will tour the two countries for two weeks collecting data and meeting with officials about their electoral systems, especially their election management systems, before returning home around May 29. The amendments to Korea's election laws recently passed by the National Assembly have provided the legal grounds for clean and inexpensive polls, a Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said. The question now is how to implement the new laws to achieve clean and cheap elections, he added. "Secretary Yun will visit the United Kingdom and the United States to research their election management systems and collect data which may help implement the new laws," he said.
