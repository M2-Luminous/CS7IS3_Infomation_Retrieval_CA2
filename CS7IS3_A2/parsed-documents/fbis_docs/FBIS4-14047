[Rothschild] It is not a question of whether I believe him or not. The question is whether he can implement the agreement. I believe that he wants to; however, if 'Arafat does not realize that he is assuming responsibility for a system as complicated as that of a country -- and whether or not he has sovereignty is of no significance here -- and if the world does not understand that he requires aid on a large scale, then there is no chance of turning a new leaf. [Peri] These are certainly good times. The coordinator of government activities in the territories is almost conducting public relations on behalf of 'Arafat. [Rothschild] Definitely. Not because I like 'Arafat so much but because I want this agreement to succeed. If the Palestinian authority does not show the residents that it is better than we were in the civilian-economic sphere, there is no chance of this agreement ever being implemented. We can hold talks in Cairo, Paris, and Washington until the sun goes down but if we fail to implement what is agreed upon because of a lack of resources, then what have we achieved? Their needs will grow threefold or fourfold after the agreement in comparison to their needs while we were in control. If we also consider the fact that they will be able to collect all the taxes they want to, then there will really be no chance of getting anything done. [Peri] People are saying that 'Arafat is deliberately stalling because he does not want the agreement at all. He does not want to be the mayor of Jericho and is afraid of being assassinated in Gaza. [Rothschild] I do not know if he is afraid. I think 'Arafat is becoming increasingly aware of the difficulties. I believe that one of his fears, which have accumulated during the negotiations, is that he will be unable to meet the needs and expectations of his public. He has no choice, however, because with every day that goes by without changes on the ground he loses more supporters of the agreement. Afterwards, things will be even more difficult for him. The more profound and detailed the negotiations become, the more the Palestinians realize how complicated their problem will prove to be; how impossible it is to bring about changes in the field within a short time; and to what degree the shortage of resources dashes any hopes of meeting the public's expectations. They are frightened by the burden of responsibility they will have to assume and the scope of the needs they will have to fill with regard to a population who currently receives services in all walks of life. [Peri] You are a member of the Israeli delegation to the economic talks with the Palestinians. How much money do they need in your assessment? [Rothschild] Our budget stands at 300 million shekels this year. They will need at least three times that amount because our budget does not include security. Today, we finance the salaries of 400 policemen. The Palestinians are talking about 9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. Salaries are not everything, there is also maintenance. Whoever talks about adding 200 classrooms must understand that even after the construction work is over, one still has to pay wages to hundreds of teachers. They also want to increase the number of clerks, build residential apartment buildings, set up a sewage system. [Peri] How do they perceive self-administration? [Rothschild] It is easier to speak of Gaza because Jericho is a very isolated area. It all depends on the kind of resources the Palestinian authority will have at its disposal. According to studies carried out by us, the public's standard of living will drop by 20 to 25 percent compared to its present level, which is already low. Unless a great deal of money is invested in the Gaza Strip very soon it will turn into a tinderbox. Not so much against Israel but primarily against the Palestinian rule. If people say that 'Arafat is frightened of an agreement, or at least hesitant, then that is the reason. [Peri] What do you expect them to do? [Rothschild] We are encouraging 'Arafat to appoint a council, but he is stalling. A decision should be made now on who is to head each system -- health, education, customs, and so forth, and these people should be brought in so as to have time to overlap with us before they take charge. They have to set up an entire economic system and to man the tax authority whose staff resigned at the outset of the intifadah. Under the agreement, they are committed to certain levels of income tax, VAT [value added tax], and customs. Yet they do not have a system which knows how to impose, calculate, and levy the taxes. You cannot build such a system in a day. Rami, Nabil Sha'th's son, arrived this week to acquaint himself with the computer system which we are going to leave to the Palestinian administration in Gaza. He is still in shock. It is a sophisticated system, and they have no one to operate it. You cannot work from day to day. You have to train people in each sphere of life. This week in Cairo, for instance, the transfer of the Finance Ministry's powers was discussed; namely, that Israel is to cancel all its contracts with suppliers. But they do not have answers to the most basic questions: How will they operate elevators? How will they obtain oxygen for hospitals? What will they do about all the daily systems based on these contracts? [Peri] Have your public and secret meetings with Palestinians included meetings with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] people? [Rothschild] Since Hamas is an illegal organization, people who meet me are only willing to admit to an affiliation with the universal Islamic network. I have spent many hours in conversation with these people. I acquired an in-depth acquaintance with how their network operates, what its objectives are, and how it seeks to achieve these objectives. One of their leaders told me: We are no pistol revolution. We did it once in Egypt (the assassination of President al-Sadat), and the alternative is someone who is much more diffident, hesitant, and much more brutal. Therefore, our method is to cultivate the support of a broad social stratum. How? We invest in the target public everything the administration cannot invest. [Peri] Is it possible that we screwed up, that we should have opted for the radicals? [Rothschild] I definitely think we conducted contacts with people who do not necessarily represent the Palestinian society. The problem with Faysal al-Husayni and the other salon leaders was that their power stemmed from their affiliation with the PLO, and not from a self-built position in the Palestinian street. We conduct negotiations with them, but the street does not recognize them. In my opinion, one of our mistakes was not having held sufficient contacts with the authentic leaders, and the intifadah has indeed generated such leaders. We could have found them in prisons. On the Palestinian street. One does not necessarily make political agreements with them, but a dialogue with them is definitely possible. But it should be understood: I will not propose -- and I never have -- that we hold contacts with Hamas, whose motto is the destruction of Israel. [Peri] I understand from your answer that the agenda should have been turned around: We should have started with the local radicals -- not Hamas -- and bring in the Tunis wheeler-dealers afterward. We should have skipped al-Husayni, 'Ashrawi, and the likes. [Rothschild] Yes. We should have started out by talking with the street leaders. With those who are capable of getting 5,000 or 10,000 people out to hurl stones. They would have been capable of getting the same 10,000 to extend olive branches. The PLO alone cannot do it. I have always been in favor of launching a dialogue with the street leaders, because you can run the area with them, and they have no problem cooperating with us. Guys like Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq or Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, who have served many years in prison -- they are not afraid. They have already thrown their grenades. Faysal al-Husayni cannot criticize them, because they will immediately answer: And where have you been? [Peri] If we indeed made a mistake in this issue, is it still possible to fix it? [Rothschild] We are fixing it, because now we are holding a dialogue with representatives of the Palestinian street. [Peri] It is still unclear who will rule the territories: 'Arafat and the people from Tunis, or the young local leadership? [Rothschild] I am convinced that if the people from Tunis do not give the local youngsters a measure of control, they will find it very hard to rule. The young generation, however, will also find it hard to go it alone. Even if they are considered the leaders in the streets of Gaza, they have no funds. Only a combination of PLO funds -- raised by regular contributions and organized by a well-ordered system -- and the authentic local leadership, can provide some chances for normal functioning. [Peri] Will the real problems in the territories surface only after the withdrawal, with the present level of terrorism being only a sort of prelude? [Rothschild] I am not all that concerned about the security problem, although it tops our list of priorities. I believe the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is strong enough to solve this problem eventually. It is very possible that the Palestinian police will be interested in proving it can cope with terrorism within the area under its jurisdiction, whereas terrorism will still prevail in the areas under our control. [Peri] Do you believe that the Palestinian police will be able to squelch Hamas activity? [Rothschild] I believe that the primary objective of the Palestinian police will be not to prevent Hamas attacks against us, but rather to foil attacks on the Palestinian council, to prevent Hamas taking over the streets and its attempts to disrupt daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho. They will leave it to us to foil Hamas attacks against Israel. [Peri] If Israel has early warnings about a Hamas attack, will the Palestinian police cooperate with us, or will it leak the information to Hamas members? [Rothschild] According to the agreement between us, if there is a warning about somebody who plans attacks against us, the PLO has to foil these attacks. We must remember, however, that the Palestinian police will not be homogeneous. There will probably be some people there whose opinions do not necessarily coincide with those of the PLO. There are enough people in Gaza who find this agreement utterly disagreeable and who will do everything possible to foil it, including attacks on Israelis and on the Palestinian autonomy institutions. [Peri] The Palestinian street is a great and frightening unknown. Do you find a deep and eternal hatred for us there? [Rothschild] There is hatred, but I would not term it eternal. It is a hatred which is not politically motivated, but is rather constituted of negative feelings toward our behavior, whether this behavior is justified or not. A son who sees his father under detention, or who has to undergo brutal searches and insults can never forget this -- nothing will change this fact. I am not talking here about those wounded and killed. [Peri] What about the slight to their honor? [Rothschild] The insult done to their honor is one of the main factors contributing to their hatred. This hatred, however, is limited only to those affected, and does not mean that the Palestinians will not be able to coexist with us over the long term. [Peri] What does coexistence with the Israelis mean for the Palestinians? [Rothschild] It is a slogan for wanting to receive all the benefits Israel can give them without Israeli presence in the territories. It means working in Israel, trading with us, and enjoying Israeli freedom. I believe that over the prolonged months of negotiations 'Arafat has learned about a Palestinian public he was unfamiliar with. This is a public which has learned a lot from us over the last 26 years. It is a demanding public which has learned to use the media. They used CNN against us, and now they are using it against 'Arafat. It is not the public to which 'Arafat was accustomed in Beirut, Amman, or Tunis, a public which was used to obey his every order. [Peri] Do you hear them criticize 'Arafat? [Rothschild] Now they criticize him openly, whereas once they dared to criticize him only secretly. The difference is that today they give vent to their criticism openly over the pages of AL-QUDS. They say that if 'Arafat believes he can establish the 23d dictatorship in the Middle East here, he is mistaken. It is not only that somebody is willing to write this down, there is also somebody who is willing to publish this criticism. [passage omitted] [Peri] You sound very pessimistic. [Rothschild] I am not pessimistic, I am concerned. If the agreement we achieved will not be implemented on the ground, we will have achieved nothing. Unfortunately, we can do very little to help implement this agreement. The chances of implementing it depend on how the Palestinians shoulder the responsibility, their ability to manage affairs and their leadership. I am rather worried about all of this, because I still do not see any signs that the Palestinian side is ready to assume this responsibility.
