FR941021-1-00055 FR941021-1-00009 The projected 10-year costs of the intermediate vision proposal for second-class applicants are $462,887 in primary testing costs, $2.2 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting the standard, and $6,529 in direct processing costs for the expected 17 additional persons who would be denied under the provision, totalling $2.7 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.8 million. The projected 10-year costs of the near vision proposal for third-class applicants are $2.8 million in primary testing costs, $1.3 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting the standard, and $131,340 in direct processing costs for the expected 339 additional persons who would be denied under the provision, totalling $4.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.9 million. It is emphasized that the denials and costs associated with the near vision proposal are not wholly attributable to the proposed amendment. Although this requirement does not exist in current regulations, it has been in place administratively for some time. Thus, the associated costs are being, and would continue to be, incurred without this proposed amendment. NTSB accident records were investigated for the periods from 1962 through 1989 for commercial flights and from 1982 through 1989 for general aviation (GA). For these periods, no accident was found where intermediate or near vision deficiency was specifically determined to be the cause. As such, the FAA is not able to quantitatively ascribe the benefits of the three proposed vision amendments based on historical accident analysis. Notwithstanding the absence of documented accidents related to these three proposals, the FAA maintains that such accidents may well have occurred and could continue to occur in the absence of the proposed amendments. The NTSB accident analysis system may not document those cases where a near or intermediate vision problem caused or contributed to accidents. Examples would include deviations from course or altitude, inaccurate monitoring of gauges and other avionic displays, and incorrect setting of aeronautical parameters such as headings or radio frequencies. While the extent to which intermediate or near vision problems have caused such accidents is unknown, it is the FAA's position that: (1) general aviation pilots require adequate near vision to read charts and checklists, and (2) commercial pilots require adequate intermediate vision to properly monitor aircraft instruments. Although this evaluation is not able to quantify the benefits of the proposed vision amendments, the FAA holds that the benefits would be significant and would exceed the expected costs. Electrocardiogram (ECG), Second-Class The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for second-class medical certificates would be required to have a routine resting ECG at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years after reaching age 40. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $25.5 million in primary testing costs, and $1.7 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 178 persons who would be denied, totalling $27.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $19.2 million. The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records. In the absence of this proposal, commercial pilot, heart-related accidents over the 1994&hyph;2003 period are projected to consist of: 2.64 deaths per year valued at $6.60 million, .14 serious injuries per year valued at $89,600, .14 minor injuries per year valued at $322, and 2.06 damaged or destroyed (GA and commercial) airplanes per year valued at $169,360, totalling $6,859,282 per year. The projected benefits of this provision over the ten-year study period are $68.6 million, with a present value of $48.2 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 40 percent effectiveness level ($19.2 million cost / $48.2 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial.
