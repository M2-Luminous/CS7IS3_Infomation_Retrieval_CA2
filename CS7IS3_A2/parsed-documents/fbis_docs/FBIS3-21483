It reflects a continuation of the choices and guidelines set forth in the Eighth Economic and Social Development Plan. The reforms initiated in the fields of taxation, deregulated trade, and incentives for private investment are being continued. While the 1994 General State Budget reflects a calm climate characterized by the positive results recorded over the preceding two years in terms of growth, employment, restraint of price developments, and preservation of the internal financial equilibriums, it nevertheless faces a certain amount of pressure due to the foreign debt and the need to prevent runaway price increases as a result of the wage increases granted in 1993. It is in that optimistic context that the total volume of the 1994 General State Budget was set at 5.515 billion dinars[D] compared to D4.95 billion in 1993, an 11.4-percent increase. Tax revenues continue to constitute the main source of funds for the state budget. They are expected to total D3.5 billion compared to D3.08 billion in 1993, a 13.6-percent increase. Nontax revenues are estimated at D702 million, thus remaining more or less at their 1993 level of D700 million. Borrowing will provide D1.203 billion, of which 72 percent will come from domestic loans. Expenditures under Title I (state operating expenditures) are set at D3.422 billion, an increase of 10 percent over 1993. Operating expenditures related to payroll and current management expense in government departments are set at D2.116 billion, or 62 percent of total current expenditures. That increase of 11.6 percent over 1993 is due in particular to pay raises. Expenditures under Title II are set at D2.093 billion, or about 14 percent more than capital expenditures in 1993. Those expenditures are divided into direct investments (D635 million), financial operations (D415 million), and reimbursement of debt principal (D1.043 billion, including D507 million for the reimbursement of domestic debt). Taking the above data into account, the net budget deficit is estimated at D320 million, compared to D357 million in 1993 and D389.8 million in 1992. The following should also be mentioned: 1. The revenues and expenditures of government enterprises whose budgets are attached to the General State Budget as a suspense item are set at D334.961 million, compared to D305.029 million in 1993, a 9.8-percent increase. 2. The revenues and expenditures of government enterprises whose budgets are attached to the annexed budget as a suspense item are set at D1.875 million, compared to D1.793 million in 1993. 3. Revenues in the annexed budget are set at D273 million for 1994, an increase of 10 percent over 1993 (D248 million) despite elimination of the item relative to television broadcasting revenues. 4. Revenues and expenditures in connection with special Treasury funds are set at D643 million, an increase of 5.2 percent over 1993 (D611 million).
