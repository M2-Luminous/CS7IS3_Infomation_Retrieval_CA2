FR940630-0-00093 FR940630-0-00036 The Department acknowledges that in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department specifically declined to adopt numerical goals despite suggestions from members of the public to the contrary. The suggestions to adopt numerical goals were made at meetings held at HUD Headquarters before publication of the proposed rule. As part of development of the proposed rule, the Department held two meetings on section 3 at HUD Headquarters, and invited to these meetings various housing authorities, industry groups, representatives of public housing residents and other low-income residents. (These meetings and the listing of some of the individuals and groups that attended these meetings were discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule at 58 FR 52535&hyph;52536.) At these meetings, several of the meeting participants suggested, as did commenters on the proposed rule, that the section 3 rule provide for numerical goals as goals that recipients and contractors should strive to meet, and as a means of measuring compliance with section 3. In the proposed rule, the Department declined to adopt numerical goals stating that the establishment of numerical goals was not consistent with the objectives of section 3. The Department stated: Section 3 provides that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, economic opportunities generated by the expenditure of HUD financial assistance should be given to low- and very low-income persons. This means that, if feasible and if consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, all economic opportunities generated by HUD financial assistance must be given to low- and very low-income persons. Generally, however, this will not be feasible in every case. For example, with respect to employment opportunities, it is unlikely that in every hiring situation low- and very low-income persons will be qualified for every job opportunity generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance. Therefore, it is not possible to measure compliance with section 3 in terms of a numerical result, because numerical results will vary dependent upon the circumstances of the hiring, e.g., the types of jobs offered, the skills required for these jobs, and the qualifications of the low- and very low-income persons (residing within the metropolitan area, or non-metropolitan county) to fill these jobs. Although every job may not be filled by a low-or a very low-income person, section 3 requires that efforts must be made to hire as many low- and very low-income persons to the greatest extent feasible. (58 FR 52536) While the Department continues to recognize that numerical results will vary depending upon the circumstances surrounding the hiring or contract award, the Department was persuaded by comments on the proposed rule that broadly established numerical ``goals'' (i.e., hiring or contracting levels likely to be achieved in most employment and contracting situations) better serve the objectives of section 3, and better assist recipients and contractors in complying with section 3, than a listing of various types of outreach efforts that recipients and contractors may undertake. The commenters on the proposed rule expressed concern about the number of low- and very low-income persons hired, and the numbers of contracts awarded to section 3 business concerns that would be considered by the Department to be in compliance with section 3. The commenters stated that the proposed rule required recipients to report annually on the numbers of training and employment opportunities provided to low- and very low-income persons, and the number of contracting opportunities awarded to section 3 business concerns, but failed to provide any indication about what hiring and contracting results would be considered in compliance with section 3. A few commenters stated that a focus on efforts, and not results, would make recipients overly concerned with the process, and not with the outcome of the process; that is, recipients would be too concerned whether efforts undertaken matched those in the regulation, without serious analysis of whether those efforts were appropriate for achieving the desired results. In a similar vein, a few commenters stated that the Department's role was to focus on the results, and the role of the recipients and contractors is to determine how best to achieve those results. In response to these comments, ยง135.30 of the interim rule establishes numerical goals (stated in terms of percentages) for training and employment, and for contracting. The Department will not repeat in the preamble, the entire text of this section, but will note some key features of this section.
