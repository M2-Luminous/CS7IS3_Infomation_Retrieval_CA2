Those who wish to create conflicts in the future are attempting to portray, in advance, the situation in the territory from which the Israeli enemy will withdraw. The Mosad began to assassinate nationalist symbols and strugglers in the occupied territory just as the racist regime in South Africa assassinated struggler Chris Hani and created bloody riots in which hundreds of black citizens were killed. The same experiment is being repeated in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli occupation could not fabricate bloody conflicts among the resistance factions, so it resorted to assassinations. Palestinian strugglers from all revolutionary factions -- such as Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and other factions -- were exposed to the killing and arrests we have seen in Gaza and the West Bank. The Israeli occupation wanted to create a state of chaos and insecurity on the eve of the promised Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area on 13 December. When these attempts failed, the Israeli occupation postponed the withdrawal and began to maliciously aggravate sensitivities and differences, (?embody) them, and exaggerate them. Some of us fell victims to this black media. International and hostile press contributed to the inflation of Palestinian events in order to portray the areas from which the enemy will withdraw as if they were moving toward conflagration. This propaganda ended the joy felt by many people and created fear and concern in their hearts. This resulted in an internal situation that produced national, factional events and differences. Regrettably, the media and press highlighted these unjustified differences. People became more worried about security and stability and cautioned against the future. Many articles were published in newspapers and the Palestinian leadership was, for no reason, the target of criticism and defamation. Popular awareness is necessary so that the masses will be ready for national reconciliation. It is also essential so that the leading cadres will be ready to undertake this mission through their deep understanding of the nature of the coming stage, which calls on them to be disciplined, calm, self-confident, and convinced in their future mission so that the masses will find security. We must be aware that the Israeli occupation is the cause of our instability, starvation, and loss of our freedom of expression. The end of this occupation means the elimination of these diseases, which were caused by the occupation of our Palestinian territory for many years. Ending the occupation of a part of our land will certainly bring us back to normal and will prepare us to work seriously in building the free Palestinian society of the future. Responsible behavior is a test for the awareness of the factions, cadres, and masses, which should not vie for authority, but should work for fostering cooperation between all parties for the sake of construction. Authority has not been attained yet, and the results of occupation are still before our eyes. We ask every member of the police and security forces to behave as a loyal servant to the security of the masses. The police and security forces should maintain the masses' property and their freedom of expression. The image in the masses' mind that the police and security forces are coming to impose a coercive system should be changed. The police and security forces have come to maintain human relations between the people and to provide the appropriate atmosphere so that the masses can resume their natural life from which they have been deprived for so long. They were deprived of holding parties, celebrations, meetings, and seminars. They were deprived of cooperating with various groups, and of establishing social, cultural, economic groups, and practicing all actions that the human being practices in a stable society. This is the task of everyone affiliated with a movement, faction, organization, or political party, because democracy cannot be entrenched as an expression of human rights and freedom unless all Palestinian organizations act properly in dealing with one another first, and then in dealing with the masses in general. The factions should refrain from inciting differences or digging in the past, which might incite factional, family, or religious differences, so that every citizen will feel that the liberated homeland is his homeland, and that he is living in it freely, and is enjoying security and stability. We stand before an experiment that the world is witnessing, and on the basis of which it will judge our good or bad performance and our administration of the liberated territories. The reaction of the friendly world and the donors will be good or bad in accordance with our administration and the national relations that we will weave between the citizens and the resistance factions, and their performance of their national duties on the ground. There is no society that is free from social, political, or economic problems, but the developed societies give prominence to these problems and explain them in an objective manner. They try to resolve them through a collective effort after reaching the successful solutions for such problems. They keep rival groups away from fighting, confrontation, and inciting local conflicts to enable the national authority organs and the resistance factions carry out their duties comfortably, in a manner that keeps them away from confrontation with the masses and serve the masses' daily interests in an honest and sincere manner. Our past experiences remained in our minds as Palestinians in spite of the signs of [word indistinct] that surfaced in the Palestinian society. We should return to our nature of national solidarity, collective action, and eagerness to serve the masses and offer all that they need in this transitional stage in which suspicion, doubt, and anxiety are abundant, and the enemy is sowing these fears in the whole Arab area. The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for the whole Arab area because the Palestine question is the crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and all that takes place within its framework is directly reflected on the Arab situation. Therefore, we should be a good example in behavior and performance when we build our future society. From now, we recommend that voluntary teams of women be formed in every walk of life. Let us enable women to do considerable social and economic work; let us organize their efforts in social, economic, and cultural institutions; and let us open schools to train and enlighten them in order to qualify them and make them capable of work, sacrifice, and participation. If such groups had been formed in quarters and camps to carry out a comprehensive survey of people's needs, we would have been able to accelerate economic development. We also should qualify youths, find job opportunities for them, and train them in all cultural, social, and economic fields. Let a school be opened every day for these youths so that our society can become full of qualified people capable of construction. Someone said that the voice of work is stronger than the roar of words. We have to take into account that the current transitional stage is witnessing some sort of mix of criticism, freedom of speech, and insult; of narrow sectarian prejudice and enlightened political affiliation; and of those who just raise national unity slogans and those who work to realize those slogans on the ground. We also notice another kind of mix in what is possible in this transitional period and what is impossible and of short-term and strategic goals. We have no magic wand to achieve what we want. Instead, we have to continue our struggle to make achievements gradually day after day and year after year. We should not seek certain positions. Instead, we should work because work will lead us to suitable positions. We are not in a stage of sharing the booty, as some unexperienced people believe. We are now surveying and promoting our qualifications to carry out our missions and to continue our hard struggle, in which opinions on the ways to achieve national goals differ. The enemy, with its sins, is still penetrating our circles through the pains, the backwardness, and the social diseases it has left behind. We have to remove them through hard work and through our social and political awareness. Let us refrain from punishing those who committed mistakes. Let us try to reform them and make them good citizens. We also should promote the spirit of cooperation among all the militant forces without exception, we should behave like instructors and educators, and we should forgive people of their mistakes by dealing with these mistakes in sound ways and far from grudge and hatred. The homeland is for every one, and every one has contributed to its liberation and has to contribute to its construction.
