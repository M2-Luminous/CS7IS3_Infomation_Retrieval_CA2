"The Public Service Commission and I have (consequently) embarked on a programme to ensure that groups that are under-represented are targeted for immediate employment in the public service," Dr Skweyiya said in a statement. He said all existing posts which needed to be filled would be filled. "At least 1,000 posts will be made available for filling and the posts will be at all levels, ranging from entry posts up to and including posts in the management echelons," he said. A spokesman said this included directors-general of government departments. Earlier this week, Dr Skweyiya announced the promulgation of a public service act that lays down guidelines for the rationalisation of the central government and former homeland civil service corps. Dr Skweyiya said "the filling of posts will be dealt with within existing budgetary allocations". He said he was establishing a "component to assist the (Public Service) Commission [PSC] with all issues relating to representivity will be established in the office of the PSC. [sentence as received] "An organisational component will be established in each department to assist the management in promoting representivity. A data base will be established to analyse the composition of the public service continuously. The public service as a career will be promoted amongst under-represented groups." Dr Skweyiya indicated that he already had several candidates for some posts. "I am aware of many well-qualified persons from under- represented groups who could play a key role in the public service. I call on them to respond positively when posts are advertised." Dr Skweyiya said that although the posts were aimed at under- represented groups, persons from "other groups" were welcome to apply. Serving civil servants could also apply. He said departments would be advised that where a Public Service Commission had already made recommendations on the filling of a post, that recommendation was withdrawn with immediate effect. He said the posts would be re-advertised. In addition to existing vacancies, further employment opportunities would be created. "If suitable candidates apply for these positions, new posts will be created in consultation with departments." Dr Skweyiya said the new government was committed to transforming the public service into a democratic, non-sexist and non-racial public service to serve all South Africans. "After the struggle against apartheid all South Africans are anxiously waiting for the transformation of the public service. In this regard my ministry will do its utmost to ensure that, in the spirit of the Reconstruction and Development Programme and of the new constitution, the public service will be restructured to serve the needs of all South Africans. "South Africa's public service is not broadly representative and therefore fails to comply with the constitutional requirements of Section 212(2)(B). This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The problem is not just the lack of representation of racial groups in many categories, but also gross under-representation of women, particularly black women. A well-planned and structured approach, comprising definite positive actions by the Public Service Commission, the provincial service commissions, departments and management at all levels is called for."
