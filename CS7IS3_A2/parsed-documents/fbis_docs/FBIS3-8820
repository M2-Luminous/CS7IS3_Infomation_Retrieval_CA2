President Izetbegovic would always refuse to talk to them. A day after the preliminary agreement on forming a federation of the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Bosniak-Muslim and Croat majorities was signed, the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina agreed to give an interview to NEDJELJNA DALMACIJA, the Croatian political weekly. [Soldic] Mr. President, how did you take the signed preliminary agreement on forming a federation in areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina with majority Bosniac and Croat populations? [Izetbegovic] With mixed feelings of hope and doubt. I do not think I have to explain the reason for my ambiguous feelings. If you have good intentions, you will take the news with hope, if you are also realistic, you will have many reasons for doubt and apprehension. But, for me, it was good news after a long time. [Soldic] On whose initiative did this agreement come about? [Izetbegovic] This time, the United States took the initiative and they got strong support from Germany, Turkey, Austria, and some other Western and Muslim countries. But you surely remember that I made a similar proposal sometimes last summer. It was during a dinner-party Lord Owen gave in his Geneva residence for [Croatian President] Tudjman and myself. There were only the three of us there, but my proposal was published in the Croatian press, I think. Mr. Tudjman refused the proposal at the time. Mr. Tudjman and I Behind the Scenes [Soldic] Which Bosnian, Croat, and international factors participated in making this proposal? [Izetbegovic] Our delegations, headed by [Foreign Ministers] Silajdzic and Granic participated directly, and, naturally, Mr. Tudjman and I behind the scenes. I influenced some solutions in the agreement, but my role was more one of insisting on looking for and finding solutions. I do not know exactly what President Tudjman was doing, but I presume he had a similar role. Our job was made easier by the fact that Silajdzic and Granic are very competent and good negotiators, but I still think that, without the active involvement of the United States, we would not have got very far. The fact that Christopher, Gore, Redman, and even President Clinton himself were actively involved in this says a lot. [Soldic] This agreement foresees an organization on a cantonal basis, i.e., the idea of creating ethnic ministates was completely abandoned. Will cantons have national characteristics and how many cantons will there be in the federation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina areas with Bosniak and Croat majorities? [Izetbegovic] We could say that the concept of ethnic ministates was thereby relinquished. However, cantons will mostly be national. I could say national, but not ethnically pure. Regard this, the area of central Bosnia is a specific case, because the population is mixed, or better yet, turned upside down, as if there had been a demographic earthquake. I have already mentioned the initiative I presented last summer on a joint state of the Muslims and the Croats. I was specifically motivated at that time by central Bosnia, i.e., the insolubility of that area. I felt that we would continue to fight hopelessly for this area because we instead on dividing it, and this is where I was, unfortunately, right. And regarding the number of the cantons, we still do not know yet, but I believe there will be between seven and nine cantons. [Soldic] How much territory will the future cantons take? [Izetbegovic] One of the introductory provisions of the preliminary agreement gives an answer to this question, in a very general manner, and says that the federation is formed in areas with Muslim and Croat majorities. I think that would be about 60 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Soldic] How do they intend to solve the problem of the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by Karadzic's Serbs? [Izetbegovic] In short: The agreement is akso open to the Serbs. If they do not want to accept that, they can opt for the union option from the Geneva concept. What I am trying to say is that they can chose from several variants, provided that Bosnia-Herzegovina remains an integral country or, to be more precise, provided that the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not change. [Soldic] Can you explain the division of responsibility between central and cantonal authorities? [Izetbegovic] I recommend that your readers read the relevant provisions of the preliminary agreement. They are very clear and need no additional explanation. We can say that the proposed solution is characterized by a relatively strong central authority, with the wide competence of cantons, especially regarding questions of specific national interest. We could generally say: The state provides joint interests and cantons protect national interests. Solutions Specific Like Bosnia [Soldic] What is the planned national structure in the central and cantonal authorities? [Izetbegovic] Those are various combinations of the principle of parity and the principle of proportion. Parity is planned for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, as it is a very important body, and in the House of Nations. The proportion principle will be applied in the Chamber of Representatives and "something in between" in the federal government (at least 30 percent of ministerial seats are reserved for Croat deputies), while, in the cantons, all organs are established on a propertional basis. [Soldic] When will the constitution of the federation be adopted? [Izetbegovic] The draft constitution is being established in Vienna. After the agreement is signed, it is planned that it will be ratified by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. Therefore, we are planning a legal way of transforming the state from the present constitutional system to a new one. [Soldic] Does the present agreement foresee the presidential system? [Izetbegovic] Yes, to some extent. However, that will not be a purely presidential system. I would rather call it a combination of presidential and parliamentary systems. On the other hand, the majority principle, or the rule of the majority, which always characterizes a parliamentary system of authority, has been significantly amended or limited by a two-chamber composition of the future assembly, where the second chamber, the House of Nations, requires consensus, and so forth. All in all, a specific solution, as specific as Bosnia itself. [Soldic] Does the present agreement abolish the previously signed agreement on the EC administration of Mostar? [Izetbegovic] No, during the last hours of the talks, just before the agreement was signed, we agreed that the European Union would temporarily be in charge of Mostar. [Soldic] Do the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croats, lose the right to dual citizenship acquired a year and a half ago as a result of this agreement? [Izetbegovic] No, they do not. [Soldic] What do you think about the preliminary agreement on the principles and basis for founding a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] I support that project. As you know, the idea was developed much earlier than the Washington agreement. [Soldic] You have probably heard that a part of the Croatian public resists that idea, as well as the idea about a joint state with the Muslims. [Izetbegovic] I know, I have heard that. Resistance comes from those who have a guilty conscience and are deeply involved in this senseless conflict between the Croats and the Muslims. They fear the truth will come to the surface once the war is over. Naturally, there are those who are not well-informed -- or who are misinformed. Let me give them some information: More than 10,000 Muslims actively participated in the Croatian Army in the war of 1991. Many have never returned to their homes, and I personally prevented 25,000 to 30,000 of our men joining the "JNA" [Yugoslav National Army] to go to the Croatian front during the war. It was in August, 1991, when our Presidency -- although Serbian deputies were opposed to it and in spite of the protests, and even threats, of the former JNA -- forbade any further mobilization of young Bosnian men to the JNA. One should not forget those things, although it seems to me that some of your people have a Freudian loss of memory. Anyway, I know the views of most Croatian intellectuals on this question, the way the Catholic Church thinks, and even the views of relevant political factors, those in the authorities and those from the opposition. I am well-informed and pleased about that. [Soldic] Does Croatia get the right of transit through Neum, the territory of the federation? [Izetbegovic] Yes, it does, without restrictions, as if there were no borders. That is reciprocal: Bosnia gains similar rights on the communication line from Ploce to the Bosnian border. This is, of course, of the greatest practical value for the future confederal relations between the two states. "I First Thought About Roads..." [Soldic] What can refugees expect from this normalization of relations between the Croats and the Muslims, i.e., between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] I mentioned one of our motives for this arrangement. That is the problem of central Bosnia. The second, more important, one -- perhaps the most important one -- concerns refugees. Conflicts between us and the Croats have completely marred the prospects for their return. All roads were closed. There seemed to be no way out. You asked me -- I think that was your first question -- how did I take those signatures in Washington. Let me tell you what I thought first when I heard the news about the signing of those documents. I thought about the roads that would be opened and the thousands of our people who would use them to run to their homes. You do not know how much they desire that. I know, I was with them, I saw it. Thank God for this sudden glimmer of hope.
