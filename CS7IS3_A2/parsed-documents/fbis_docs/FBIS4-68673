The Bashkiria Procuracy suspects him of murdering Ravil Musin, head of the city of Dyurtyul and Dyurtyulinskiy rayon administrations, who also served as a volunteer deputy chairman of the republic parliament; he died some time ago from the explosion of a grenade attached to a wicket at his home. After Musin's death, Talipov assumed the former's duties. Some time later he was dismissed for "shortcomings in his work" and went on to become the director of Dyurtyulinskiy meat combine, where he worked until lately. According to a version of the investigation, Talipov participated in a criminal conspiracy to kill Musin by hiring a contract killer. The suspect is under arrest. Investigation continues.
