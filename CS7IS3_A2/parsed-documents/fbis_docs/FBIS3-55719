Vladimir Shumeyko, chief of the organizing committee, has already said that he is going to propose the vote right after the question of voting procedure was resolved. By many accounts, it is Mr. Shumeyko, elected in Kaliningrad Oblast, who has the best chances to assume this job. He even plans to ask Boris Yeltsin to allow him to combine his permanent job at the Federation Council with being deputy prime minister. Earlier, Vladimir Shumeyko had said that he did not consider the future speaker as "a ceremonial figure, but as a decisionmaking politician" -- apparently unlike "the first-night speaker," Yuriy Chernichenko, who will open the senate's meeting as the oldest deputy. There have been no reports about any consultations among other senators as to who would be their head. Viktor Stepanov, chief of the Karelian Supreme Soviet, even suggested that there should be no speaker in the upper chamber at all so that "no one will manipulate the deputies." This option is unlikely to materialize. What this means, however, is that Vladimir Shumeyko may have as many as 169 competitors, but none of them can seriously challenge him. Still, one should proceed with care when forecasting the results of the vote. The Federation Council, unlike the State Duma, has so far been devoid of party lines. Any talk about party factions in the council is yet out of the question: out of 170 seats, the communists have 12; "Russia's Choice," 6; and the Agrarian Party, 1. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy claims that senator Leonid Polezhayev, Omsk Oblast governor, has connections with his party. Mr. Polezhayev himself denies this. Mr. Shumeyko has already said that he was "glad that the upper chamber does not have any party affiliation." It is likely, however, that territorial blocs will emerge in it instead of party factions. Eduard Rossel, dismissed from governorship but still leader of the Urals Economic Cooperation Association, continues his efforts to form a group called "Deputies of the Urals." On Monday evening, the council of the "Siberian Agreement" association was meeting to work out its line of conduct; the next meeting was scheduled for Wednesday. The essence of the policies regional elites are expecting their delegates to pursue was formulated fairly clearly by conferences of entrepreneurs in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, and Magadan: They requested that the Far East authorities take protectionist measures to shield domestic businesses and introduce tight taxation rules for foreign entrepreneurs.
