At least many of them are. A few days ago a blizzard played tricks over the city, pressing down on it with large snowdrifts and converting the sidewalks into narrow paths and the roads in narrow ruts. The city administration does not have any funds to put them in order. Ordinary citizens are being "squeezed" by the prices in the stores, in transportation, and in the day care centers and hospitals. The defense enterprises that constitute the basis of the city's industry are "squeezing" people by their violations of the conversion law. Motorostroitel, the city's largest AO [joint-stock company] received for the current year a state production order that is capable of giving a workload to only five percent of the production capacities. The Christmas vacation at some enterprises has not yet ended. According to the administration's estimates, during the next few weeks the conversion plants will have to lay off at least approximately 15,000 workers. Who will be included in that figure? Where will those people go? What will their families live on? These are questions to which no one in Perm can give an intelligible answer. It is only in the headquarters of the local parties and public associations that life is in full swing. The people there are preparing for the election to the oblast Representative Assembly. According to preliminary estimates, from 500 to 600 candidates will contend for 40 places. Who, then, has the best chances of success? Perhaps one of the leaders of the local section of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]--19-year-old Aleksandr Chulkov, who identified himself as a student but who, it transpired, is not carried on the rolls of any higher educational institution? He has already announced that the Zhirinovskiy followers have been guaranteed the majority in the assembly. In addition, he has called himself the "shadow governor," and has recruited a shadowy "cabinet of ministers." Another local leader of the same party sent to the Perm section of the SDP [Social Democratic Party], which is organizing an antifascist front, a letter in which he promised that, in payment for the criticism leveled against his party (when the LDPR comes to power), everyone will be subjected to repressions, up to and including death by firing squad. But if one speaks seriously, in Perm the LDPR scarcely has any chances of success. But the Communists have substantial ones. This is attested to if only by the results of the election to the State Duma. V. Zelenin, agricultural institute professor, and V. Putilov, chairman of the Rossiya [Russia] Kolkhoz, the largest one in the oblast, both of whom got through the election with unambiguously Communist programs, garnered considerably more votes than the other pretenders. It is also interesting that today more and more Communist Party sections are being supported by young people and students. They have begun, by the way, to issue a newspaper under the somewhat pretentious name NASH PAROVOZ [Our Locomotive]. The trade unions are also counting on a majority in the Representative Assembly. People in the Perm Oblast Council of Trade Unions regret that they did not take part in the election to the State Duma. Now they have decided to fight actively for places in the oblast representative authority. Yet another previously unknown force arose unexpectedly on the local political scene -- the force consisting of the united managers of banks and other financial structures. And it can be assumed that a definite amount of success has been guaranteed to them --if only at the expense of the money that they have at their disposal. Those Perm residents who still preserve some kind of political aggressiveness are, of course, worried most about what kind of succession will occur between the present Council that is living its last days and the future Representative Assembly. M. Bystryantsev, chairman of the oblast Council, feels that there is no doubt about it. First, in his opinion, at least half the members of the small Council can become part of the Representative Assembly and be beneficial there. But he himself is also planning to run for election. One should have no doubts about Mikhail Ivanovich's success. Several districts and public associations are already arguing today about the right to nominate him as their candidate. Immediately the question arises: does this mean that he will also head the assembly? That would really be too much! There are two real leaders. One of them is, yes, M. Bystryantsev. However, the oblast administration has decided to oppose him with Doctor of Economic Sciences Ye. Sapiro, first deputy governor. To tell the truth, the collision between the two leaders seems to be a bad thing. But, really, there are those who wanted very much to organize it. Why? Apparently the administration wants to put under its control the new representative authority that has not even been born yet! We can see that the process that is gathering force on the federal level has also seized the provinces. Until the snowdrifts are cleared away here... to the politicians!
