In 1994-95 it will also receive $550 million to cover the balance of payment deficit and back up social programs. The agreement on the loan was signed during the consultative conference of the World Bank and Kyrgyz representatives in Paris on 2 and 3 June, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev told a press conference in Bishkek. The program for economic restructuring envisages measures to lower the inflation rate to 3 percent (it stood at 7.5 percent last May) and to 2.5 percent by the middle of 1995. By the end of 1997, the annual rate of inflation is to stand at 4 percent. Akayev said that, to date, Europe did not offer any significant assistance either to Kyrgyzstan or to Central Asia. The U.S. and Japan are playing the biggest role in promoting the economic reform in Kyrgyzstan. Akayev said he was disappointed with the results of cooperation with the European Commission and said that the credits extended last year were "the plunder of the poor." To quote the president, in Brussels he expressed disappointment with the program for technical assistance, proposed by the European Commission. He said that this program was absolutely useless, because it benefitted only the European Commission's bureaucrats, so Kyrgyzstan no longer needed proposed consultations.
