[Brahimi] It is difficult for me to go for one reason: Namely, the security situation is unstable. The United Nations is evacuating people from there. I know that there is a shortage of medicine in the hospitals, but it is not possible for a UN plane or for the UN envoy to go there while the cease-fire is not holding. A Red Cross ship has been waiting for several days, begging in vain for permission to dock and unload food. These people have been my friends for 30 years; they are neutral. But there is one point on which we are not neutral: The need for a cease-fire. [Jazulit] Before leaving al-Mukalla, Brahimi met with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, president of the new state in south Yemen. Because the southerners stick to their position, the meeting produced no positive results regarding an end to the war. [Al-Bid] I believe brother Lakhdar Brahimi has learned about the situation. He has repeatedly said, even before he arrived here, that priority should be given to a cease-fire. I think he is right. We have to do everything to achieve this objective now. [Jazulit] Brahimi expressed the identical position to that of the southern political leadership concerning a cease-fire. [Brahimi] My conclusion is what he [al-Bid] has just said, that the brothers here support a cease-fire and the beginning of the dialogue. [Jazulit] Brahimi left al-Mukalla without convincing the southern political leadership of a federation or a confederation as a compromise solution. He also apologized to the people of Aden for not being able to visit them for security reasons. The southerners attach hope to a decisive Security Council decision. Otherwise, the war of attrition may drag for long. The war goes on.
