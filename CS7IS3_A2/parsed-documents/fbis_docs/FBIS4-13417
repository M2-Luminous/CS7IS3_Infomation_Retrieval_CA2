Following the intensification of the Serbs' attacks on cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially on Gorazde, and in reply to a written message from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to our president on the painful predicament of the people in Bosnia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani held a telephone conversation with the Bosnian president last night and discussed the latest situation in the war- stricken areas in Bosnia, especially in the occupied city of Gorazde. In this telephone conversation, the president pointed out that the people and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran fully understand and are concerned about the painful and, at the same time, sensitive situation of the defenseless and Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, and stated that all the officials and people--from the esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution down to the Government and people of Iran--are sorrowfully following the bitter and painful events in Bosnia, which are taking place before the indifferent eyes of the world. He stated that when the United Nations refused the offer by the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch forces to defend the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the areas that the UN had declared safe havens, the Iranian nation realized that the international organizations and countries are not serious in their claims to defend the defenseless people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The president added: Now again, since the United Nations has overtly declared its inability to defend the oppressed Bosnian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to send forces to the areas under UN supervision to defend the rights of the Muslim Bosnians. Iran also welcomes the assistance of other countries. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the Serbs' chemical attacks on Gorazde and expressed the Islamic Republic's readiness to send them defensive equipment, namely masks and antichemical uniforms. Hashemi-Rafsanjani asked the Bosnian president to convey the greetings and sympathies of the Iranian people to the oppressed Bosnian people and to consider the Islamic Republic of Iran a partner in their affliction and to rest assured that the Iranian government and nation will do their best not to desert the Bosnian people in their struggle for the vindication of their definite rights. Alija Izetbegovic expressed the gratitude of the Bosnian Government and people for Iran's humanitarian assistance and briefed the president on the latest situation in Gorazde and added: Gorazde is still resisting the aggressors. But it is under heavy shelling, and the situation in the city is extremely difficult and disturbing. He expressed his confidence that the people and government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will support the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as in the past.
