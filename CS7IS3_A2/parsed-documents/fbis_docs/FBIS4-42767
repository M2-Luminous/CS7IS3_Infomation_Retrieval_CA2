NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG notes: The events of the past naturally formed the focus of the ceremonies. But it was mainly Bill Clinton who bridged the gap between the past and the future, saying that the fight for freedom was still continuing. The Longest Day is not yet over, said the first U.S. President to stem from the postwar generation. The victims of the terrible fighting could not have been honored in a better way. Clinton demonstrated the great impact that the victory of the Allies continues to have to this very day, says NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. KOELNISCHE RUNDSCHAU writes: There is no reason to glorify 6 June 1944, the Longest Day. Instead, today one must reflect and ask oneself where cruel tyrants can and must be stopped, and when one should carry the banner of freedom and democracy further with determined action. These questions continue to be faced by the Allies of World War II and those who have coalesced with them since that time. The answers are more difficult to find today than they were at that time, also because the number of tyrants seems to be increasing without pause, says KOELNISCHE RUNDSCHAU. DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG, which appears in Hameln, notes: D-Day, 6 June 1944, was a veritable death sentence for the first Allied troops to land on the beaches. Under defensive fire from German artillery and in close combat, a large number of soldiers lost their lives. Some died for freedom, and others in defense of the Nazi dictatorship. Fifty years have elapsed since then, and although Germany in the meantime has returned to the orbit of equal countries, also in a political sense, and has undergone a reconciliation with its former enemies, no German representative had a place at the D-Day celebrations in Great Britain and Normandy. It is simply stupid to criticize Helmut Kohl for not having made a greater effort to get invited to the ceremonies, says DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG. The DIE WELT daily writes: One can note in a critical tone that the commemoration of the Longest Day on the coast of Normandy was more than a mere taste of Hollywood. But who is going to criticize the fact that the former war enemies are using today's media resources to once again cast a favorable light on the high quantity of blood spilt by their sons in the vivid past? This is going to be the last time to do it in this way. The number of those with memories of direct experience is dwindling. Thus, there can be no repetition in the future of the senseless debate on whether or not the Germans should have been present on the Channel coast. Where would Chancellor Kohl have stood? At the bows of Queen Elizabeth's yacht, or on the bridge of the U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington steaming toward the former German positions? Or perhaps even in the ruins there? DIE WELT asks.
