Pavlovski writes that the barley harvest has already begun in some regions in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), where 64,000 hectares have been sown. The Macedonians expect to harvest 50,000 metric tons of brewery-grade barley, and the Macedonian breweries need 30,000 tons. The expected yields of various field crops are about 155,054 tons of barley, 15,000 tons of rye, 1,070 tons of oil-bearing pods, and 798 tons of poppies. The acreage devoted to bread grains has been increased by about 7,000 hectares for a total of 116,550 hectares. Part of the area sown has been affected by drought, especially in the Stip and Sveti Nikole districts, but the overall harvest is expected to be satisfactory. In fact, according to Pavlovski, the wheat harvest should set a record for Macedonia. Experts estimate that the average yields of wheat per hectare will be about 3,500 in the Pelagonija region, 3,200 in the Skopje region, and 4,000 in Polog. Pavlovski notes, however, that a bountiful harvest does not depend only on weather conditions and the mobilization of workers and machinery, but is also influenced by the purchase prices for the crops and the amount purchased. According to Mioljub Panov, chairman of the "Zito Makedonija" milling and baking industry, because of the high guaranteed price of 10 denars per kilogram, the purchase of bread grains will be limited. Eftim Ancev, minister of agriculture, forestry, and water management, says that, to the extent that that price has not been accepted by purchasers, the government will pay producers for the wheat. The milling and baking industry is reluctant to buy bread grains not only because of the high prices (FYROM wheat costs $240.00 per ton, compared to $140.00 per ton for U.S. wheat), but also because of the increased supply of flour and wheat in stores, silos, and other storage bins, Pavlovski continues. According to data as of 30 April, there were 110,000 tons in reserve. According to Sande Djambazovski, deputy minister of agriculture, forestry, and water management, the Directorate for Material Reserves will purchase wheat from this year's crop that is not bought by the mills. The purchase of bread grains by the milling and baking industry is also affected by financial considerations, according to Pavlovski. Because of unpaid loans, the banks are not able to extend credits to the milling and baking industry. For the anticipated purchase of 150,000 tons of wheat, about 1.5 billion denars will be needed. But that is not all: The state must secure an additional 300,000,000 denars for the producers. Kiro Dokuzovski, secretary for agriculture, food processing, and tobacco industry in the Chamber of Commerce, says that the price is not the focus of the conflict for the producers, nor is the fact that they will accept whatever quantities of bread grains that are needed. He believes that the state must issue orders to control imports because there is no justification for uncontrolled imports when the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management is attempting to defend the reserves to ensure supplies for the market. The producers, however, do not want to repeat the old practice of not knowing where to get money at the best rate or, after a long wait, having their assets devalued.
