According to the agency, rice consumption in the October- December period in 1993 fell 0.9 percent from the same period the previous year to 5,458 grams per person in an ordinary household. Households involved in rice growing were excluded. In the preceding July-September period, consumption rose 0.4 percent, going to the plus side for the first time in eight years. "The return to the minus side is evidence that rice consumption is on the decline," an official at the Food Agency said. Rice eaten at home fell 1.9 percent to 4,391 grams per person, while rice consumed outside of the home grew 3.3 percent to 1,068 grams.
