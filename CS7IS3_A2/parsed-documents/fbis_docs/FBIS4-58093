The deficit, which was non-existent during the oil boom, stood at seven billion dollars in 1992 compared with 20 billion dollars in 1991, said the report released by the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). The report divided the 22-member Arab League into two groups: the first comprising the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) plus key oil producers Iraq, Libya and Algeria, and the second the 13 members, which have little oil. It showed exports of goods and services by the first group increased slightly to 114 billion dollars from 113 billion dollars while exports by the second group jumped to 34 billion dollars from 29 billion dollars. "What helped this positive development in exports by the second group is the policy of freeing prices of goods and exchange rates, easing government restrictions on foreign trade and supporting export activities by the private sector as part of economic reforms," the report said. Imports by the second group rose to 47 billion dollars from 41 billion dollars while the first group slashed imports to 108 billion dollars from 121 billion dollars in the same period, it said. Experts said the combined Arab balance of payment deficit was caused by a sharp decline in crude prices over the past decade as oil exports account for more than 70 percent of the total Arab exports. In 1980, when oil prices shot above 30 dollars, exports by the first group peaked at 235 billion dollars. With imports standing at 114 billion dollars, the balance of payments registered a record surplus of 121 billion dollars before it started to deteriorate in the following years. Such exports plummeted to 108 billion dollars in 1985 when oil prices went below 20 dollars then recovered slightly to 113 billion dollars in 1991. The report said the improvement in exports of goods and services by the second group pushed their ratio to the Gross Domestic Product to 27 percent in 1992 from between 18 and 24 percent in the first half of 1980s. A breakdown showed members of the first group, except Kuwait and Iraq, had a surplus in their balance of payments in 1992 while all those in the second group were still suffering from a deficit. The biggest surplus was recorded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), standing at 4.47 billion dollars. It stood at 1.12 billion dollars in Algeria and between one billion and two billion dollars in Oman and Qatar. In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and exporter, the surplus was only 693 million dollars due to a surge in imports, the report said. Kuwait, which had enjoyed a persistent surplus before the 1990 Iraqi invasion, suffered from a small deficit of 30 million dollars because of a sharp rise in imports and a decline in oil exports. Iraq, still under a UN embargo, had a deficit of 728 million dollars, with exports standing at 413 million dollars and imports at 1.141 billion dollars. The report did not give details of the Iraqi trade. The report, which covered economic developments in the Arab world for 1992, showed public and private investment in the region totalled 112 billion dollars during that year compared with 98 billion dollars in 1991. Around 83.6 billion dollars were invested in the first group and Saudi Arabia received the lion share, with investment of 29.5 billion dollars. The report showed investment in Iraq stood at 14.2 billion dollars while no investment was registered in war-torn Somalia. It estimated the combined Arab Gross National Product at 478.9 billion dollars, of which the first group accounted for 347.7 billion dollars.
