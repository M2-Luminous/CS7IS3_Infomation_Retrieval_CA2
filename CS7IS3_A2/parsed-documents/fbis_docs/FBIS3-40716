The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] has been playing up Hindu religious fundamentalism, spreading hatred against Muslims and labelling theirs as the true nationalism, was said to be poised for a great victory in these elections. But only in Delhi and Rajasthan did the BJP come into power with a narrow majority. But in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the party was driven out of power. Now the BJP says, 'what if we are out of power? We have secured a larger percentage of the votes. But they forget that it was the same electoral system that elevated them to the seat of power. The argument seems like a drowning man clinging on to a straw. The BJP aroused emotions among the people but did not respect truth at all. Emotions may flare up suddenly and also disappear all of a sudden. It was by arousing religious sentiments that they came into power so suddenly and in the same way lost it too. It has been an accepted fact all over the world that everybody is an equal to one another and that every person is entitled to equal opportunity. The BJP failed to respect the truth and proceeded to emphasize differences and neglected to concentrate on vitally basic issues like poverty, joblessness, soaring prices of essential goods and this, in fact, brought about the downfall of the party. Janata Dal stands for social justice. This party had made sacrifices for that cause. Mulayam Singh Yadav when he was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, mobilized the people to put up a stiff fight against the BJP. He was ridiculed by the BJP which called Maulana Mulayam Singh Yadav. As a result of these factors the people of the state believed that the best alternative to the BJP is Yadav's coalition and they elected his party to govern the state. It is not enough to feel there is an injustice. But one should stand up and fight against it and for this cause undertake any kind of sacrifice. Only such kind of people could command respect--this is the lesson learned from these elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress Party's victories in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh are the result of the dissatisfaction among the voters against the BJP ministries there. The election results in these four states have shown, to put it in a nutshell, that the true victory belongs not to any party, but to the common man. The Bharatiya Janata Party with its stand on Ayodhya issue demolished the Babri Masjid and carried on a vigorous campaign of hatred and the common man in Uttar Pradesh, searching for an alternative leader, found the right person in Mulayam Singh Yadav. The BJP regimes in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan failed to solve the day-to-day problems of the common folks and the common man decided to teach a lesson to the BJP. If only the Congress had waged a vigorous campaign against the BJP, it could have won more seats. So far as the Janata Dal was concerned, it was a party coming out with good ideas. But it did not grow to be a party that could be an alternative to form a ministry. The common man also realized if he supported the Dal, votes against the BJP would be scattered away. This factor was not realized by the Janata Dal. Hence it met with defeat. These election results convey loud and clear one message: Whether a ruling party or a party that aspires to get into power, in order to secure a majority of seats, the party should instead of promoting politics of hatred, work hard in finding solutions to the people's problems and improving their standard of living. The very fact that these election results demonstrated to the world at large that an Indian citizen is superior to their political leaders, is a significant turning point in itself, is it not?
