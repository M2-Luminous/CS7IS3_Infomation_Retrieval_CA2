Senators had proposed a few changes in the text but the house finally rejected them in order to finish work on this urgent issue. The newly-adopted law says that the property is now managed by provincial governors who may pass this responsibility on to local governments if the latter want it. Forests will be administered by the state forests management. Property of special importance for national defence will be taken over by the Defence Ministry. The former Soviet and later Russian Army left in Poland nearly 8,000 buildings and other property worth over 158 million U.S. dollars. To upgrade this property to a reasonable condition, Poland will have to spend nearly 93 million U.S. dollars, while the estimated value of ecological damage amounts to about 53 trillion zlotys (2.5 billion U.S. dollars). Some 30-40 per cent of the property, mainly buildings, have already been overhauled and are used. The Senate also adopted the law on restructuring the co-operative banks. Under this law, the co-operative banks will be grouped in nine regional banks, and the Bank of Food Economy (BGZ) will be transformed into a joint stock company and will play the role of the national bank. Within five years, its shares will be sold to cooperative banks. The Senate decided to make no changes in the recently amended law on corporate income tax. According to the amendemnt, bank reserves covering bad credits will be considered as the bank's costs and in that way banks will pay lower taxes. If the amended law is signed by the president, the state central budget will get 1.7 trillion zlotys less.
