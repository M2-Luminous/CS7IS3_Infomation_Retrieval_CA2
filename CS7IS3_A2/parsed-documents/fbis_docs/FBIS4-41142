During the last round in the evening, 212 votes were cast for the budget, 43 against with 60 abstentions. Approval required 225 votes. Acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin did not succeed in persuading the Duma to pass the budget as a compromise reached in close cooperation between the government and the lower house of parliament. He said that without an approved budget the government does not have the right to use credits of the Central Bank but is limited to taxes which he said constitute only 60 pct of the necessary resources. This threatens this year's supplies to North Russia and the gathering of the harvest and puts off the planned raise in the earnings of government employees. After the voting results were announced the Agrarian faction suggested putting off the matter till Friday as 15 of its members were absent. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin gave instructions to cancel all deputy business trips and visits of parliamentary delegations and said that all deputies should come to Moscow for the crucial vote. Appropriate orders were given to the head of the office of the Duma Andrey Voikov. The voting is scheduled for Friday morning when a plenary session is to begin at 9 a.m.
