From May 1, China instituted reforms of its distribution system for crude and refined oils so as to stabilize oil prices and normalize oil transactions on the market, rationally allocate oil resources and promote the production of crude oil. In the past month, despite planned rises in prices of crude oil, retail sales prices of refined oil all over the country had declined due to the reduction of intermediate links in the distribution of refined oil. Sources said that at present, the oil prices and oil market in China are stable and the channel between supply and demand is unblocked. The reform of China's oil distribution focuses on the balance between supply and demand in oil production and consumption and coordination between domestic and international oil resources and the oil market; rational allocation of crude oil processing resources and refined oil resources; maintenance of rational oil price differences according to regional differences. The reform also aims to reduce the intermediate links in oil distribution, unclog oil distribution channels and set up risk price funds for crude and refined oils. The State Council stressed that from now on the state will exercise unified control over the prices of crude and refined oils. All refineries must implement the sales prices of refined oils set by the state and all gas stations must strictly follow the stipulated oil prices in sales transactions. No party, government or military organizations are permitted access to the wholesale or retail sale of crude oil and refined oil. The State Council also stressed the role of the sales department of the China National Petrochemical Corporation as a main channel in the distribution of refined oil. The government also stipulated that the refineries will directly supply big oil-consuming sectors including railways, transportation, civil aviation, armed forces and oil export companies.
