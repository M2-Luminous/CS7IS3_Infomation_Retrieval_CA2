FR940930-2-00046 FR940930-2-00030 (3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided the parties to the agreement have not applied for the same license. Section 1.2106 Submission of Upfront Payments (a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment. In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice. No interest will be paid on upfront payments. (b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. (c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rule, or if insufficient funds are tendered to constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made will be returned. (d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder is the high bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a winning bidder, the Commission may refund the excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder. (e) In accordance with the provisions of subsection (d), in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to §1.2104 for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional obligations that the high bidder may have. Section 1.2107 Submission of Down Payment and Filing of Long-Form Applications (a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed. Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under §1.2103, however, bidders may be required to submit their down payment with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated entities eligible for installment payments under §1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. See §1.2110(e) (1) and (2) of this subpart. Down payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties. No interest will be paid on any down payment. (c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an application, as contemplated by §1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is a high bidder for a license in the Interactive Video Data Service See 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on FCC Form 574 in accordance with Section 95.815 of the Rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their long-form applications. Notwithstanding any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: Auction Application Processing Section, 1919 M Street, NW., Room 222, Washington, DC 20554. An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the penalties set forth in §1.2104 of the Commission's Rules. (d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to §1.2105.
