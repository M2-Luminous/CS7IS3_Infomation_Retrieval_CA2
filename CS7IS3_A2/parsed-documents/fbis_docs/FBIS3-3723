[ellipsis as published]. Five provinces and autonomous regions from China's northwest region flung their doors open to the outside world on an unprecedented scale. They gave full play to their advantage of abundant natural resources; comprehensively developed economic and technological cooperation with other provinces and autonomous regions; introduced investment from abroad and established economic relations with other regions; learned from the experience of other regions for their own development; made use of other regions' superiority to make up for its own deficiency; and promoted the development of the local economy. The northwest regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Shaanxi are endowed with rich natural resources and have long supplied a large amount of the resources and raw material for the national economic construction. However, due to a weak economic foundation, they were not effective at self-development. With the deepening of reform of China's economic system, and with the gradual lifting of prices of resources and raw materials, these provinces and autonomous regions--which in the past have relied on state subsidies and mandatory production plans--have been forced one after another to enter market competition. As a result, people in those regions began to change their concepts and sought to open a new path for development through extensive economic and technological cooperation with other regions. Advancing to the east and expanding to the west, reaching out to the north and descending to the south, introducing investment from abroad and establishing economic ties with other regions in China, and adopting an omni-directional opening up policy have all become the common understanding of these provinces and autonomous regions in developing the economy. So far they have joined some ten regional cooperation organizations including the Huanghe Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, the Northwest Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan Economic Cooperation Zone. Last year alone they concluded agreements with other regions on some 10,000 cooperation projects and on exchanges of goods worth over two billion yuan. What is gratifying is that economic and technological cooperation is not limited to project cooperation and to exchange of commodities alone; they now involve joint development. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region cooperated with other regions to develop a cotton growing base; Gansu Province jointly developed rare metal resources with other regions; and Ningxia prepared to cooperate with other provinces to build a power supply project. Funds from five provinces, autonomous regions, and other regions for China's Huanghe Economic Cooperation Zone Joint Stock Limited Company have initially been put in place as scheduled. The operation of this company will effectively help coordinate economic exchanges between various provinces and regions as well as promote their development through cooperation. The five provinces and autonomous regions have changed their passive stance and have begun to aggressively look for business partners. Xinjiang concluded agreements of 2.1 billion and 1.7 billion yuan respectively from its holding of the "Spark Trade Fair" and "Urumqi Trade Fair" in 1992. Last May, 2,044 contracts, agreements, and letters of intent worth 1.7 billion yuan were signed at Shaanxi's Third Technological Results Fair. At the same time, the five provinces and autonomous regions have increased economic cooperation with coastal regions. Qinghai Province entered into an economic cooperative relationship with Shandong Province. They signed 51 projects on introduction of funds, technological cooperation, and personnel exchange, as well as 32 agreements on expanding friendly ties during exchanges of leadership last year. They also carried out 1,700 personnel exchanges, with over 500 of these involving cadres at or above county level and at or above department head level. Qingdao Chemical Industry Institute has annually helped train 50 specialized chemical industry personnel for Qinghai's Haibei Prefecture during each of the last five years. Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu have also exchanged cadres and work experience with economically developed coastal regions. They have broadened their economic vision and increased economic cooperation projects through such kind of exchanges.
