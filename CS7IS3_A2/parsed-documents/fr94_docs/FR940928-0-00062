ACTION: Notice of final fair market rents. SUMMARY: Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs) annually to be effective on October 1 of each year. FMRs are used for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subparts A and B), including space rentals by owners of manufactured homes under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subpart F) and project-based Certificate assistance (part 882, subpart G); the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program (part 882, subparts D and E); Section 8 housing assisted under part 886, subparts A and C (Section 8 Loan Management and Property Disposition programs); and to determine payment standard schedules in the Rental Voucher program (part 887). HUD published the proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 FMRs in the Federal Register on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32492), and in another publication on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35739), announced that the public comment period was extended to October 14, 1994. The public comment period was extended to give Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) the opportunity to use the new rental housing survey guide that HUD had recently developed for smaller, nonmetropolitan areas. Two separate sets of proposed FMRs were published on June 23_one based on the 45th percentile rent standard and the other based on the 40th percentile rent standard. The authorization bill now moving through Congress establishes FMRs at the 45th percentile rent standard. This notice, therefore, makes effective the final FY 1995 FMRs at the 45th percentile level.
