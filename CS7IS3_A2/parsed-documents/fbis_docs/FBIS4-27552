Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi made the remark in her meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in the Diet building, a Foreign Ministry official said. Wu, who previously met Hata in Seattle last November, also expressed hope for early implementation of Japan's planned fourth package of yen loans to China through official development assistance, the official said. Hata replied that Japan should try to forge future-oriented relations with China based on repentance over controversial remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the official said. Nagano resigned in early May over his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre never happened and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II.
