FR940819-2-00044 FR940819-2-00020 Procurement List; Additions AGENCY: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. ACTION: Additions to the procurement list. SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List commodities to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman, (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 17, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 31218) proposed addition to the Procurement List. Comments were received from two cap manufacturers. Both firms noted the serious decline in military uniform headwear purchases of recent years and indicated that the loss of any more headwear items from competitive purchasing would further reduce the competitive market and increase their chances of going out of business. The Committee is aware of the decline in Government purchasing of clothing items. However, it should be noted that nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program which produce military uniform items are also experiencing the results of this decline, and their employees with severe disabilities have traditionally had higher rates of unemployment, and thus more difficulty in securing other work, than workers without disabilities employed by commercial uniform item manufacturers. The nonprofit agency which will produce the cap under the Committee's program is also recovering from the employment losses caused by a severe hurricane which closed the military base on which the agency was performing other contracts under the Committee's program. It should also be noted that neither of the commenters is currently producing the cap for the Government, as the current competitive contract was won by the nonprofit agency which will produce the cap under the Committee's program. Accordingly, the commenters will not lose anything they currently have, other than a chance to bid on future competitive contracts for the cap. Because there is no guarantee under the competitive bidding system that any particular company will get a contract, the Committee does not consider the loss of this chance to constitute severe adverse impact on a company. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities are hereby added to the Procurement List: Cap, Garrison, Women's 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5481 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5504 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5507 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5521 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5536 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5544 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5559 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5566 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5612 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5627 8410&hyph;01&hyph;381&hyph;5647 This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
