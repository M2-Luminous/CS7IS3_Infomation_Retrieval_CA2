"Coordination meetings between NATO and the UN have sorted out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR], told a press conference. His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city. "On the broader pinciples I can say that NATO and the UN are very much of one mind," MacFarlane. He noted that control involved "monitoring, supervision by UNPROFOR personnel, linked to the question of where weapons are located at the end" of the February 21 NATO deadline for the belligerents to withdraw their heavy weapons or placed them under UN control. MacFarlane said the issue was being discussed with both the Bosnian Serbs and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army. He added that despite the cancelation of Tuesday's meeting of top military officials at Sarajevo airport after the Bosnian Army comander in chief did not show up, the UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia, General Michael Rose, "is at this stage fairly happy with the way things are going." Earlier in Brussels NATO sources said the head of the Atlantic alliance's forces in Europe was to meet with the UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia this week to discuss differences over enforcement of the NATO ultimatum. NATO General George Joulwan was to meet with Yasushi Akashi in Zagreb at a time yet to be decided, to raise problems of coordination between the two bodies, a NATO military source said. Separate NATO sources said UNPROFOR plans to have monitors check on Serb artillery surrendered to UN troops in Serb barracks under a ceasefire accord implemented Thursday did not amount to proper control. One anonymous source said: "That's not a proper control. The control has to be strong enough to stop the weapons being used." The Serbs have placed 33 artillery pieces under UN monitoring within Serb barracks at Lukavica and Mokro, while the mainly-Moslem government forces have handed over 10 mortars to Ukrainian UN forces in Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb leaders Tuesday rejected demands to withdraw all their heavy arms from around Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb military commander General Radko Mladic told the Yugoslav TANJUG news agency that his weapons would stay put to protect Serbs against "fanatical Moslem units." But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that he was prepared to order regrouping of "part" of his heavy artillery "in order to facilitate monitoring" by UN peacekeepers.
