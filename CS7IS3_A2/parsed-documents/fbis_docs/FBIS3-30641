Over 400 motorcycles a day cross the border to Serbia. Their main business is fuel export. This trade is quite lucrative -- there are no restrictions regarding the number of motorcycles entering the former Yugoslavia. Some do this three times a day exporting an average of 50-60 litres of fuel. The more persevering -- those who cross the border three times a day, make a daily profit of about 2,000 leva. There are record holders -- some people from Bregovo make 17 "trips" a day. The lack of statutory documents restricting this type of trips has resulted in conflicts with the border officials working at Bregovo. On February 3 angry motorcyclists blocked the Bregovo checkpoint from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. The conflict was solved temporarily. According to customs officers, such conflicts are bound to become more and more frequent in the absence of a categorical stand of the Customs Chief Department on restricted exit of motorcycles and other Bulgarian motor vehicles to the former Yugoslavia.
