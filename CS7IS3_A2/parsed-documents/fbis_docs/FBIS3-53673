This is because a great deal of that reaction and the outcome depend on the Israeli positions regarding withdrawal from the Golan and achievement of results on the other Arab negotiating tracks, particularly the Palestinian and Lebanese tracks. The Geneva summit put the ball in the Israeli court after Syria proved to the U.S. sponsor its complete readiness to bear the consequences of total peace, including the establishment of normal relations with Israel. Israeli officials, however, still prefer to ignore this reality and to insist on the Syrian side's pronouncement of the word "normalization," as if there is a difference between normalizing relations and establishment of normal relations. Certainly, Syria is still committed -- just as the other Arab negotiating parties -- to the comprehensiveness and justness of a peaceful solution and, consequently, to the Arab link in general, especially the Syrian, with the Palestinian cause. Realization of the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations will remain a constant factor despite the momentary differences in viewpoints between the Arab brothers. The supreme Arab interest is above any other consideration, especially as all the Arab parties have chosen the strategy of peace and a negotiated settlement. Hence, amid the political ambiguity prevailing in the region now, one fact seems certain: None of the Arab parties will sign a final and separate peace agreement with Israel, rather all of them are striving for a comprehensive peace in the interest of the region's peoples and their future generations. In this context, any agreement or settlement with any Arab party will not be complete unless it coincides with integrated settlements with the other parties. Hence, the Palestinian side's approach and conviction is that any concrete negotiating achievement realized on any negotiating track is, in the larger sense, in the Arab interest. If the Syrian-U.S. summit has managed to put the foundation for Israeli withdrawal and evacuation from the Golan Heights -- this if we assume that Israel will respond to this just Arab demand, refrains from placing obstacles to it, and does not pursue the known method of procrastination -- the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement will still depend on the realization of withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, south Lebanon, and the 'Arava Valley within framework of an integrated Arab solution comprising the Arab parties interested in peace, without exception. We are now awaiting the practical Israeli reaction to the Geneva summit after Syria announced its readiness to bear the burden of peace as of this moment. That response must not be confined to the Syrian track alone but, in conformity with the comprehensive concept of peace, should extend to include the other negotiating tracks, foremost of all the stalled negotiations for more than two months with the Palestinian side. Those negotiations were supposed to end positively several weeks ago.
