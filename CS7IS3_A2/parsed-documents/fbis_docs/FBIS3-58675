The question of northern Iraq was also discussed, as we mentioned that it would in our column last week. The Turkish side brought up the matter. The Turkish delegation headed by Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, outlined Turkey's position on the matter and said that "tension continues to exist in northern Iraq." Let Them Come To Hold Talks "We support Iraq's territorial integrity. We want the situation in northern Iraq to be resolved within that framework. However, you should first disclose that Iraq will comply with the UN resolutions." That was Turkey's general approach. The Turkish delegation also conveyed a direct message to Baghdad, which Ankara has wished to do for a long time: "Hold talks with the Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq and resolve that problem among yourselves." Apparently, the Iraqi delegation was prepared for that message. The Iraqi officials said: "You have always said that you support Iraq's territorial integrity. However, you have allowed the Hammer Force, which is opposed to Iraq's territorial integrity, to remain in your country." That brought Turkey's problem into the light. However, Turkey's initiative was based on its conviction that the Hammer Force will not remain in the region indefinitely. Regarding Turkey's message to Baghdad that it should hold talks with the Kurds in northern Iraq, the Iraqi officials failed to respond by saying that they "agree to hold talks" with them. They merely said "we can hold talks with them if they wish to do so." Obviously, Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani will not be satisfied with that reply. It can be easily assumed that Barzani and Talabani, who are pressed by the United States "not to hold talks with Baghdad," will be dissatisfied with the Iraqi official's unwilling compliance and refuse to hold talks with them. BOTAS Cannot Resolve the Problem by Itself A certain amount of progress was made on the question of the withdrawal of the oil in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The matter was also discussed with BOTAS [Pipelines and Petroleum Transport Corporation] officials yesterday. However, the problem cannot be resolved through the talks that will be held between Turkey and Iraq. The letter U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Oxman wrote before he left Ankara in December 1993 explained the matter in detail. Turkey can withdraw the oil that belongs to it. However, each and every step after that will be subject to UN approval. In short, Turkey has to discuss the matter with the UN officials and Washington, regardless of the two-day talks the Turkish officials held with the Iraqi delegation in Ankara. Apparently, the matter has a political aspect that goes beyond the BOTAS officials' authority. [passage omitted] Fayda Talks Have Been Cut It seems that Ankara's anxiety on matters related to northern Iraq is gradually increasing. However, the Foreign Ministry circles have not admitted that state of affairs. Interesting developments are taking place in that region. Undesirable incidents may take place at any time. For example: The Turkish, U.S., British, French, and Iraqi officers met to exchange views and information after the Gulf War once a week. The meetings were held in an Iraqi military garrison in Fayda, a district center that is 30 km from Turkey's border. They maintained their talks even in the tense atmosphere after the war. The weekly meetings have been cut since the clashes in 1993 because the Iraqi officers failed to attend them. The meaning of that state of affairs is obvious. The mechanism for mutual agreement and exchange of information to obstruct serious clashes in the region does not exist anymore. [passage omitted] Turkey's Guarantee To what extent can the Kurds in northern Iraq trust Saddam Husayn even if they conclude an agreement with Baghdad? They reached several agreements in the past but they were all violated. Considering the psychological situation in the region, the question of a "guarantor country" will definitely be placed on the agenda after a possible agreement on northern Iraq. An effective mechanism will be required in the region when the Hammer Force withdraws from Turkey. Obviously, Turkey will have to decide the policy it will adopt. Either a mechanism similar to the Hammer Force will have to be established or Turkey will have to act as an effective guarantor country in the region. Does that matter not concern NATO, which has very little to do at the present time?
