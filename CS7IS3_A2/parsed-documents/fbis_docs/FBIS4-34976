Lazo stated that the main objective of this meeting is to contribute to increasing the level of economic and commercial relations with Caribbean area countries. [Begin recording] [Lazo] We want to sell more in the Caribbean; we want to buy more in the Caribbean. We want to increase the presence of joint enterprises with Caribbean companies. We hope, above all, that these meetings can be the occasion and the place not only for Cuba's trade with the Caribbean, but for Cuba as a center of Caribbean trade, thus allowing us to convert Cuba, its eastern region, and Santiago de Cuba into a center from which we Caribbeans can trade and negotiate with the rest of the world. [end recording] In his address, Michael Manley, Jamaica's former prime minister, condemned the U.S. blockade of Cuba: [Begin Manley recording in English, with simultaneous translation into Spanish] I can say without hesitation that the embargo begins with injustice. I can go further in saying that it is contrary to international law. I go even further, in my statement that it is now maintained in defiance of the overwhelming UN vote. [end recording] In another part of his address, Manley stated that history would be made with the creation of the Association of Caribbean States, which will come to life with Cuba's presence. Other addresses during the course of the morning were delivered by Osvaldo Martinez, president of the economic commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government and director of the World Economic Research Center, and by Octavio Castilla, vice minister of foreign investments and economic cooperation.
