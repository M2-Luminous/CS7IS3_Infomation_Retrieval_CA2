The citizens' level of participation was as a whole fairly high at 47 percent. In short, the elections took place, but now with hindsight you think: What was the point of holding them at all? No representative power as such has come into being in the oblast. Twenty-one of the 36 new deputies are rayon administration heads. Meaning that they themselves will write the local laws as well as executing and monitoring them.... This situation is not new, but in our parts, where it is "getting worse" with every successive election, it is interesting that the townspeople long ago surrendered their voting rights to the rural areas. It was actually there that voting went amazingly smoothly, But the elections could be said to have been boycotted in eight out of 12 districts in Kursk. In four of the oblast center's districts the turnout proved to be the minimum allowed, and, as it is not hard to divine, it was on the whole elderly people who voted here. They accordingly entrusted deputies' powers to a former oblast military commissar and pensioner for some years now, M. Ovsyannikov, and one of the leaders of the oblast Communist Party organization, N. Ivanov.... V. Aseyev, first secretary of the Russian Communist Workers Party Oblast Committee, and another communist, successfully got into the Oblast Duma from the mining district of Zheleznogorsk, and the nuclear power workers' city of Kurchatov, as promised, made a show of not turning up at the polling places -- the turnout was only about 12 percent here -- because their wages have not been paid for a long time. It is a paradox of the times when, it would seem, the need to qualitatively change the authorities is greater and more acute in those places where the people do not wish to participate in voting for them.
