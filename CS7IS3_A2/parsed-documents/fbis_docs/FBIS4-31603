Of this total, 5,740 provided financial reports, meaning that they actually operated. In reality, however, that number was higher because companies with fewer than five employees are exempt from the duty of reporting. The sum total of the capital invested amounted to $1.4 billion, compared with $490 million toward the end of 1991. The foreign investors are led by the Americans, who invested altogether $933 million by the end of 1992, mostly in the form of large investments averaging $23 million per company, as compared with an average of $246,000 per company for foreign investments as a whole. Next to the Americans were Italian investors ($270 million total), followed by transnational corporations and international financial institutions, and, last, by investors from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Sweden, and Belgium. The Italians led in boldness of investment projects--their investment plans envisage an additional $1 billion. The Americans, too, plan to invest about $1 billion. Eighty percent of all foreign investments in Poland derive from the 10 countries named above. Noteworthy is the unusually low level of investment by Japanese companies in Poland. In the subsector structure of foreign investments, industrial enterprises rank foremost, accounting for 64 percent of all capital invested; they were followed by trade (17 percent), transportation (3.7 percent), and construction (3.2 percent). In 1992, the proportion of foreign investments in transportation and construction decreased, but in trade it increased. Approximately $400 million in foreign capital has been invested in the electrical-machinery industry. As in the case of the countries of origin of capital investment, the geographical distribution of investment sites is markedly uneven. Most investments are concentrated in seven or eight voivodships, chiefly in the Warsaw (30 percent), Poznan, Gdansk, Szczecin, Katowice, Koszalin, and Torun voivodships. In comparison, the proportion of investments in such [eastern] voivodships as Tarnobrzeg, Chelm, Zamosc, Przemysl, Krosno, and many others was negligible. Such are some of the data provided in the fourth regular report of the Institute for Business Cycles and Foreign Trade Prices (IKC), authored by Dr. J. Biskup and Dr. W. Burzynski. According to them, that report deals with only some aspects of the situation in 1993 owing to the absence of the data needed for a comprehensive analysis of the operations of joint ventures. Such an analysis will be presented in the next report, to be published this coming summer. In comparison with its previous issues, the report presented does, however, contain some new elements. It is a compendium of data on all of the major foreign companies operating in Poland and, in its final part, presents figures on the growth of direct foreign investments in the world and their role in the world economy. This serves to evaluate the significance of foreign capital to the growth of the Polish economy against a broader background. The IKC report discusses in some detail the laws governing foreign investments and specifies the legal acts concerned, which can be of practical importance to potential investors. It also contains many specific data on the operations and financial status of companies. The aggregate value of the projects launched by joint ventures amounted to somewhat more than 4 trillion zlotys [Z]. Investments worth more than Z20 billion each were undertaken by 53 companies,those worth Z10-20 billion each by 43 companies, and those of less than Z500 million by 792 companies. As much as 79 percent of the companies engaged in no investment projects at all. Joint ventures contracted in 1992 bank loans totaling Z21.6 trillion, or nearly four times as much as in 1991. Of that total, more than half were in the form of foreign credits. The overall sales volume of these companies exceeded Z145 trillion, with the domestic market accounting for most (72 percent) of the sales. Exports accounted for 26 percent. Industrial enterprises handled 70 percent of the sales of their own products and services, followed by construction enterprises, with 6.4 percent, and transportation and trading enterprises, with 4.4. percent. In 1992, joint ventures employed altogether 230,000 people--i.e., about 2 percent of total employment in Poland. A year previously they had employed fewer than 120,000 people. The Ministry of Internal Affairs considered 1,126 requests from foreigners for the purchase of real estate, of which it approved 876 (including 518 requests from physical persons) and declined 112. In Warsaw Voivodship, 64 hectares of land were sold to foreigners, in Szczecin Voivodship 39, in Poznan Voivodship 29, in Tarnow Voivodship 19, in the Nowy Sad and Zielona Gora voivodships 18 each, in Opole Voivodship 15, and in the Wroclaw and Katowice voivodships 11 each. Particularly interesting aspects of the report concern the findings of studies of the incentives and disincentives for foreign companies as regards investing in Poland. The biggest incentive for investing is the prospects for economic growth and the size of the market. Another consideration is the agreements concluded by Poland concerning the establishment of free-trade zones. On the other hand, foreign investors ascribed relatively little importance to the evolving political situation in this country. (However, following the recent elections [in which the postcommunists won] and in view of the ongoing political donnybrook, this may change.) It turns out that bureaucratic barriers are probably the strongest disincentive for investing in our country. Civil servants often simply shy away from making final decisions. In addition, the quality of our managerial personnel elicits doubt. Other negative considerations include the underdevelopment of the economic infrastructure, the frequent revisions of the tax system, and the fatal--in the eyes of foreign entrepreneurs--tariff policy.
