FR940425-0-00009 FR940425-0-00007 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;24] Revocation of Restricted Area R&hyph;2904B Starke, FL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revokes Restricted Area R&hyph;2904B Starke, FL, and returns the airspace to the National Airspace System. An FAA Special Use Airspace review determined that this restricted area has not been utilized for hazardous military activities for an extended period of time. As a result of that review, the U.S. Army has determined that a requirement no longer exists for retention of the restricted area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Gallant, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes Restricted Area R&hyph;2904B Starke, FL, because the area has not been activated for several reporting periods, and the U.S. Army has determined that it no longer has a requirement for the airspace. This action returns restricted area airspace to the National Airspace System, thereby increasing the amount of airspace available for use by the flying public. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested. Section 73.29 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review In accordance with FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,'' this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures.
