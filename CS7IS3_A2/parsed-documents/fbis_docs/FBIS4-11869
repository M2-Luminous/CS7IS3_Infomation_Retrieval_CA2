Many of over 2,000 Palestinians expelled for political reasons since 1967 were tipped to return in May 1993 when Israel allowed a token 30 to return, but refused to allow those who had been expelled for intifada-related activities go home. "The names should be agreed upon by Sunday if all goes well," a PLO official in Amman told the JORDAN TIMES on Friday. Tunis-based spokesman Marwan Kanafani confirmed that "there are plans for the return of deportees this week," but refused to give further details. Former student union president of Bir Zayt University Marwan Barghouti, Palestine Peoples Party executive committee member Taysir 'Aruri and 'Ayshah 'Awdah, a prominent political party activist, are expected to be among the first batch of expellees allowed to return. Some PLO officials had tipped that a return may be possible as early Monday or Tuesday.
