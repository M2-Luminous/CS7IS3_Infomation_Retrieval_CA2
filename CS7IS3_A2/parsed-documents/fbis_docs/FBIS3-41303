Coca farmers have called for active resistance to avoid the forceful eradication of coca farms in the region. (Cibar Victoria), second secretary of the General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers, reported: [Begin (Cibar Victoria) recording]: In keeping with the government's repressive guidelines, the government's repressive forces--UMOPAR [Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas] and the DEA--on 14 February at 5 a.m. [words indistinct] eradicated five hectares of the sacred coca leaf. To conduct this eradication operation, the government forces arrested several fellow peasants in a violent and savage manner and are keeping them incommunicado. [end recording] [Luis Mayan] Farmers from the (Villa Cunari) coca-producing farmers cooperative have decided to declare themselves in a state of emergency and general mobilization. The following is a report by peasant leader Valentin Gutierrez, who reports the assembly's conclusions. [Begin Valentin Gutierrez recording] We have decided to put in force the self-defense committees and declare ourselves in a state of emergency and general mobilization at the grass-roots level. This means we will not be responsible for any eventual conflict or clash that may be caused by the government's repressive forces. The government will be solely responsible for any eventual conflict because coca producers have been willing to negotiate and have attended all negotiations called by the government. Therefore, the government is solely responsible for any eventual conflict. [end recording] According to reports supplied to this radio station, we reassert that members of DiNaCo [National Coca Control Directorate], Direco [Coca Eradication Directorate], UMOPAR, and inmates from the Chimore rehabilitation center continue to eradicate coca farms by force. These eradication operations are being conducted at the (Sebastian Fundador) colony against the (Ibircanzana) coca farmers cooperative where, according to peasant leaders, there was a clash and tear gas was used.
