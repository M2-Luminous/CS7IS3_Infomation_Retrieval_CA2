The attacking troops had launched an offensive in Anlung Veng with an infantry unit moving in front of three T-54 tanks, and another infantry unit behind the tanks. The NADK and local people intercepted a group of the forward infantry troops and attacked the troops behind the tanks. In a few minutes, we killed or wounded many of the infantry troops in the rear. The survivors retreated in disarray, leaving the tanks behind. At the same time, we assaulted the infantry troops in front of the tanks. They were all killed, wounded, or forced to flee in disarray by our surprise attack. Moreover, they knew that the infantry troops in the rear had been routed, and thus they had no support in the rear. At that moment, we encircled the three tanks that were isolated like iron ingots in the open field. The occupants of the tanks jumped out and took off their uniforms so that no one could tell whether they were officers or rank and file. We destroyed two of the T-54 tanks and captured another. On the same day, we damaged another T-54 tank west of Lumpong. We also killed Brigadier Generals (Suan Siphon) of Division 5 and (Chin Ieng) of Division 286, two colonels, and 36 soldiers; wounded 60 enemy soldiers; and captured 27 others. According to a report from Route 68, nearly 100 puppet soldiers deserted the front lines and arrived at Route 68. The enemy is being encircled and smashed bit by bit. We are attacking and smashing the enemy communications lines in particular. The doomsday of the military ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government is drawing near.
