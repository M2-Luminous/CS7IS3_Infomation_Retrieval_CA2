They have taken this action because publishing houses have increased by several times the cost of their services, referring to a government decision on reassessing production assets. According to the editors, this will make the future existence of their publications impossible. KOMERSANT, which is not worried about any price rises, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which is restrained by army discipline, the NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER, which does not cooperate with the government and wants nothing from it, and the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which believes that it is not the government but the printing trades who have incorrectly fixed tariffs that one should be fighting, will not be taking part in the strike.
