In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, one of the mediators, a tribal chief, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The six hostages and their helicopter were yesterday evening still being held by the Shudayq tribe some 110 km from Sanaa but various mediations are under way by tribal chiefs, parliamentarians, and officers to persuade the Shudayq tribes to release the hostages, who include a British expert, the Canadian pilot, and four Yemenis. The tribes, however, are requesting that the state provide public services for their region such as completion of the building of schools, inclusion of their region in the electricity network plan, and introduction of drinking water projects, medical services, and other projects. Sources have denied yesterday's reports about the release of the hostages. They said that Shaykh Muhammad Yayha al-Ruwayshan, from Khawlan, initiated a mediation the day before yesterday to persuade the Shudayq tribe to release the hostages but the tribe holding the experts -- employees of the U.S. company Hunt, which operates the Ma'rib oilfields area -- demanded definite guarantees that the state would grant and seek to fulfill its demands. These demands include five to 10 new Landrovers as security in return for the release of the detainees and their plane, provided these vehicles come from the state, not the mediators. In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Shaykh 'Ali al-Qayri, who is one of the mediators, said that the mediators had contacted the official authorities in Sanaa to convey the kidnappers' demands and secure guarantees for the release of the hostages, but the authorities have so far refused to grant the kidnappers' demands and have been looking for ways of putting an end to these kinds of pressures, which have recently been frequent, and of putting an end to the kidnapping of foreign experts for use as a means of pressure on the official authorities. He said that a number of senior officials told the mediators that the state was willing to discuss all legitimate demands with these people but outside the framework of pressure through the abduction of foreigners, a method which undermines Yemen's reputation in the world. The helicopter and the six experts were kidnapped on the morning of the Monday before last in the area of al-Yamaniyah in Khawlan as the experts, including a Hunt company security official, were about to disarm a mine planted near the pipeline passing through that area. According to press reports, the six experts are being well treated and have not been denied any requests because they themselves are not the target but the means used to put pressure on the official authorities and, therefore, are well taken care of.
