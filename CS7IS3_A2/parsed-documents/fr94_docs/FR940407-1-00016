ACTION: Notice of withdrawal. SUMMARY: On July 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (58 FR 38100). After thorough review, the Coast Guard has decided not to establish a special anchorage area at Garrison Bight, Key West, Florida. DATES: Withdrawal of the NPRM is effective April 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ensign D. Marston, Seventh Coast Guard District, Aids to Navigation Branch, (305) 536&hyph;5621. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All comments received opposed the proposed special anchorage area. The Coast Guard has also determined that the proposed rule would not be effective in permitting anchoring without anchor lights because the proposed area lies in International COLREGS waters.
