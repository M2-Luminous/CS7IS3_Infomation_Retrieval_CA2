FBIS4-29387 "dreas117__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Daily Report 17 June 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Sanctions Resolution Appraised `Positively' U.S. Sanctions Resolution Appraised `Positively' OW1706031094 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 17 Jun 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706031094 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Japanese BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 17 June Morning Edition] [Text] The government appraises positively the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution on sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) drafted by the United States because "it provides for a grace period to serve as a warning, and Japan's position has been taken into consideration to a certain extent," (according to a top Foreign Ministry official). If the resolution is adopted, Japan will promptly perform its duties as a UN member. The government appreciates in particular the fact that the objective of the sanctions -- to make North Korea change its mind -- is clearly indicated. It believes that providing for a grace period of 30 days from the adoption of the resolution before sanctions are actually implemented is "a result of accommodating Japan's original proposal" on "step-by-step sanctions starting with a warning resolution," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Since the draft resolution is being considered at the UNSC, the focus is now on how China will react. The government says that "at this point, we have absolutely no indication how China will act," (according to a top Foreign Ministry official). It believes that although China's response may change the substance of the resolution, "it is improbable that the resolution will become any tougher." It would like to see the resolution passed in the end in a form conducive to encouraging North Korea to change its attitude through discussions in the UNSC involving China.
