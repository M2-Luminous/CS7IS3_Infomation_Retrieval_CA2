That directive directed you to prohibit entry of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Hong Kong for which the Government of Hong Kong has not issued an appropriate visa. Effective on November 30, 1994, you are directed to permit entry of made-to-measure suits in Categories 443, 444, 643, 644, 843 and 844 which are visaed as merged Categories 443/643/843 and 444/644/844 or 443/643/843(1) and 444/644/844(1) or the correct category corresponding to the actual shipment. Made-to-measure suits in Categories 443, 444, 643, 644, 843 and 844 may be visaed with or without the (1) suffix. Merchandise in Categories 443, 444, 643, 644, 843 and 844 which has been exported prior to November 30, 1994 shall not be denied entry if visaed without the (1) suffix.
