"We proposed holding preparatory negotiations," he said. This is a reversal of the Japanese Government position that it would not propose resumption of negotiations because North Korea one-sidedly broke them off. Tokyo seems to have changed its position and made the proposition because it was felt that postponing resumption of the negotiations recklessly was undesirable in view of a possible breakthrough in nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States, according to diplomatic sources. "Last autumn, a Foreign Ministry official officially asked North Korean authorities stationed in a third country to have preparatory negotiations with Japan for resumption of talks on normalization of diplomatic ties," the Ministry official said. North Korea has not answered Tokyo's proposition, he said. Japan made the proposal as indirect aid to the United States in its negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear problem, he said. "The Foreign Ministry could tap North Korea's position on the preparatory negotiations again if necessary," he said. He had no comment on the results of North Korean-U.S. contacts announced Thursday. "It's too early to say anything about the negotiation," he said. Blocking special inspections of North Korea's non-declared nuclear facilities would affect the resumption of Tokyo-Pyongyang negotiations, he said.
