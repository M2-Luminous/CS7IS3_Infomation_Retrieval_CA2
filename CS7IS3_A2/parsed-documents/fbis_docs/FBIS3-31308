On the plateau located between the Gorj Prefect's Office and the aforementioned Public Corporation, over 2,000 employees, particularly from the coal basins Jilt and Mehedinti and from Pesteana and Farcasesti mines, remained faithful to Miron Cosma, leader of the Mining Trade Union Confederation of Romania, who advised them to wait for messages calmly. However, at around 1530 local a part of the demonstrators tried to force their way into the Prefect's Office. As a result of the incident, nine people who belong to the law enforcement bodies were injured. Further, the entrance to the headquarters of the Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation was opened by force. According to our correspondent's report, the result of the telephone discussions held by Miron Cosma with the minister of industry, Dumitru Popescu, and with the president of the Chamber of Deputies Adrian Nastase, did not satisfy the demonstrators. At 1830, Miron Cosma read an ultimatum, which says, quote: If by 1500 tomorrow a government team is not sent to Targu Jiu Municipality for negotiations, I personally, accompanied by leaders of trade union and demonstrators, will go to Bucharest, unquote. In a declaration published by the local weekly MESAGER, Victor Murea, mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality, stressed that the miners' actions are illegal and the demonstrators should have asked three days before the outbreak of the strike for authorization to occupy the area neighboring the Brown Coal Autonomous Public Corporation, which is public property. The mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality said that appropriate legal measures will be taken against organizers of the strike.
