FR940825-0-00081 FR940825-0-00016 •The Circular (section XXX .26(d)) authorizes Federal agencies to establish the audit requirements that will apply to awards to commercial organizations. In the interests of simplicity and uniformity, we have made commercial organizations subject to the audit requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;133, which applies to most other HHS recipients of funds. See §74.26(a). •The Circular (section XXX .33(f)) authorizes Federal agencies to establish conditions under which title to exempt property will be vested in recipients. (Exempt property is property for which a Federal agency has statutory authority to vest title without further obligation, e.g., research grants under 31 U.S.C. 6306.) HHS is continuing its longstanding policy of only reserving the right to require transfer of title to such exempt equipment. This policy gives maximum flexibility to recipients of HHS funds, while protecting HHS's ability to ensure continuity of resource application when responsibility for a project is moved to a new or replacement recipient. See §74.33(b). •The Circular (section XXX .37) authorizes Federal agencies to require that recipients record liens to indicate that personal and real property was acquired or improved with Federal funds and that the property disposition rules apply to it. We have done so only with regard to real property in which a Federal interest has been established. We believe that such a rule properly balances the desire to minimize administrative burdens on grantees with the need to protect critical HHS financial interests. See §74.37. •We have adopted the Circular provisions at sections XXX .22 and XXX .52(a)(2) to reflect the OMB-approved procedures of the HHS Payment Management System (PMS). For example, PMS has adapted the forms SF&hyph;270 and 272 and renumbered them as PMS&hyph;270 and 272, respectively. See §§74.22 and 74.52(a)(2). 2. ``Deviations'' Approved by OMB Circular A&hyph;110 provides for a process whereby a Federal agency may seek exceptions to provisions of the Circular. HHS sought and obtained approval for the following deviations from the Circular's provisions. • Prior approval of research patient costs _Because of the significant amount of, and sensitivity to, research patient care in HHS, revised §74.25(c)(8) continues the requirement currently at §74.103(d)(3) that recipients obtain prior approval for research patient care costs in awards made for the performance of research work.
