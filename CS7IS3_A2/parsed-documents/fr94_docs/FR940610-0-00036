FR940610-0-00036 FR940610-0-00018 40 CFR Parts 144, 264, and 280 [FRL&hyph;4894&hyph;3] Standards Applicable to Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities, Underground Storage Tanks, and Underground Injection Control Systems; Financial Assurance; Letter of Credit AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: EPA is amending the regulations related to financial assurance promulgated under Subtitles C and I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Those regulations cite the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,'' published by the International Chamber of Commerce. This notice inserts the words ``and copyrighted'' into the letter of credit instrument to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material. As a result of this notice, owners and operators using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial assurance must include this additional language. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Gorman at (202) 260&hyph;1339, Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Authority This amendment is promulgated under the authority of Sections 2002(a), 3004, 3005, and 3006 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6924, 6925, 6926, and 6991, and under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq. II. Background Owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must demonstrate financial assurance for costs of closure, post-closure care, third-party liability and corrective action associated with their facilities. In subpart H of 40 CFR part 264, the Agency has established regulations regarding financial assurance for closure, post-closure care, and third party liability. Section 264.151 provides wording for the various financial instruments that owners and operators may use to demonstrate financial assurance. Section 264.151(d) provides wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure care, and §264.151(k) provides wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for third-party liability. The RCRA regulations in 40 CFR part 280 impose similar requirements on owners and operators of underground storage tanks. Under those provisions, owners and operators of underground storage tanks must demonstrate financial assurance for taking corrective action and for third party liability. The regulations then establish a series of mechanisms that owners and operators can use. Section 280.99 provides the wording for a letter of credit, which is one of those allowable mechanisms. Finally, the regulations at 40 CFR part 144, subpart F for the Underground Injection Control Program contain specific requirements for financial responsibility for Class I hazardous waste injection wells. Class I wells inject industrial and municipal wastes, including RCRA hazardous wastes, below the lowermost underground source of drinking water (USDW). 40 CFR part 144, subpart F, is directly applicable to owners and operators of all Class I hazardous waste injection wells. III. Purpose of This Notice The wording of the letter of credit instrument in §§144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and §280.99 includes a reference to the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,'' published by the International Chamber of Commerce. However, the language does not make it clear that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material. This correction notice amends the letter of credit instrument in §§144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and 280.99 to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material by including the words ``and copyrighted'' in the wording of the letter of credit instrument. As a result of this change to the regulations, owners and operators who obtain a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance must use the revised language in §264.151(d), 264.151(k), or 280.99(b), which includes the words ``and copyrighted.'' IV. Effect on State Authority To Administer Federal Programs Since this amendment only revises the description of the document, and does not impose new duties on owners or operators that choose to rely on letters of credit, EPA will not require states to adopt this change as part of their approved UIC and UST programs or authorized RCRA programs. Therefore, owners and operators in authorized states that do not adopt this change will not be affected by this rule. However, EPA encourages states to adopt this change. In states that adopt this change and in states without approved UIC or UST programs or states not authorized for the RCRA program, new letter of credit instruments will have to include this new language. V. Administrative Procedures Act Requirements Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), a rule is exempt from notice and public comment requirements ``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issues) that notice and public procedures thereon are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' EPA believes that comment is unnecessary because this amendment makes only a change in the wording of the letter of credit instrument, but does not change the requirements for using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial assurance. Therefore, EPA believes there is good cause to make today's rule effective on August 9, 1994.
