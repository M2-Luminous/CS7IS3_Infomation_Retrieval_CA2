FBIS4-46409 "jptot024__l94086" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 6 June 1993 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA LEBANON Hizballah Discord Reported; al-Tufayli Revival Seen Hizballah Discord Reported; al-Tufayli Revival Seen NC1006091494 Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic 6 Jun 93 p 8 NC1006091494 Beirut AL-SHIRA' Arabic BFN [Text] The dispute between Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has intensified after Nasrallah backed the publication of a book entitled "Observations on Sayyid Fadlallah's Method." The dispute has grown to include their entourages and loyalists. Asked about this issue, Fadlallah declared: "I do not trust any of Hizballah's leaders... without exception." A dispute has likewise surfaced between Nasrallah and Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik , who is also director of Hizballah's religious school in Ba'labakk. Nasrallah has been giving cover to Shaykh Yazbik's rivals. One sign of the dispute was Nasrallah's insistence on employing Shaykh As'ad Balluq at the school. Shaykh Yazbik insisted on expelling Balluq. Nasrallah realizes that he has lost all his religious credentials and his credibility inside Hizballah and is giving serious thought to his future after he leaves the secretary general's post. He has established and will be director of the Islamic Institute for Education, which supervises the Imam Mahdi schools in several Lebanese areas. It should be noted that the funds that Nasrallah is spending on this institution are actually part of Hizballah's budget. He urges Hizballah members to be economical and then diverts the party's funds to expand his institution. Nasrallah refuses to employ any one in the institution who is not blindly loyal and obedient to him. Observers note that military operations carried out by the Islamic Resistance have recently been few and feeble. The reason is the secretary general's appropriation of funds for his own institution. He is also using Hizballah media to make publicity for the Imam Mahdi schools. [A brief report on page 9 of the same issue of AL-SHIRA' reads: "Recent organizational changes in Hizballah indicate that former party secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli will regain his influence over Hizballah's decisionmaking process."] [AL-SHIRA' also reports on page 10: "The Zionist enemy's criminal abduction of the Faithful Resistance official Mustafa al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba provided Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah with an opportunity to make a grand entrance into al-Biqa' following recent negative attitudes and resentment against him by area residents and party members. Some of his few supporters in the area sought to invent occasions for him to attend to give the impression that he is still strong in al-Biqa'. The results were disappointing. During the al-Ghadir Day poetry festival in Marjat Ra's al-'Ayn in Ba'labakk, Nasrallah's loyalists did all they could to mobilize a large party turnout but the area's ulema boycotted the festival and only 18 out of 100 al-Biqa' scholars attended. Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik was also absent."]
