The deal included what has been described as "internationally banned fragmentation bombs," aircraft, spare parts, and various types of other weapons including light ammunition. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the charge d'affaires refused to grant visas to five of the Polish company's senior sales officials. He also informed the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership in Aden of the situation on the grounds that the deal was part of the military repercussions of the Yemeni political crisis and that it would undermine Yemen's national Army. Colonel 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director of the Yemeni Economic and Military Foundation, had sent a letter to Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah in Sanaa asking him to grant the delegation a visa to enable it to complete the agreement on the deal, but Sharaf refused to carry out the foreign minister's instructions and the visit was suspended. The delegation was supposed to arrive in the Yemeni capital on 6 April. YSP officials in Aden have raised questions about the source of funds for such a deal and also about the attitude of the Foreign Ministry or rather about the way the Yemeni leadership used that ministry, bearing in mind that Basindwah had issued a circular to all Yemeni diplomatic missions instructing them to refrain from any actions that would reflect partisan views and urged foreign states to deal directly with the Foreign Ministry. Yemeni sources have confirmed that Sanaa has recently opened two offices for the purchase of arms in the Russian capital Moscow and the Ukrainian capital Kiev. In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in London, they said that a well-known Yemeni businessman was supervising the Moscow office and negotiating contracts on behalf of the north Yemeni leadership with the Russian authorities, some covering 60 fragmentation bombs, each worth $350,000, as well as missiles which have been shipped to al-Hudaydah port through Bulgaria. The sources said that Muhammad Sharaf, the Yemeni charge d'affaires in Warsaw, contacted the home of Yemeni Mrime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attass in the evening of the day before yesterday while the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee was in session, and informed him of the matter. Al-'Attas then reported what he heard directly to the Dialogue Committee. [passage omitted]
