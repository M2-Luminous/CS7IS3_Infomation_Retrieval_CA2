According to the spokesperson, Sweden's military authorities grew very circumspect after a Saab JAS 39-Gripen crashed on 8 August 1993, during a demonstration, near the downtown area of Sweden's capital. The pilot could no longer steer the aircraft because of a failure in the control lever. During a test bench session "sizable vibrations" were registered in the engine's turbine.
