The bakers demanded they be paid in keeping with the defined minimum wages, the striking committee said. Bread deliveries were made only to hospitals and the Army. Negotiations were underway with the representatives of the authorities and if an accord was reached during the morning hours, the bakers would normalize production in the course of the day. The strike of bakers, something even the oldest Belgraders do not remember, was only one in a series of strikes that hit the Yugoslav capital late last and early this year and which came as a result dissatisfaction with extremely low wages. Severe sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina threatened the living standard of some 10.8 million people with galloping hyperinflation which literally devalued any wages by the hour and on the other hand invited spiralling price hikes.
