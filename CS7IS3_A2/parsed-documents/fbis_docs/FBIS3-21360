Responsible sources in Hamas, the Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA), and the National Liberation Front (FLN) said that contacts might not begin before the new president announces the broad outlines of the policy he will follow. Liamine Zeroual has not yet spoken. He has not addressed the nation in the week since his appointment as head of state. However, the president may address the nation on Tuesday, 8 February. Some sources say that Zeroual will deliver his "second speech to the nation" before 9 February, the second anniversary of the declaration of the state of emergency. The big political parties that boycotted the conference say they are waiting for concrete political measures that will help begin serious dialogue and restore civil peace. This is the basic demand before the government now. Officials in National Human Rights Watch, the organization directly concerned about such measures to calm the situation, say that they "have made steps in this direction and are awaiting a response from the authorities." However, they did not clarify the nature of these measures and instead denied knowing of any amnesty measures that the government has taken or is in the process of taking. As for contacts with the FIS, signs of relief are becoming increasingly clear. In an interview with AL-WATAN, Youcel El Khatib said that the FIS has accepted the principle of dialogue and has agreed to participate in bringing the country out of the crisis and ending the bloodshed. This statement agrees completely with the "declaration against violence" that the overseas FIS parliamentary delegation signed on Sunday. In a similar interview with the daily AL-MUJAHID, El Khatib said that the dialogue with FIS representatives was positive and that the FIS personalities enjoyed credibility and were representative of the party's base, even if the dialogue did not specifically involve Ali Benhadj and Abassi Madani. According to El Khatib, "members who are founders and officials of the FIS can be found among these personalities," but he refused to give the names--"for security reasons," as he said. It appears that the crisis of representation latent in the parties, including the FIS, will find a solution. In the wake of progress regarding relations with the FIS, El Khatib expressed the hope that the major parties would participate in forming the transitional National Assembly of 170 seats to be split between the political parties and the associations.
