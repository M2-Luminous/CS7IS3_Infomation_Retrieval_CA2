According to the press service of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, the delegation has come to Latvia to discuss possible cooperation between Latvia and the United States in military sphere as well as in security issues. Andrejevs voiced his concern about the security of Latvia, particularly in respect of the radar base in Skrunda, because the presence of such site on the Latvian territory might cause various misinterpretations and incidents. The U.S. delegates said that, if the Latvian security was threatened, Latvia could consult with NATO and make use of the opportunities offered by the programme "Partnership for Peace". The head of the American delegation said that his country understood Latvia's concern over its security, therefore the contacts were being established to launch bilateral cooperation. The talks also dealt with issues connected with the programme "Partnership for Peace". Andrejevs said that the Latvian Government was ready to sign the agreements on joining the programme. The U.S. delegation said that NATO was offering a possibility to consult with its advisors in order to find the best kind of Latvian participation in the programme. The guests also thought that the programme could encourage the Baltic States to cooperate on security issues. Speaking about the defence problems, Pavlovskis stressed that they are mainly financial problems. The U.S. delegates said that a limited financial assistance could probably be obtained from the NATO.
