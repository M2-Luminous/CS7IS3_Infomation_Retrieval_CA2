Types of Projects Except as expressly provided in section II.B.2.b. and II.C. above, the Institute has placed no limitation on the overall number of awards or the number of awards in each special interest category. The general types of projects are: 1. Education and training; 2. Research and evaluation; 3. Demonstration; and 4. Technical assistance. B. Types of Grants The Institute has established the following types of grants: 1. New grants (See sections VI. and VII.). 2. Continuation grants (See sections III.H. and IX.A). 3. On-going Support grants (See sections III.I. and IX.B.). 4. Package grants (See sections III.J., VI.A.2.b., VI.A.3.b., and VII.). 5. Technical Assistance grants (See section II.C.2.). 6. Curriculum Adaptation grants (See section II.B.2.b.i.(b)). 7. Scholarships (See section II.B.2.b.v.). C. Maximum Size of Awards 1. Except as specified below, concept papers and applications for new projects other than national conferences, and applications for continuation grants may request funding in amounts up to $300,000, although new and continuation awards in excess of $200,000 are likely to be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highly promising proposals that will have a significant impact nationally. 2. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amounts up to $600,000, except as provided in paragraph V.C.3. At the discretion of the Board, the funds to support on-going support grants may be awarded either entirely from the Institute's appropria-tions for the fiscal year of the award or from the Institute's appropriations for successive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of the award. When funds to support the full amount of an on-going support grant are not awarded from the appropriations for the fiscal year of award, funds to support any subsequent years of the grant will be made available upon (1) the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterly Progress Reports required to be filed and grant monitoring, and (2) the availability of appropriations for that fiscal year. 3. An application for a package grant may request funding in an amount up to a total of $750,000 per year. 4. Applications for technical assistance grants may request funding in amounts up to $30,000. 5. Applications for curriculum adaptation grants may request funding in amounts up to $20,000. 6. Applications for scholarships may request funding in amounts up to $1,500. D. Length of Grant Periods 1. Grant periods for all new and continuation projects ordinarily will not exceed 24 months. 2. Grant periods for on-going support grants ordinarily will not exceed 36 months. 3. Grant periods for technical assistance grants and curriculum adaptation grants ordinarily will not exceed 12 months.
