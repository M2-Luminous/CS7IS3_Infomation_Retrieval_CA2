The supervisor of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God, who was speaking before today's Friday prayers sermons in Tehran, criticized the approach of the Saudi Arabian Government towards the disavowal of infidels ceremonies and said: We are not trying to create any disturbances for the Saudi Government. However, on the basis of Islamic principles and at the urging of the guardian of the cause of Muslims [Khamene'i], and in order to implement a divine injunction, we will perform these ceremonies. He said: In Islam it is incumbent upon people to take part in the disavowal of infidels ceremonies. He added: To separate the political dimension from the hajj means that in this great congress the Muslims will have to do nothing regarding the enemies of Islam and should not find any solutions for the political and social problems in Islamic countries, including in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is burning in the fire of Serbian atrocities. He urged Saudi officials not to prevent the Muslims from carrying out their duty in performing the disavowal of infidels ceremonies in this year's hajj pilgrimage.
