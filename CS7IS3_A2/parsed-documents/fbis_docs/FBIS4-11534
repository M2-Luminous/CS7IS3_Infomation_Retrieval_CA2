He added that those who favor a reduction in the military budget, as well as those who favor the elimination of the Army, are seeking chaos and war in the country. During a seminar at the Olof Palme Convention Center to review civilian-military relations, an event that is continuing today, Gen. Ortega, in one of his usual abrupt remarks, said the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] is a stabilizing factor in Nicaragua. Without the EPS, he added, there would be chaos and war in the country. He was criticizing those who favor a reduction in the Army's budget. In his statements, one can see Ortega's zeal to control power in a more complete and hegemonic way. Meanwhile, Dr. Lino Hernandez of the Permanent Commission for the Defense of Human Rights said what is happening in Haiti could happen here. [Begin recording] [Hernandez] Ortega noted that those seeking to alter the current state of the Army or the way the it is organized right now are attacking the country. In other words, he is saying, there can be no changes here unless he or the military leaders accept them. I expected a different position from him at this seminar, because there are many international personalities taking part in it. These people expect the military to be remain subordinate to civilian authorities. In turn, we expected Gen. Ortega to express a different position, but he took the opportunity to be very blunt. He expressed the Army's view, saying that the Army here cannot be altered. In fact, he even threatened an economist clearly referring to him. He said: There is an economist who is saying that the Army's budget must be reduced. Well, this is a direct threat. Ortega is telling him that he must be quiet. Ortega's position shows there is a long way to go in this country to attain what the Nicaraguan people want, which is a de jure state -- a system that will include the subordination of the military to civilian authorities. [Reporter] It seems that he wants to remain in the Army forever, giving up the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate. [Hernandez] When these politicians try to wrap themselves in power -- and here, Ortega speaks like a true politician -- they become very dangerous. We cannot stop thinking or predicting that one day Gen. Ortega might decide to seize control, and who is going to tell him no at a time when foreign intervention is practically nonexistent? Aristide was ousted in Haiti. The U.S. Government says it is against it, and yet the situation continues. It has been more than two years since the Haitian coup. Unfortunately, we feel there is an attempt to control power in an increasingly hegemonic and complete way, and we must be alert to this. We must prevent men like Generals Ortega and Somoza from trying to control all power in the country. [end recording]
