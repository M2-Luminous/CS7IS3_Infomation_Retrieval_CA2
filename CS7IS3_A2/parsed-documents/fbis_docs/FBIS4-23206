A commission of enquiry comprised of Army and police officers is expected to leave today for Gamboma, a town located 300 km north of Brazzaville, the same sources added. Gamboma is a stronghold of the Congolese opposition coalition. Early this year, opposition militia stole a large quantity of arms and ammunition from the noncommissioned officers' school there. At the time, President Pascal Lissouba accused, without mentioning any names, a senior Army officer of having approved of the theft.
