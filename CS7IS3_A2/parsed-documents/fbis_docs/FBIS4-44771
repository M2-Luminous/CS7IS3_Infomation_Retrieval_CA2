The island's geographical position assumes an even greater importance nowadays. Enhanced by the excellent telecommunication services offered by the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CYTA), as well as by other, specialised services offered to the business community, offshore companies and businesses have been attracted to Cyprus and the island has established itself as the most attractive business centre in the region and a telecommunications centre of advanced technology. It is widely accepted that no contemporary business enterprise can be successful in today's demanding business world without efficient, advanced and reliable telecommunications facilities. Recognising this, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority has invested heavily in upgrading the telecommunications network, enhancing the quality and expanding the range of services offered to satisfy the growing needs of its customers. The result has been the establishment of an excellent telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of reliable and efficient telecommunications services both nationally and internationally. In Cyprus, the contribution of telecommunications in the general effort to reactivate the economy after the tragic events of 1974, has been particularly significant. Subscribers in 197 countries, or about 99% of the world's telephones, can be accessed automatically from Cyprus, while the rest of the world can be reached through the operator. Telefax service is available to all countries operating such a service, while telex and telegraph services are provided to virtually every country in the world. New value-added services, such as audiotex and videoconferencing have been recently introduced. Data transmission locally or overseas is effected either through the public, switched telephone network and point-to-point leased circuits, or via the Packet Switched Public Data Network (CYTAPAC), which uses sophisticated switching technology and ensures reliable and secure transfer of data. Private leased circuits are also available for voice, text and video applications. A cellular mobile telephone service, operating at 900 MHz, with an area coverage of more than 90% of the island, and an island-wide automatic radiopaging service are also offered. CYTA also provides a range of maritime services, enabling communication between land-based establishments and ships at sea, as well as a variety of services and facilities to third parties. The authority, in its continuous drive for excellence has, since 1986, been expanding its network and gradually replacing analogue facilities with digital switching and transmission systems which are considered state-of-the-art technology. By the end of 1993 the capacity of the switching network was about 65% digital, while the digital transmission network constituted about 90% of the total. The density of telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants currently stands at about 52, which compares favorably with European countries advanced in telecommunications, while the figure of 65 is targeted for 1997. Today, Cyprus is primarily connected with the rest of the world via six satellite earth stations and three analogue submarine cables which form a highly reliable and flexible network. One of the authority's main aims is to establish Cyprus as a center of telecommunications in the Eastern Mediterranean region to support the government's objective of turning Cyprus into an ideal services center and information hub. With this in mind, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority has entered into agreements with Greece, Israel, Syria and Lebanon for the establishment of fiber optic submarine cable systems connecting these countries with Cyprus and through it with the rest of the world. The Cyprus-Israel cable (CIOS) has already been installed and will be ready for service early this year. The tender for the construction of the Cyprus-Syria link (UGARIT) was recently awarded and the cable is expected to be ready for service by November this year. Tenders have also been invited for the Cyprus-Lebanon cable (CADMOS) which is expected to become operational in March 1995. The contract for a fourth fiber-optic submarine cable connecting Cyprus with Greece (APHRODITE 2) was awarded early in 1993. This cable is expected to be ready for service by September this year. Another cable, an extension of the Cyprus-Greece cable, will be laid between Greece and France--CYTA will be a major co-owner in this system. A fifth fiber-optic cable connecting Cyprus with Egypt constitutes part of the SEA-ME-WE 2 submarine, fiber-optic cable, an extensive system stretching from Singapore across the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and ending at Marseilles. When completed in July this year, SEA-ME-WE 2, covering more than 18,000 kilometers, will be the longest fiber-optic, submarine cable laid to date. Cyprus Telecommunications Authority is participating in the construction of the cable system as a co-owner, with 53 other parties. In line with the policy of establishing Cyprus as an information hub in the eastern Mediterranean region, the authority entered into an agreement with Russian organisations providing for the establishment of a satellite link between the two countries. The agreement also provides for the routing of telecommunications traffic originating from Russia, as well as from other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, through Cyprus to the rest of the world and vice versa. The link will be used for telephony, data transmission, telefax, videoconferencing, etc. At the same time, CYTA is proceeding speedily with the introduction of new services, using state-of-the-art technology, so as to meet market demand. Among these services are the Pan-European Paging System ERMES, expected to operate in 1994; the Pan-European Cellular Mobile Telephone System (GSM) and an integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) to be introduced in 1995, as well as a number of value-added services such as videotex, electronic mail, message handling system X.400 and voicemail in the 1994-1995 timeframe. It is evident that the advanced, reliable and efficient telecommunications services offered by the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority, as well as its ambitious plans for the future, place Cyprus among the world's developed countries in this field and render it an ideal business center in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region.
