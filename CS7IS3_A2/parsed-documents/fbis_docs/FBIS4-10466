He has said the country's economic recovery began in November 1993. [Begin Aspe recording] The agreement was ratified in November. The economy had reached a deadlock in October, and we already had a negative 3-percent drop in industrial production. Ratification of the agreement took place in November, and industrial production rose to 0 percent that month. Recovery began in December, and figures for the industrial sector in December show a 4.1-percent increase. The change was truly dramatic.

He said all the country's sectors reasserted their pledge with ratification of the pact for stability, competitiveness, and employment to continue with a gradual 3-percent economic recovery, a 7-percent inflation rate, which is less than last year's inflation, and a zero fiscal deficit.
