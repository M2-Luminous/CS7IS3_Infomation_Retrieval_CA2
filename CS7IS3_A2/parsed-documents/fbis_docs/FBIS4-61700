According to Simonenko, the Ukrainian Communists would see any move to reschedule the elections as illegal and would insist, even in defiance of a direct presidential decree, that the elections be held on 26 June. The bloc of left-wing forces brings together the Communists, Socialists and the Ukrainian Farmers' party. It has some 120, or more than one third, of the parliament's 338 distributed mandates and can block the endorsement of what it sees as ill-intended amendments to the national Constitution. Simonenko said the Communists would support the candidacy of Socialist leader Aleksandr Moroz in the presidential elections. Most other presidential nominees, he said, had already had a chance to serve Ukraine but failed to perform well in positions of power. In principle, however, the Ukrainian Communists opposed the institute of the presidency. According to Simonenko, the left-wing bloc would aim primarily to insure economic stabilization. It intended, first of all, to put in order the national taxation system by balancing the producers' and the country's interests. In Simonenko's view, the producers must be given a chance to streamline production with the help of government-controlled levers. Activities in the financial and credit fields must be controled. Simonenko held high credit rates responsible for economic recession in Ukraine.
