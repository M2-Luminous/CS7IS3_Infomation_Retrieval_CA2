Diplomats said Norway had joined Austria, Finland and Sweden in qualifying to join the 12-nation union on January 1 next year. One diplomat said: "It's a considerable breakthrough. Most people here didn't believe Norway would do it on time." The breakthrough came after Norway and the EU agreed to Spanish demands for extra fishing catch quotas as part of Norway's entry ticket to the Union. Under a complicated formula, the EU's four poorest countries have been given the right to an extra 14,100 tonnes of annual cod catch quotas in the Barents Sea starting in 1998. About 6,000 tonnes will be offered by Norway, calculated partly on a predicted increase in fish stocks by 1998, and the EU is to buy the right to catch another 8,000 tonnes, mainly in the Russian waters of the Barents Sea. EU officials said 45 percent of the extra quotas would go to Spain, 45 percent to Portugal, five percent to Ireland and five percent to Greece. Austria, Finland and Sweden agreed to their terms for joining the EU on March 1, but Oslo originally refused Spain's demand for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. But EU membership for Norway and the other applicants is still dependent on ratification by popular referendums in each of the four countries and by the European Parliament. It also depends on resolution of an internal EU quarrel over changes in the voting rules of ministerial councils to take account of the newcomers. Britain, with some backing from Spain, continued Tuesday to oppose any change in the balance of power which would result from the entry of four new members. EU foreign ministers will meet here again next Tuesday to continue their attempts to overcome the British objection.
