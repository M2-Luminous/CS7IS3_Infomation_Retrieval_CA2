Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas swore in the commission, which is made up of writer Eraclio Zepeda, anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Institutional Revolutionary Party Senator Eduardo Robledo. The commission "will have complete independence to evaluate the situation and the problems that need to be resolved as well as to make suggestions about options and actions to efficiently face the problems in the conflict areas," it was reported. Rojas said the commission members' backgrounds "and their roots and identification with the people of Chiapas guarantee an objective reflection of the prevailing situation in the state and an intense dialogue with social organizations and communities in an effort to improve living conditions."
