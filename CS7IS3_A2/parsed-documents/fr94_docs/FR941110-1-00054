FR941110-1-00054 FR941110-1-00010 The committee would report to the Secretary such information concerning certificates of privilege as may be requested. (f) The committee should have the authority, under proposed ยง956.80, with the approval of the Secretary, to require that first handlers submit to the committee such reports and information as the committee may need to perform its functions and fulfill its responsibilities under the order. In the normal course of business, Walla Walla Sweet Onion handlers collect and record information that may be needed by the committee. Witnesses expressed the belief that the reporting requirements that may be imposed under the proposed order would not constitute an undue burden on handler businesses since the information is typically collected for other purposes. Reports could be needed by the committee for such purposes as collecting assessments; compiling statistical data for use in evaluating marketing research and development projects; promotional activities; making recommendations for production research; and determining whether handlers are complying with order requirements. The record evidence indicates that to the extent necessary for the committee to perform its functions, handlers will likely need to provide information on the quantity of Walla Walla Sweet Onions handled each season. This required information may include, but would not necessarily be limited to, the quantities of Walla Walla Sweet Onions received by the handler and the quantities disposed of by such handler, the date of each such receipt and disposition, and the identity of the carrier transporting such onions. This should not be construed as a complete list of information the committee might require, nor should it be assumed that all of the above would necessarily be required of handlers. There may be other reports or kinds of information that the committee may find necessary for the proper conduct of its operations under the order. Therefore, the committee should have the authority, with the Secretary's approval, to require each handler to furnish such information as it finds necessary to perform its duties under the order. Each handler should be required to maintain such records of Walla Walla Sweet Onions received and disposed of as may be necessary to verify the reports that the handlers submit to the committee. All such records should be maintained for at least two fiscal periods after the fiscal period in which the transactions occurred. The order should provide that the Secretary and authorized employees of the committee should have access to handlers' premises to examine those records pertaining to matters within the purview of the order. This provision would enable verification of compliance with requirements of the order. All reports and records submitted for committee use by handlers would be required to remain confidential and be disclosed to none other than persons authorized by the Secretary, as required by the Act. Such reports should become part of the committee and Secretary's records. However, the committee should be authorized to release composite information from any or all reports that do not reveal confidential information. Such composite information could be helpful to the committee and to the industry in planning operations under the order and in promoting the order. Any release of composite information should not disclose the identity of the persons furnishing the information or any person's individual operation. (g) No handler should be permitted to handle Walla Walla Sweet Onions except in conformity with the provisions of this part, as set forth in proposed ยง956.89. If the program is to be effective, compliance with its requirements is essential, and no handler should be permitted to evade any of its provisions. Any such evasion, on the part of even one handler, could be demoralizing to those handlers who are in compliance and would tend to impair the effective operation of the program. Witnesses testified that consumers are being deceived when they purchase onions they believe to be Walla Walla Sweet Onions, but which are actually onions produced outside the production area. Proponents testified that the application of the Walla Walla name to onions not grown in the production area is an unfair trade practice that destroys the reputation of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion and causes harm to the industry.
