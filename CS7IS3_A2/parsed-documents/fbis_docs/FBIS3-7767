UN Bosnian commander General Michael Rose's approach is "to give notice and then run convoys," UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said in Sarajevo on Sunday. He said convoys in the past had negotiated their passage with the warring parties who often blocked humanitarian aid at their checkpoints. The convoys did not always have armored escorts.
