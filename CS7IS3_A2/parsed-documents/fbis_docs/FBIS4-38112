The IMF insists that the government devalue the Egyptian pound and offer a large number of public sector companies for sale in exchange for its recommending that one-third of Egypt's debts be waived; that is, $4 billion, which are scheduled to be forgiven this month under the agreement signed between the government and the IMF in the summer of 1991. The talks held last week between government officials and a team from the World Bank were fraught with acute differences, as each side stuck to its position. The government asked the World Bank team to postpone the devaluation of the pound to a later stage and promised in return to accelerate the privatization process and sell a considerable number of public sector companies in the coming months. Zafin Burmister [name as transliterated], World Bank representative in Cairo, has stated at a ceremony marking the bank's 50th anniversary that the government has pledged to the bank to privatize more than 80 public companies in the coming months. He added that the government is keen on fully implementing the program signed with the bank and the IMF to have a third of its debts forgiven. Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, chairman of the Banks' Union, has stated that banks will stop accepting any new deposits as a result of the increase in the deposits they now hold. He added: Unless the government hastens to issue long-term bonds enabling the banks to invest the accumulating funds in their possession, the banks will find themselves compelled to stop accepting new deposits. Speaking to journalists during a seminar on Arab banking on Sunday [19 June], 'Abd-al-'Aziz explained that the banks will not accept money it cannot invest. The increase in deposits held by the banks, he added, will lead to a drop in the interest rates.
