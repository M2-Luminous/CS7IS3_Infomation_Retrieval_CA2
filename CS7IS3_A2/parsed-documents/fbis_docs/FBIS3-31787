Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the coordinated chetnik and Croatian Defense Council soldiers' attacks at Maglaj continue unabated in the evening hours. After the infantry attacks were repelled, constant bombardment of the civilian population and defense lines from howitzers, tanks, and mortars resumed. This is one of the hardest days of the war on the Maglaj front, yet it is just the beginning of a large-scale and long-term offensive. This is confirmed by the constant influx of chetnik reinforcements from Modrica, Doboj, Banjluka, and the concentration of tanks in (?Tulnica), Medjici, and Brankovci. The soldiers and the people of Maglaj are resolved to defend their town and they will fight to the end." Gornji Vakuf correspondent Atif Agic reports that "sudden shelling from mortars and tanks was registered in the village of Privora in the vicinity of Gornji Vakuf, and it was accompanied by constant antiaircraft gun, antiaircraft machine gun, and sniper fire. Of course, the Gornji Vakuf town center was not spared. It was shelled from 60-mm and 82-mm mortars. The ustashas also shelled the residential buildings in the village of Purici with recoilless guns and mortars. The defense lines are stable."
