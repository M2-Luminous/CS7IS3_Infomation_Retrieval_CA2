[Al-Iryani] No. A civil war means fighting in every suburb, street, and village in Yemen. This is not the case now. The present war is between military forces belonging to the Socialist Party and other military forces defending the unity. [Al-Barghuthi] Do you think the perpetuation of war and failure to quickly settle the situation militarily may lead to a protracted war of annihilation in which civilians will eventually take part? [Al-Iryani] I do not think so because the present military situation does not suggest this possibility. The Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates are entirely under control. The non-fall of Aden cannot turn into a civil war in Abyan, Shabwah, or other governorates. People are far from the atmosphere of war; they are leading an extremely normal life. Therefore, I think it is impossible for matters to turn into a civil war. Things now depend on the fall of Aden. I am confident that once the Socialist Party's mechanism is uprooted in al-Mukalla, it will all be over. As you know, fighting is currently taking place only on one front, that is, the Aden front. We are not in a hurry to enter Aden. The "legitimate forces" may enter Hadhramaut before Aden. Our care for civilians in Aden is all that is stopping us. Indiscriminate shelling of the city for 10-12 hours may lead to its fall. It is preferable to besiege the city for a few days instead of bombing it indiscriminately and harming the civilians. We will thus avoid a civil war which the socialists tried to launch. Their indiscriminate shelling of Sanaa with Scud missiles is meant to tell the Arabs and the world that what is taking place in Yemen is a civil war as proven by civilian casualties. They will then call for Arab and international intervention in Yemen to stop the civil war. [Al-Barghuthi] How do you view the political solution after the cessation of battles and how will you deal with the Socialist Party's leaders and cadres? [Al-Iryani] This subject has been settled by two decisions. The public prosecutor decided to take legal action against 16 Socialist Party civilian and military officials and ordered their arrest. This was followed by the general amnesty decree. The way the non-prosecuted Socialist Party leaders behave toward the general amnesty decree will decide the way to deal with them. [Al-Barghuthi] Will power be shared equally between the two parties as was the case before the war? [Al-Iryani] At the end of the war, we expect to negotiate with the Socialist Party as a partner to the coalition, but it will not be given any other privilege. Before the war, the socialists were given privileges they did not deserve and this led to the present state of affairs. [passage omitted]
