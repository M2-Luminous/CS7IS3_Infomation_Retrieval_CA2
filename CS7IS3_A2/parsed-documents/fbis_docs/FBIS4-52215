The statement sharply condemned the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for demanding a total inspection of the DPRK in a sinister attempt to stamp out its political system, ignoring the special position of the DPRK that suspended temporarily the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). "We are convinced that the DPRK Government is showing fidelity with regard to the nuclear policy and highly estimate the DPRK Government for sincerely implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreement and pushing ahead with nuclear development under the strict surveillance of the IAEA. "We castigate the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council for openly applying the double-standard to the nuclear issue under the baton of the United States," the statement said, and stressed: "We warmly hail the declaration of the great leader President Kim Il-song that the DPRK neither has nuclear weapons nor needs to manufacture them."
