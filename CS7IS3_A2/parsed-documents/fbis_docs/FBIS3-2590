According to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has begun its work. Inserting a new paragraph: Tasks are arduous and the responsibility is heavy. It is our hope that the Preliminary Working Committee can unite Hong Kong compatriots in the most extensive way, succeed in all fields of work in preparation for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, as well as its first session of government and legislature, and live up to the expectations and great trust of the people of the whole country. Joining the original version: No matter what twists and turns we may face, the Chinese Government and people have the determination and ability to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. Britain's colonialist rule over Hong Kong is coming to an end and no force on earth can stop it from happening.
