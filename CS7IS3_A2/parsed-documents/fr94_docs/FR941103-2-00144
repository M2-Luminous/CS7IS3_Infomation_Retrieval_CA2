FR941103-2-00144 FR941103-2-00081 Volkswagen states that the antitheft device planned for the MY 1995 car lines differs somewhat from the device on the MY 1992 lines. Volkswagen states that the differences in the planned MY 1995 device are a revision in the central locking system, the addition of an LED activation indicator, and changes in the audible and visible warning devices. With the MY 1992 antitheft device, once the central locking system and alarm are activated, the operator could choose to open only a specific door lock or the trunk lock by turning the key and quickly releasing it. Holding the key for more than 0.5 seconds in the open position deactivates the alarm, and opens both door locks and the trunk lock. Additionally, when the key is inserted and turned counterclockwise to open the trunk lock, the central locking system also opens both door locks and deactivates the alarm system. Turning the key in either front door lock or in the trunk lock rearms the device and locks both doors and the trunk. Tampering with the device will cause both the horn and lights to activate for up to 4 minutes. For MY 1995, Volkswagen plans to modify the antitheft device so that when the key is inserted into a front door lock or trunk lock, the key will only open the lock being turned. However, an operator can open all the door locks and the trunk lock simultaneously if, within 5 seconds of the first turn of the key, the operator turns the key a second time to the open position. Tampering with the MY 1995 system would cause the horn to sound for 30 seconds, instead of sounding for up to 4 minutes, as the MY 1992 system does. In addition, the device planned for MY 1995 will utilize the hazard warning flashers, which operate up to 5 minutes. For MY 1995, an LED activation indicator light will be added on the front dashboard. A flashing light shows that the antitheft device is activated. For the planned MY 1995 device, Volkswagen provided a drawing indicating that all the switches and wiring activating the device are protected. The door, trunk, and engine hood contact switches are all hidden within the vehicle. Additionally, the control unit for the antitheft device is located in the passenger-side dashboard, with the battery being protected under the hood. If an unauthorized attempt should be made to open the hood, an audible signal and flashing of the hazard warning lamps will be triggered via the contact switch for the engine compartment light when it is opened. The alarm system horn is located in the trunk compartment and can only be reached after the trunk lock is opened. Volkswagen addressed the reliability and durability of its antitheft device by providing a list of Volkswagen's internal performance and durability tests that were conducted on the device. Among these tests were tests for: Material requirements; operating voltages; temperature stability; mechanical properties; electrical requirements; electromagnetic compatibility; environmental compatibility; and service life. With its petition, Volkswagen included a certification that the antitheft device was tested according to Volkswagen's standard, including those tests relating to electrical and mechanical durability, and passed all the performance requirements of the tests. As further evidence of the antitheft device's reliability and durability, Volkswagen stated that the functions of the antitheft device are to be handled by a specially developed microchip manufactured with the latest complementary metal oxide semiconductor (C&hyph;MOS) technology. Volkswagen asserts that among the advantages of this method are that it reduces the number of discrete components by about 60 percent compared with conventional antitheft devices; it has better reliability, as there are fewer solder joints; it has a high degree of parameter stability; and by the use of a chip, the suggestion of contact bounce and interference on input signals from the protected areas can be digitalized. Volkswagen further states that in addition to a high degree of protection (the unit will withstand ^150 V to +100 V pulses without damage), this achieves a high degree of resistance to interference. Volkswagen stated that the antitheft device planned for the MY 1995 A6 and S6 car lines is, except for the changes noted earlier, almost identical to the devices on the Audi 100, S4, 500 and Quattro car lines that have been granted exemptions from parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard. The agency has reviewed the theft experience of the Audi 100 and 200 car lines equipped with the antitheft device as standard equipment, for 1989, 1990, and 1991. The data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, NHTSA's official source of theft data, show that for 1990/91 the most recent year for which theft data is available, the Audi 100/200 had a theft rate of 1.3564 (per thousand vehicles produced), a rate that is below the 1990/91 median theft rate of 3.5826. For 1990/91, out of 235 vehicle lines, the Audi 100/200 line was ranked 204, far lower than the median rank of 116. In discussing why it believes the antitheft device will be effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft, Volkswagen compared its MY 1995 antitheft device to similar devices for which NHTSA has previously granted exemptions from parts marking. Volkswagen stated that the theft rates of these comparable lines decreased when the antitheft device was made standard equipment, and have remained, for the most part, below 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712 (per thousand vehicles produced). (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985). Volkswagen stated its belief that its device proposed for MY 1995 is equivalent to all of these comparable devices previously granted an exemption by the agency. The agency believes that the MY 1995 Volkswagen antitheft device is comparable to the devices on the car lines cited below.
