FR941102-1-00058 FR941102-1-00016 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth O. Hardie, Office of Rulemaking, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;6987). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Heraeus DSET Laboratories, Inc. (``DSET''), of Phoenix, Arizona, petitioned NHTSA for rulemaking to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. Specifically, DSET asked that paragraph S5.1.2 be amended ``to update the weathering and heat testing requirements of plastic material used for optical parts such as lenses and reflectors.'' Currently, these materials are required to conform to SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970. DSET wants NHTSA ``to allow alternative processing techniques besides injection molding to produce test specimens, to allow test specimen sizes other than a 3 inch diameter disc and to change the specimen thickness tolerances from # 0.005 inch to # .010 inch.'' Those requirements for injection molding and for the diameter and thickness of the test specimen are set forth in J576c, May 1970. The petition set forth five reasons in support. The first is that the requirement in Standard No. 108 (SAE J576c) that test samples be injection molded is ``technology limiting'' and other methods of test specimen fabrication exist and should be allowed. SAE J576 JUL91 allows alternative processing techniques to produce test specimens. Secondly, SAE J576 JUL91 contains no sample shape or diameter requirement, in contrast to Standard No. 108's present restriction to a round sample of 3-inch diameter. DSET submits that there is no technical reason to continue the limit for the test specimen. Third, DSET stated that no technical reason exists to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance to 0.005 inch (or 0.13 mm as NHTSA expresses it). Accordingly, the petitioner recommends # 0.010 inch (0.25 mm), ``since this appears to be a more reasonable tolerance that almost all plastic lens materials manufacturers can meet.'' The petitioner said that many manufacturers currently have trouble meeting the # 0.005 inch tolerance. Fourth, DSET believes that States impose a burden on manufacturers to test according to Standard No. 108. Although 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 and Standard No. 108 do not require a manufacturer to conduct testing in producing and certifying a vehicle or item of equipment (the requirement is that the product meet all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards when tested according to the procedures specified), DSET says that many State laws require proof of testing according to Standard No. 108. This means that even if there are alternative processing techniques for plastics that have been developed as a result of advancing technology, the manufacturer is obliged to follow the test procedures of Standard No. 108. Finally, DSET said that SAE J576c has been out of print for many years. Its unavailability has resulted in manufacturers routinely submitting ``test specimens that do not meet the # 0.005 inch thickness tolerance or the 3 [inch] diameter size requirement.'' The agency has reviewed DSET's petition and has found that there is a reasonable possibility that the amendments asked for would occur at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly, the agency has granted DSET's petition. The requested changes would appear to simplify the test requirements of Standard No. 108 without degrading safety. These changes would also allow more flexibility in the preparation of test specimens. However, NHTSA is concerned that simple substitution of the 1991 version of SAE J576 for the 1970 one might result in an unintended burden upon industry, as the updated version contains some requirements that are different from and in addition to those of the 1970 version. In addition, the ASTM D&hyph;1003 requirements currently referenced in S5.1.2 of Standard No. 108 are those of 1961. NHTSA is proposing to amend S5.1.2 to replace the reference to the 1961 version of ASTM D&hyph;1003 with a 1992 version and seeks comment on this change. The differences between the two versions include subtle changes to the text in virtually every section and the agency is unable to judge whether these changes would result in an increased burden to industry. Because of this uncertainty, the agency is proposing as an alternative a means of implementing DSET's request that does not include a reference to the revised standards. NHTSA welcomes informed comment on this issue. As a consequence of its age, a 33-year-old ASTM specification may be technologically limiting, as well as difficult to obtain. As noted above, strict adherence to older procedures which States may require means that manufacturers could not avail themselves of newer, less restrictive processing techniques if such exist.
