The individual respondent data on amounts outstanding and on interest expense for the various deposit categories are given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. ยง552(b)(4)]. Data on interest rates paid on deposits are made available to the public on request. SUMMARY: The reports collect detailed information on amounts, offering rates, interest expense, and fees on various types of retail deposits from a stratified sample of BIF-insured commercial and savings banks. The revisions are designed in part to make the data collected more accurately reflect deposit pricing. In addition, other changes eliminate items no longer deemed necessary to conducting monetary policy. The Federal Reserve uses data from the FR 2042 and FR 2042a in a number of ways, including construction and interpretation of the monetary aggregates, measuring elasticities in money demand equations, and assessing the changing behavior of banks in pricing deposit accounts. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 22, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board.
