Clinton, who leaves here Saturday [8 January] night, met Monday with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Strobe Talbott, the would-be deputy to Christopher, on the tour that will include stops in Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva. The President is scheduled to meet with specialists on European and Russian affairs Tuesday night. At the center of Clinton's trip would be the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's enlargement, reforms in Russia, Moscow's outstanding nuclear differences with neighboring Ukraine and the now-slowed-down Middle East peace process. The strong support for Russia's ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party in the recent parliamentary elections has prompted the Eastern and Central European countries to hasten the process of joining the NATO. Washington, afraid of putting Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a worse footing, is against immediately accepting countries like Poland and the Czech Republics into NATO. In what it calls the "partnership for peace" program, the United States champions a gradual process in which all former Warsaw Pact member countries could join NATO's military training and other cooperation projects without security guarantee from the Transatlantic Alliance. This approach was criticized by Polish President Lech Walesa as "short-sighted and irresponsible." However, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili, a former NATO commander, said "We cannot just simply move the Berlin Wall a few hundred miles eastward." "It is important that we are very clear that... [ellipses as received] We are not building a system that is against someone, because otherwise... [ellipses as received] We would just be fueling the paranoia that might exist," the general said. On Thursday, Shalikashvili and Madeleine Albright, Washington's ambassador, will go to East Europe, both added items in their itinerary, to soothe their concerns over the U.S. plan on NATO enlargement. Clinton will stop in Prague, the Czech Capital, and meet with Eastern European leaders. His next stop is Moscow, where he will have a second summit meeting with Yeltsin to reiterate Washington's support for Russia's political and economic reforms. Clinton reportedly planned a stop in Ukraine, but the former Soviet Republic's parliamentary decision to retain the nuclear weapons on its soil kicked the visit out of Clinton's schedule. There has been wide reports of a three-way meeting in Moscow among Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, but the White House said that was still up in the air. At the State Department, Spokesman Mike McCurry said a trilateral meeting of U.S., Russian and Ukrainian officials had started Monday on the nuclear issues. McCurry said a meeting between Clinton and Kravchuk "depends on the kind of progress they can make in talks on these nuclear disarmament issues." After a stop in Minsk, the Belarus Capital, Clinton will go to Geneva, Switzerland, for talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to revive the Middle East peace talks. Prior to his departure to Europe, Clinton will make a speech on Thursday on foreign policy, raising the curtain for the 10-day five- country trip. On Sunday afternoon, the President will make a speech in Brussels on Washington's European policy. "It is an important opportunity for him to articulate his sense of U.S.-European relations and the American role in Europe after the Cold War," a senior administration officials said last month. Clinton will answer "What is the new agenda for Transatlantic cooperation? Why do we care about each other? What do we see as the challenges to our interests? and what he sees as the American role in helping meet those challenges," the official said during a background briefing to foreign reporters.
