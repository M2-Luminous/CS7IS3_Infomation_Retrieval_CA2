The Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan has again embarked upon a good mission to focus attention on the issue. Due to serious drawbacks in the election laws, it has not been possible to strictly monitor the election expenses. Among all the various aspects of the election law, the rules and regulations concerning election expenses have become ridiculous aspects. It is estimated that a major party, on national level spends up to Rs.1,000 crores (10 billion rupees) on each election. How does it get this huge amount? The elections create an illicit relationship of ties between politicians and leaders of industries. This is the cause of black money (unaccounted or hidden) growing into millions of rupees, according to the intelligence experts. So far no serious effort was undertaken to put an end to this most unpleasant chapter in the history of Indian democracy. In order to rectify these drawbacks, suitable amendments to the law have to be made. Without waiting for the parliament to do this, Seshan has begun to make use of the existing provisions of the law to take effective action. He has decided to revise the forms intended to get the data regarding election expenses; Candidates should give not merely expenses incurred by them, but also paid by others, meaning their parties, or other individuals or organizations. It is also essential that the candidates should solemnly swear and declare that they do not hide anything and no expense was omitted. Of course, those who cheat and deceive may still invent ways to escape from strict measures. Yet there is nothing wrong in making these regulations as rigid and strict as possible. It is of course, true, that the dominance of money power in elections cannot be eradicated by the action of the Chief Election Commissioner. It will be possible only if political parties and the government give their full cooperation in the matter. Politicians should not hesitate in giving the election commission the authority to audit the expense accounts of the political parties. In the absence of such an arrangement, candidates will show only a fraction of their real expenditure. This is because politicians have been practicing the art of cheating for so long a time that they have made a mockery of the election rules regarding the excessive election spending.
