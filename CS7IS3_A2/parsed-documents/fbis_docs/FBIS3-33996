This statement of U.S. interference cannot be accepted. The U.S. President, in reply to Congressman Gary A. Condit and 15 other legislators, demanding an active U.S. diplomatic role in Punjab, has assured them that his administration shares their "desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh rights" and promised to take up the issue with authorities in New Delhi. There should be no doubt, however, that what is being cleverly camouflaged as defence of human rights is in fact a brazen interference on the part of the Clinton administration in India's internal affairs. Indeed, contrary to a widespread illusion among New Delhi's policy makers that Washington under a Democratic Party president would hold India in a tight embrace, Mr. Clinton has lost no opportunity to bare his fangs at this country. In fact, there has not been a single issue in the past year which has revealed that Mr. Clinton's set-up has the slightest consideration or respect for India's autonomy. Instead what has been flaunted as the administration's fresh "even handed" approach towards the subcontinent has essentially meant a definite anti-India, pro-Pakistan bias in U.S. policy pronouncements. Little wonder then that the U.S. has chosen to treat Pakistani help for terrorists in India as being no worse than the propaganda of human rights violations in India. The tone for such a lop-sided policy was set rather early through the blunt remarks of Mr. John Malott, a senior U.S. official who visited Delhi last May when he sermonised us on improving our human rights record, especially in regard to Kashmir and Punjab. In so doing not only did Washington choose to be blind to the "ground realities" in both these states, where our forces are fighting a proxy war against infiltrators sent by Pakistan, but also totally overlooked the constitutional safeguards our democratic polity and independent judiciary provide for protection of human rights. Mr. Clinton admits "some recent improvements in the Sikhs' situations" but maintains that "abuses still occur." Perhaps he needs to be reminded that even in this country Rodney King episodes do take place. On the question of human rights, India would want Washington to keep in mind that it is fully conscious of its responsibility to defend human and civic rights. It has a human rights commission. These institutions may have to be made more effective. But that is India's concern. The fact that the U.S. has shown little appreciation of India's stand on the issue shows that Mr. Clinton perhaps find the human rights issue a clever means of arm-twisting India into following policies tailored to suit American interests, especially on the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. Curiously, Mr. Clinton wrote a similar letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, head of the pro-terrorism Kashmir-American Council on the same day that he wrote to the Congressmen on Punjab. But while the former statement to a lobbyist was said to be an oversight, his communication to the Congressmen could hardly be so. By replying to the Congressmen referring to the crisis of "Khalistan", Mr. Clinton may have lent credence to a concept which the same Mr. Malott had only last August announced as having no official sanction. The Indian government has done well to react sternly to Mr. Clinton's statement.
