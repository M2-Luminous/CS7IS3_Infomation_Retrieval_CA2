Last year's start of operation of a numerical weather prediction system, which uses an advanced Yinhe-II computer, made the increased forecast capacity possible. China also set up the first continental global atmosphere watch observatory last year in Qinghai Province, which is expected to be operational soon. Officials say the observatory will enable China to monitor the atmosphere, including the ozone layer and acid rain. The observatory, which is officially known as China Global Atmosphere Watch Baseline Observatory (CGAW) was constructed with cooperation from the World Meteorological Organization. The National Satellite Meteorological Center is now building the ground segment for Fengyun-2 Meteorological Satellite to be launched. The satellite will be China's first geostationary meteorological satellite.
