Military sources of the Croatian Defense Council have, on the other hand, been reporting on the constant activity of Muslim snipers and gunners at Mostar streets, schools, and buildings. The UN Protection Force and military observers are counting mines and shells; dead and wounded are counted, too -- civilians, children, and soldiers alike on both sides. General Ante Roso, head of the Croatian Defense Council Headquarters, protested against the UN Protection Forces because of the shelling of civilian targets, which caused the deaths of children. Several days later, General Jean Cot wrote to General Roso about the shelling of Mostar and asked him to stop the action. The demarcation line in Mostar has remained almost unchanged since 30 June 1993, when Muslim forces, supported by the units of the Croatian Defense Council consisting of soldiers of Muslim nationality, occupied the "Tihomir Misic" Barracks and the largest part of Bijelo Polje. Since that time, there have been clashes for the preservation of positions, mostly at the level of provocations. Muslim forces tried to occupy Buna on three occasions, with the aim of starting an offensive in the direction of Stolac, but they were forced to withdraw because of heavy losses. The attempt to occupy Hum also meant a tragic end for Izetbegovic's soldiers. The Croatian Defense Council units on several occasions succeeded in seizing several well-fortified buildings on Ricina (Santic) Street in the center of Mostar. According to some objective assessments, there are 6,000-7,000 soldiers in the 4th Corps of Izetbegovic's army in Mostar. Most of them have been recruited among refugees from eastern Herzegovina and eastern Bosnia and are armed with weapons they obtained or "borrowed" from the Croatian Defense Council. These are infantry weapons, including mortars, recoilless rifles, and single-barreled rocket launchers; they do not have heavy artillery guns. It is highly probable that they have recently bought mostly ammunition and certain weapons. On the other side, there are Croatian Defense Council units, who are much better armed and have much more ammunition but cannot (and do not have to) keep as many soldiers on the Mostar front as the Muslims. It is only logical to ask why the Croatian Defense Council has not completely occupied Mostar in the past nine months. Why has this stalemate position -- in which the Croatian Defense Council is losing its people -- not been resolved yet? There are various theories about it, but the most probable is the one that says that it is a political issue. Taking into consideration the information on the number of soldiers that can be engaged on both sides, on the weapons the parties to the conflict have, and on the much more favorable positions the Croatian Defense Council units have, it is certain that the Muslims would be defeated according to any military law should it be decided to take Mostar. The only question is how long the Muslims could offer resistance, since many Muslim soldiers are ready to leave Mostar and the unbearable life in isolation and poverty. The striking force of the Muslim army are refugees from eastern Herzegovina, who are more than aware of the fact that it is almost certain they will never be able to return to their homes. This makes them the most radical element in the Muslim army. The local Muslims could make an agreement with Croats, although this would not be easy. On the other hand, it has become evident that "foreigners" play an important role among the Muslims in Mostar. This is proven by the fact that two Muslims from Sandzak joined the negotiations in Medjugorje, but the Croatian Defense Council representative did not want to negotiate with them, so the first negotiators returned. The Serbian soldiers situated on the slopes of Velez Mountain are observing everything and are waiting for an outcome. They do not know when or if they will interfere in the Muslim-Croatian conflict.
