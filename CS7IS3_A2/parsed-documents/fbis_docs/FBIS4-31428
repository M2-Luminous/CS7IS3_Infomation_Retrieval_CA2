Fekete: "Fidesz Does Not Want To Be Part of the Government -- Less Than a Fifth of the Leadership Would Say Yes to the MSZP"] [Text] According to NEPSZABADSAG's information, the majority of the National Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] would be against a coalition cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] if the party that was victorious at the elections sent an official request to the Young Democrats. According to the party's leadership, the Fidesz's moral standing would be lost if, giving up its values advocated in the campaign, it joined the emerging social-liberal coalition. The Fidesz's official view has not changed: The party is only willing to react to an official coalition offer received directly from the MSZP. At the same time, influential people in the Fidesz firmly stated that the mood in the party's leading bodies is against the coalition; a proposal to work together with the MSZP would not even receive the support of one-fifth of those in decisionmaking positions. The members who stated this used the decision of the Fidesz's April 1993 congress held in Debrecen as an argument which stipulated two conditions for cooperating with the MSZP: The MSZP should not be a subservient party to the trade unions, and that a change of generations should take place in the Socialist leadership. According to Fidesz politicians, neither of these conditions have been met; therefore, acceptance of a possible coalition offer would go against the party congress decision. Fidesz members also emphasized that the party would lose its moral standing if it entered the coalition because, in its election campaign, it had contrary goals to this, including "preventing the former leaders from returning to power." According to politicians, with their 20 parliamentary deputies, the Young Democrats would be just as unimportant partners in a coalition as the Christian Democratic People's Party was in the past four years alongside the Hungarian Democratic Forum. However, in opposition, the Fidesz could win over those liberals who are disappointed with the social-liberal government. According to our information, the coalition agreement of the Socialists and Free Democrats might in spite of all this leave the possibility open for the Fidesz perhaps to join later.
