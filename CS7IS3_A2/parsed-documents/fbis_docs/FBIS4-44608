Performance indicators for these couplers meet or exceed those of the 6N136 and 6N137 commercial products made by the U.S. firm HP [Hewlett Packard]. Moreover, these Institute 44 products use a black ceramic metallized package, providing noticeably higher reliability than comparable resin packages. The high-speed, high-voltage optoelectronic coupler is used for driving TTL signals, relays, pulse amplifiers, high-voltage signal transmitters, and A/D converters. The Z-type optical coupler is used in gyro accelerometers and also in computer-peripherals interface circuits in office automation systems and in isolated-signal transmission systems. The IC-type high-speed optoelectronic coupler is oriented toward computer-based digital communications systems and real-time control systems.
