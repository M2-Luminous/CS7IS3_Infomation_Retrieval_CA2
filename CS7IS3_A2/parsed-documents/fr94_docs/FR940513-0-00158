FR940513-0-00158 FR940513-0-00034 The Commission recognizes that manufacturers regularly etch products with voltage, wattage, and other information, which is the disclosure method that NEMA and GE recommended for the encircled ``E.'' 228 The Commission concludes that if the encircled ``E'' is permanently marked on the lamps, the objectives of EPA 92, as they apply to general service fluorescent lamps, can be achieved at a reduced compliance burden on those manufacturers who choose to sell lamps that bear no labels, whether packaging labels, hang tags or adhesive labels. Manufacturers need not etch on such products the explanatory statement otherwise required to accompany the encircled ``E.'' On the product itself, the statement may be difficult to read and may not be used or needed by most consumers of these products (who primarily are more knowledgeable commercial purchasers). See ยง305.11(e)(2)(B) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 228 The Commission also notes that the labeling rules do not prohibit manufacturers from marking their products in this manner. 3. Catalogs Eight comments recommended that whatever disclosures the Commission requires for general service fluorescent lamps appear in catalogs from which these products can be ordered for purchase. 229 There was no opposition to this recommendation. Therefore, these amendments require that, in addition to disclosing the encircled ``E'' on packaging, manufacturers must disclose clearly and conspicuously the encircled ``E'' in close proximity to each entry for a covered general service fluorescent lamp in catalogs from which the lamps can be ordered by purchasers. 230 On each catalog page upon which the encircled ``E'' appears, manufacturers also must disclose, prominently and conspicuously at least once, the statement: ``(The encircled ``E'' logo, followed by:) means this bulb meets Federal minimum efficiency standards.'' See ยง305.14(d)(1) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 229 GE, G&hyph;2, 5; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 24, 26&hyph;27, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 30; Osram, G&hyph;4, 2, (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 4; Philips, G&hyph;5, 3; ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3&hyph;4, (Tr.), 328&hyph;329, (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 9; SCS, GG&hyph;16, 4; WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 4. 230 This requirement also applies to general service incandescent reflector lamps. 4. Point-of-Sale Printed Materials Four comments addressed the issue of disclosures in point-of-sale materials for general service fluorescent lamps. GE suggested that the Commission may want retailers to make specific disclosures available in point-of-sale written materials, to the extent that such disclosures may be necessary to help consumers choose the most energy efficient products that meet their requirements. 231 ACEEE recommended that average annual operating cost and average lifetime indicators be included on both packaging and point-of-sale displays for sales to residential purchasers. 232 LBL stated that efficacy (efficiency) information should be included in point-of-sale materials for residential purchasers. 233 SCS contended that the best way to disclose both the energy index and operating cost information would be through voluntary point-of-sale materials prepared on a regional basis. 234 231 GE (Ans.), G&hyph;2, 8. 232 ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3&hyph;4. 233 LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 3. 234 SCS, GG&hyph;16, 4&hyph;5. The Commission has already discussed its position and its determination not to require disclosures in point-of-sale materials, in Part IV.C.7, above. The Commission's position is the same for point-of-sale materials for general service fluorescent lamps. Accordingly, the Commission is not requiring specific disclosures for these products at point of sale. As with the other lamp products covered by the labeling rules, however, manufacturers and other sellers must disclose the assumptions they use (cost of electricity, hours of use, etc .) if they voluntarily make point-of-sale operating cost disclosures. 235 See ยง305.13(a)(2) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 235 See Part IV.C.2.b, above. F. Other Issues 1. Request for Exemption for Products To Be Eliminated by EPCA's Energy Conservation Standards EPCA's minimum efficiency standards for 4-foot medium bi-pin and 2-foot U-shaped general service fluorescent lamps and all incandescent reflector lamps will not become effective until October 31, 1995, 236 approximately six months after the labeling rules become effective. Because of the burdens new labeling requirements would impose, NEMA, GE and Osram requested an exemption under EPCA, 42 U.S.C.A. 6294(a)(2)(C)(ii) (West Supp. 1993), from the labeling requirements for lamp products that will be eliminated from the market on October 31, 1995. 237 This section states that if the Secretary of DOE determines that compliance with the minimum efficiency standards specified in EPCA for any lamp will result in the discontinuance of its manufacture, the Commission may exempt such lamp from the labeling rules. The exemption would be limited to those lamps that may no longer be manufactured after the minimum efficiency standards become effective. DOE has made this determination. 238 Hence, the Commission has the discretion to exempt these lamp products from the new labeling rules. Given that these products will be manufactured for only six months after the new labeling rules go into effect, it does not appear appropriate to require manufacturers to go to the expense of redesigning their labels. Accordingly, those general service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps covered by the minimum efficiency standards that become effective on October 31, 1995, under 42 U.S.C.A. 6295(i)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1993), that do not meet those minimum efficiency standards are exempted from the labeling rules. 239 236 42 U.S.C.A. 6295(i)(1)(A)-(B) (West Supp. 1993). 237 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 10, 14&hyph;15, 44, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 5 fn. *; Osram, G&hyph;4, 2. See GE, G&hyph;2, 10. 238 Letter dated April 18, 1994, to Janet Steiger, Chairman, FTC, from Hazel R. O'Leary, Secretary, DOE. 239 As of November 1, 1995, any manufacturer who continues to manufacture these lamps could be subject to action by DOE for selling lamps in violation of the minimum efficiency standards.
