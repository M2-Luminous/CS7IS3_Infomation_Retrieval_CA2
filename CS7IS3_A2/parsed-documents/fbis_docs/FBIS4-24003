In a meeting with local journalists shortly after his arrival coming from Maringue, Afonso Dhlakama said the aim of his visit to Sofala Province was to familiarize himself with the main problems facing the people as well as to determine what they would want to see done after the October elections. [Begin Dhlakama recording] Well, I am here to visit Sofala Province, because I have already visited other provinces. I am here to familiarize myself with the political situation. I am here to greet the people, to guarantee the introduction of the democratization process. I am here to determine what the people want after elections. [end recording] We also asked Afonso Dhlakama to comment on delays observed in the voter registration process in areas under his control here in Sofala Province. [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think the process has begun to take off. As you are aware, it was only a few weeks ago that State Administration Minister Aguiar Mazula visited Maringue, Inhaminga, Muanza, and other areas to swear in our administrators. I think the voter registration process will now move forward. People in those areas must register as voters, because only those in possession of voter registration cards can vote. [Unidentified correspondent] Any comment on the manner you were received at the Beira Airport? [Dhlakama] [Words indistinct] you gentlemen of the press will remember that when President Chissano arrived here, factories and schools had to close down to allow thousands of people to receive the president at the airport. We did not do that. People came here freely, and this clearly shows that they truly want to see the Renamo leader, the man who went to the bush and brought peace, democracy, and hope. These people's future is my hands. [end recording] Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama arrived at the Beira Airport at about 1200, and he was received by Manuel Pereira, Renamo political representative in Sofala, and representatives of other political parties. Also present were dozens of traditional chiefs. [passage omitted] During his stay in this province, Afonso Dhlakama is expected to visit a number of districts and hold meetings with businessmen and traditional chiefs. He will also visit the port of Beira, Munhava Ward, and the Beira Central Hospital.
