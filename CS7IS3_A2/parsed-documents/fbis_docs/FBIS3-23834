This can be seen from the results of the Russia-wide conference--"On the Use of Credits and Technical Assistance Afforded by International Financial Organizations in Accordance with the Program of Support for Privatization and Structural Transformations in Russia"--conducted 5 February at the Moscow Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises. Conference participants demanded that the government institute measures which would stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises. The Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises was established in November 1992. It unites about 3,000 enterprises and has 49 regional divisions. The president of the association is Yegor Gaydar. Voucher privatization has enabled the denationalization of more than 8,000 medium and large-scale enterprises and has brought about a steady demand for investments. Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays, however, who took part in the conference, explains the lack of investments not just by virtue of the economic crisis, but by the absence of a purposeful state investment policy as well. This circumstance has a direct effect on attracting large and long-term investments in privatized enterprises. According to data from the Russian Property Fund, the total amount obtained from the sale of blocks of shares of denationalized enterprises at investment auctions in 1993 came to 1.2 trillion rubles [R], i.e., 8 percent of the investment volume of the Russian market. In this regard, short-term programs (up to two years) clearly dominated, while long-term programs (up to six years) comprised just 6 percent of all investment projects. Under these conditions, the association proposed that the government implement urgent measures to stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises. The Program of Support for Privatization and Structural Transformations in Russia, developed with the participation of the State Committee for Property Management, is specifically aimed at achieving this. It includes the affording of advantageous (paid for by international financial organizations), competent consulting and auditing assistance to the councils of directors of joint-stock companies in developing their investment projects and choosing investors. In the words of Anatoliy Chubays, however, the program has still not been formally approved by the government, and its confirmation is expected within the next 10 days.
