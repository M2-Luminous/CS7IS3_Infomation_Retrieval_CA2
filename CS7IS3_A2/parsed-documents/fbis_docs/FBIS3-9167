The questions are posed by unidentified correspondents either in English or Serbo-Croatian and a simultaneous translation is provided both ways. The news conference lasts approximately 40 minutes All the answers by President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Silajdzic are fully texted. Before the first question is asked, Izetbegovic tells the reporters that "there will be no special statement. We have given enough of those. We are at your service." Asked whether the federation/confederation agreement is the "final solution" to the relations with the Croats and whether the same is planned with the Serbs, Silajdzic says "I am afraid that the term final solution has bad connotations, but the solution is in the federation, and it has been done in good faith. I hope that it will be implemented in good faith. The same solution would be, and is going to be presented to the Serbs and offered to them for acceptance. This is all I can say about it. The draft constitution is already there, and is of course available in English. Thank you." An unidentified reporter asks whether the federation and confederation with Croatia allows the Serbs, or their republic, to confederate with Serbia, and Silajdzic says that "It is only natural that the Serbs live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I must remind you here that the whole federation concept is based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Within that, it is only natural that the Serbs, the Bosnian Serbs, have certain ties with Serbia. That is of course a matter for discussion at negotiations." Replying to the question as to when the confederation agreement could come in force, Izetbegovic says "After the solution to the entire issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, after the issue with the Serbian side is resolved. If that issue is not solved within a reasonable amount of time, then the sides will agree on whether to start the implementation of the confederation agreement. However, we will first try and find a solution with the Serb side in Bosnia- Herzegovina, that is, find a peace solution for the entire Bosnia." Izetbegovic then says that "I have proposed to President Tudjman that he come to Sarajevo, this invitation is in the works, and I think it will be sent out today. I do not know how you have already heard of it. This is this morning's decision. I think that it is high time President Tudjman came to Sarajevo. The invitation is to be sent out because we believe that it would be a step toward the implementation of the agreement. There are also certain practical issues that could be solved on that occasion between Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia. There are many such issues and that is why I believe that this visit will be useful." Asked to comment on the decision of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to end the work of the commission for the investigation of war crimes, Silajdzic says that "I have heard about the announcement by the secretary general that the commission would cease work. This is the war crimes commission. I do not know about any definite decisions, I only know about the announcement. I must say that it surprised all of us. War crimes are war crimes and cannot be [word indistinct] by investigations. War crimes cannot be ended by an administrative decision. Nobody has the right to forgive the war crimes in the name of the victims. It would be very unusual, and I think that it would set a precedent if the commission were to cease work investigating war crimes on account of a lack of funds. We are sure that the commission will continue to work, and the funds will be found for the commission to continue." Izetbegovic adds that "I could say here that the funds have already been secured by private sponsors, even though we do not think that this will be sufficient. The United Nations must continue to finance the commission. I am sure that the work of the commission will not cease regardless of whether the United Nations will continue to finance it. We will try and make sure that the United Nations continues to do so." Responding to a question regarding the solution to the issue of territories that have been ethnically cleansed or are under Croatian control, Silajdzic says that "The federation is based on universally known human rights, and the human rights are practically the main ingredient of the draft constitution, the main part of the draft constitution. The right of return is one of the rights that will be implemented in this federation. It is quite clear that all the people who have been expelled from their homes will have the right to return to their homes. The minimum that we can do for those who have suffered so much is to give back to them the basic right to return to their homes." Izetbegovic interrupts, saying that "I would only add here that the results of ethnic cleansing will be ignored in all solutions. All the information, and the draft constitution clearly says so, [changes thought] the demographic picture will be the picture represented at the census of 1991. Therefore no ethnic cleansing will be taken into account. There is a certain provision for that in the constitution." Silajdzic says "If I may add, human rights are placed immediately after the establishment of the federation. So before any division of responsibility between the federation, the government, and the cantons, before anything else, there are human rights. It is no coincidence, this is based on our conviction that what has happened in Bosnia is actually a savage and gross violation of human rights." A reporter asks whether there will be any government-imposed restrictions on the movement of the population after Sarajevo is opened, and Izetbegovic says that "there will be no restrictions except those that your government, too, would impose. Only persons against whom criminal charges have been brought will not be allowed to leave the city. I would like to stress that it was us, our government, who insisted that the roads be opened as soon as possible. We have demanded the opening of the southern road, the road that goes via Hadzici. The Serb side, however, was opposed to this. Therefore there will be no restrictions apart from the usual ones." The same reporter asks whether a "mass exodus" is expected once the city is opened, and Izetbegovic replies that "I expect that far more people will enter the city than leave it. We are afraid of problems connected to that, the program of accommodation, employment, food, and so on. No, we do not expect that the people will leave the city. However, we will not prevent anyone who wants to leave from doing so." Asked to comment on the fact that the United Nations have found a number of heavy weapons within the exclusion zone around Sarajevo, Izetbegovic says that "I have not received this morning's statement, but we know. I think that two or three times at these news conferences, you will remember, we have been pointing to the fact that there are still weapons within the exclusion zone. We have been pointing to these things. According to our information, there are a lot more of those weapons. I would like to remind you of a report we sent out some 15 days ago and, as far as I can remember, these weapons, these tanks, were mentioned there." Asked to comment on the fact that the Herceg-Bosna Representative Council has issued a statement that they would condition the federation agreement on the confederation agreement, Izetbegovic says that "There is a provision in the signed document that the confederal agreement would be elaborated on after the federation is implemented. As far as I know, that was also the view of the Croatian side during the negotiations. However, we do not exclude a different solution if an agreement is reached. I do not think that anything stands in its way except that, in our view, the problem of peace should be solved in Bosnia-Herzegovina prior to the establishment of the confederation. This has been the general view, to do that before entering the confederation with Croatia." Replying to a question on the protection of human rights, Justice Minister Trnka gives a detailed account of the provisions in the draft constitution regarding various courts that would be authorized to deal with such matters. Izetbegovic adds that "Apart from the court for human rights, there will be the institution of ombudsmen, which, by the way, originates from Nordic law, and these will naturally consist of local judges. However, during the transitional period, during the first four to five years, European and international judges will take part in the work of these bodies. They will be nominated by the CSCE and the International Court of Justice. Anyway, during the first five years, foreign judges will also participate in these bodies. Both institutions, the court for human rights and the institution of ombudsmen, will exist." Asked by a reporter about the territory of the future federation, Silajdzic says that "I think that, if I may say so, Article 1 says that the federation will consist of those territories with majority the Bosniak and majority Croatian populations. That is the definition of the federation. The definite maps will be drawn after we conclude the talks with the third side." Another reporter asks Izetbegovic what will happen if the referendum in Croatia rejects the confederation agreement, and Izetbegovic says that "If it is rejected and if, according to their laws and their constitution, a referendum has to be held, so if it is rejected, then there will be no confederation. The federation and the confederation are not linked. We have gone for both the agreements, however, from the legal point of view, these are not two connected things. The federation has been detailed, and it will become valid when the Assembly ratifies it. That is when it will become valid. As for the confederation, that depends on whether [words indistinct] and of course -- you asked me what if a referendum in Croatia rejects it -- there will be no confederation. However, the federation stays. The confederation is an agreement between two sovereign states." An unidentified reporter cites a statement by Ivan Bender, member of the Croatian delegation, that there can be no federation without the confederation, and Izetbegovic says that "Mr. Bender is not authorized to give such statements. That will be done by the relevant bodies. That is his personal view and we have to respect that, but he is not authorized. This is just the personal and individual view of Mr. Bender." Replying to a question on the future relations with the Serbs, Izetbegovic says that "we will start any talks with them, regardless of the options on offer and those accepted, with the demand for the return of the territories. I can repeat that, and I have said it before, we still stand on that position. Any talks with the Serb side, and of course we still do not know who will participate -- you know that there will be a Serb assembly on Sunday [26 March] -- we will wait for the results of this assembly before any talks. This assembly is a very important body, and it is an important event. Anyway, we will start any talks with them with the issue of returning territories, and the talks will develop depending on the response to that question. I would like to stress in connection with this Serb Assembly, that the Croatian assembly in Sarajevo on 6 February was a very important occasion in the things leading up to the Washington events." A correspondent asks whether there was any talk in Washington about the Government's minimal territorial demands, and Izetbegovic says that "there was no talk of that. I can only say that questions regarding maps did arise, particularly during the last meeting prior to our departure. That was only an exchange of views, not a demand for us to define our minimum. We repeated our demand that the territories had to be returned. I did not have the impression that such a demand was rejected or that it was met with disapproval."
