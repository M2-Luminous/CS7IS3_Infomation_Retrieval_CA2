According to her words, Alexander Vershobow expressed satisfaction with Prime Minister Moravcik's statement that the government would strive to calm down the political situation and with the government's determination to pursue a positive policy toward minorities. The talks were also attended by Ralph Johnson, coordinator of U.S. assistance to the countries of Central and East Europe. The two representatives voiced apprehension lest the interim nature of the present government unfavorably influence the government's economic policy and economic life become excessively politicized, especially during the election campaign. The Slovak deputy prime minister replied to this that the future government would undoubtedly be a coalition one and that some and, possibly, even all of the current coalition parties would probably participate in its formation. Therefore, it would be shortsighted of them to misuse economic power for their own political aims because they would have to bear the consequences for this after the elections. "This line of argumentation convinced the U.S. side," Schmognerova said. The subject of Brigita Schmognerova's talks with IMF Executive Director William Kieckens was the extension of a so-called standby credit to the Slovak Republic to reinforce its foreign-exchange reserves. The extension of the credit would at the same time be an expression of trust in [the government's] economic policy and an important signal for other financial institutions. According to Brigita Schmognerova, during its February visit to Slovakia, an IMF mission arrived at the conclusion that the fulfillment of one of the indicators for the provision of the credit--that the [budget] deficit not exceed 4 percent of gross domestic product--will be very difficult to achieve. It did not content itself with the previous government's assurances that this indicator would be achieved by tightening discipline regarding expenditures and proposed additional measures to meet this indicator, which, however, the previous government did not have time to approve. Brigita Schmognerova did not tell the TA SR correspondent that specific measures had been proposed. She only said that one part concerns the solution of the deficit and another the monetary program of the Slovak National Bank. "During the talks, we reached the conclusion that it is exceptionally important to achieve those indicators. If we are able to fulfill them by other measures [than those proposed by the IMF mission], however, the IMF will essentially accept that," Schmognerova said.
