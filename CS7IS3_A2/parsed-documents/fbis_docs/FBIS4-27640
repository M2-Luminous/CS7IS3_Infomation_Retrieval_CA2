"Only in this way will the wheels of government turn more smoothly and development move more quickly," the chief of state said Wednesday, 20 April, as he opened the 1994 National Coordination Conference (RAKORNAS) on Effectiveness of the State Apparatus at the State Palace in Jakarta. Yesterday's program was also attended by Coordinating Minister of Public Welfare Azwar Anas, Minister of Administrative Reform T.B. Silalahi, Minister of State for the Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman, Minister of State for Agrarian Affairs/Chief of the BPN [National Agriculture Board] Soni Harsono, and Minister of State for Women's Affairs Mien Sugandhi. The RAKORNAS, which is to last three days, is being attended by 250 people. They consist of secretary generals, secretaries to coordinating ministers, secretaries to ministers of state, secretaries of regional office affairs, deputies for administration, and chief of bureaus for organization, administration, and personnel. In that connection, President Suharto also underlined the coordination conference theme, which relates to the strengthening of discipline in the apparatus and improvement of service to the public. According to the chief of state, public services and discipline in the apparatus are two very important elements in the administration of government and development. A high level of discipline in the apparatus will raise the quality of management of governmental administration, and good quality of service will expand development opportunities for the people. Therefore, the president said he hoped that this meeting on effectiveness of the state apparatus will formulate operational actions for improving discipline in the state apparatus and improving the quality of service to the public. He also explained that the autonomy of second-level regions is an important part of efforts to expand public creativity and initiative, which are the key to the success of development during this takeoff era. "Therefore, all the issues related to the implementation of granting more extensive autonomy to second-level regions must receive maximum attention," the president said. Since 1974, he said, the government has made preparations for emphasizing the autonomy of second-level regions. On many occasions, the president has also asked that all echelons of the apparatus make preparations to create in second-level regions a regional autonomy that is tangible, dynamic, harmonious, and responsible. "Government regulations on government in the regions have also been prepared. In this coordination conference, I ask that all issues related to this implementation of autonomy receive maximum attention," the president said. As for modern management, the chief of state also pointed out that when he formed the Sixth Development Cabinet he stressed the need for modern management to support the implementation of PJP II. Such modern management, the president said, needs to be applied at the planning, implementation, and supervision stages. "This modern management needs to be detailed, analyzed, taught, and applied according to its principles in all government work units and offices," the president said. Civilian Employee Education and Training President Suharto also said that in the implementation of development up to now, the government has constantly tried to promote the career development of civilian government employees. The chief of state said he still sees some aspects of career development that need to be improved, however, particularly in the areas of employee education and training. The career of a civilian employee begins when the employee is accepted as a candidate employee. Because candidate employees come from a variety of sources, the process of teaching them and introducing them to the administration of government and development is intensive, he said. "What we have been doing, namely using the apprentice method, appears not to produce optimal results. Therefore, as a part of the selection process, candidate employees in the future must also receive mental and disciplinary preparation in their prejob training," the president said. The president also added that subjects taught, promotion procedures, and the quality of lecturers must also be improved so that civilian government employees will be truly ready to take up their increasingly heavy and complex duties. The president also instructed that other aspects of career development be studied very thoroughly. These include employee performance appraisal forms, selections for appointments, and transfers. Why? The president said, "Future duties require better quality government employees who possess professional capabilities, are full of enthusiasm to serve, and have high levels of discipline."
