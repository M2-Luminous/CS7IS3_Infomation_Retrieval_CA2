Welcome to the Mittagsmagazin, Herr Kinkel. Are lawyers getting involved in politics again? Or, to rephrase that question, does the Bundestag need such a supreme lawgiver? [Kinkel] We would have preferred it if the Bundestag had made the necessary decision, and I have pressed the Social Democratic Party [SPD] on this again and again. Unfortunately, the SPD blocked the decision. We need it; the coalition proposed a draft amendment to the Basic Law, but we need a two-thirds majority and we did not get it. That is why we had to come here. [Announcer] What argument did you make to the judges? You are caught in the middle, so to speak: the government you belong to on the one hand, and the Free Democratic Party [FDP], which wants something slightly different, on the other. [Kinkel] I am not caught in the middle at all, because politically it was clear between all of us that we want these three missions to go ahead. It was only with the AWACS mission [German personnel would crew AWACS reconnaissance aircraft over Bosnia] that the FDP parliamentary group had some doubts about whether Article 87A (2) or Article 24 of the Basic Law is the legal basis for this. That is the subject of the dispute here, and with such a difficult legal position it will be necessary, appropriate, and also possible to turn to the Constitutional Court. After all, that is what it is there for. But this morning I argued that we urgently need this amendment to the Basic Law, a ruling by the Constitutional Court, now -- because we could not reach such a ruling in the Bundestag -- so that we can become capable of action in foreign policy. The chancellor and I are the ones who suffer almost daily from this situation because our friends and partners do not understand why, after unification, we are still to a certain extent in the spectators' gallery and to an extent incapable of action. We must come on down, we must be able to help remove violations of human rights and alleviate the direst need in this world. It was not for nothing this morning that I pointed out that 80,000 UN soldiers from 68 countries are carrying out 16 missions all over the world. Germany cannot go its own way. It must get involved. [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, you also want the Bundestag to make majority decisions. Do you believe agreements would be reached then, for the discussion of this topic has been going on for a very long time? [Kinkel] We put forward a coalition draft proposal, which states that the German lower house should decide on any future mission. I am convinced that this would be the right thing. As regards the issue of majority decisions, this proposal says there should be a simple majority on peacemaking and peacekeeping measures. We hope we will soon hear what the Federal Constitutional Court has to say on this. [Announcer] What should the Bundeswehr be allowed to do then, quite specifically, without drawing down the anger of the world--not too much and not too little? [Kinkel] For the time being, the Bundeswehr's prime task will be defense. But the world has changed. We need peacekeeping and peacemaking measures--blue helmet missions. In isolated, exceptional cases we will also need to be involved in peacemaking measures because there are situations--and that is the way things are--which unfortunately require the use of force as the ultimate resort to end them. The Bundeswehr should be able to get involved in the future just as other armies in the world do. Remember what happened in Rwanda last week. It was strange that we had to give so much thought to whether we could possibly bring out our own people, the 11 personnel of Deutsche Welle who were trapped there. That is absurd. It cannot stay that way; we must become capable of action. [Announcer] Herr Kohl has said German soldiers should never go where German troops have been in the past. Defense Minister Ruehe does not take quite such a narrow view. What is your position? With whom would you tend to agree? [Kinkel] The chancellor is not talking in general terms, but specifically about Yugoslavia. I agree with him completely that, because of the historical situation, we would not achieve a Bundestag majority for the deployment of German troops there, even if we were constitutionally able to do so. This is an opinion I share. [Announcer] You are saying there should be no combat deployments. But should it not be possible to sanction legally what is already being done in practice? The Americans, who shot down four military jets over Bosnia, were directed toward their target by German servicemen. Wasn't that a combat mission? [Kinkel] That is the legal question I mentioned earlier, the matter of AWACS missions. It is true that a German was involved in operating the AWACS aircraft's flight guidance system. But the Constitutional Court permitted this, so to speak, through a temporary order, and this is what we want to see examined here. As regards AWACS deployment, the FDP's legal position differs from that of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union. This is why we need clarification. [Announcer] We should also discuss the current situation in Bosnia, Herr Kinkel. Bill Clinton is conducting defense policy discussions as we speak. He has said that he might alter his policy on Bosnia slightly, and he said this morning that he is looking for recommendations. What would you recommend or advise him to do? [Kinkel] As I repeated yesterday in Luxembourg, and I shall say it in Luxembourg again this evening, and yet again when I go to the United States the day after tomorrow, we are not the ones to be giving advice because our constitutional situation means we cannot become involved. You see, the main problem is simply that the situation could be resolved only by means of combat troops being deployed on the ground. None of the countries who are legally and actually capable of this are willing to do so, and I appreciate their reservations. Whenever someone here in Germany says something has to be done and we have to get involved militarily, I ask whether the Germans are willing to send their sons there. Until now, if I have gauged the public mood accurately, people are not greatly in favor of this, even if our constitution permitted it. This is why we are not the ones to be giving advice. By the way, just imagine, the French have 6,000 men on the ground, the British over 2,000; the Danish, the Belgians, the Dutch--all of them have troops there. And of course they want to ensure that these troops are not endangered by bombing missions. Gorazde has a specific situation: We have 60,000 encircled Muslims as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] people who are still there. You can imagine that air strikes would be extremely dangerous. The Americans have started looking at new options with the United Nations and NATO. Let's wait and see what happens. [Announcer] I think there is still plenty more talking to be done. Many thanks, Herr Kinkel.
