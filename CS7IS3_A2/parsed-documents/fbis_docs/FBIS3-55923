Commenting on the results of the Monday meeting with Latvian energy officials, Stasiukynas said the Latvian side expected to agree on the joint construction of a huge oil terminal in Liepaja, but all hopes failed when it became clear that the relief of the sea bottom near the Latvian port is unsuitable for the project. The minister said the future terminal in Liepaja would be quite small and would handle around 3 million tons of oil products each year. But the Latvian terminal could greatly contribute to regulating oil prices in Latvia and Lithuania, Stasiukynas said. Latvia intends to start building its terminal in spring and hopes to complete it by the end of the year. Separate talks will be held to discuss Lithuania's possible participation in the project. The earlier Lithuanian-Latvian protocol on oil terminal construction is void, the minister said. The official confirmed that the main designer of the Lithuanian terminal should be known in late January. Stasiukynas said Lithuania suggests Latvians to invest in the Butinge terminal and the step would mean that a joint project is carried out. International financial organizations previously pressured Lithuania to build a joint oil terminal, however the minister doubts whether Latvia would be willing to invest in Butinge.
