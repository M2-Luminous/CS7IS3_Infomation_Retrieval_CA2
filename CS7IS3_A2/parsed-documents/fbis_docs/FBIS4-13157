One sustained serious wounds and three sustained light injuries. Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that a 17-year-old Arab from East Jerusalem got on the bus in the Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood and attacked passengers with an ax. He was shot by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier, wounded, and captured. Our correspondent Ofra Nehmad reports that two of the casualties were wounded by shots fired by the soldier. The wounded were taken to Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital. An unidentified man called Qol Yisra'el's Arabic Department to announce that the terrorist belonged to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that there is a reasonable chance to conclude the negotiations with the PLO within several weeks. Rabin told a meeting of the coalition's Knesset factions that the evacuation from Gaza and Jericho will be short and will last two to three weeks. He stressed that Israel will not agree to the PLO continuing in the peace talks and at the same time reaching agreements with Hamas on attacks inside Israel. For us, that is the red line, the prime minister said. He noted that Israel acted in Cairo and in other places to foil such an agreement and will judge developments by results on the ground.
