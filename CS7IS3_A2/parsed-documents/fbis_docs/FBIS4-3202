All representatives to the meeting reached a consensus that enterprises' ideological and political work should be subordinated to and serve the whole party's overall work, which is guided by the principle of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability." Attending the five-day annual meeting were representatives of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities as well as relevant ministries and commissions. Also attending were more than 100 representatives from enterprises. They will study and exchange ideas, practices, and experiences concerning how to further strengthen and improve enterprises' ideological and political work under the new situation of building a socialist market economy. They will also amend the society's charter and elect directors for the new term to form a new leading organ. Xu Weicheng, deputy executive head of the Propaganda Department, presided over today's meeting. Yuan Baohua, chairman of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Society, gave a report at the meeting. He said: Exploring new ways to promote enterprises' ideological and political work is of very important significance in ensuring the smooth progress of enterprises' reform and the coordinated construction of material and spiritual civilizations. Yuan Baohua continued: As far as enterprises' ideological and political work is concerned, the current situation provides both opportunity and challenge. During the course of carrying out this year's reform, which is wide in scope and great in difficulty, some unexpected problems and some confused thinking might crop up. It is imperative for us to knuckle down to our ideological and political work, with a clear objective in mind. The publication of Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has provided us with most effective weapons for carrying out this task. Yuan Baohua emphatically said: The primary objective of this year's work is to ensure that enterprises will carry out the tasks of arming the whole party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to follow the mass line, carry out enterprises' democratic management, carry forward a hard working spirit, and combat negative and corruptive phenomena. Meanwhile, in the light of workers' ideological realities, we should try to find new ways to carry out this work under the new situation. To carry out our work in the new period, it is necessary to pay attention to spiritual civilization construction by fostering a correct outlook on life and sense of value among workers. Meanwhile, during the course in which state-owned enterprises are establishing and improving their leadership and making it consistent with the modern enterprise system, the party, government, and trade unions should focus on improving production and management and try to knuckle down to our ideological and political work in all aspects. While talking about the ideological and political work in our drive to change enterprises' management mechanisms, Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said: The drive to change the management mechanism requires us to use ideological and political work to stir workers' enthusiasm in participating in reform and to correctly handle the relationship between the concept of invigorating enterprises and that of straightening out their internal management, between the concept of workers becoming the master of the country and that of becoming good workers, between the concept of some people becoming prosperous first and that of achieving common prosperity, as well as between the concept of increasing labor productivity and that of increasing workers' incomes. He urged that enterprises' ideological and political work should be applied to the whole process of production and management. Self-education in various forms should be conducted among workers. In addition, ideological and political work should be institutionalized. In his speech, Xue Zhaoyun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions should concentrate on routine mass ideological and political work. At present, we should focus on two things: First, it is necessary to help workers enhance their understanding and adaptability to reform policies and methods. Second, we should solve contradictions in a timely fashion and help workers adjust various personal relations on the basis of mutual concern, understanding, and respect.
