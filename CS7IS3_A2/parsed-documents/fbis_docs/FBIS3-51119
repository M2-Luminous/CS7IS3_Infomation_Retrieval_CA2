"Cuba is maintaining absolute respect for something which has been the main feature of our foreign policy -- that the Mexicans may find the best solution to the internal problems which have developed at this time," Robaina added during a news conference shortly before starting on an official visit to Switzerland and five African nations. For the past six days at least 12 communities located throughout the Mexican State of Chiapas have been the scene of clashes between the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and government troops. With respect to reports appearing in the Chilean newspaper EL MERCURIO related to that country's government not reestablishing diplomatic relations with Havana before 21 March, the Cuban foreign minister pointed out that Cuba is not "impatient or proposing any date or deadline. "It is a decision that only the Chilean Government can make whenever it considers it convenient and we respect that," the Cuban minister stated. When asked about Cuba's presence at the new Honduran president's inauguration scheduled to take place on 27 January, Robaina indicated that his country had not yet been invited. Nevertheless, if there is an invitation, he indicated, Cuba will not be absent. "In any Latin American setting our country will not turn down an opportunity or an invitation," the Cuban minister emphasized. In reference to prospective relations between Cuba and the United States in 1994, Robaina believes that there will be no substantial changes. He added that even though Washington's tone toward Havana has been less aggressive, a more severe blockade is still in place. On the other hand, he mentioned new possibilities in political and economic ties with Europe, Latin American, and the Caribbean. The Cuban foreign minister said that "Cuba's situation is very difficult, but we are not at a dead end yet." Robaina believes that although 1994 will not entail any significant changes in the country's internal situation with respect to 1993, it may be that the [downward] spiral will begin to reverse.
