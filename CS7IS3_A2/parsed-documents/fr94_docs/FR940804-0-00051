FR940804-0-00051 FR940804-0-00022 Four commenters stated that the sequence in which sanctions apply should be reversed with the highway sanction generally applying first. Several of the commenters contend that the highway sanction will be more effective at compelling State correction of SIP deficiencies because it would have greater economic impact, and it will be more effective at addressing political and statewide failures. One commenter disagrees with EPA's rationale that the offset sanction is more likely to produce a greater air quality benefit, arguing instead that the highway sanction better encourages early State compliance. Several commenters challenge EPA's rationale that the offset sanction potentially applies to all criteria pollutants; the commenters argue that the fact that stationary sources emit more types of pollutants is irrelevant since, in the proposed rule, the offset sanction applies only to the pollutant(s) in the deficiency. The commenters also raise an argument that EPA's proposed sequence unfairly burdens industry when the SIP deficiency is State-caused and that sources will be unfairly penalized due to project location and timing. Four commenters believe that EPA should determine sanction order on a case-by-case basis. These commenters express concern that EPA's streamlined approach provides insufficient notice of sanctions and leaves many sanction application details unclear. One commenter argues that EPA should streamline its own rulemaking processes rather than deny notice to affected parties. These commenters were also concerned that general application of the offset sanction would negatively impact stationary sources. One commenter argues economic competitiveness and air quality will deteriorate under the offset sanction. Two commenters were concerned that because of the length of the EPA rulemaking process stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanction burden. Two commenters believe that the nature of the SIP deficiency should be considered in determining sanction sequence. One commenter believes that the sanction chosen should be linked to the SIP deficiency and that EPA must conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking to determine whether the highway sanction applies first as to specific types of SIP deficiencies. The commenter is concerned that stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanctions burden, and that this result could stifle economic development. Three commenters support the proposed sequence of sanctions. One commenter supports the position that the link between the highway sanction and air quality benefits is uncertain and another commenter agrees that the offset sanction provides a quantifiable and more likely air quality benefit. Another commenter supported EPA's concerns regarding the administrative and implementation burdens of the highway sanction as a basis for the offset sanction applying first.
