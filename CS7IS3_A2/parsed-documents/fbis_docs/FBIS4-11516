Melendez also condemned U.S. pressure on countries in the region to prevent Cuba from joining regional integration organizations in specific sectors such as tourism. In his address, Melendez stressed the deplorable health indexes of the continent, which have been aggravated by the imposed economic models. Regarding these models of commercial opening, complete privatization, and unregulated foreign investment, Melendez pointed out that 270 million people living in poverty is too high a figure for a population of 450 million people, in addition to distressing indexes of unemployment, infant mortality, and education, which brings to mind an endemic adjustment rather than a true recovery.
