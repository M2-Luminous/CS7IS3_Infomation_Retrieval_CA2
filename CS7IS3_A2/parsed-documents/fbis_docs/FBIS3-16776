As a result of this the most likely consequence will be the IMF's refusal to grant Russia the second part of the systematic credit of $1.5 billion. I remind you that the first part of the credit was given to Moscow in 1993. INTERFAX, quoting informed sources, reports that the main reason for the probable refusal is the deficit of almost 10 percent in the draft budget approved by the government. Sources claim that during the discussion and approval of the budget by the State Duma the deficit will grow even more. Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council's budget committee, commented on the possible refusal to grant the credit at the request of our radio station: [Begin Gonchar recording] I think that this is not the only reason that the talks with the IMF have ended as they have. In order for me to draw any conclusions I would have to look at more detailed documents, but I think that the main reason, from my point of view, is the fall in production. The fact is that inflation is caused by two things, and the main one -- as Yegor Timofeyevich Gaydar used to speak about at sessions of the former Supreme Soviet -- is the fall in production. From February 1993 to February 1994 production fell by 24 percent. I think that the defining factor was not the level of inflation, but the ability to overcome it. But I repeat again that this is a very serious document and needs deeper analysis. [end recording] At the same time this afternoon the Russian Finance Ministry and the IMF mission will renew their bilateral talks on offering the second part of the systematic credit in the context of the conditions put forward by the IMF's managing director, Michel Camdessus. INTERFAX was told this by a high-ranking spokesman in the Finance Ministry. The source refused to say exactly what these conditions are, but he noted that they, I quote, considerably complicate the progress of the talks. According to the source, on Sunday evening a meeting was held in the Finance Minstry at which the head of the IMF attached new conditions to the question of offering Russia $1.5 billion. Camdessus has not put forward such conditions previous to this meeting.
