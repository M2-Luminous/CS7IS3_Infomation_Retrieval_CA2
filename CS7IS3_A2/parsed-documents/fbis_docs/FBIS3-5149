Negotiations on revision of the election law, the political fund law and the local autonomy law resulted in an eleventh-hour compromise between the ruling and opposition parties earlier Friday. The revised legislation is expected to stand as a turning point for the establishment of "a new political culture" in this country, where politicians could engage in activities "that do not need money," as the slogan of the Kim Yong-sam administration goes. In a nutshell, politicians on both sides could compete on an equal footing from now on, unlike in the past when pro-government politicians enjoyed abundant campaign funds and strong organizations while oppositionists had to resort to demagoguery. In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) Thursday night, President Kim described the new political laws as "revolutionary" and said they are needed if Korea is to join the ranks of "advanced" nations in the true meaning of the term. The new election law provides punishment for parliamentary, gubernatorial, mayoral and local assembly candidates who spend more than the legally mandated amount during the permissible period of campaigning. The spending limit for a presidential candidate is 22.5 billion won, down from 36.5 billion won. A candidate for the National Assembly can spend up to 53 million won, down from 120 million won. The amount is smaller for candidates running for local office. An election will be nullified if a candidate spends more money than legally allowed or if a candidate's family or campaign workers are found to have violated the election law. Candidates convicted of violating the election law will be banned from running for elective office for 10 years. The new law abolishes the system of paid campaign workers and prohibits political parties from holding rallies during campaigning periods. Such rallies had served as occasions for bribing voters in the past. All candidates are required to disclose their personal assets. They are also allowed to make as many outdoor campaign speeches as they want. The political fund law allows an individual to contribute up to 150 million won to political parties, up from the current limit of 100 million won. The government's subsidy to political parties will rise to 800 won from 600 won per eligible voter. The revised local autonomy law stipulates that all four local elections be held at the same time. It also calls for increased allowances for local council members and their aides paid by the state.
