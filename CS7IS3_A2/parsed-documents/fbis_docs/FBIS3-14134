The successes and failures were not all similar and differences stemmed from the distinctive conditions prevailing in the respective countries. However, in 1372, the United States achieved nothing but overt defeat. The United States began this year with apprehension of the future, and a bleak outlook on its strategy for grappling with international issues in the aftermath of the Cold War. In the last days of the year, most of this trepidation persisted and Washington's quest for adopting a comprehensive stand and policy on international developments has failed. Last year, the U.S. Government's policy in foreign crises was the target of intense criticism at the domestic and international level. U.S. President Clinton's series of defeats in his interventionist policies in many countries served to undermine the people's trust and elicited the objections of the Congress against those who implement the country's foreign policy. What is certain is that the U.S. foreign policy in the aftermath of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union continues to be based on continued interference in the internal affairs of all countries and proliferation of this interference. This objective was pursued in the period when the Republicans were in power and has been continued by the Democrats. Regardless of the U.S. hostility toward the Islamic Republic of Iran, countries such as Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti were the main focus of the U.S. foreign policy activities. As regards Iraq, the United States ignores the rights of the people and continues its policy of constant pressure and the imposition of UN sanctions and has prevented all kinds of balanced solutions. The most conspicuous examples of the defeat of the U.S. interventionist policies can be more clearly perceived in countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. After a prolonged silence on the atrocities of the Serbs, and indifference toward the killing of 350,000 Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States sought to extricate itself from its political isolation by Europe and entered the fray. What motivated the United States to intervene was the emergence of conditions conducive to cooperation with Europe for implementing the covert plan for partitioning Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this purpose, the Serbs were threatened with a NATO air strike within a propaganda display on the one hand, and on the other, by means of suitable pretexts and with UN cooperation, the matter of any direct military intervention was ruled out. These actions by the United States brought new disgrace for the West and the United Nations both of whom profess to be defenders of the rights of the defenseless people of the world. Another manifestation of the perplexity of U.S. foreign policy was in Somalia. The United States entered the arena on the pretext of responding to the crisis on humanitarian grounds, but with the passage of time, the sinister motives of the United States in launching these operations were apparent to all. From the vantage point of the U.S. military echelons, the U.S. military presence in the Horn of Africa was a guarantee for controlling the crises in this vicinity that threatened its interests. However, with the resistance of the Muslim Somali people and the killing of U.S. soldiers, Washington woke up to reality and admitted to its vulnerability and the defeat of its policy in Somalia. This resulted in a withdrawal of 5000 U.S. soldiers from Somalia. In the crisis in Haiti, U.S. foreign policy suffered a worse fate as the efforts by the Clinton administration in the past year to reinstate deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and to convince the military rulers of the country failed. Initially, by coercion and in order to cover up the disgrace of its retreat from Somalia, the United States dispatched troops to Haitian shores. Right from the outset, it encountered the resistance of the people and the armed forces of that country. Ultimately, the United States forced the United Nations to reimpose an oil and arms embargo on the military government of Haiti. These sanctions were criticized vehemently by the people of Latin America. All these crises in 1372 exposed the effete nature of U.S. foreign policy in such a way that, for months after the Clinton administration took over, the fallout continued in the form of the American people worrying at the trend in U.S. foreign policy. Last year, a CBS television poll indicated that 61 percent of the Americans are apprehensive at the performance of the Clinton administration in foreign crises. On the other hand, the resignations by U.S. State Department officials are another reflection of these fears. Some congressional deputies even called for Warren Christopher's resignation as he did not have any answer for the failure of such interventions. In any case, facts and figures confirm that the current U.S. administration has no other recourse but to review the decisions and objectives of its foreign policy. As the WASHINGTON TIMES reported, Clinton has not been able to evolve a strategy for U.S. foreign policy in the first year of his presidency.
