He said to reporters on Wednesday that Yegor Gaydar's resignation as first deputy premier had not ended his political career. "We'll see him working in the Russian government some time in the future," Shumeyko said. He rejected the suggestion that Gaydar's resignation meant an end to the economic reforms. "Only Gaydar, Fedorov and Shumeyko have left the government," the rest of its members remaining in office, Shumeyko said. He said the recent reorganization had made the government more compact and potentially more efficient. "I hope this government stays in office until the new presidential election, prior to which it has to resign under the Constitution," he said. He did not rule out that the Russia's Choice bloc, headed by Gaydar, would come to be in opposition to the Chernomyrdin government. But this would only be clear after the government approved proposed amendments to its economic policy, he said. Shumeyko said the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov would not affect Russia's relations with its Western partners. But Russia is "a powerful sovereign state, which will not allow anyone to lecture it," he said.
