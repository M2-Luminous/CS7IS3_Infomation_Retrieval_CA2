So far, neither has made any moves toward compromise. However, some members of the Japanese group engaged in negotiations in Washington have begun to share a need for concession. Thus, hard-line officials -- mainly from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry -- have once again called for caution and warned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against giving too much consideration to the United States. Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, a diplomatic source in the United States said: "If the talks should break down, our efforts accumulated so far will go down the drain, and such a situation must be avoided." In this way, he maintained that due consideration should be given to the United States. His comments indicate that Japan should make concessions because the U.S. Congress is now moving toward submitting a bill on retaliatory measures against Japan. At the same time, the same source was also aware that the views of Japanese hard-liners must be taken into consideration, and said: "I am not saying that Japan should make unreasonable compromises. But what is important is that the talks must be brought to an appropriate settlement."
