Bulgaria advocates seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and has repeatedly declared its firm resolve not to intervene in any form in the events taking place in former Yugoslavia. At this critical juncture, any change in the Bulgarian position is absolutely impossible, Slatinski emphasizes in his letter. Nikolay Slatinski appeals to the president to employ his constitutional powers more resolutely with a view to achieving greater coordination and integration of the efforts of the political elite in the legislative and executive powers to defend the national position on the crisis in former Yugoslavia.
