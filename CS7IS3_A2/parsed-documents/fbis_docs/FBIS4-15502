FBIS4-15502 "drsov068_u_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Latvia Russian Envoy Gives Official Apology Russian Envoy Gives Official Apology LD0704214594 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1359 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704214594 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russian Ambassador in Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh extended in Riga Thursday Moscow's official apologies due to the "misunderstanding" around President Yeltsin's order to create military bases outside the Russian Federation. Earlier the news media said that by his order Yeltsin backed the initiative by the Russian Defense Ministry on the creation of military bases in the CIS countries and Latvia. Addressing on the same day a briefing in Riga, the Russian Ambassador admitted that there was "a technical mistake" which was detrimental to the Russian-Latvian relations and made difficult the political dialogue. Rannikh said that he had doubt about the origin of the document. He said that the Russian Embassy in Riga did not receive the official report from Moscow that the document was signed and was in force. He believes that Latvia's negative reaction to the document was caused by the tense situation caused by preparations being under way for the signing of the Latvian-Russian agreements on the Russian troop pull-out. Rannikh also confirmed that all problems associated with the pull-out and the conditions of the temporary deployment and status of the radar station in Skrunda were solved and the documents were initialed by the chief negotiators of the two countries on March 15. According to the agreement, the Russian radar in Skrunda is a Russian military facility which is under the civilian control and cannot be regarded as a military base.
