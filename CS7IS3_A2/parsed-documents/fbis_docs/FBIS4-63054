In his words, it often happens in Russia that someone hands in his resignation and it is not accepted. Mikhail Nikolayev also had some complaints about the concept of the state's nationalities policy developed under Sergey Shakhray's guidance and published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. According to Yakutia's president, he disagrees with the philosophy of this concept. First and foremost, Mikhail Nikolayev stated, the reason for his disagreeing lies in that the new Russian Federation Constitution defines the status of the republics comprising the Russian Federation as states, whereas Sergey Shakhray's concept reduces the level of former autonomous entities to the level of territorial components of the Russian Federation. "I cannot understand this," Yakutia's president stated. Nor is Yakutia's president happy about the fact that the concept takes no account of the rights of the indigenous peoples to these territories' natural resources. He thinks this is incomprehensible because the Constitution provides for a different arrangement for owning the natural resources of components of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Mikhail Nikolayev does not think Sergey Shakhray's departure is a tragedy. In his words, "everybody should calm down and work." "I am more worried about how to see through the shipping season in the polar seas, how to deliver cargoes, how to feed and clothe citizens of my republic rather than about the change of guard in the federal government, even in such a lofty position," Yakutia's president underlined. Bashkortostan President Murtaza Rakhimov stated in a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview that he regrets Shakhray's resignation if only because it was Sergey Shakhray who led the delegation during the talks between Moscow and Ufa on the signing of a bilateral Russian- Bashkirian treaty delimiting powers and jurisdictions. "Now I do not know who is going to head the Russian delegation," Bashkortostan's president underscored. He said it is not clear what is to become of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord which, incidentally, Bashkortostan's president backed in the December elections.
