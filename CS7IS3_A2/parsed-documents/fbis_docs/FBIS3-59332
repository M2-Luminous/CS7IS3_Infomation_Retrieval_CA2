How can modern enterprises be established? Liu Guoguang, a noted Chinese economist and vice president of the China Academy of Social Sciences, comprehensively elaborated his views and opinions on these questions this morning during a colloquium jointly sponsored by the provincial government general office and research center. Liu Guoguang pointed out that the modern enterprise system differs from the conventional state-owned enterprise management mechanism in six aspects: 1) It operates on the basis of clearly defined property right relations; 2) it is characterized by the separation between government administration and enterprise management; 3) it is characterized by diversified investments; 4) it is run to achieve a single objective--the very function and target of modern enterprises is to make profit; 5) it practices limited liability management; and 6) it pursues the principle of survival of the fittest and lets enterprises operate under a competitive mechanism. Liu Guoguang also presented his opinions on the ongoing project to introduce the company system into state-owned enterprises and on other supporting reforms as well. Executive Vice Governor Lu Ruihua presided over the colloquium today.
