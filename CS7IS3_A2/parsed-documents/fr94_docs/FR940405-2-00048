FR940405-2-00048 FR940405-2-00024 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;184&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Compliant March 30, 1994. Take notice that on March 23, 1994, JMC Power Projects 1 filed with the Commission a complaint against Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee). 1 JMC Power Projects include Ocean State Power, Ocean State Power II, Selkirk Cogen Partners, L.P., Masspower and Altresco-Pittsfield, L.P. JMC Power Projects request that the Commission find it to be unjust and unreasonable for Tennessee to continue to collect from JMC Power Projects the volumetric surcharge component of Tennessee's Order Nos. 500 and 528 take-or-pay recovery mechanism. JMC Power Projects states that as a result of Order No. 636&hyph;A, JMC Power Projects do not receive the benefits of service granted to them in Tennessee's so-called ``Cosmic Settlement'' Orders 2 or to system customers served under part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. JMC Power Projects assert that absent Commission action in this proceeding, they will be forced to continue paying, without concomitant benefit, volumetric take-or-pay surcharges imposed upon them by the Cosmic Settlement Orders. 2 See Tennessee, 59 FERC ¶61,045 (1992), reh'g 59 FERC ¶61,361 (1992). JMC Power Projects request the Commission to find that, as section 7(c) shippers receiving no benefits of service under part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, and in light of the precedent established in KN Energy, 3 JMC Power Projects should be exempt from contributing to Tennessee's part 284 volumertic take-or-pay surcharge. 3 KN Energy, Inc. v. FERC, 968 F.2d 1295 (DC Cir. 1992). Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 29, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 29, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8099 Filed 4&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
