According to the summons issued by the Ministry of Justice Palace on 5 Dey [26 December] for 'Abbas Salimi-Namin, managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the trial is scheduled for 1000 on 8 Esfand [27 February] this year at Tehran Penal Court 2, Branch 199. In this summons, the charge against the managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I is said to be "publishing lies." Sa'idi-Sirjani began his complaint against KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's managing director in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], when an article criticizing his writing in the newspaper ETTELA'AT was published in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. Investigation of this case was begun in earnest at that time by the Ministry of Justice. The managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been summoned several times to give explanations to the public prosecutor, and according to the most recent summons, his trial is to begin in the month of Esfand. After questioning the managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I and listening to his explanations, the special investigator for this case determined that Sa'idi-Sirjani's claim could not be pursued and announced that the investigation of the case was closed, but the Tehran deputy prosecutor canceled the investigator's opinion and reopened the case. Sa'idi-Sirjani is among those who are interviewed on foreign radio programs such as the BBC and the Voice of America, usually about cultural, social, and sometimes political matters, and his writing is published in Persian-language newspapers published abroad.
