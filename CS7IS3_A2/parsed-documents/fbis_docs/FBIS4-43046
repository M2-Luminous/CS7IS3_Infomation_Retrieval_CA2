"We are determined to continue our coalition with the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]," Kinkel stressed at noon today after committee meetings of the Liberals in Bonn. He assumed that the FDP would "double" its Sunday [12 June] result at the Bundestag elections and that the coalition with the CDU/CSU could continue after 16 October. The presidium and the executive had agreed that blaming individuals within the FDP would not help anybody. The party now had to concentrate on clarifying its policies to the people.
