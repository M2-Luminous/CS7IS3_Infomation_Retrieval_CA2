Alfredo Diaz Urbay, director of the Labor Research Institute, told PRENSA LATINA that by January the State Committee for Labor and Social Security [CETSS] had received 156,828 applications for permission to do this type of work. According to the decree, in force since the second half of 1993, 136 forms of self-employment are allowed, he said. Diaz Urbay also said that over 70 percent of the authorized persons practice less than 20 percent of the activities permitted, particularly the following: craftsmen, coachmen, carpenters, barbers, handcart drivers, and manicurists. He said that 76.9 percent of the permits have been issued to males. Of those receiving permits 35.5 percent work, 27 percent are retired, 19.7 are jobless, and 16.7 percent are housewives. According to the document, the regulations are established by two state committees -- labor and social security, and finance. The former issues the permit for self-employment and the latter collects, because these persons must pay for their permits, thus helping bolster the state's treasury. State finance committee sources have reported that Cuban authorities are studying the implementation of a general tax system which, if approved, would include the self-employed. The production of various crafts, which makes it possible for the Cuban population to buy minor articles, particularly for domestic and decorative purposes, has been observed to increase since the State Council decree was enacted. The current conditions of the so-called special period in time of peace, a stage of serious economic crisis after the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union, Cuba's main commercial partners, and the aggravation of the U.S. embargo determined the need to expand the opportunities for self-employment.
