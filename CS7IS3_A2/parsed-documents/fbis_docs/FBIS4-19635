The prime minister said if a settlement to the Kashmir dispute is achieved, all other issues between Pakistan and India will also be resolved. Referring to the 20-percent increase in the Indian defense budget, the prime minister said it is basically aimed at crushing the freedom movement in occupied Kashmir. Nevertheless, this increase has also put pressure on Pakistan to take appropriate steps to deal with any threat to its security. The prime minister said Pakistan had made several proposals to India for mutual reduction of forces, for reducing defense expenditure, for preventing nuclear proliferation and an arms race, and for resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India has not demonstrated any positive reaction to any of these issues. Referring to internal affairs, the prime minister said her government has granted several concessions that ensure extensive opportunities to foreign investors in Pakistan. She said all foreign investors are totally safe in Pakistan, as the benefit of nationalizing institutions in the current age of market economy has ended. German investors can play a dominant role in Pakistan's development. The prime minister said Pakistan's territory is extremely attractive and profitable for investors as its economy is progressing toward stability. The country is replete with natural resources and the best business opportunities are available here due to its location in an important region of the world.
