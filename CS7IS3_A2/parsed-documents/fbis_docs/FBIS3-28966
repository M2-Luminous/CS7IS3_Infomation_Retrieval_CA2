What really transpired in Subic, and what did you discuss with the president of Taiwan? [Ramos] [passage omitted] It was not an official visit; we did not talk about political matters, but we concentrated on trade and economic cooperation because that is allowed under the one-China policy. And why shouldn't I take advantage of that stopover, a very brief one about three hours, of the president of Taiwan, in as much as they are the biggest potential investors in Subic. They have already contracted for 300 hectares in which they will put up 150 factories, and we will open up this area on 20 February. And for the purpose of developing that industrial site area, the Taiwanese have arranged for a soft loan to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority under Chairman Dick Gordon, amounting to $23 million dollars, but that can be expanded to $100 million later on between the next couple of years depending on how fast there's a need for that loan. At the same time, we, on the part of the Philippine Government, we are putting in our appropriations there, which is called for there at the BCDA Law, the Bases Conversion Development Authority Law which includes Clark. Now, as for those investments in Subic, another important matter we discussed is the joint ventures in agribusiness. This is an offshoot of what we just discussed with Ben Jochico [journalist in Bacolod City] in regard to sugar. It was quite very clear to me that the Taiwanese would want to contribute agricultural expertise as well as capital into the Philippines to develop joint ventures in agriculture so that at least they will have a nearby source of food products coming out of this joint ventures, because joint ventures allow them to produce at minimal cost. So I said that, by all means, we have the land and the farm labor available, and these are readily available in the northern part of Luzon, which is nearest to your country. [sentence as heard] But they are available elsewhere in the Philippines, and there is already a very active Taiwanese business group here, they have their own chamber of commerce. That could be the vehicle for the acceleration of this kind of partnership. [passage omitted]
