Joining a group discussion with deputies from Hainan Province to the National People's Congress (NPC), Li Peng said that in the process of reforms, it is necessary to discover problems and promptly solve them. Li Peng also heard today a group discussion by NPC deputies from Jilin Province. Hainan deputies raised proposals on strengthening the island province's infrastructure, developing its rubber industry and exploiting its marine resources. Li Peng said Hainan, as China's largest special economic zone, has made remarkable progress in reform and open policy implementation and is one of China's most promising areas. He expressed the hope that Hainan would make use of its advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken infrastructure development. The premier also emphasized the importance of maintaining a high ethical standard in Hainan, China's largest special economic zone. With the Jilin group, the premier heard deputies speaking on enterprise reform, grain production, the opening of border areas, and the introduction of a share-holding system for enterprises. On improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, Li Peng said it is necessary to give them support by way of introducing reform measures. "But, fundamentally speaking," the premier said, "enterprises should rely on themselves to find markets for their products and to improve their performance through technical renovation and scientific management." After he left the Jilin delegation, Li Peng met with and spoke to deputies from Fujian Province. Speaking of uneven economic development within Fujian, he said the province should make efforts to narrow the gap between developed Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou and its backward northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common prosperity.
