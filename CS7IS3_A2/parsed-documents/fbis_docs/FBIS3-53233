Selva Raja] [Text] The armed forces have been alerted following secret reports received by the Military Intelligence Unit stating that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] are preparing to attack the Karainagar naval base and the Oorkavalturai and Mandaitivu Army camps. In its report, the Military Intelligence Unit has stated that after the destruction of the Nagathevanturai naval base, the next LTTE target will be the Karainagar base. The Tigers took six high-speed boats called water jets from the Nagathevanturai base. They also have two more boats of this type. Defense authorities are anticipating an attack on the Karainagar and Kankesanturai units. Navy gun boats and ships have been kept in readiness in Paruthiturai and Kankesanturai territorial waters to repel an LTTE attack. Some night infiltration by extremists was detected on Oorkavalturai island. Recently two extremists were shot dead for landing on the island. Therefore, the armed forces are kept in combat readiness on the islands, which are under the control of the Army. Meanwhile, new Army commander Major General Gerry De Silva is going to take command on 1 January. Defense experts predict that during De Silva's tenure, there may be major changes in the Army. Tamil political circles say that one has to wait and see whether he will adopt the policy of confrontation followed by outgoing Lieutenant General Cecil Waidyaratne, or encourage negotiations. Meanwhile, local elections are going to be held in the Eastern Province and Vavuniya. Nomination papers have been invited for this purpose. It is a different matter that the announcement for the elections has triggered strong protests among the Tamil parties. Reports from Jaffna say that President Wijetunge's announcement to launch an `operation' [preceding word in English] in the north after these elections has created a major stir in the LTTE circles. The president's announcement indicates that a major offensive will be launched against the LTTE. In Jaffna, the Tigers have announced that the speeches made at last week's United National Party Conference indicate that according to the president's plan, a major offensive against the LTTE in Jaffna is planned for February. They have also announced that they are not ready for any talks, their doors are closed for negotiation, and they are also prepared for the war. The Tigers adopted the path of confrontation after former President J.R. Jayewardene announced that the government was prepared for either war or peace. Jayewardene's announcement followed the death of 13 soldiers in the landmine blasts at Tirunelveli in Jaffna in 1983. Thousands of soldiers were killed within 10 years and tens of thousands of people became refugees. Saying that today's problem is only terrorism and not ethnic strife, the present president has announced that he is going to give surgical treatment [chathira chikichai] to the north. Tamil political leaders say that in the future, everyone will understand the connotations of the announcement. Meanwhile, the government is seriously thinking about declaring the northern area to be a war zone. It is learned from highly reliable sources that Wijetunge has asked the three armed forces chiefs to be ready for a major conflict in February and to devise a strategy for his consideration before the 4 February holiday. It is certain that a major offensive will be undertaken in the north after the next independence day. Reports from Jaffna suggest that the Tigers are getting ready for a major conflict after their offensive in Pooneryn. The Tigers have constituted hundreds of suicide squads to counter the war to be undertaken by the government in the north. Reports say that the Tigers are planning to deploy many more suicide squads than they deployed against the Army's Yaldevi operation and for their Frog Leap operation launched to overrun the Pooneryn and Nagathevanturai army and naval bases. In any case, after the local elections in Eastern Province and Vavuniya, a major military offensive is certain in the north. The security force officers in Eastern Province and Vavuniya have already been directed to see that the Tigers do not infiltrate the areas where polling will take place during the elections. In the new year, the election process will be set in motion, but the leader of a popular Tamil political party has announced in Colombo that no political party with any self-respect will take part in the elections. Whatever is the case, there will no surprise even if the new year is declared as a year of war.
