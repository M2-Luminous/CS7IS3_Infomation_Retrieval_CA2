In his view, "the political forces that have proclaimed the secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine and its merger with the Russian Federation have now gained power in the autonomous republic." He believes that the Crimean leaders have chosen two routes. The first is the adoption of a constitution that proposes to proclaim the Crimean autonomy an independent state, and the second is to restore the old Soviet Union, which is impracticable. He believes that the conclusion should be unambiguous: The Crimean issue ought to be solved only in the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, the president stressed. "We must do it," Leonid Kravchuk said. He made the proposal to immediately form the Ukrainian Constitutional Court, which should repeal all decisions of the Crimean parliament and president contradicting the laws of the Ukrainian state. He also proposed making amendments and addendums to the Ukrainian Constitution, to the law on demarcation of powers between the Ukraine and the Republic of the Crimea, in which it is to be clearly defined that the Crimean autonomous entity is the territory of the Ukrainian state. In the opinion of the president of Ukraine, all power ministries of the Crimea should also be subordinated to Kiev. It is also important to settle budgetary relations. "Now we must take the most radical measures to stabilize the situation, because the consequences could be even worse," Leonid Kravchuk stressed. And this needs to be done in the framework of the Constitution, be believes.
