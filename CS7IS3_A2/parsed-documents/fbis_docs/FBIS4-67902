This was the third test of the two-stage missile. Agni was first successfully tested in May 1989 and the second partially successful test took place in April 1992. Possessing a potential range of over 2,000 km, the Agni is India's first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM). Described as a ``technology demonstrator,'' the missile can deliver one tonne payload. This is twice the estimated weight of nuclear warhead and the success means that India can deliver a nuclear strike if it chooses to weaponise. The focus of the launch was to guide better end more accurately, a sophisticated re-entry vehicle or the warhead of the missile. ``Other gains are incidental,'' says a highly placed source at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). But, Saturday's test is also expected to prove an extension of the missile's range, though no confirmation on this count is as yet available. Experts account the 19 tonne weight of the missile, which is five tonnes more than the weapon tested in 1989, primarily due to the excess fuel it is carrying. This would be translated to an extended range, it is presumed. The 21-metre Agni tested on Saturday is also longer in comparison to the weapon launched in 1989. The Agni on its maiden flight had measured 19 metres. While modifications on the warhead are possible, prelaunch indications suggested that the re-entry vehicle is of a manoeuvering type. Small fins were attached at the base to facilitate the warhead's movement. Challenging Task Controlling the flight path of the re-entry vehicle is a particularly challenging task. The warhead which moves towards the target at a rapid speed crosses the earth's atmosphere. Making the warhead withstand the high temperatures (around 3000 degree Celsius) it encounters poses a major challenge to scientists. Keeping the warhead stable during this phase is also vital. One of the unique features of the Agni re-entry vehicle is its heat shield. A carbon-carbon composite heat shield enables it to withstand temperatures 5,000 degree Celsius. In addition, the heat shield is ablative. It melts and chars and its outer layers peel off. It takes away the heat, layer by layer. Guiding the warhead is also difficult because the vehicle during its final phase can be jammed. However, DRDO scientists have discounted this possibility. Apparently Agni's re-entry vehicle resembles the Pershing II warhead. The guidance technology on the Pershing II is so accurate that the warhead lands within 45 metres of the target area. Two-Stage Configuration The Agni posses a unique two-stage configuration. While the missile is hurled into space by a solid fuel booster, the liquid fuelled second stage leads missile warhead to its predesignated target. With premium on accuracy, the choice of a liquid second stage was deliberate. DRDO scientists, under whose overall supervision the missile programme is being carried out, agree that the first stage rocket is based on an indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3) design. The liquid fuel stage is based on the Prithvi design. But auxiliary propulsion is added to the missile to enable it to fly higher.
