Choegyal, member of the Chinese delegation to the 50th session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said that the Chinese Government regards the equality and solidarity of all nationalities and the practising of regional national autonomy as basic principles in dealing with minority nationalities issue. He briefed the participants on China's minority nationalities policy, saying, "the adherence to the equality of all nationalities is a basic principle stipulateed in China's Constitution." "In China, all nationalities, irrespective of their differences in population size, level of social and economic development, customs and practices, religious beliefs and languages, enjoy equal status and equal rights," he said. As China is a country with 56 nationalities, he said, the Chinese Government always pays great attention to the strengthening of solidarity and harmony among them. "The government has always been careful with the protection of the rights and the interests of minority nationalities," he said. "In dealing with such issues, the views of the nationalities concerned are extensively solicited and full consultations conducted." "The government also adopts laws as well as concrete measures in order to guarantee participation by minority nationalities in the management of state and local affairs in various aspects of social life," he added. In addition, as certain gaps still exist in economic and social development between areas inhabited by minority nationalities and those inhabited by the Han nationality due to historical, natural and geographical factors, "the Chinese Government has always emphasized the importance of providing necessary financial, human and material assistance to them," he said. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government always grants them preferential policies in formulating programs for national economic development. It also requires and encourages the better-developed areas to help them, he added. The Chinese delegate also stressed that regional national autonomy is an important aspect of the political system provided by the Constitution. "The system has played an important role in protecting the rights of the minority nationalities and in promoting the development of these areas," he said. The Chinese delegate pointed out that China's minority nationalities policy has proved to be successful in the past 40 years.
