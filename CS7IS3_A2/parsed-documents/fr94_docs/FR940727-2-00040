FR940727-2-00040 FR940727-2-00025 4. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondent to divest any of the Schedule A Assets, as provided in the Consent Order, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief for any failure to comply with the Consent Order or this Agreement, or in any way relating to the Acquisition, as defined in the draft complaint, respondent shall not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondent also waives all rights to contest the validity of this Agreement. 5. To the extent that this Agreement requires respondent to take, or prohibits respondent from taking, certain actions that otherwise may be required or prohibited by contract, respondent shall abide by the terms of this Agreement or the Consent Order and shall not assert as a defense such contract requirements in a civil penalty action brought by the Commission to enforce the terms of this Agreement or Consent Order. 6. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege, and upon written request with reasonable notice to respondent made to its principal office, respondent shall permit any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission: a. Access during the office hours of respondent and in the presence of counsel to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of respondent relating to compliance with this Agreement; b. Upon five (5) days' notice to respondent, and without restraint or interference from respondent, to interview officers or employees of respondent, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters. 7. This Agreement shall not be binding until approved by the Commission. Analysis of Proposed Consent Order Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, a proposed consent order from Healthtrust Inc._The Hospital Company (``Healthtrust''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Healthtrust's proposed acquisition of three hospitals from Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross'') would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, if it had been carried out. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order. Both Healthtrust and Holy Cross own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals in the Salt Lake City area, encompassing Salt Lake County and southern Davis County; and the Salt Lake City_Ogden Metropolitan Statistical Area, an area encompassing three contiguous counties in northern Utah: Weber County, Davis County, and Salt Lake County (``Three-County Area''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. According to the complaint, Healthtrust owns and operates Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful (in southern Davis County) and Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City (in Salt Lake County). Holy Cross owns and operates St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden (in Weber County), and two acute care hospitals in Salt Lake County, Holy Cross Hospital in Salt Lake City, and Holy-Cross-Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan. The consent order, if finally accepted by the Commission, would settle charges that the acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. The complaint alleges that Healthtrust and Holy Cross are competitors in those markets. The hospital markets in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area, according to the complaint, were already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.
