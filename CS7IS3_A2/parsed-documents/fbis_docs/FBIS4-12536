Narasimha Rao will visit the United States in May to resolve the complexities in Indo-U.S. ties centering on the Kashmir issue and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty by holding summit-level talks. The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr. Sidharata Shankar Ray, will arrive in New Delhi on 2 April to finalize the date for Rao's visit. Earlier, Indian officials held that it would not be proper for Rao to visit Washington as the Clinton administration was exerting too much pressure on the Kashmir and Punjab issues. These officials gained confidence after the defeat of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution on Kashmir in Geneva and advised Rao to go ahead with his proposed trip to the U.S. Apart from exerting pressure on India on the human rights situation in Kashmir, the Clinton administration is also raising the Punjab issue which New Delhi no longer acknowledges is a problem. President Clinton is doing things that have not been done by the former U.S. presidents. He is responding to letters written by any Sikh militant and has already replied to the letters from two of them. Washington is also pressuring New Delhi to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and all these have become a cause of headache for India. New Delhi's ties with the Democratic Bush administration was very cordial but it is not the same with the Clinton administration. India did not expect Clinton to become the President. India cannot match even somewhat the intense Pakistani propaganda in Washington; and the favorite issue is human rights for the Democratic senators, who regularly raise a hue and cry over the human rights situation in Kashmir, China, Iran, and other countries. This issue is the main obstacle that has prevented the United States from granting the most favored nations status to China. Hence, there is no reason to believe they will easily stop raising the human rights question in Kashmir. There has been a diplomatic victory in Geneva, but the United States did not support any side. Indian officials believe that had America exerted pressure, it would not have been necessary for China or Iran to appear in the field. In that case, Pakistan would not have gone so far. The U.S. silence over this issue is a cause of worry for India. Solarz is not willing to become the U.S. ambassador to India due to pressure from the Clinton administration, causing a great setback for India. It is well-known that Solarz has a soft spot for India. Under these circumstances, the Indian officials feel that Rao should go to Washington to express India's feelings. They are confident that the talks between President Clinton and Rao would be successful like the latter's earlier talks with the British prime minister, John Major, and the German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. It is for this reason that the Indian ambassador to Washington, Sidharta Shankar Ray, has been summoned to New Delhi. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has again commented on the human rights situation in India. This time the concern has been voiced not by Robin Raphel but the Secretary of State Warren Christopher before the subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives over the situation in Punjab and Kashmir. According to reports from Washington, in reply to Democratic Congressman James P. Moran, Christopher said a clear difference of opinion exists between New Delhi and Washington on the two issues of human rights and nuclear nonproliferation. He said, "In fact, concern over the human rights situation in Kashmir and Punjab has not yet been allayed." Christopher also did not hesitate to praise India. In his words "the United States has traditional and friendly ties with India. We want that this relationship to strengthen further. We have very high opinion of India. Unlike other friendly countries, U.S.-India ties are not totally free of problems. The two spheres where difference of opinion exists is human rights and nuclear nonproliferation." The U.S. Secretary of State is confused over India's nuclear programs. Referring to India's first underground nuclear test in 1974, Christopher said India might have acquired nuclear capability in the meantime. This is also applicable in the case of Pakistan. The U.S. wants nuclear research programs conducted by these two countries for military purposes to be kept within a certain limit. Christopher evaded the question on why the ban that has been imposed against Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment has not been imposed on India also. However, he said he would reply to this question later. The complexities regarding the appointment of the U.S. ambassador to India has increased. Solarz who had been identified as the next U.S. ambassador to India has stepped aside realizing the attitude of Clinton administration officials. Solarz became aware of this attitude after he held talks with the U.S. vice president, Albert Gore, last Thursday [10 March] and earlier with the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and his assistant, Sandy Berger. These three people hinted to Solarz that his chances of being nominated as ambassador were thin. Solarz later withdraw his candidacy. Experts believe that despite the great publicity that Solarz did not get the ambassador's job because he is very sympathetic to India. Recently, Warren Christopher, announced that Solarz would be made ambassador to India. He added that the announcement of his appointment had been delayed due to procedural formalities. Earlier, Solarz had been accused for his alleged involvement in providing visa to a Hong Kong businessman. Later, he was acquitted of the charge after an FBI inquiry. The middle-level officials of the U.S. State Department are against the appointment of Solarz as ambassador as he is close to President Clinton.
