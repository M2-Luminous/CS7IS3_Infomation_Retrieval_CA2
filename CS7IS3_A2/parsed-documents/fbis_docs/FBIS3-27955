The package includes expanded investment in public works, increased investment in housing construction, and the easier acquisition of land, with the scale of projects in these three areas alone exceeding 8 trillion yen (Y). The government and the ruling coalition parties are now making final adjustments on the pending question of how large the cuts in income and residential taxes should be and where the revenues to cover the shortfalls arising therefrom should come from. They are seeking a conclusion on this by 2 February. As far as the question of whether to increase the consumption tax rate as a source of revenue is concerned, however, they plan to ask Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to make a political decision. With all the measures combined, the total package is likely to surpass Y14 trillion in scale, the largest ever in history. The comprehensive economic package is in the process of being finalized under a schedule of the coalition parties announcing their proposal on the morning of 3 February and the government announcing its final proposal on the evening of the same day. The draft version of the announcement on the economic package says in its preface that the nation needs the greatest possible measures to put the chaotic economy back on track as quickly as possible in 1994. This is necessary for the country to attain stable growth in 1995 and thereafter, and to take up the midterm tasks in preparation for the advent of the aged-population society, it adds. A main point of the package is that a total of Y4 trillion worth of projects -- including the advanced acquisition of public-use land -- will be undertaken to expand public works investments. These include Y2.9 trillion in public works projects and Y300 billion in independent regional projects. In the area of improving facilities, emphasis will be given to those related to education, research, medical care, and social welfare -- to attain an improvement in people's lives and the infrastructure for research and development. With respect to the tax system concerning housing construction, whereas at present the housing loan tax applies to those earning more than Y20 million and building a house whose floor space exceeds 240 square meters, such a rule will be abolished over a certain period. In addition, to make land transactions easy, the "tax to promote the efficient use of land" will be introduced. Under the new taxation system, if someone who has owned land for more than five years wants to sell it for use in a good-cause project needed for the development of cities and towns, he can have his tax on transfer profits reduced to 20 percent (from the current 39 percent). In the case of corporations, an additional 10 percent in corporate taxes will no longer apply. As for the efficient utilization of land, the package proposes appropriating additional project funds through establishing a special account for road construction and a special account for city development fund loans. It also proposes that the government pay interest on loans to buy land now owned by the Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation and to purchase farmland within city limits.
