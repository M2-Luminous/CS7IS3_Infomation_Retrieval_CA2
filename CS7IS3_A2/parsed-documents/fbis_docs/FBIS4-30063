SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that talks with Hata did not bear fruit because sessions between the two sides over policy pacts are still continuing. Coalition parties and the SDP, which are holding talks toward forming a policy agreement, could not find any middle ground in their reconciliation talks that would pave the way for the SDP to rejoin the alliance, official sources said. Although Hata indicated Thursday that his minority cabinet would resign en masse, a condition the SDP has demanded for returning to the fold, off-and-on sessions between the two sides aimed at achieving a policy accord before forming a new coalition, hit an impasse over differences on tax reform, the sources said. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters the party cannot immediately agree on the tax reform issue, including a hike in the current 3 percent consumption tax rate. The coalition sought an SDP agreement to specify the size of the hike, but the socialists, who objected to the introduction of the tax, rejected the request. The minority coalition and the SDP will continue to discuss the matter Friday, the sources said. On Hata's remarks that he is ready to step down with all his cabinet ministers, Kubo said he takes the statement seriously and urged Hata to resign voluntarily en masse. At a press conference after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget cleared the Diet, Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband his cabinet if it is necessary to bring the SDP, a primary force in the previous coalition administration led by Morihiro Hosokawa, back to the camp. The House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee, meanwhile, failed to set the timetable for the lower house to hold a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet, which was submitted Thursday by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has said the minority administration does not reflect people's views. The LDP, which was ousted by the coalition last August after dominating Japanese politics for 38 years, demanded that the lower chamber take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion on Friday but the coalition opposed it, saying talks with the SDP are continuing, the sources said. It depends on SDP members whether the no-confidence motion passes the lower house, they said.
