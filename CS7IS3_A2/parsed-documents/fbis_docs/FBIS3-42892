In any case, this is what he himself claims. In the words of Zavidiya, he only cooperated with the LDPR (within the scope of his own political projects) and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, with whom the president of the Galand concern had "friendly relations" for a long time. However, the cooperation between the concern and the LDPR ended after a dispute that took place during the election campaign, and Andrey Zavidiya now intends to engage in political activity independently. In his words, his acquaintance with Mr. Zhirinovskiy took place in November 1990. The president of the Galand concern was attracted by the program of the LDPSS [Liberal-Democratic Program of the Soviet Union], "which had nothing in common with his (Zhirinovskiy's) current views." Later, Zavidiya appeared together with Zhirinovskiy in the presidential elections in 1971. He insists that in 1993 he did not finance Zhirinovskiy's party, but his own campaign. In Zavidiya's words, he was officially placed on the party election rolls, presented to the Central Electoral Commission, and as a candidate was given an officially stamped certificate. However, a little later Zavidiya was crossed off the rolls in violation of all procedural norms. However, according to Zavidiya's claim, during all of the time of cooperation "not a single kopek, in the sense of transmitting money or giving it to someone from the LDPR, was transferred. Galand concern enterprises paid the telephone bills and covered expenditures for travel and press products. All told, according to preliminary estimates, about 3 billion rubles [R] were spent. Andrey Zavidiya emphasized that all this was done within the framework of his own election campaign: Galand structures agitated for the LDPR only because the name of the president of the concern was on the political roll of the party. About 50 percent of the party members are my supporters." However, after the dispute it was impossible to stop the Galand working machine, and the concern's enterprises continued to agitate for Zhirinovskiy's party, thinking, probably, that they were doing this for the good of their own president. Now Andrey Zavidiya intends to achieve the restoration of his rights and really obtain a Duma seat. Moreover, there are plans for the creation of a large party on the basis of 1,500 enterprises of the Galand concern system, expanded and reinforced by 3,500 organizational committees. The proposed party will have to be centrist and "cooperate and be on friendly terms with both the left and the right." At present, two examples of Andrey Zavidiya's participation in party life after the break with the LDPR are known. The president of the Galand concern is closely associated with the organizational committee of the Leftist Russia party, which stands on firm communist positions. In addition, he joined the organizational committee of the Majority Party (see SEGODNYA No. 100), which, according to the assurances of its leaders, is closer to the reformers in its positions.
