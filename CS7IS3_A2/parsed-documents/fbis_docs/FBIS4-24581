He said that Russia and China are experiencing profound social changes and the two countries have taken different ways and measures in their own reforms due to their respective national and historic characteristics. He added that the two countries should learn from each other. The tasks facing both Russia and China were similar in many aspects, he said, which holds possibilities for bilateral cooperation of mutual benefit. The Russian premier said that the complementary nature of the two countries, their resources and economies provides both with certain potential for effective bilateral cooperation. He noted that bilateral relations have entered a new stage, which brings about a broad prospect for a constructive partnership in the next century. Such relations, he said, well meet the basic national interest of the two countries and constitute an important element in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region as well as rest of the world. Touching upon bilateral economic cooperation, he said that this was a complicated thing: on the one hand, the cooperation is vigorous; while on the other hand, there is great potential for its expansion. He said that bilateral cooperative relations have to be shifted to a higher level in line with international standards, involving cooperation in production, investment and joint ventures. He said that the good-neighborly cooperation between the two peoples will continue to be accelerated, for the sake of the two great nations, and peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
