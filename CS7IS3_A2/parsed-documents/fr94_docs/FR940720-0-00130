FR940720-0-00130 FR940720-0-00010 Response: To date, the species has declined even with these regulations in place. These regulations do not ensure that habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow will be protected. Listing of the species by the State of New Mexico only regulates collecting of the species. It does not provide protection for its habitat or for its recovery. The Service believes the protective mechanisms of the Act are necessary to prevent the species' extinction. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Rio Grande silvery minnow should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .), and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Rio Grande silvery minnow ( Hybognathus amarus ) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The only existing population of H. amarus continues to be threatened by annual dewatering of a large percentage of its habitat. This dewatering is primarily the result of diversion of river flow for agriculture within the Middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. During a year when an average or above-average amount of water is available, the impacts of the diversions are not severe. During a below-average water year, the river channel may be dry from Isleta Diversion Dam downstream about 179 km (111 mi) to the headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir for two months or more. When two below-average flow years occur consecutively, a short-lived species such as H. amarus can be severely affected, if not completely eliminated from the dry reaches of river. During the 94 years for which flow records have been maintained for the middle Rio Grande, it has not been unusual for the 245 km (153 mi) reach of the Rio Grande from the Angostura Diversion Dam downstream to Elephant Butte Reservoir to experience periods of no flow. Even before construction of mainstream dams, the middle Rio Grande frequently experienced periods of no flow. During such periods, it is suspected H. amarus survived in areas where irrigation return flows re-entered the river, in the pools formed by water leaking through the gates of the diversion dams, in the irrigation ditches and drains, and in the reaches of stream above the diversions from which their offspring could repopulate downstream reaches when conditions permitted. It is not known why these same factors do not provide sufficient habitat to support H. amarus under current conditions. Other factors, such as an increase in non-native and exotic fish species, or an increase in contamination may be exacerbating the stress placed upon the species during low-flow periods. Mainstream dams permit the artificial regulation of flow, prevent flooding, trap nutrients, alter sediment transport, prolong flows, and create reservoirs that favor non-native fish species. These changes may affect the Rio Grande silvery minnow by reducing its food supply, altering its preferred habitat, preventing dispersal, and providing a continual supply of non-native fishes that may compete with or prey upon the species. Altering flow regimes may also improve conditions for other native fish species that occupy the same habitat as the Rio Grande silvery minnow and may thereby cause their populations to expand at the expense of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. Since completion of Elephant Butte Dam in 1916, four additional mainstream dams have been constructed on the middle Rio Grande, and two dams have been constructed on one of its major tributaries, the Rio Chama (Shupe and Williams 1988). Construction and operation of these dams, which are either irrigation diversion dams such as Angostura, Isleta, and San Acacia; or flood control and water storage dams such as Elephant Butte, Cochiti, Abiquiu, and El Vado, have modified the natural flow of the river. The dams make it possible during a low-flow year to completely divert all of the flow from the river channel into irrigation ditches. The species does not persist in the irrigation ditches or the low-flow conveyance channel. Platania (1993) collected fish samples from 11 locations along the low-flow conveyance channel between 1987&hyph;1989 and failed to locate any Rio Grande silvery minnows. The dams also store spring runoff and summer inflow, which would normally cause flooding, and release this water back into the river channel over a prolonged period of time. This release is often made during the winter months when low flows would normally occur. Artificially-controlled flows depart significantly from natural conditions. Reduced flows may limit the amount of preferred habitat available to the species and may limit dispersal of the species. Although the mechanisms of how the decline of the species occurred are not fully understood, manipulation of flow may be one of the primary reasons H. amarus has been extirpated from portions of its historic range. Channelization of the middle Rio Grande has resulted primarily from the placement of Kellner jetty fields, or jacks, along the river. They are designed to protect the levees by retarding flood flows, trapping sediment, and promoting the establishment of vegetation. Since 1951, the Bureau of Reclamation and Corps have installed in excess of 100,000 individual jetties occupying more than 2,000 ha (5,000 ac) (Bullard and Wells 1992). From Elephant Butte Dam downstream about 325 km (200 mi) to its confluence with the Rio Conchos, the Rio Grande is fully controlled by reservoir releases and irrigation return flows. Meanders, oxbows and other components of historic aquatic habitat have been eliminated in order to pass water as efficiently as possible for agricultural irrigation and downstream deliveries. These changes affected the Rio Grande silvery minnow by altering its habitat to the extent that its survival was not possible. The sandy substrate, which it prefers, has been replaced by gravel and cobble, and no backwater areas exist where the young can develop. Winter flows released from Caballo Dam often equal .06 cubic meters per second (2 cubic feet per second), which is not enough flow to maintain habitat for fishes.
