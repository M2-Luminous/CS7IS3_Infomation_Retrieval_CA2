It is problematic that the failure of the meeting to reach an agreement on the framework talks is taken as the "independence of the Japanese diplomacy." What is crucial in diplomatic negotiations is to make efforts to see they do not break up. I must say that the meeting was a failure. It is not only Japan which is to blame. The United States which wanted to narrow down all the negotiations to only one thing -- setting of the numerical targets -- is responsible as well. But Japan was only concerned with rejecting it, failing to present an alternative to it. Beginning with talks on textiles, many negotiations have been held between Japan and the United States. In a number of cases, they came close to failing, but the negotiators were able to avoid the worst and resolve differences because both parties made efforts to reach agreements at the talks. In the Japan-U.S. construction talks and the structural impediments initiative talks in which I was personally involved, I persisted with the position of saying "No" to the U.S. demands, but I presented counterproposals as well. This time that sort of efforts were not made at all. The negotiations were entrusted to bureaucrats, and politicians did not try to take responsibility. Now, the United States keeps on criticizing the bureaucrats, but it is barking up the wrong tree. The bureaucrats cannot go beyond the roles assigned them. The United States' possible incitement of the high-yen value or enforcement of sanctions in case of a failure of the summit meeting has been anticipated. The trend of national bond and stock prices in the United States is stable. So is the market of the dollar against the mark. If the United States decides on imposing sanctions, Japan has things to say, too. As far as the cellular phone issue is concerned, it should be dealt with pursuant to international rules. I doubt if the Japanese Government can really talk about "mature, adults' relationship" without feeling shame in its conscience. Prime Minister Hosokawa may be thinking that way in fact, but there are people within the government who are concerned as much as we do. Many of the bureaucrats who accompanied him on the visit to Washington returned home very much disheartened. In that respect, Mr. Hosokawa is too ignorant. In the meeting of the seven major nations' (G-7) finance ministers and central bank governors to be held soon, the Japanese Government must seek the cooperation of other nations to ensure that the exchange market better reflects Japan's fundamental economic conditions. On the other hand, the government must continue to make efforts to open up Japan's markets. The Liberal Democratic Party can cooperate in that regard, but if the government wants us to cooperate, it must stop telling lies. The government says it is easing rules on 1,591 items, but the number is a simple sum of what the government offices cited. Many of them are duplicated. I hope the government will stop bragging about the numbers which are wrong.
