The appeal to Husayn was made with the knowledge of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. So far, Kollek has not received an answer. Kollek contacted Husayn through a third party associated with the former mayor and the king. The mediator made a special trip to Jordan to deliver the invitation. Kollek suggested that Husayn come to Jerusalem openly, aboard a special helicopter, and pray at the graves of his forefathers in the city. The climax of the visit was to have been festive prayers at the Temple Mount mosques. Kollek suggested that Husayn return to Jordan after the prayers, without meeting any Israeli officials. Kollek advised Rabin and Peres before making the proposal, and they expressed no opposition. Kollek confirmed the details of this report yesterday. According to him, he has not yet received the king's reply, although a few weeks have passed since the invitation was given. In the interim, the king underwent ear surgery, and he is currently in the United States for medical treatment. It is not clear whether he intends to respond to the former mayor's offer. It is not clear whether Kollek's offer to Husayn was made at his own initiative, as the former mayor of Jerusalem, or whether it was made at Rabin and Peres' request. In any event, the offer was meant to serve important Israeli interests, as well as obvious Jordanian interests, at this critical juncture for both parties. Had Husayn accepted the offer, he would have prayed publicly on Temple Mount, under extensive media coverage, before Yasir 'Arafat, and this would have lent support to his demand for involvement in the management of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. A Husayn visit at this time could help Israel resist the pressure for an 'Arafat visit to Temple Mount and help weaken the Palestinian demand for control over East Jerusalem and the Muslim holy sites. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 13 June reports that "Teddy Kollek expressed regret over the fact that his proposal to Jordan's King Husayn to visit Jerusalem and pray at the Temple Mount mosques before Yasir 'Arafat was leaked to the press." Kollek said "that so far, he has not received any reply from Jordan with regard to his proposal."]
