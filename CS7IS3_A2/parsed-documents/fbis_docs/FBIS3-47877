Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito have been strongly critical of Takemura for maintaining covert contacts with the Liberal Democratic Party -- from which he bolted in 1993 -- in connection with political reform and an anticipated realignment of political parties. The two parties are reported to have privately asked the prime minister to replace the chief cabinet secretary. However, Takemura, who enjoys the prime minister's full backing, intends to resist such moves. Conflict within the ruling coalition parties are expected to intensify as a result. Allegedly, there have been recurring demands for Takemura's replacement since late 1993. However, the prime minister believes that the replacement of someone who has been a major ally since well before the start of his administration, would certainly unsettle the political base of the coalition, which is built on a delicate balance between the Shinseito-Komeito bloc led by Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary general, and Takemura supporters. He has, therefore, taken a cautious approach. However, Takemura himself has been afflicted by a growing sense of crisis. On the evening of 12 January, he held a meeting with officials of his Sakigake [Harbinger] Party while maintaining telephone contact with the prime minister. He also confirmed that "there would be no cabinet reshuffle yet" with the prime minister's office on the morning of 13 January, and announced this at a news conference shortly afterward. Takemura said at the news conference, "I think I am the target of all sorts of criticism." The comment showed his concern at the strong criticism of him from the ruling coalition parties. However, he also said: "I will continue to work hard and exert my utmost efforts to do my job." The remark showed he did not seem daunted by calls for him to be replaced. The issue of a cabinet reshuffle is expected to reemerge after the end of the next regular session of the Diet. Takemura, by subtly emphasizing that the power of appointment lies with the prime minister, seemed to indicate that for the time being, he would focus on maintaining his alliance with the prime minister and continue his confrontation with the Ozawa group.
