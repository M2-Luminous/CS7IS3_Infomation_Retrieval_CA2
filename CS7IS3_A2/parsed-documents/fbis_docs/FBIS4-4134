The United States is due to rule on renewing China's MFN in June. "The MFN status is a reciprocal and mutual beneficial arrangement between China and the USA and should not be linked to any issue irrelevant to it," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said in response to a question about sending Wang to the United States. "Because of the sickness of prisoner Wang Juntao, Chinese judicial departments in accordance with Chinese law, permitted him to receive medical treatment," he said. U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked for significant progress on human rights issues in China before renewing MFN, which allows Chinese products easier access to US markets. The dissident, one of the primary leaders of the crushed democracy movement of 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991. During detention, he contracted hepatitis and his health in general deteriorated in recent years. Wu refused to say whether Wang would be allowed to return to China after recovering, saying it was up to judicial authorities. He also said a recent visit to the United States by Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi was a "success and will help enhance the mutual understanding between the two countries and promote the bilateral trade and economic ties."
