That unequivocally follows on the agreement signed by General Rasim Delic and General Ante Roso on Saturday [12 March] in Split. Their signatures will, hopefully, finally bring an end to Muslim-Croat conflicts and disputes. It is significant that it took less time for the soldiers to reach an agreement than for the politicians who negotiated in Vienna, although the agreement between the two generals is in compliance with the work of the participants at the Vienna talks. Naturally, it was easy for the soldiers to surpass the politicians, for they discussed a narrow segment of the broader mutual relations between the Bosniak Muslims and the Croats, but the difficult part was to disregard the series of conflicts, the wounded and the dead, to suppress frustration resulting from mutual shelling. Geostrategically speaking, the defense system of the Bosniak-Croat federation will definitely mean a lot for broad general relations in these parts. The United States was evidently extremely interested in reaching the agreement and they almost pushed General Roso and General Delic to end the negotiations successfully. However, it is also obvious that the first officers of the two military forces wisely realized that mutual Muslim-Croat conflicts cannot benefit either nation and that they directly benefit the third side. Still, considering the possibility of reaching a lasting political solution on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the signed agreement clearly says that its defense system does not aim at harming the third side. Simply, the two nations which will live in the federation are trying to define clearly the question of defense, which is an extremely important one for every country, especially for the one which rises anew from the ashes of the war. There is no doubt that the United States will insist exactly on the military-defense plan of the future Bosniak-Croat federation, for in any option of the future course of events, it could guarantee a successful resistance to those who want to use weapons to impose political solutions. Of course, in order to implement the agreement signed by Generals Delic and Roso, it will be necessary to suppress the frustration and forget bad memories, and that will take time, but one can go forward only if one looks toward the future, not toward the past.
