Secretary Li Changchun delivered a speech in which he emphatically called for firmly grasping each and every excellent opportunity at the moment, further emancipating our minds, deepening the on-going enterprise reform, and boldly trying out a variety of new reform measures. He stated: We should strictly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee by further developing the productive forces; promoting lateral associations between enterprises; forming more enterprise groups; correctly handling relations between reform and development, on the one hand, and stability on the other; carrying out production in light of market demand; producing more readily marketable products; shifting enterprise operational mechanisms; focusing on heavy industrial growth, while continually pushing ahead with light and textile industrial growth; and amalgamating more loss-making enterprises with profit-making enterprises, with a view to turning enterprise losses into profits. To this end, he said, all comrades concerned should further enhance a sense of enterprise reform and should strive to accelerate the on-going enterprise reform. Secretary Li Changchun noted: The large and medium-sized state- run enterprises also should implement a joint-stock cooperative system on a trial basis, further expand opening up to the outside world, and firmly grasp two key work aspects at the same time.
