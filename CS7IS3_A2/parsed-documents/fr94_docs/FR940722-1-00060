FR940722-1-00060 FR940722-1-00012 4. Section 23.697 is amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: §23.697 Wing flap controls. * * * * * (c) If compliance with §23.145(b)(3) necessitates wing flap retraction to positions that are not fully retracted, the wing flap control lever settings corresponding to those positions must be positively located such that a definite change of direction of movement of the lever is necessary to select settings beyond those settings. 5. Section 23.701 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) to read as follows: §23.701 Flap interconnection. (a) *␣*␣* (1) Be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection between the movable flap surfaces that is independent of the flap drive system; or by an approved equivalent means; or (2) Be designed so that the occurrence of any failure of the flap system that would result in an unsafe flight characteristic of the airplane is extremely improbable; or * * * * * 6. A new §23.703 is added to read as follows: §23.703 Takeoff warning system. For commuter category airplanes, unless it can be shown that a lift or longitudinal trim device which affects the takeoff performance of the aircraft would not give an unsafe takeoff configuration when selected out of an approved takeoff position, a takeoff warning system must be installed and meet the following requirements: (a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff roll if the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe takeoff. The warning must continue until_ (1) The configuration is changed to allow safe takeoff, or (2) Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll. (b) The means used to activate the system must function properly for all authorized takeoff power settings and procedures and throughout the ranges of takeoff weights, altitudes and temperatures for which certification is requested. §23.723 [Amended] 7. Section 23.723(b) is amended by changing the word ``reserved'' to ``reserve''. 8. Section 23.729 is amended by revising paragraph (e) and by adding a new paragraph (g) to read as follows: §23.729 Landing gear extension and retraction system. * * * * * (e) Position indicator. If a retractable landing gear is used, there must be a landing gear position indicator (as well as necessary switches to actuate the indicator) or other means to inform the pilot that each gear is secured in the extended (or retracted) position. If switches are used, they must be located and coupled to the landing gear mechanical system in a manner that prevents an erroneous indication of either ``down and locked'' if each gear is not in the fully extended position, or of ``up and locked'' if each landing gear is not in the fully retracted position. * * * * * (g) Equipment located in the landing gear bay . If the landing gear bay is used as the location for equipment other than the landing gear, that equipment must be designed and installed to minimize damage. 9. Section 23.735 is amended by redesignating paragraph (c) as paragraph (d), by revising the introductory text of paragraph (a), and by adding new paragraphs (c) and (e) to read as follows: §23.735 Brakes. (a) Brakes must be provided. The landing brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly must not be less than the kinetic energy absorption requirements determined under either of the following methods: * * * * *
