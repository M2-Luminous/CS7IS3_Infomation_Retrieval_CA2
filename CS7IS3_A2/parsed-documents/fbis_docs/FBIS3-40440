The development and building of this "Super AR5" is expected to take six years beginning in 1995. The "Evolution of Ariane 5," as it is being envisioned today, was unveiled by the ESA [European Space Agency] and the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] at the Space Transport Forum that was held in Nancy at the end of November by the AAAF [Aerospace Association of France]. The heads of this program are already concerning themselves with the future of the new European Ariane 5 rocket even though its initial version, the AR5, is still under development and is not expected to fly until October 1995. It is already evident, however, that to maintain Ariane 5's commercial competitiveness, as competition grows more severe toward the end of the decade, and with satellites growing ever larger, Arianespace will rapidly have need of an enhanced version of the AR5. The "Evolution of Ariane 5" program is intended to prolong Ariane 5's competitiveness by retaining its dual satellite launching capability, with satellites expected to weigh between 3.3 and 3.8 metric tons according to the CNES. An American study published last April also concluded that by the end of the decade, "80% of the payloads will weigh less than 8,000 lbs" (3630 kg). 7.3 Tons in Transfer Orbit Under these conditions, the goal of the Evolution of AR5 program will be to launch two satellites weighing a total of 7.3 metric tons between them into geosynchronous transfer orbit [GTO]. This represents an increase of slightly more than 1.3 tons (+22%) over the capacity of the AR5 currently under development, which is designed to place approximately six tons, or exactly 5970 kg, in 600-36,000km/7ï¿½ orbit. The AR5's performance objective in the case of a single-satellite launching into the same orbit is to be 6830 kg, and that of the AR5/Mk2 approximately 8.2 tons, or double the capacity of Ariane 4 today (4.3 tons). This sizable gain in performance must be achieved, however, without loss of Ariane 5's qualities. That is, without degrading the launcher's reliability, but also at the same time reducing the cost of the rocket, according to Nancy Remy Hergott, engineering assistant to the CNES's director of launchers. To accomplish this, it is not a question of simply increasing the number of motors or the size of the stages, nor for that matter one of adding boosters or an upper high-energy (cryogenic) stage. All these solutions would be too costly and would augment the developmental risks. The CNES proposes to proceed on the basis of two major steps. The first would be to augment the thrust of the Vulcain cryogenic motor and the weight of propellants of the AR5's central stage. This would produce a gain of at least 800 kg of payload in GTO. The second step would consist of augmenting the performance of the Aestus upper stage motor, increasing the weight of storable propellants (N204/MMH) from 9.7 tons to 14 tons. This would result in a gain of around 400 to 500 kg. In addition, it is expected to be able to squeeze out another 100 kg of gain by replacing the AR5's P230 dry-fuel booster links with welded joints. These are the principal AR5 modifications being proposed, after its initial 25 to 30 flights, in order to arrive at the AR5 Evolution version, which would then be ready to enter commercial service in 2001. A Super-Vulcain The Aerospatiale H155 cryogenic central stage will be modified to increase the total weight of propellants from 152 tons to 172 tons (+13%). But overall volume is to remain constant. This is to be achieved by displacing the intermediate dividers of the tanks so as to increase the quantity of liquid oxygen relative to that of liquid hydrogen, and correlatively modifying the mixture ratio, from 5.3 to 6.2 (+17%). In the case of the SEP [European Propellant Company] Vulcain cryogenic motor, this translates into a thrust increase to 1300 kN (+16%), with a loss of specific impulse that will be compensated for by a modification of the exhaust nozzle. This modification will actually result in a slight overall gain (two seconds), increasing the specific impulse to 433 seconds. The motor weight will be increased (+9.5%) to 1750 kg. The Vulcain's combustion chamber (its walls are cooled by ducting) will be modified by DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] to increase its throat diameter, mixture ratio (+17%), pressure (+2%), and flow (+16%). The injector remains unchanged, as does also the hydrogen turbine pump. On the other hand, the oxygen turbine pump will be modified by Fiat Avio so as to include a 2-stage supersonic turbine (with blades machined in the disk and not flanged), enabling support of the increases in pressure (+7%), flow (+18%), and above all, power (+25%) to 4.8 Mw. The divergence of the nozzle will be enlarged, with section ratio increased to 60 (+33%). The upper part will retain the technology of the Vulcain, with cooling by a bleed-off of the fuel flow, which, however, will be reduced (-20%). The medial part is surrounded by the turbine gases injection ring. These gases also cool the lower skirt (which consists simply of bent sheet metal). This new nozzle, developed by SEP, DASA, and Volvo Flygmotor, is expected to begin testing on the Vulcain by the end of 1994. L14 Upper Stage Generally speaking, and intentionally, the enhanced Vulcain will use well-known and, for the most part, proven technologies. The development of the Vulcain Mk2 and the modifications of the central stage could thus be completed in six years, the last three of them being devoted to tests of the new motor, which is to have the same reliability as the present Vulcain (0.946). The other phase of the enhancement is to concern the DASA upper EPS [storable propellants] stage. Its tank is pressurized by helium, without turbine pump, and has actually already been improved, doubling its performance between the original L5 and the current L9.7 version. Its propellants capacity has been increased from 5 tons to 9,7 tons, its thrust from 20 to 27.5 kN, its specific impulse from 316 seconds to 324 seconds, and its duration of operation from 810 to 1266 seconds. This time, its performance is to be substantially enhanced, with an increase from L9.7 to L14. The stage will thus undergo a complete alteration but without modifying its architecture. Its tanks will be enlarged (by 700 mm) but made of lighter material (Al-Li in place of Alu 2219). This, says C. Ransom of ERNO [German Aerospace's Northern Development Consortium], will make it possible to add 4.3 tons of propellants (+45%) and raise the thrust of the Aestus motor to 35 kN (+27%). The L14 will have exactly the same mechanical, electrical, and fluid interfaces as the L9.7, which will therefore continue to be used for other missions in low-earth and sun-synchronous orbits and for single-satellite launches into geosynchronous transfer orbit. The L14 will be used for dual launches requiring the full power of this "Super Ariane 5" beginning in 2001!
