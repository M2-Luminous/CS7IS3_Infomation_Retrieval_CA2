The mood in the SPD is good at the moment, "but this must now be turned into votes," SPD candidate for the chancellor's office Rudolf Scharping said, speaking to an audience of more than 1,000 people at the traditional SPD meeting in Vilshofen, Lower Bavaria. In the overcrowded meeting hall, Bavarian SPD Chairwoman Renate Schmidt called for bringing about a change in the government: "It is time for a change." Scharping accused the Federal Government of damaging Germany's "greatest asset," the stability of social peace, the quality of work, and internal security. A change must finally be brought about in Bonn: Even though the SPD has already won in many polls, it must now also win the elections: "Helmut Kohl as a retiree in Oggersheim -- this is a nice prospect for Kohl and a useful one for Germany," Scharping said. In his view, the CSU "deserves a rest after its many affairs." It is so busy with mastering its affairs that it is no longer contributing toward mastering the problems in Germany. Bavaria also deserves a "good female minister president." Renate Schmidt criticized the Bavarian government party by saying that the "Republikanization of the CSU" is increasing. Anyone who makes a policy with the "fear of having too many foreigners" must not be surprised that right-wing extremists are on the rise.
