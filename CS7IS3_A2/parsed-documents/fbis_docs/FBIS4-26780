He also said that further efforts should be made to strengthen the publicity campaign to enhance people's common knowledge about various legal aspects and continuously achieve more solid effects so as to keep step with the development of legal system construction in China. Ren Jianxin's comments came in a speech at a forum marking the first anniversary of the "Educational Corps for Assisting the State's Middle- and High-Ranking Cadres To Study Law." Ren Jianxin said: The effort to publicize and educate people on the legal system's importance is a basic task in China's legal system construction. It is also a major characteristic of our legal system construction. The corps was formed at a time when China is accelerating its pace to establish a socialist market economy. The corps is a good way to promote the campaign for publicizing and educating people on the legal system's importance, help the broad masses of cadres, and particularly middle- and high-ranking cadres, enhance their legal sense of the market economy's importance. The work, which is organized by the Propaganda Department, the Justice Ministry, and the China Law Society, is of great significance. Ren Jianxin pointed out: During the course of establishing and perfecting a socialist economic system, we should popularize legal knowledge about the market economy, enhance people's legal sense of importance about the market economy, maintain social stability, and guarantee proper order of the market economy. It is an important task to publicize and educate people on the legal system's importance. The task will remain so for a long time to come. Extensive efforts should be made to instill the idea of the legal system into the minds of citizens, and particularly leading cadres, so that leading cadres at all levels will foster the legal system idea for a socialist market economy. Practice proves that whether or not leading cadres at all levels have a sense of importance about the legal system and their ability to make decisions and carry out their duties in accordance with the law play an important role in promoting socialist modernization. It is impossible for a leader who does not understand the law or who has never used legal means to manage economic and social affairs to become a good and conscientious leader. He expressed his hopes that, through conducting classes on the legal system, the teachers of the corps will not only help leaders of the organs of the CPC Central Committee and the state as well as leaders at provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional levels master legal knowledge but also further foster an idea of the market economy. It is imperative to let leading cadres at all levels have a better understanding of the fact that a sound legal system is needed to guarantee the establishment and perfection of a socialist market system. In an attempt to establish and develop a socialist market economy, all leading cadres must take a lead in studying law, using law, and carrying out duties in accordance with the law. It was learned that, since the corps' establishment, 13 senior lecturers have given more than 10 lectures on the legal system to leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and state organs, including the Geology and Mineral Resources Ministry and the State Meteorological Bureau, as well as to major responsible comrades of Jiangsu, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other localities. These lectures include corporate law, regulations on the change of operating mechanisms in state-owned industrial enterprises, amendments to the Constitution, and stocks and bonds. On top of that, another 11 senior lecturers have recorded 13 video lectures on the legal system regarding the market economy. The videotaped lectures have been released to 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country. The forum was jointly sponsored by the Propaganda Department, the Justice Ministry, and the China Law Society. China Law Society Chairman Zou Yu presided over the meeting. Justice Minister Xiao Yang also spoke at the meeting. Some members of the corps also expressed their opinions and suggestions about improving the campaign.
