This jargon of the opponent to dialogue is nothing but a foolish attempt to evade their responsibility for the collapse of North-South dialogue and justify the criminal war moves against the North, which are now increasing the tensions in the Korean peninsula. It is an insult to and a mockery of the dialogue partner for the South Korean puppet clique to twang the harp of "dialogue" while bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war after unilaterally breaking up the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South. Yi Yong-tok said "if the UN sanctions are taken against the North, the South will adopt all measures needed for international cooperation." This revealed the invariable intention to isolate and stifle the North at any cost with the help of outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam group must not act rashly, clearly mindful that going towards a war after closing the door of dialogue will, after all, tighten the noose around its neck.
