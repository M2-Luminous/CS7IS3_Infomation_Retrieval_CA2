Kuptsov, by Erik Kotlyar, under rubric "Law and Order": "First Interview With New MUR Chief, Exclusive for SK Readers"] [Text] It is no secret that the fight against crime is spinning its wheels. Accusations leveled at the militia are heard on all sides. People say that the fight is being waged poorly, that officials are being bought and sold, and that criminals are being coddled and retrained as chastisers. And the fight is being increasingly drawn into political games that are well seasoned with payoffs. There really is no fight at all! Are these reproaches justified? Basically, unfortunately, yes, they are! For the most part, such facts have been confirmed. But there are a few things that are frequently forgotten in the heat of the polemics. The structure of the militia includes criminal investigation and prosecution services for which the elimination of the criminal segment is their direct duty! If society rejects that purpose, then those services are no longer needed and should simply be abolished or transformed into something else. But they do exist, and it is incorrect to say that the fight against crime has been completely stopped. It is another matter that the results have become the wrong ones! And that the services are up to their ears in debt to the taxpayers. Why is this happening? There are several reasons. The main one is that the social environment and the modern economic order are engendering and multiplying crime in the way that dampness gives rise to mold. The rates of its multiplication are greatly outstripping the development of those militia agencies whose functions include the putting up of resistance to the criminal forces (unlike the rates of formation of detachments for the protection of law and order). As of today, the criminal militia has not gone far in its development from the number of personnel in the old times, when the situation was more normal and it was possible to walk along the streets in Moscow at night, arm in arm with one's girl friend. A second reason is the fact that the highest echelon of authority has been corrupted. Frequently that echelon sympathetically supports the criminal element for their mutual advantage. The third reason is the frustration of a society that has been shaken by the unprecedented boldness with which the criminal world is invading the customary way of life. And, finally, the last reason: the frustration of the militia itself, which has become accustomed to operating, like every other line service, in accordance with a command from above. Fewer and fewer of these commands are coming in. But, under conditions of the political instability and confusion, it is simply impossible to operate at one's own risk. There have been attempts to assume responsibility in individual instances, but that did not lead to anything good. Several times the "authorities," restrained by the desperate risk of protectors of law and order, allowed themselves to get under the so-called "pledge," by issuing threats to the operational agents and their families. You have to agree that it is a lesson that people remember! It is truly a "golden age" for all kinds of rogues! Of course, among the militia men there have arisen doubts and, in accordance with the customary tradition (and, one should not forget, we all have emerged from the Soviet authority), searches for the extreme began. Why is it important to find the guilty person? Because everyone has bosses, and, as everyone knows, those bosses never want to share with anyone the responsibility for what is happening! Their task is to analyze the situation and punish people! "If you get money (but I don't), you'll have to answer!" It is no wonder that, with this kind of disjointed resolution of a very serious question, the only thing that we have today is the constant rotation of personnel among the militia professionals, in the hope that the new employee will be luckier than his predecessor. In one of the statements made in the State Duma it was stated that workers who have distinguished themselves are deliberately removed from the law-enforcement system! But this is a special question, and it should be analyzed in a special study... It is a fact that today the reason for removing a militia employee can be not only his poor performance in the precinct, but also his failure to develop the proper on-the-job interrelationships. Observing all of this, we are most troubled that the person sitting in the chair behind the control panel in the fight against crime is not the latest in a series of heating specialists. Let me hasten to assure the readers that this has not happened. The person who replaced Yu. Fedoseyev at MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department] was his deputy, a person with a long biography in the militia, who, even in the past, frequently executed the direct duties of the UGRO [criminal investigation] chief -- Vasiliy Nikolayevich Kuptsov. The 42-year-old militia colonel is as erect as an athlete and is meager in his words and gestures. He actually does have behind him a difficult path from an ordinary militia man in 1974 to responsible positions in which the only person who can work successfully is one who has had good experience and who enjoys authority among his comrades. V. Kuptsov meets all these criteria. He graduated from militia school, and then a branch of the RF [Russian Federation] MVD Academy. He worked "on the ground" as an operational agent in a militia department, and was also a department chief, senior operational agent for especially important criminal-investigation cases, the first deputy RUVD chief, deputy chief of BKhSS [Combatting the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation], and, over a considerable period of time, MUR deputy chief. He is very knowledgeable about operational work, and, most importantly, makes a sober evaluation of the real order of things. The hopes of Moscow's criminals that they will have an easy life with the arrival of the new MUR chief are apparently in vain. One would certainly want to believe and hope that this is so! [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you arrived in the job of MUR chief at what is probably not the most favorable time. All the barriers are shaking under the onrush of crime. Do you have your own concept or will you develop MUR's traditional work practices? [Kuptsov] I have been working at MUR long enough to assert that the experience and traditions of the city's investigation administration are unique. They took years to form, and every administrator made his own contribution; of course, every one who bears responsibility for the assigned job has his own approach to those tasks. It is important that the basis of his job should be the practical considerations in accordance with the requirements of the time. Because crime changes very quickly, and failing to take those changes into consideration in operational work would be a big mistake! With the development of privatization there appeared new methods of taking personal savings away from private individuals with the help of various swindles. We have introduced certain functional and structural changes in the administration's work in order to specialize individual links in criminal investigation specifically in those types of crimes. The situation is exactly the same in the area of crimes against property. The concepts of private and state property are identically high-priority in the legal sense. Correspondingly there must be a change in the level of professionalism in the departments that are engaged in the uncovering of crimes against all types of property, including private and personal. Incidentally, for the period of transition to market relations this is of great political importance. Take, for example, such a type of crime as explosions. Previously such unusual cases used to be investigated by us in the general work flow. But currently a new type of crime has turned into an entire "branch" that has acquired its own specialists and underground industry. Consequently, MUR also needs a department in which the trained operational agents can make an educated evaluation and analyze each occurrence. That is, life forces us to carry out a kind of "modernization" of investigation as applicable to the "technology" of crime. The same thing can be said about the discovery of illegally acquired weapons. Everyone is well aware of how those weapons are used. Frequently the people who perish are completely innocent individuals who just happened to be at the scene of the crime. Previously this phenomenon was viewed as a part of the overall picture involving the crime that had been committed. Currently we want to achieve the intensification of investigation work to such a degree that the guns can be taken out of illegal circulation even before they can be fired! In order to do that, it will be necessary right now to have our employees specialize. One important circumstance is that the employees for the new types of work are selected strictly on the basis of their on-the- job qualities. Other considerations are categorically precluded. We take a very thrifty approach to the personnel makeup that has developed at MUR and the city's criminal investigation department. [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you have mentioned MUR's historic heritage. In those departments that will be affected by the respecialization, won't the important experience and skills that were previously accumulated be lost? [Kuptsov] I can put your mind at ease. MUR will not part with anything beneficial that it has in its arsenal. [Kotlyar] MUR was constantly understaffed -- something like approximately 300 persons in the operational complement. How do you propose to fill in that personnel gap? The complication lies in the fact that the payment for the labor performed in the various militia services is definitely not equal, and criminal investigation in the table of organization is viewed not in the most favorable light. [Kuptsov] There really is a problem here. Many people are more eager to go to the new services where the pay is better. But the people who come to MUR are the romantics, who are seized and attracted by our unusual job. I hardly think that there is anywhere else that an enthusiast would be able to graduate from the kind of school for detective service that we have in our subdivisions. We have had good experience in training junior operational agents. They learn the science of investigating from start to finish in our system. From the operational agents we create reserves for promotion. The most capable employees who have reached the level of skill must definitely have growth prospects. The young ambitious person must be assured that if he works well, he will definitely by singled out and will be trained for promotion. I am convinced that this kind of worker will open up his capabilities even more in his next assignment. We have certain administrators who like to "hide" their valuable workers and keep them for themselves. That is a vicious practice. It leads to a situation in which, in the final analysis, we are deprived of the people whom we need. For our work it is not just enough to have education. It is also mandatory to do some work "on the ground," where it is necessary to carry out directly the dirty work with criminals. Only then will a person reveal his on-the-job qualities and his understanding of how it is necessary to act in various situations. Those who travel the entire path from the initial cell in criminal investigation at a militia station, then through the okrug links, and then gradually rise to the city administration, are in my opinion people who have substantial qualification. For them there are no secrets: they become easily oriented, like highly trained professionals. Unfortunately, in our service it sometimes happens that workers in the administration make disdainful comments about those who are working in the initial investigation teams. And the opposite situation also occurs. Both groups of people are mistaken. It is necessary to have worked at all levels in order to become a full-fledged detective or operational agent. As for the unequal payment for their labor, this question, I am convinced, will be resolved properly! In the final analysis we will achieve a situation in which steady collectives of like- minded individuals who are devoted to their city and its inhabitants will form gradually at MUR and the city's criminal investigation links. [Kotlyar] MUR employs slightly more than 300 people, and the number of workers in criminal investigation for the city as a whole is 4000. Have you developed a methodology for interaction among all the parts of what would seem to be, on the whole, a rather large detachment of people? [Kuptsov] Your question is very correct. The bulk of the work must be conducted only where the crime has been committed. We are already taking steps to guarantee the coordination of all our subdivisions. Here, as you have correctly noted, we used to make a strategic miscalculation. Without the mobile attraction of all the city's personnel, it will be impossible to resolve the crime problem, even if we increase the MUR apparatus to 3000! But the share of the central investigation department will be a few more uncovered cases! But that will not provide much until we achieve a situation in which all the crimes will be identified at the place where they were committed. Another question is that it is impossible to require the okrug departments and stations to uncover all the crimes, irrespective of the type of complexity. For example, murders by hire -- for work like that we simply do not have enough manpower or informational support. In that instance their share will be the execution of the overall algorithm for actions -- the processing of the housing sector, investigation of the scene of the crime, etc. Such cases are within the competency of the city administration, and we have opportunities to uncover them. Although much also depends here upon the corpus delicti and its complexity. Many crimes are within the capabilities of specialists from the okrug criminal- investigation links. In this respect all the city administrations and departments have been given guidelines concerning what types of crimes should be uncovered at their level. There must be no formal check-list approach here -- not worrying about whether or not it is within your capabilities, but just do it for the sake of the record, and that's all there is to it! I think that, with the passage of time, it might even be possible to reduce the apparatus in the city administration, by transferring some of the employees to the okrugs. MUR will retain the functions of providing consultative and methodological guidance and of monitoring the actions of the city's services, and, of course, the work involving especially important and dangerous cases. [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, have you noted any precise delimitations in the area of the work between MUR and RUOP? We sometimes hear people saying, "This is our job, but that isn't..." [Kuptsov] The concept of "our job or not our job" does not exist. For Muscovites there is only a single concept -- the city militia. And for the victim it is a matter of complete indifference as to whether the person who came to his assistance is a MUR or RUOP operative. The most important thing is the final result. As for our internal evaluations, I think that, in the interests of the overall job for which we all are responsible, it is necessary to construct the work on principles of good interaction and mutual understanding, rendering assistance to one another in the name of our common goal. Then the results will become obvious, and Muscovites will truly feel that they are getting real assistance! [Kotlyar] MUR has a good rule: preserve the, as it were, "money- box of experience." That money-box used to be represented by a consultative group made up of MUR veterans. Others who are being called upon are former administration chiefs from wartime and the postwar period and major investigative specialists who retired for reasons of age, but who are completely capable. Will this undertaking -- which is, in our day, a rare and beneficial one -- be preserved in the future? [Kuptsov] Not only will it be preserved, but it will also be multiplied. These people are the militia's "gold fund." Their experience is invaluable. For young detectives they are not only help, but also a personal example in behavior and attitude to the job. Therefore we shall expand the group of our unique specialists: their knowledge and work habits are an important contribution to the administration's work. [Kotlyar] During the short period of time in which you have been heading MUR, have you encountered any difficult situations? [Kuptsov] Maybe you should have asked me whether I have had a free moment recently. All you have to do is to glance at the summary. Every day there are dozens of corpses, violent incidents, attacks... The impression is that we are working in a frontline city! The tension has remained unchanged. But I would like to direct your attention to something. We have enough manpower and enough intellect, but nevertheless the elimination of crime is a comprehensive problem. Here it is necessary for everyone to participate identically -- the manpower of the procurator's office, the city authorities, and, most importantly, the public, without which it would be impossible to cope with the city's woes! Recently there has been a sense of a certain loss of enthusiasm, or maybe a certain disappointment. That's bad. I would like to take advantage of the opportunity provided to me to make a statement in your esteemed newspaper, and to call upon all the healthy forces in Moscow to render all the assistance that they can to the militia, to be more attentive to everything that is happening around them, and not to avoid interacting with the internal-affairs agencies if such interaction is required. I also state confidently, on behalf of my comrades, that the people at MUR are well aware that the basic weight and responsibility for preventing and uncovering crimes lie on the shoulders of the militia. [Kotlyar] Thank you, Vasiliy Nikolayevich, for having this conversation with me. Please allow me to wish you success in your job, which is a very familiar one for you but which is very difficult today!
