"The mood was not that the two sides are in dispute" in the two-day insurance talks in Tokyo, said a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official. "Both sides appear to favor a quick settlement." A U.S. trade official called the talks "successful meetings, but just one step in what are going to be difficult negotiations." "We obviously still have considerable work ahead of us before we complete our agreement," he said. "We are anxious to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible." No deadline has been set for the insurance sector, but the official said the two sides were "adjusting their schedules" to finish before a July summit of major industrial nations. They agreed to start drafting an accord when they meet again late this month, but they have yet to delve in detail on the sticky issue of "objective criteria" to gauge progress in opening Japan's markets, he said. Most of the meetings consisted of catching up on events since bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February and on confirming the progress they made before the rupture, said the Japanese and U.S. officials separately, each declining to be named. Negotiators were halfway to agreement when talks broke down over other sectors and neither side is making new demands, the Japanese official said. But serious differences remain, with the U.S. continuing to press for what the U.S. official called its most important issue -- deregulation of prices, terms and conditions of insurance policies in Japan. Washington insists that Japan allow competition in prices and innovative policies in the life and nonlife sectors, saying Japanese consumers have essentially no choice in either area, the U.S. official said. Negotiators have not attempted to define objective criteria to measure progress in opening Japan's market, as called for in the framework accord signed last July, the Japanese official said. Both sides cited earlier commitments that such criteria will not become "numerical targets." Such wrangling in the two other key sectors -- government procurement and autos and auto parts -- scuttled the framework talks in February. The issue of instituting a system of insurance brokers to help Japanese consumers get the best policies is "still unresolved," the U.S. official said. Japan has agreed in principle to the system but the official said there is no point in having a broker if there is no real choice among policies or prices. The U.S. also wants simpler, clearer licensing procedures. On the other hand, Japan is seeking uniformity in licensing in the U.S. insurance market, complaining that state-by-state regulatory jurisdictions block foreign firms from entering. The Japanese official said the U.S. agreed to negotiate on access to its own market, but the U.S. official refused to confirm it. He indicated, however, that U.S. negotiators responded to Japanese questions by explaining voluntary measures being taken by state insurance commissioners for more uniform standards. The U.S. official denied the U.S. is trying to make Tokyo go slowly in liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" that includes disease and nursing coverage and stands outside of life and standard nonlife insurance. But freeing that area ahead of the others would mean "the wiping out of many companies in the third sector without any opportunity for them to compete in the life and nonlife sectors," the U.S. official said. The Japanese official said there were "no particular discussions" on the third sector. Bilateral talks were to start Thursday in Washington on autos and auto parts and Friday in Tokyo on Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.
