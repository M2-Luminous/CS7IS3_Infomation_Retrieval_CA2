Moravcik said the government would take concrete steps to develop the private sector, support small and medium businesses, increase the competitiveness of Slovak products, and create job opportunities. He also promised that privatization would be speeded up in a fair way. "We welcome more active participation by foreign investors in the privatization process in the Slovak Republic," he said. The government also intended to create the necessary conditions for the broadest possible integration of the Slovak economy into European and world economic structures. Even though his government will only last until the elections six months from now, it would introduce innovations into the economy that should outlive the government's term of office, Moravcik said.
