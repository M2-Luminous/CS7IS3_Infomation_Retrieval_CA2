One of the aims of my visit is to persuade the Polish parliamentarians to engage themselves more closely in the formulation of the future Europe, said Martinez after meeting Sejm and Senate Speakers Jozef Oleksy and Adam Struzik respectively. Speaking after his meeting with Jozef Oleksy, Martinez said that Poland is playing an important role in the Council of Europe which will help facilitate and speed up Poland's integration with the European structures. Jozef Oleksy said that Poland no longer needed to fight to justify its place in Europe, and said that he and Martinez were agreed that Poland should be a driving force for initiatives in the Council of Europe. Oleksy proposed that the Council of Europe should open a representative office in Warsaw along with the lines of the office of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Adam Struzik said after meeting Martinez that their talks covered Poland's role in creating a bridge between Western Europe and eastern neighbours of Poland. The situation in Poland following the September 1993 parliamentary elections was also touched upon during the meeting. The visiting president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe met Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to discuss Poland's participation in the Council of Europe's efforts aimed at European integration and stabilization of democratic institutions on the continent. The two politicians reviewed European security issues and the situation in Russia and Ukraine. Martinez also met with leader of the parliamentary caucus of the Democratic Union (UD) Bronislaw Geremek and discussed with him the question of a possible admission of Russia and Ukraine to the Council of Europe. Despite expectations, the talks did not touch upon the subject of UD's resignation from participation in the Polish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The UD's decision came in protest over the election of Tadeusz Iwinski, an SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) mp, as deputy president of the assembly. The principle that decisions on the composition of the Polish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are taken in parliament and not outside of it, is the condition of the presence of Confederation for an independent Poland (KPN) in the delegation, party leader Leszek Moczulski said after meeting Martinez. Moczulski claimed that such decisions should be made by all parties represented in the Sejm on a consensus basis. He added, however, that "from the point of view of a political rivalry in Poland, the KPN's condition is impossible to be met." KPN has been assigned one place in the 12-member delegation but the party decided not to appoint a party candidate and said it wants an equal number of delegation members. They are elected or appointed by the Sejm from among its members and political parties in the delegation follow the proportion of their strength in the Sejm.
