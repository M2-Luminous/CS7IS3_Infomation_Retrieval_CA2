The agreement, confirmed by Brittan's spokesperson, marks the beginning of a sort of Italian-British axis as regards the complex issue of the distribution of top positions in various institutions, including the European Union, NATO, the OECD, and the WTO [World Trade Organization] (GATT's successor). Dehaene is being supported by both France (because he is a federalist, and French-speaking), and Germany (because he is a Christian Democrat). For his part [British Prime Minister] Major is supporting Brittan, not because Major is convinced that he will ultimately win, but rather, to prevent the Paris-Bonn axis from achieving too much power. If Brittan is defeated, London will demand a substantial consolation prize. Dehaene's true rival is former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Chancellor Kohl tried to convince him to withdraw from the contest by offering him the post of NATO secretary general, but Kohl was unsuccessful. The decision will be made in Corfu at a dinner which is likely to be stormy. Italy will be presenting a long list of candidates, headed by former Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero, who is aiming for the OECD, and the Socialist former head of government Giuliano Amato, who is being considered for NATO. On the other hand, as regards the European commissioners, Berlusconi's government is preparing to replace outgoing Commissioners Ranieri Vanni d'Archirafi and Antonio Ruberti. Two names that are being mentioned are those of Romano Prodi and Mario Monti, the rector of the Bocconi school. However, [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, disappointed at not having been chosen as foreign minister, is also aiming for a European position. Another likely candidate is European Parliament Secretary General Antonio Vinci, who is considered one of the most experienced and powerful Eurocrats in Brussels.
