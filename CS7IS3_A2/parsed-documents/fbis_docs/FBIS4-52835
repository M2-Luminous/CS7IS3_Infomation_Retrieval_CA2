Japanese products have already attained a high quality level, and Japan is now being asked to expand imports because of its huge trade surplus. The three laws are thought to have outlived their usefulness. This measure is also considered part of the government's deregulation efforts. Of the three laws, the Export Inspection Law and Export Products Design Law will be abrogated in 1997, while the law on standardized labeling for export products of small businesses is expected to be abolished before the end of 1994. The Export Inspection Law requires quality inspection for certain products specified under the law. Products failing to pass this inspection cannot be exported. In the 1960's, the inspection list included as many as 500 items, although at present, the list has been shortened to 50 commodities, such as eyeglasses and silk products. The Export Products Design Law is aimed at preventing imitation of designs to promote the export of high quality products. Only seven items, including fountain pens and furniture, come under the jurisdiction of this law.
