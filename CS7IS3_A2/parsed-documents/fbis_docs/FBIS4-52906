A ROK Government official concerned said on 14 May that as soon as the remarks of Deputy Prime Minister Yi had been made public, the U.S. Government asked the ROK Government for an explanation and has been trying to find out the true intention of his remarks. At a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors Association held on 12 May at the Press Center, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: "If it is proven that North Korea has developed even one-half of a nuclear weapon, the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be nullified." The U.S. Government pays attention to the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi for two reasons: First, the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi may be an attempt to put a brake on the policy of freezing the North Korean nuclear program, which the U.S. Government has reportedly been examining positively. It is generally believed that the U.S. Government has been examining a change of its policy toward North Korean nuclear weapons from a policy of preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons -- a policy based on the notion that "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons cannot be allowed absolutely" -- to a policy in which "one or two nuclear weapons can be overlooked." In particular, U.S. moderates who espouse the policy of freezing the North Korean nuclear program believe that if North Korea is urged to remain in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system and open itself up, North Korea will naturally collapse in the near future. Second, the "theory on nuclear sovereignty" that some ROK academic and political circles had persistently advocated may, the U.S. Government worries, have infiltrated into even the government level and that the remarks by the Deputy Prime Minister Yi may be a good example of this possibility. This U.S. policy was made clear when it pressured the ROK to include the provision that the North and South "shall not possess reprocessing facilities and uranium enrichment facilities" in the declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which the North and South agreed on in 1991. The U.S. strategy was to prevent not only North Korea, but South Korea from developing nuclear weapons. When some ROK people still advocated the "theory on nuclear sovereignty," even after the denuclearization declaration was effectuated, the U.S. Government examined the possibility of making the denuclearization declaration an "international treaty" and asked the ROK Government what it thought of the idea. The U.S. Government did so because it believed it is necessary to seek the signing of a denuclearization treaty to overcome the weakness of the denuclearization declaration, which can be abrogated by a mere North-South agreement. The U.S. Government pays special attention to the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi because it thinks senior ROK Government officials have made "suspicious remarks" one after another. In early April Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said: "Keeping North Korea in the NPT system is the most important factor in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, and North-South mutual inspections are not an urgent priority." The U.S. Government expressed its interest in his remarks as well. Even when the ROK Government decided not to insist on North-South exchange of special envoys, a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks, the U.S. Government officially welcomed this overture. However, it still suspected that this may be an extension of the theory on nuclear sovereignty on the Korean peninsula. As the controversy over his remarks escalated, Deputy Prime Minister Yi explained he intended to stress that "North Korea must not possess nuclear weapons." Nevertheless, the speculation that his remarks may have been a message from the ROK Government to the United States persists in the United States. Therefore, it is predicted the difference in views between the United States and the ROK, which was exposed by the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, will be further sharpened when North Korea returns to the NPT and when, as a result, the deadlock over the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved to a certain extent.
