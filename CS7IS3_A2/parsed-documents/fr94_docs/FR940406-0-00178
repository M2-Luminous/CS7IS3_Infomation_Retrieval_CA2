FR940406-0-00178 FR940406-0-00012 In the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 1991 light truck automatic restrain rulemaking, which is available in the public docket at NHTSA, the agency estimated weight increases per vehicle ranging from 15.3 pounds for a driver's-side air bag to 35.7 pounds for both driver and right-front passenger air bags (including ``secondary weight,'' i.e., weight added for supporting structure, etc.). Using these figures, NHTSA estimated that fuel economy could be reduced by about 0.05 to 0.11 mpg. The automatic restraint weight estimates provided by the manufacturers in their responses to the Request for Comments, and the NPRM for this rulemaking were generally consistent with those previously developed by the agency. NHTSA calculates that the manufacturers' estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of 0.07&hyph;0.12 mpg for MY 1996 and 0.11&hyph;0.14 mpg for MY 1997. These weight effects are reflected in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no need for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. 2. FMVSS 214 On June 14, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 27427) a final rule extending the ``quasi-static'' test requirements of FMVSS 214 to trucks, multipurpose vehicles, and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. On July 13, 1992, NHTSA published (57 FR 30917) a final rule establishing a brief phase-in for the requirements of this rule. Manufacturers must meet the requirements for all of their light trucks as of September 1, 1994. The ``quasi-static'' requirements have the effect of requiring each side door to be designed to mitigate occupant injuries in side impacts. It measures performance in terms of the ability of each door to resist a piston pressing a rigid steel cylinder against it. Manufacturers generally comply with the standard by reinforcing the side doors with metal beams or rods. In the Regulatory Evaluation accompanying the rule, NHTSA estimated that the requirements of FMVSS 214 would result in an average weight increase of 24.8 to 26.7 pounds (including secondary weight). This weight increase could result in a fuel economy degradation of 0.1 mpg. The weight estimates provided by the manufacturers for quasi-static side impact protection translate, according to NHTSA calculations, into fuel economy penalties of approximately 0.04&hyph;0.07 mpg for each model year, MYs 1996 and 1997. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no need for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. The agency is also considering other regulatory requirements to protect light truck occupants in side impacts. The agency addressed a number of possible requirements in an ANPRM published on August 19, 1988 (53 FR 31716). In addition, on June 5, 1992, pursuant to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, NHTSA published (57 FR 24009) an ANPRM concerning whether passenger car dynamic side impact protection requirements should be extended to light trucks. Since any additional requirements in this area would take effect after MY 1997, there will be no impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities. 3. FMVSS 216 On April 17, 1991, NHTSA published a final rule (56 FR 15510) amending FMVSS 216, Roof Crush Resistance, to extend its requirements to light trucks with GVWRs of 6,000 pounds or less. Previously, the standard applied only to passenger cars. The effective date of the rule is September 1, 1994. FMVSS 216 is intended to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger compartment in rollover crashes. This standard established strength requirements for the forward portion of the roof to increase the resistance of the roof to intrusion and crush. The agency believes that this requirement will have a negligible impact on light truck manufacturers' MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities. Most light trucks already meet the standard. NHTSA calculates that the manufacturers' weight impact estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of about 0.003&hyph;0.030 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections. 4. FMVSS 108 On April 19, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 16015) a final rule requiring new light trucks to be equipped with center high-mounted stoplamps (CHMSLs). The effective date was September 1, 1993. With an estimated weight effect of about one pound, this rule has a negligible CAFE effect. 5. FMVSS 201 On February 8, 1993, NHTSA published (58 FR 7506) a notice proposing to amend FMVSS 201 to require passenger cars and light trucks to meet a new in-vehicle component test to provide protection when an occupant's head impacts upper interior components (such as A-pillars and side rails) during a crash. The estimated weight effect for light trucks for this proposed requirement averages six to nine pounds per vehicle, for a fuel economy effect of 0.03 mpg. Currently, it is still indeterminate as to whether the proposed requirement will affect light trucks in MYs 1996&hyph;97. At this time, therefore, the agency cannot take potential fuel economy effects into consideration when establishing fuel economy standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97. 6. Rollover Prevention The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to publish an ANPRM or NPRM by May 31, 1992 to provide ``protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds or less.'' On January 3, 1992, NHTSA published (57 FR 242) an ANPRM announcing that the agency is considering whether to propose a safety standard to reduce the casualties associated with rollovers of passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and utility vehicles. In addition, on September 29, 1992, NHTSA published a notice (57 FR 44721) announcing the availability of a document describing the agency's planned rulemaking effort, data analyses, and physical research to address the problem of rollover crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities. Since NHTSA has not yet proposed any requirements in this area, it will not have an impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE capabilities.
