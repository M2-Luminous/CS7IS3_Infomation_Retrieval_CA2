The eight-member mission will visit places such as the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, the Serbian capital of Belgrade and Skopje in Macedonia before returning to Japan on January 17, the officials said. The members will meet Yasushi Akashi, head of U.N. peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, as well as other U.N. officials and government officials of Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, they said. The Japanese team is headed by Shunji Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who played a key role in realizing Japan's legislation on cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping missions which enabled the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia in 1992. Foreign Ministry officials have described the aim of the mission as simply to "grasp the local conditions" to study possible Japanese contributions, brushing aside speculation that the mission might pave the way for sending SDF there. Akashi has repeatedly called for Japanese contribution to U.N. peacekeeping forces in the former yugoslavia. Japanese officials have cited difficulties in sending SDF troops there because of the absence of a cease-fire agreement, unlike that in Cambodia. Japan is expected to send an assistant to support Akashi.
