In a joint announcement, the six trade unions (three from each side) said they decided to stage jointly next November a trade union forum in which all labour organisations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots will participate. An effort will be made so that the forum will be held under the auspices of the European Union while experts from European trade unions will be invited to attend. The forum will address labour and social-economic issues of common interest. Those attending today's meeting were PASIDI [Pancyprian Union of Civil Servants], PEO [Pancyprian Labor Federation], SEK [Confederation of Cypriot Workers], and three Turkish Cypriot unions namely KTAMS, DEV IS and TURK SEN. The joint statement said that the six labour organisations "reaffirmed their determination to step up their efforts in order to promote and consolidate trust between the two communities". It said the common interest and destiny of the two communities demanded their cooperation through mutual understanding for the joint handling of problems and the overcoming of obstacles.
