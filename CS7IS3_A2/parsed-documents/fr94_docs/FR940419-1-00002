FR940419-1-00002 FR940419-1-00001 MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD 5 CFR Part 1209 Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on Whistleblowing AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. ACTION: Notice of proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Board proposes to amend its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant first files a request for a stay of that action. This proposed change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower cases into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20419&hyph;0002. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Llewellyn M. Fischer, General Counsel, (202) 653&hyph;7171. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed change came about as a result of Executive Order 12866, September 30, 1993, requiring agencies to insure that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. The Board's review found that changing the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent with the legal and regulatory time limits for filing with the Federal courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both of which can potentially review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed change will help to eliminate possible confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board. The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1209 Administrative practice and procedure, Civil rights, Government employees. Accordingly, the Board proposes to amend 5 CFR part 1209 as follows: PART 1209_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 1209 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1204, 1221, 2302(b)(8) and 7701. ยง1209.5 [Amended] 2. Section 1209.5 is amended by removing the number ``20'' in paragraph (c); and by adding in its place the number ``30''. Dated: April 13, 1994. Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board.
