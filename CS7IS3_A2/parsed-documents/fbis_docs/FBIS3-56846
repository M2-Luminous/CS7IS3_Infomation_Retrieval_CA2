The Baltic leaders responded instantly. The point of their statement cam down to the fact that Russia's viewpoint is unacceptable to Latvia and Estonia, which continue to insist on the speediest withdrawal of troops and do not want to come within the sphere of anyone's interests. The U.S. State Department has stated that it intends to appeal to the Russian Government for explanations and that Kozyrev's words radically contradict the position voiced by Boris Yeltsin during recent talks with Bill Clinton. A few hours after the TASS report Foreign Ministry officials, answering telephone calls from Russian and foreign journalists, began to issue denials. According to a employee of the information and press department, ITAR-TASS took Kozyrev's words out of context and distorted their meaning: "Addressing a meeting with Russian ambassadors to the countries of `nearby foreign parts,' the minister spoke of the need to strengthen ties with all republics of the former USSR, including the Baltic states. He then turned to military issues and here there was talk only of CIS members. That is, his words about retaining a Russian military presence in the zone of vitally important interests in no way apply to the Baltics. That cannot be understood from the ITAR-TASS report: You formed the impression that Kozyrev had in mind all former Soviet republics." The incident would seem to be exhausted. Nonetheless, many questions remain. Why, having learned of the annoying blunder which caused such a barrage of responses, did neither Kozyrev himself nor his press service immediately issue a resolute denial? The Foreign Ministry's official statement on this score will to all appearances be made public only at 1400 on Thursday, at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the information and press department. By noon on 19 January the embassies of the Baltic states in Moscow had not yet been informed that the words ascribed to Kozyrev do not accord with reality. The denial was remarkably limp. As a result half a day was lost -- during this time foreign newspapers and agencies and radio and television broadcast many commentaries far from favorable to Russia and its foreign policy department and its chief.
