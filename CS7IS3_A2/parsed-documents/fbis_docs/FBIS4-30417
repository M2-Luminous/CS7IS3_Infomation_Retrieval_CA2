An informed official source said Saturday the draft covers the summit's date and place, the number of attendants and the period of visits. The source said the government believes the first summit talks should occur by mid-July at the latest and that Seoul or Pyongyang should be the site. Panmunjom is not included in the Seoul side's list of candidate venues for the summit talks, he said. The government welcomed North Korea's selection of Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Unification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, as its chief delegate to the South-North preparatory contact next Tuesday. Noting that Kim belongs to the faction advocating more openness, a Seoul official said his selection may well point to Pyongyang's good intentions toward the proposed summit. North Korea informed the South Saturday morning that it had chosen Kim as chief delegate to next Tuesday's contact. The two other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun, a State Council member.
