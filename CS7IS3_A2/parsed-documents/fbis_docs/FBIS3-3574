A survey shows that the region has 9,180 such enterprises employing 51,000 people. Their gross income last year amounted to 310 million yuan, an increase of 24 percent over the previous year. This highland region began to develop rural enterprises later than the interior parts of the country. A local official said that the expansion of rural enterprises is giving the local people a faint sense of commodity economy and helping to rationalize and boost the local economy. The official acknowledged that Tibet's rural enterprises are concentrated in cities and towns and are developing unevenly.
