[Begin Tomas recording] The efforts being made by the government, all men of good will -- notably those in the churches and international organizations represented here -- and the people of Cabinda Province at large, have finally allowed consensus to be sought on the basis of majority so that Cabinda's problems can be settled at the negotiating table, rather than by taking up arms. To us, it has been a source of satisfaction and pride to learn that, finally, our brethren in the Renewed Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave, the Cabinda Democratic Front, the Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, the Movement of Resistance for the Total Independence of Cabinda [words indistinct] have decided to build a common front called the Cabinda Nationalist Forum, Fonac, that will seek to create favorable conditions for future talks with the government of the Republic of Angola. This is a patriotic stand. Taking into account the suffering of their people, they have decided to write yet another brilliant page in the history book of our heroic people of Cabinda, in line with our ancestors' teachings. We sincerely hope that this initiative will not be aborted, as has happened with so many other initiatives in our recent history. We would also like to convey to our Cabinda brethren our wish that the negative influence of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola will not harm their interests. [end recording]
