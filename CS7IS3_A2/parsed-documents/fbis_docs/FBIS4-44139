At a news conference in parliament today, Yilmaz charged that Turkey is experiencing the most severe economic crisis since the establishment of the republic, the number of workers dismissed from work is increasing, and inflation has reached 140 percent in five months. [passage omitted] In addition to the economic crisis, Yilmaz noted, we are also experiencing a judicial crisis. He remarked that the decision of the judiciary is not being implemented despite a binding constitutional article on the subject. [Begin Yilmaz recording] It has become clear that through the constitutional amendments, the government actually wants to ensure the continued membership of DEP [Democracy Party] deputies in the Assembly by changing Article 84, and to prevent any possibility of by-elections. The prime minister, who boasted of having ousted the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] from the Assembly during the local elections -- referring to DEP deputies -- and who said that DEP deputies are the shadow of the PKK in the Assembly, is now trying to amend the Constitution in order to keep the DEP deputies in the Assembly. This, in turn, is the work of a mentality unable to see even two months ahead, the same mentality that prevails in the economic area. [end recording] Yilmaz pointed out that the government is allowing the Assembly to go into recess while the interparty constitutional committee decided to continue to work. The differences of views with regard to Article 24 can easily be overcome, Yilmaz stated. Explaining that ANAP is not responsible for the deadlock, Yilmaz claimed that the deadlock was caused when the other coalition partner changed its stand and used secularism as a life jacket in politics. The ANAP leader said: As the Assembly is going into recess, the issues included in the government's democratization package have been suspended. Now, our nation will carefully follow the next actions of the Social Democratic Populist Party, which declared that it will leave the coalition if the democratization package is not passed.
