During her news conference at the Holiday Inn Hotel, Ciller said: "Turkey is facing an expanding terrorist movement that has assumed the nature of a militia movement. We know the names of the businessmen and artists from whom PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] levies money. We will call them to account." Behcet Canturk, a Kurdish businessman from Lice, became the first victim following Ciller's statement targeting Kurdish businessmen. Two days after being abducted in Istanbul on 15 January 1994, Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu were found dead in Sapanca district of Adapazari.
