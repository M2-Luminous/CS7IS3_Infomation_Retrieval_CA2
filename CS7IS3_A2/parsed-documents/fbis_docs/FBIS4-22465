Chikin: Your Grace, I often have to address the most diverse audiences--in terms of age, in terms of social composition, in terms of political views. In addition, I regularly familiarize myself with the extensive readers' mailbag. All this enables me to conclude that the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in our life is becoming increasingly material. This is connected to a large extent, I believe, with your efforts for the spiritual, Orthodox-patriotic enlightenment of society, the revival of Russian national self-awareness, and the preaching of mercy and love, righteousness and piety. In our society today, which is rent by discord, there are many forces that would not be averse to portraying the church as their political ally. It is sufficient to point to the efforts being exerted for this by the present ruling regime. You, Your Eminence, despite your clear civic, patriotic position, have until recently rejected all suggestions that you link your name with any political force whatever. You were always above this. But quite recently you responded to our request and blessed the initiative of certain politicians, journalists, and cultural figures who announced the creation of the broad public movement Accord in the Name of Russia. It is the first time that a man of the church of so high a rank has "intervened in politics," on the side of the "center-left opposition," what is more. What prompted you to make this decision? Are you not afraid of charges of political intriguing? Metropolitan IOANN: I fear no charges. It is important that I keep my conscience clear before the impartial Day of Judgment, but the common talk of man does not frighten me--it is transient, frivolous, and rash. As far, however, as my "intervention in politics" is concerned, things need to be made clear here in order to avoid possible misunderstandings. I am, as before, free of any party predilections whatever. This goes against the grain for many people. The news media have repeatedly pronounced me at times a communist, at times a nationalist, at times (as soon as they could bring themselves to say it!) a fascist even and pogrom instigator, virtually. There is nothing surprising in this for the stern words of ecclesiastical understanding and paternal arch-pastoral denunciation are pleasing to far from everyone in the present lacerated Russia. Black-hearted people are endeavoring to evade the expository light of Christ's truth and ecclesiastical grace. Evil, generally, cannot stand the truth and always attempts to debase and calumniate it. But we must not give way to despair. The Lord said in Holy Scripture: "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven..." (Matthew, 5, 11) I consider it essential to emphasize that I do not distinguish between "right" and "left," "liberals" and the "supporters of strict authority." I endeavor merely, to the best of my abilities, to distinguish well-intentioned people sick at heart for the profaned motherland from the ill-intentioned destroyers who have reduced my unhappy country and my kind-hearted, trustful people to the shame in which they now find themselves. While being outside of politics, the church cannot, for all that, be outside of society, outside of life, pretending not to notice the orgy that has been put on in Rus by Christ-haters, corrupters, and Satanists of various stripes. So I did not bless the "opposition" as such for I am not a politician. But, on the other hand, I joyfully blessed the pious intentions of people who appealed to me for support and assistance. After they had said to me: "Your Eminence, Russia is dying. Bless us, we wish to make every possible effort to halt this monstrous process and revive our common fatherland in the strength and glory of its past grandeur"--some kind of Russian Orthodox archbishop I would have been had I refused this blessing. For the first time leaders of an influential political grouping appealed directly for benediction and spiritual support to the church hierarchy. And this invests all of us with a great deal of responsibility. Although I am not so naive as not to understand the entire complexity of the current apportionment of forces, ascribing to myself some special role. In addition, the events of "Black October," when the church was cynically used as a screen by political intriguers conducting under the cover of the negotiations at the Danilov Monastery preparations for a large-scale provocation, taught all of us a thing or two. So it needs to be said clearly that the archbishop's blessing is given for selfless, sacrificial labor in the name of salvation of the dying fatherland, the unification of all healthy forces of society, an end to the discord, and for spiritual devotion, not political games, backstage machinations, and the struggle for office. The main thing today is to find the ground for unification, not allow oneself to be pulled into another bloody "showdown," and to ensure the evolutionary, predictable development of events in the country. I believe this to be the sole possible path, which should be taken jointly by everyone: the government and parliament and the opposition and the "power party." No one should ever be accused indiscriminately, en masse. I am convinced that the vast majority of politicians, wherever they are--in the structures of the executive, legislature, or judiciary--could reach agreement if they could isolate themselves from the baneful influence of extremism. V. CHIKIN: This is true, nonetheless, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the politicians, like society as a whole, are today considerably disunited. Each has his own view of the causes of the present drama, his own prescription of a way out of the crisis, his own circle of followers. On the one hand this creates favorable soil for compromise for the most sober-minded and farsighted are beginning to understand that under the current conditions no one can cope with the general problem alone and that the alternative to broad patriotic unification can only be chaos, an intensification of the discord, and an endless succession of "Praetorian" palace coups. But, on the other, there is always the temptation to emphasize one's own exclusiveness and significance. What, in your view, should the unificatory platform be? Metropolitan IOANN: We should be united first and foremost by the danger of general perdition, seeing the growth of the trends of disintegration of Russia's millennial sovereign statehood. We should unite on the basis of our centuries-old holy places, moral and civic values, and fidelity to the best traditions of Russian history and culture. Unfortunately, certain present extremist reformers, who have inherited the worst traits of the terrorist--"Bolshevik"--self- awareness, have already cost Russia incredible sacrifices and are moving in the direction of the creation in our country, which is rapidly becoming destitute, of a power monstrous in its cynicism-- corrupt and uncontrolled and concealing behind pseudo-democratic rhetoric utter scorn for the laws and a single-minded aspiration to dictatorship. Their unchecked, heedless, and irresponsible experimenting has brought our motherland to the brink of state, economic, political, and spiritual catastrophe. But an end must be put to the omnipotence of the petty politicians who have ruthlessly crippled Russia beneath the demagogic "Reforms at any price" slogan. The death of the country must not be the appalling price of the arrogant aspirations of a handful of power- lovers. It can be averted solely, however, on the path of a responsible and thorough search for ways of national reconciliation and the mobilization of all healthy social forces prepared in the name of the fatherland to rise above their opportunist mercenary interests. The basis of this unification should be a comprehensive and integral patriotic ideology designed to revive in society the flouted sense of national dignity and cleanse the mass consciousness of the legacy of group and class enmity, state and religious nihilism, and aspirituality and amorality. The undoubted priorities in this sacred cause of the reconstitution of Greater Russia as a healthy, conciliary organism, responsible component of the international community, and most important guarantor of geopolitical balance in the world are the restoration of the historical continuity of its development; reunification of the artificially disarticulated Russian people and the reconstitution of the conciliary trinity of Great Russians, White Russians, and Little Russians; and the strengthening of all moral-religious foundations, which from age to age inspired our valorous forefathers to endeavors for the good of the beloved fatherland. In addition, it is vitally necessary today to ascertain and support a responsible and authoritative political leader who can rally the nation, having harmoniously and constructively united the efforts of all who sincerely take to heart the country's fate. Only such a leader may be a real guarantor of national accord, rein in the growing chaos in the economy and the turmoil in politics, emphatically and commandingly introducing to the life of society a strict legal framework and having excluded violence from the arsenal of political struggle, standing "above the fray" in the role of peacemaker and impartial judge, not provocateur and instigator. It should be understood, of course, that we are all faced with an unprecedented historical choice threatening Russia with the chaos of collapse and a slide into the abyss of historical nonexistence. We need to recognize the far-reaching complexity of the tasks of revival confronting a society rent by discord. Grant us, Lord, the patience, courage, and faith necessary on this onerous path.... V. CHIKIN: The opposition has been attempting for several years now to formulate a patriotic ideological platform which would be a foundation for the joint actions of all healthy forces and has invariably failed. All this ends in its basic ideas ultimately being intercepted and used with ill intent by our political opponents. Could you, Your Eminence, indicate if only the general features of the ideology of a Russian revival capable, in your view, of imparting to all of us the necessary creative, unifying impetus which Russia is lacking today? Metropolitan IOANN: Politics is today, unfortunately, chiefly a sphere of the operation of human passions, a sphere of the clash of ambitions and desires, a field of the domination of the love of power, vanity, and pride. Politicians are failing to formulate a common "ideology of revival" because they approach this matter in exclusively opportunist fashion, regarding such ideology as a mechanism of the control of society, not as the result of profound, conceptualized, and substantiated convictions arrived at through much suffering. Everyone wants to have an ideology "for himself" and is prepared for any artificial manipulations, provided that he stand out from the common herd. I speak of this not in condemnation but in sorrow for it is the present discord which is the result of this approach. It remains only to wait and hope that with God's help common sense ultimately prevails, for all that, over personal ambitions. The Accord in the Name of Russia affords such a hope. As far, however, as the availability of an ideological platform suitable for Russia's revival is concerned, it does, of course, exist. And, what is particularly important, there is no need for it to be specially devised or artificially designed. It is necessary only to avail ourselves of the giant spiritual experience which the Russian people have accumulated in the time of their sovereign existence. After all, it is perfectly obvious today even that the reviving Russian national self-awareness is gravitating in all parameters toward the fullest possible restoration of the historical continuity interrupted in the 20th century by a whole series of devastating military clashes and powerful social cataclysms. Despite, however, the catastrophic nature of Russian history, Russia has thus far ultimately emerged from all upheavals and discord even stronger than it was before they started. The unique spiritual qualities of the Russian national-religious self-awareness has contributed primarily to this course of events. For many centuries it has been based on three fundamental philosophical archetypes. The first--the archetype of sovereignty-- has traditionally appeared in the mass consciousness as the ideology of Russian imperialism presupposing conviction as to the universal peacemaking role of Russian statehood. As distinct from its West European brethren, Russian imperialism was never of an aggressive nature, militarist even less. Its underlying slogan: "Moscow is the third Rome," postulated an understanding of the empire, the state, as the optimum state form for the spiritual-- religious and cultural--development of society in accordance with the moral imperatives of the Christian religion. The sovereign might of the state was not regarded as an end in itself here but merely as the means of the protection and defense of the traditional values and objects of worship of national life. The second archetype of Russian self-awareness--the archetype of conciliarism--takes the form of an ideology of Russian nationalism. And once again, in contrast to aggressive European nationalism, this ideology was in Rus always of a conservative- protective, peacemaking nature and paternally protective in relation to the small peoples living in Russia. Its foundation was the unreservedly just assertion that it is the Russian people (taken in their triune conciliary fullness together with Little Russians and White Russians as a spiritual, not only ethnic, community) who are the most important custodian of the sovereign consciousness, pillar of Russian statehood, and its dependable guard. The third, most important, profound, and ancient, archetype of Russian self-awareness is firmly connected with Orthodox ecclesiasticism and is formalized philosophically in the ideology of Russian religious messianism. Its development was the natural result of the ineradicable impact made by the Orthodox Church on the entire system of Russian being--eternal, family, social, and state. The basis of this philosophy is the belief that the highest, providential duty of the Russian people-- the "Chosen People"--is the obligation to preserve the dogmatic and moral ideals of Christianity and to carry them undefiled through all obstacles, misfortunes, and disasters. This ideology, just like the first two, is of a clearly expressed introverted, that is, nonaggressive, peaceful nature. It was these three philosophical archetypes that were reduced to one in the Russian slogan "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, People," which remained the social slogan of Russia right up to the 1917 revolution. It is they--in updated, modern form--that should be made the basis of the new, reviving Russia, which will combine within it all that is best that was cultivated by Russian life both in ancient times and in the recent past.... V. CHIKIN: But today many of the concepts among those about which you have been speaking are being earnestly discredited by the news media. Could they consolidate a mass consciousness still subject to the powerful influence of television rot?! Metropolitan IOANN: First, I do not insist on some definite terms: What is important is the essence, not the name. Second, a real ideology of Russian revival should be geared to the long term. We need to know how to wait because, after all, it will take time for our national self-awareness to return to its natural forms. Even the branch of a tree weighed down by a heavy load does not straighten immediately. One thing can be said for sure: The process of Russian revival is today under way tumultuously, its direction has been determined, and any political force that dares to ignore this is doomed to vanish from the Russian front stage in the coming years even. V. CHIKIN: But such a natural process could be interrupted at any moment. Does not the dreadful example of the October carnage in Moscow confirm this? Metropolitan IOANN: It confirms precisely the opposite for, despite the Black October and the forced brain-washing before the December elections, their results confirmed the powerful national-patriotic shift that has occurred in public opinion as of late. I believe, incidentally, that the Accord in the Name of Russia initiative is to a considerable extent the result of a general burning need for a unification of efforts in order to prevent extremists and provocateurs availing themselves of the fruit of these processes. It is not, after all, a question of which office one occupies but of the first outlines of the truly constructive interaction of very dissimilar people beginning to emerge. I, in any event, will make every effort to ensure that this be the case for I see this as an opportunity to contribute the best I can to the conciliation of suffering Russia and the achievement of the national accord and civil peace so desired by us all.
