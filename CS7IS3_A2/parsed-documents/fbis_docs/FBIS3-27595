The situation has attracted overseas investors into the huge market in this field. This is a view shared by representatives of nearly 20 overseas business offices in Beijing, as shown in recent interviews with XINHUA when asked about China's investment environment. According to Chun Song-Chin, chief representative of the Beijing office of the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation from the Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government has long been aware of the importance of developing its infrastructure and has put large sums into it, as signally manifested by its determination to build the three gorges project and some other large water conservancy projects. Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of Germany's BASF Chemical Corporation, appreciated China's rapid development in telecommunications, saying that when the BASF came to China at the beginning of the '80s, China's telecommunication facilities were very backward, especially international telecommunication services. But now, he said, China's telecommunications system was much better, with portable telephones and pagers widely in use. H.T. Kung, director of the Public Relations Department of the AT&T China Company, noted that China has invested heavily in the development of telecommunications satellites, cables and program- controlled telephones, which will increase the telephone users rate from 2.15 percent of the population last year to 3 percent this year, and the rate is expected to reach 6 to 7 percent by the end of this century. He added that this will in turn greatly promote China's economic development. China's communication's development also left a strong impression on these overseas business people. They felt that China's transport systems have been improved drastically, with great increases in the handling capacity of ports like Tianjin, Dalian and Shanghai, construction of more highways and electrification of railways, and opening of more domestic and international air routes. They said, however, that China's infrastructure, still a weak point in China's investment environment, was lagging behind China's economic development, while from a long-term point of view, this field holds a huge market and vast potential for overseas investors who are also eager to be involved in this development. With the speeding up of China's reform and opening up, Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of the Beijing office of the U.S.-China Business Council which has more than 250 U.S. member corporations, said that more and more U.S. companies want to take part in China's construction of airports, railways, highways and power stations, which has created a "craze" in the U.S. On China's working efficiency and the quality of its personnel, these business executives believed that "the change in people's hearts and heads" and improvement of education are vitally important to China's reform and further improvement of China's investment environment. On this point, China's finance sector attracts more of their interest. They said that they were pleased to see so many professional Chinese people engaged in that sector. While thinking highly of the service of China's banks, they expressed their expectation of even better services in the future. Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that Chinese Government officials are "more open, more cooperative and more efficient." He took Du Pont as an example: the first contract signed in 1991 between Du Pont and China took a year and a half to achieve, while the second one signed last year only took a year, and the third one which is under negotiation is expected to be signed in several months.
