As an example of this, Lage mentioned the tourism and oil extraction industries, which are going to continue to grow. He went on to say that tobacco production must be elevated starting with the current harvest and that transformations are being made in citrus, cement, and shrimp production. Lage warned that the current year will be a difficult one due to the fact that the production level of the current sugar harvest remains low and that the rest of the areas of income do not compensate for this drop. He pointed out that such results in the main industry are due to the lack of resources to secure it. Lage went on to say that the functioning of the economy and the life of the population will improve as we see a recovery in production. Lage underscored the importance of stopping the decline in production and of producing more than in the past harvest, since in the past years each harvest has been smaller. He underscored that such an accomplishment would mark a turning point in the economy. Regarding the upcoming session of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], Lage stated that specific measures will not come out of those debates because to adopt such measures requires a high level of instrumentation and precision, which cannot be achieved in such a broad forum. [Begin Lage recording] I would say that the assembly has great importance because of the significance of the issue that will be analyzed: the economy, something that is very important and that at the moment is of great interest. As everyone knows, we have an excess of currency which is the result of the (?decline) in production. This situation must be rectified. We must balance the money that is circulating among the population, and the money that is printed periodically, with the offer of goods to the population. This problem was originated by a policy of justice that the revolution adopted in face of the situation that was created with the collapse of the Socialist Bloc. In an attempt to level the prices, so that people with higher incomes would not be the only ones with access to goods, the revolution tried to establish a more equitable distribution of goods. This distribution was even more rationed than before, so that everyone could have access to those goods. Now we hope to rectify gradually the imbalance which has been created, as we gradually recover our levels of production and the situation is normalized. To a certain extent, this assembly will also summarize the process of the workers parliaments, the assemblies which gathered all those opinions, and the meeting by the plenum of the national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation. I would say that the assembly will summarize that whole process. Specific measures will not come out of that assembly. Those measures require a level of instrumentation and precision that cannot be obtained in a discussion among 500 people. Those decisions must be taken by the leadership of the government. The assembly should make recommendations. It should instruct the government and make recommendations and explanations as to what direction the government should take in making those decisions so that in the following weeks we can begin to see the progressive application of the measures that are finally adopted. Therefore, I believe that the assembly that will be held on 1 May, will be very important and will be given extensive coverage. [end recording]
