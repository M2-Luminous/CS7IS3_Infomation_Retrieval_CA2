Kobets, people's deputy of the Russian Federation, dropped into my office during the first half of the day on 20 September. He reported that a session of the Collegium of the Ministry of Defense had just concluded, which was attended by many commanders of troop arms and military districts. K. Kobets informed me that the session had been convened at the initiative of the Minister and at B. Yeltsin's instructions. The Army's participation in possible armed events in the city of Moscow was discussed. There was discussion of the possibility of establishing direct presidential control in the nation on 20 or 21 September, and it was proposed that the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation be dispersed. This would be formalized in a message from the President to the people and in a corresponding decree. This could result in various extreme acts and armed confrontations. Nothing was said about who was to be fought and who was to be protected, however. Many Collegium members were absolutely opposed to the Army's participation in the suppression of street disturbances. This was the function of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Troops. Obviously anticipating the course of events, the Minister of Defense attempted to convince the Collegium members that it might be necessary to move troops into Moscow. "During our discussion a phone call came in on the direct line from the President. I could not hear what Yeltsin said. We could only see," K. Kobets said, "that after the words `Just what would you have me to do? Take the `White House' by storm? The Army is outside of politics. You have repeatedly said so yourself!' the Minister's face turned very red and he was not feeling well. They hung up at the other end. The Minister went into another room and took some medicine. Some time later he returned. The Collegium members and those present unanimously decided to observe strict neutrality and not be drawn into any street disturbances." After listening to General K. Kobets, I asked him to report on the session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium to R. Khazbulatov, and he headed for there. I would like to deviate somewhat here from the chronology of events. Special circumstances had brought me into contact with General K. Kobets and certain other generals. It so happened that from the very beginning of my chairmanship of the Commission on the Budget, Plans, Taxes and Prices and then my deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet, hardly not a week went by in which the heads of the MO [Ministry of Defense], the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the MB [Ministry of Security] did not come to me, mainly on matters pertaining to legislative support for the functioning of those agencies, their financing, material and technical support, decisions on the induction of the youth into the army and so forth. Before becoming a member of the Supreme Soviet I worked at defense enterprises in Tataria and then in the Defense Section of the Tatarsk Oblast party committee. I was frequently in the forces, at various military anniversaries, and took part in formal and family dinners with the generals. They all spoke aloud, without inhibition, of the absence of a precisely defined military doctrine in the nation, talked with suffering about the army's disintegration and the decline of its prestige in the world arena. The only thing they discussed in a lowered voice was who had control of the nuclear button. God forbid that someone should hear that. Nor were they secretive about the causes of the crisis: "What kind of minister do we have"? He was referred to with the same extremely diminutive name used for him throughout the army. This was not familiarity; it was a reflection of the pinnacle of competence. No one referred to Generals Kolesnikov, Mironov or Deynikin in a familiar, simplified manner. They were personalities, although they too were caught up in the "Rodionov syndrome" at a crucial time for Russia. There was nothing surprising about that; the army was torn down, persecuted, degraded and insulted on all sides. I would point out that this syndrome came into being in the army following the Tbilisi tragedy, in which neo-democrat Sobchak left a black mark. What rage and what thunderbolts he leveled against the command element of the Transcaucasus Military District and the Ministry of Defense as a People's Deputy of the USSR! And it was, after all, thanks to the army that a terrible bloodbath was avoided in Georgia back then, on 9 April 1989. A large disaster was prevented then. Later, this was no longer possible; the army was forced to take a "neutral position." Let the result be judged by those who at this difficult time either remained silent or capitulated to "democrat" Sobchak or took up his position without realizing it, "falling in love with" the sparkling eyes of this destroyer of the nation. Ultimately, what began with Sobchak's offering led to the Army's direct breakdown. The U.S. has long exercised control over Russia's key areas, of course: politics and the economy. It has now reached even the Army. Many people are probably aware that during Minister of Defense P. Grachev's visit to the U.S. agreement was reached on the establishment of a joint American-Russian "peacekeeping" force out of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and Russia's 27th Motorized-Rifle Division. The most amazing thing is that the Russian Minister agreed to the possibility of their use in the CIS countries during a "special period." If, during the recent fall, victory had gone to the Constitution and the Congress of People's Deputies, the possibility cannot be ruled out that Russians would have "gotten to known" firsthand American rapid-reaction forces at strategic CIS facilities: atomic power plants, nuclear installations and so forth. ...The phone on the direct line to R. Khazbulatov rang. He asked us to come to his office immediately. Present there were Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, People's Deputy of Russia V. Achadov, advisor on Military Affairs to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, Vice President A. Rutskoy and A. Korovnikov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee. M. Kolesnikov had already reported to them on the session of the Collegium of the Ministry of Defense. "Mikhail Petrovich has just told us about the session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium. Everything K. Kobets said is confirmed. The Army will adhere to the concept that it is 'outside of politics,'" R. Khazbulatov said. "What are we going to do"? "We need officially to summon the Minister of Defense to the Supreme Soviet and clarify the situation," someone said. Grachev was not to be found an hour after that or later, however. Nor did he respond to attempts to contact him. We asked M. Kolesnikov jointly with K. Kobets to write a report to the Supreme Soviet. The Chief of the General Staff promised to write the report and bring it to us in an hour. R. Khazbulatov later told me that M. Kolesnikov came to see him an hour later and confirmed everything orally but refused to prepare a written document. From that moment the Army began slowly but certainly to enter into the scenario of a coup d'etat, first demonstrating neutrality toward B. Yeltsin's unconstitutional actions (and this actually played into his hand) and then taking action in support of the putsch. Throughout all those days, right up until I left the House of Soviets, I spoke with K. Kobets by phone three or four times a day. Like us, he was upset by the fact that the lights had been turned off, there was no hot water and it was not permitted to bring in fuel, food or medicine. He believed that this was being done by brainless blockheads to get the people to rise up and come to the House of Soviets. For my part, I too complained that power and telephone lines had been disconnected in the Ministry of Defense on 23 September, organic weapons had been taken from ministry workers and generals, and two guards from other departments had been posted at each door. And the generals tolerated this, quietly and timidly discussing the issues raised by the political crisis. The situation surrounding the Ministry of Defense was heating up, and it was impossible not to see this. The degree of secrecy in the Army increased by the day. M.P. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, issued a special document altering the procedure for telephone communication between the central agencies of military command and control and the troops. This was unprecedented in peacetime. It essentially meant that Ministry of Defense staff could not independently contact a single military subunit (division, regiment) even on a secure line. Only the chief of the corresponding staff of the troop arm could issue the order, after learning the content of the forthcoming discussion. All of this shows that neither B. Yeltsin nor P. Grachev was certain how the Army, including the top generals, would conduct themselves in that non-authorized situation which developed after 21 September. They were attempting not only to prevent the "leakage of information" but also to make it difficult for the opponents of Yeltsin and Grachev in the Ministry itself to join forces. Was General K. Kobets aware of this? I believe he was. At least one fact led me to doubt it. Some Secretariat staff members came to the office and told me: "Look, Yuriy Mikhaylovich, General K. Kobets is allegedly in touch with events on Leningradskiy Prospekt and is giving an interview at the Headquarters of the CIS Joint Armed Forces, stating that the Army is being ordered to shoot at people. "That cannot be," I replied, although I was beginning to have doubts. People could not make up such things. I phoned K. Kobets and was told by his orderly: "He is at the General Staff and will not be back soon. As soon as he arrives, I shall put him through to you." I phoned Kobets' dacha. His wife answered. Since we are on friendly terms, we chatted for a awhile, and I asked her whether she had heard Konstantin Ivanovich's TV presentation. "No," she answered, "I did not. He is in some kind of mess again." Much to my surprise, some time later I was told that Minister Grachev had personally played back a recording of our conversation for General K. Kobets as proof of his wife's "underground" activities and apparently hinted that his phone was also being tapped. Even in that situation we still considered it more acceptable to use the Army in the capacity of "blue helmets" for separating the "White House" and the police. Up to the tragic events of 3-4 October Russia's people's deputies, the heads of Federation subjects and the leaders of trade unions and parties did not believe that the government could make a decision to storm the House of Soviets. Unfortunately, independent experts with contacts with the President's administration and with the power structures maintained the opposite. The scenario had been worked out long before. According to Yeltsin, the "artillery preparation" was over. Only the actual storming remained. The date for it was postponed from one day to the next. The breakthrough of the blockade and the storming of important facilities (which ones was another question) had been set forth in the scenario and repeatedly approved. A game of nerves began. Beginning on 22 September telegrams began coming in to the Supreme Soviet and to R. Khazbulatov personally from the military district commanders, in which they proposed a "zero option" and simultaneous, early elections for the President and the Supreme Soviet. This concept later became the basis of the negotiating process at the Saint Daniel Monastery. I also informed K. Kobets of this. The "zero option" demanded great courage of the authors of Decree No. 1400, however. After all, it actually involved rescinding it or suspending it if worse came to worst. We understood all of the political complexity involved in such a decision, particularly for B. Yeltsin and those around him, but we were hoping they would be sensible for the sake of Russia. Unfortunately, our hopes were not justified. Representatives of the General Staff and of the military districts made their way to the Supreme Soviet, particularly in the first stage, who, like P. Deynikin, M. Kolesnikov and V. Mironov, declared that they understood the political situation, understood that an unconstitutional coup d'etat had been carried out but that they would not intervene yet but wait to see how events developed. Too many times the politicians had coerced the Army in the past and then abandoned and made scapegoats of the generals. On Sunday night a group of officers from one of the units in the Moscow PVO [Air Defense] District led by a colonel went over to the side of the parliament. In an interview with an Interfax correspondent inside the House of Soviets, the servicemen, who requested that they not be named, gave as the motive for their decision their absolute disagreement with B. Yeltsin's position. According to them, many other servicemen in their unit had also expressed a desire to go to the "White House", but the officers had not wanted to draw first-term servicemen into the conflict. The officers confirmed the fact that the Army was split but that it must defend the Constitution. It was apparent that following promulgation of the 21 September decree and the execution of the coup d'etat, Yeltsin's team had seen that it did not have the necessary support either in Moscow or regionally. The Muscovites, who staged numerous demonstrations and rallies, were on the side of the House of Soviets. Consequently, the Army and its leadership would still have to be "broken." Only the excuse was needed, an act of great provocation. And this soon occurred: the "breakthrough" by Muscovites of the ring blockading the House of Soviets, the "storming" of the mayor's office, "Ostankino." I underscore the fact: Those were acts of provocation. "Everyone," A. Rutskoy said, "is drawing the Army to the `White House.'" "But then General K. Kobets promised to use it only in the capacity of `blue helmets.'" "I do not believe your Kobets or Grachev! They betrayed us once, and they will do it again. I was told," A. Rutskoy said, "that there is a split in the Ministry of Defense leadership over the use of the Army and its introduction into Moscow. Pashka is calling the divisions and regiments himself, over the heads of the commanders. And your beloved People's Deputy K. Kobets agreed to head an operational group to stabilize the situation in the city, which actually means firing upon the peaceful population. It is at his orders that aimed fire is being leveled against the House of Soviets." Indeed, at a session of the Collegium of the Ministry of Defense held on the night of 3 October, a number of district commanders expressed their disagreement with the President's orders pertaining to supporting the status of the extraordinary situation in Moscow. All evening and all night from Sunday to Monday the President attempted to convince the generals of the need for a final assault on the House of Soviets. P. Grachev and K. Kobets did not need to be convinced; they agreed with it all. What was A. Rutskoy to reply? We heard over a special radio unit that armored personnel carriers and personnel of the Kremlin and Tula airborne divisions had begun moving toward Moscow. Subunits of the Ryazan Airborne Division were being moved up. We saw all of this at 07:00 on the morning of 4 October. Breaking through the barricades near the parliament building, five BMP penetrated to Free Russia Square and moved to the opposite side of the square. The armored personnel carriers and infantry combat vehicles began shelling the barricades and tents and opened fire at windows in the House of Soviets. The first round razed a tent on the square with sleeping Muscovites inside. Three bodies were left lying on the street. Subunits of the Tula Airborne Division, which had taken the place of the police and soldiers in the internal troops, closed the ring around the House of Soviets. At 08:30 the soldiers began approaching the building in bounds, while the armored personnel carriers and infantry combat vehicles opened fire on the parliament building. Ten tanks from the Kantemir Division were moved onto the bridge and the opposite side of the Moscow River to provide fire support. After several volleys fire broke out on the 12th and 13th floor of the House of Soviets. Over police radio R. Khazbulatov, Father Nikon and I constantly called upon the troops to cease fire and begin negotiations. The response was nothing but verbal abuse and a disinclination to engage in any sort of dialog. The artillery fire intensified. The movement of troops, equipment and police forces in the direction of the House of Soviets increased by the hour. Reinforcements were constantly joining them. Most of the fire on the "White House" came from the direction of the American embassy, from the Hotel Mir and the quay near the Hotel Ukraina. Snipers plastered anything moving inside the "White House" from all sides. A transition from a democratic regime to authoritarian rule had actually occurred in Russia. Tanks fired on the Supreme Soviet to the applause of world "civilization" and the approving yells of neo-democrats. I phoned K. Kobets' headquarters once more. Colonel-General D. Volkogonov, people's deputy of the Russian Federation, picked up the phone. In a cold and steel-edged voice he told me: "The situation has changed. The President has signed an order as Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the Minister of Defense on the storming of the House of Soviets and has assumed full responsibility. We shall quell the putsch at any cost. Army forces will establish order in Moscow. When the people's deputies of Russia were led out of the House of Soviets and were standing on the central, marble staircase, many of them asked one another: "Why did they shell the 'White House' in such a ruthless, demonstrative and ostentatious manner"? So much has been written in the mass media on the possibility of taking such buildings with special-purpose forces and Alfa and Vympel subunits, without artillery or outside fire. All the more since Alfa leaders and Deputy Minister of Security V. Stepashin gave assurances that 30-40 minutes would be enough to take the building. We had experience: the capture of the royal palace in Kabul and the operations in Ossetia and Ingushetia. There were therefore other objectives. A scenario worked out long before was being played out. All of us clearly understood that the shelling and the fire in the "White House" was an expensive show, a drama, staged on a grand scale for the West. "See, respected colleagues, how much work and bloodshed we have endured to achieve democracy and the opportunity to continue the political and economic reforms, while you keep waving promises in front of our faces but do not provide financial assistance. This is not gentlemanly"! The writers of the scenario forgot, however, that the House of Soviets would remain in the mind of the population not just in Russia but in the entire former USSR as the champion of their interests, the interests of Russian-language citizens. The Russians remember well who has betrayed them and how many times. Why are those who came to defend the Constitution and the law during those terrible days from the Dniester Region, the Baltic area and Central Asia regarded as butchers? By issuing the unconstitutional Decree No. 1400 on the coup d'etat and announcing that force would be used to break up the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies, B. Yeltsin himself created all of the circumstances necessary for the arrival at the House of Soviets not just of the supporting mass of peaceable people with a certain political orientation but also people prepared to defend the Constitution and the parliament being dispersed, bearing weapons. In the minds of the Russians the House of Soviets continues to represent the citadel of the Congress of PEOPLE'S (I particularly underscore that) Deputies. And the neo-democrats wanted very much to erase the memory of the Supreme Soviet from the minds of the people. In the minds of the Russians they were firing on their memories. It is not surprising that the government made haste in this matter as well. It adopted a decision to perform restoration work in the "White House" by November 1994 and to use the building as the center of government. History will hardly forget that no matter who is housed in that building, it is still the House of Soviets, that it was there that an act of vandalism was perpetrated in the public view, the shelling of Russia. And now... the awarding of the order For Personal Valor to Army Gen Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev, minister of defense of the Russian Federation, and Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets, deputy minister of defense of the Russian Federation, for valor and heroism exhibited in the suppression of armed attempts at a coup d'etat in Moscow on 3-4 October 1993. I am pained by the cynical use of the lofty words "valor" and "heroism" in this Decree. There is no such thing as heroes who fire upon the people.
