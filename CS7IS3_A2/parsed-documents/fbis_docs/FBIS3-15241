The U.S. Administration, with restraint but unequivocally, commended this turn of events; but among observers there were those who detected the "machinations of Moscow" and a "Russian-Serbian plot" in what was quite obviously a humane decision. History also repeats itself as regards lifting the siege of Tuzla airport, Which opens up the possibility of dropping food, medicines, and other aid to the population. According to information received, the first such drop will be made by Russia, but some people in the United States do not like the fact that this knot is also being untied, primarily with the participation of Russia, which is incidentally, acting strictly in keeping with UN resolutions, and is sending its observers to Tuzla as part of the UN's Blue Helmets. The `NEW YORK TIMES', for example, writes that Russia "is offering its troops in order to enable the Serbs to save face, confronted as they are with UN demands," and argues about the hand extended to the Serbs by Russia. Once again Moscow is amply criticized for catching the West unawares by devising a formula acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs -- as though the search for such a formula, opening up the way to humanitarian aid, were not a task that everyone is tackling. One can even hear voices claiming that Russia is, for the second time, depriving NATO of an opportunity to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, in fulfilment of the declared ultimatum, where UN resolutions are not complied with. One has the impression that these resolutions were prompted not by a concern for people, be they Muslims, Croats, or Serbs, not by a desire for peace and the resolution of an extremely complicated Balkan problem, but by a wish to be sure of "punishing" the Serbs. Both the guns being moved away from Sarajevo and the dawning opportunity to provide humanitarian aid to the population of Tuzla are substantial political steps. By accomplishing priority tasks, they are at the same time laying down approaches to more broadly based tasks -- identifying mutual understanding between the sides, establishing cooperation between them, and ultimately settling the chronic Bosnian problem. In my opinion, the prime rating in terms of importance goes to the fact that these steps have become possible. What specific country is making the effort to see that they are implemented is a secondary matter. If a different view is taken, one may cast doubt on the treaty between the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Croats -- even without knowing what it contains -- just because it was signed in Washington after active mediation by the United States and by Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally. In fact, not everyone in the United States welcomed it with open arms. Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser to the President, and now the director of the international policy forum, said that the whole value of the treaty lay merely in the fact that it "allows the diplomats to claim a success." Needless to say, the effectiveness of the document, as with any other, must be judged by the results it produces. But the actual signing ceremony is a starting point and hence an important step. So, Secretary of State Warren Christopher made a fitting comment when he said: "This treaty shows how much can be achieved, even after bitter years of violence, when two sides sit down together at the negotiating table.... It shows that peace is possible." Yes, it is possible if one thinks about peace rather than about "punishing" the Serbs.
