Korea Telecom had failed in the previous two attempts to auction off the shares, about 21 percent of the cellular monopoly, retarding the government's privatization effort. In this new round of bidding, a Korea Telecom spokesman said, institutional investors will be invited to put in tenders. The company also eliminated a regulation that banned buyers from selling the shares within the first year of purchase. The spokesman also said the company will lower the cutoff price for successful bidders. In previous biddings, KMT shares were sold for 335,000 won per share on average. Sunkyong Business Group virtually took over the cellular company by buying up a 23 percent holding in January when Korea Telecom invited tenders to auction off some 44 percent of KMT. Since then Korea Telecom has tried in vain to sell the remaining 21 percent stake. In the second round of bidding Feb. 14 and 15, only 2,380 shares were sold. In the third trial Feb. 28, there were no successful bidders. Once a popular stock on the Seoul Stock Exchange, KMT shares dropped in price from a record high of 407,000 won per share early last month to 300,000 won earlier this month. With the rumors of new incentives, the price began picking up again and KMT shares were selling 316,000 won per share Monday.
