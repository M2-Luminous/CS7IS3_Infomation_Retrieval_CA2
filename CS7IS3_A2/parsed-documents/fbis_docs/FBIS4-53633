In the interview, Kim testified that North Korea's nuclear weapon development is "under way with active financial support from the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] second economic committee, which is under the direct control of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, and, in 1988, North Korea succeeded in extracting 12 kg of plutonium." Kim also disclosed that WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho (in charge of economic affairs, concurrently member of the WPK Politburo) is the top official in charge of the nuclear development project. North Korea's nuclear development has been hidden by a veil of mystery, and this is the first time that the organizational structure of the project is revealed. In North Korea, Kim Tae-ho used to work at the Nuclear Energy Ministry's Namchon Chemical Plant in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province. The uranium refined at the plant is sent to a reprocessing plant in Yongbyon, and becomes fuel for nuclear reactors. In the plant, Kim worked as the leader of a working group, but he is quite well informed of various stories because he used to meet frequently with trade houses officials who supply foreign currencies to the plant. While North Korea's nuclear development project is believed to be managed by the Nuclear Energy Ministry, it is actually under direct control of the WPK second economic committee, Kim said. The committee is reportedly serving as the supreme supervising organization of military and nuclear industries of the nation, and the committee's Fifth General Machinery Industry Bureau is in charge of the nuclear development project. All nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon are administrated by the bureau, which is commanded by WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho under direct instructions from Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. When asked about achievements of the nuclear development project, Kim Tae-ho said several of his friends working as nuclear researchers told him that "North Korea first succeeded in producing plutonium from spent fuel in the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 1988." At that time, Kim Il-song and his son were reportedly so happy that they went down to the Yongbyon plant to give color television sets to all researchers and engineers. Kim added: "They extracted 12 kg of plutonium, and this amount was sufficient to produce two nuclear bombs. Taking into account North Korea's technology level, they may not yet have the bombs, but I believe the bombs are very near completion." Moreover, Kim revealed a military coup was attempted early last year to overthrow Kim Il-song and his son. The coup attempt was reportedly led by Vice Marshal Kim Pong-yul and several generals who studied in the former Soviet Union. Dozens of military officials involved were all captured after their coup plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director Yi Pong-won. Kim said he had heard the story from one of his friends -- a nephew of Yi Pong-won. Kim noted: "North Korea declared a war preparation condition in March 1993. This was not only to cope with international pressures on the nation's nuclear development project, but also to respond to the shocking coup attempt."
