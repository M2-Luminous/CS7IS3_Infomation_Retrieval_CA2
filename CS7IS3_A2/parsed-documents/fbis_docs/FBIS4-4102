FBIS4-4102 "drchi082_w_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-082 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong News Corporation Sells POST Stake to Malaysian Financier News Corporation Sells POST Stake to Malaysian Financier HK2204082494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 22 Apr 94 HK2204082494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Lulu Yu] [Text] Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has agreed to sell its remaining 15.1 percent stake in South China Morning Post Holdings (SCMP) to Malayan United Industries (MUI) -- a Malaysian conglomerate controlled by reclusive tycoon Khoo Kay Peng -- for $1.036bn, giving Malaysian interests a 50 percent holding in the newspaper group. Khoo is a close friend of Robert Kuok, the Malaysian sugar, hotels and property magnate who last year bought a 34.9 percent stake from News Corporation and became the largest single shareholder in the SCMP group. MUI's purchase prompted Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to consider referring the deal to Hong Kong's takeovers panel for inquiry into possible concert party action by the Malaysian tycoons. "We will look into the matter to see if an inquiry is warranted," Robert Nottle, the SFC chairman, said. Under local takeover rules, shareholders whose control reaches 35 percent of a company are required to make a general offer. After the sale, SCMP will remain one of only two foreign controlled newspapers in the territory, the other being the Taiwanese-owned United Daily Chinese-language broadsheet. Although it was widely expected that Murdoch would divest his remaining stake in SCMP, his deal with Khoo came as a surprise. Khoo, a born-again Christian, is believed to have had problems with Malaysian authorities. Late last year, his MUI group sold subsidiaries in MUI Bank and MUI Finance to the Malaysian Hong Leong group and has since then been sitting on a big pile of cash. In February it bought holdings in two Hong Kong companies -- a 52.8 percent stake in travel group Morning Star Holdings and a 30 percent stake in Kuok's Kerry Financial Services, a stockbroking and merchant bank concern. MUI's interests in Malaysia include the Ming Court Hotel chain, cement operations and department stores. It also has a major stake in the revamped New Heritage USA, a large U.S. theme park and resort formerly linked to disgraced Christian television evangelist Jim Bakker. MUI's wholly owned subsidiary, MUI Media, signed an agreement on Wednesday to buy 226.5 million shares at $4.575 each from News Finance (HK), MUI told the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Kuok paid US$349m (about HK$2.7bn), or HK$5.16 a share, for his 34.9 percent stake in October. SCMP shares yesterday closed unchanged at $4.225. Media analysts said the sale should give Murdoch much-needed cash to finance his loss-making Star TV operations and would make little difference to the running of SCMP's newspaper, magazine and publishing business. "The change in ownership should not affect SCMP. There should be some friendly cooperation between the two Malaysian shareholders. The prospects of the paper are not bad, although revenues are not expected to grow significantly," Brian Oung of DBS Securities said. Fred Bowers of Nomura Research Institute said he had been disappointed with SCMP's revenue growth in the past two years and expected the company's margins to shrink. "Its performance has been below expectations. I'm bearish on the stock because of rising labour and newsprint costs," he said. KM Chang of OCBC Investment Research in Kuala Lumpur said MUI's acquisition reflected the group's effort to diversify overseas.
