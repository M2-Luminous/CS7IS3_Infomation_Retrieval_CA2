Economic, political, and financial pressure is followed by constant threats of increasing this pressure, though the history and the essence of this nuclear issue is well-known both in the CIS and the international community. The reaction of public and state structures to this blackmail is diverse. A certain part, as the Supreme Council has stated, is ready to surrender to the domestic and foreign pro-imperial forces, which demand the elimination of nuclear weapons by Ukraine, while the supporters of the absolute independence of Ukraine refuse to eliminate nuclear weapons from Ukrainian territory. This part of the public cannot ignore the sad lessons from the history of Ukraine and the lessons connected with the role of nuclear weapons in the domestic and foreign policy of the imperial elite of the former USSR. The international community knows that the leadership of the erstwhile USSR regarded the nuclear weapons as their strategic force, as effective pressure and their trump card in their expansionist foreign policy. Political and military structures, which existed in the USSR, specified the character of relations between the empire and the Republic of Ukraine. The empire used Ukraine's potential and suppressed its tiny sprouts of democracy, persecuted the tendencies for the revival of the national culture, and threatened all the attempts to gain autonomy, saying nothing about the creation of an independent state; it depressed Ukraine both morally and physically with the help of penitentiaries, working camps, forced hunger, and the murdering of the cream of Ukrainian humanitarian and scientific-technical intelligentsia. Have not you heard threats and claims from Moscow -- the capital of the Russian Federation -- to divide Ukraine or to liquidate its independence along with demands to do away with Ukrainian national- democratic forces? Does not the notorious decision of the Russian legislature from 9 June 1993 repeat the black sides of Ukrainian history? Most importantly, this decision was adopted practically unanimously with seven abstentions and three rejections. Not only well-known chauvinists and supporters of the revival of the empire voted against it, but also the deputies who consider themselves democrats. In my mind, a certain part of the Ukrainian population, which has an ironical attitude toward this decree, is making a terrible mistake. The fact that this decree on Sevastopol was not implemented today means that it will be implemented tomorrow. We should not ignore the fact that tactical nuclear weapons, withdrawn to Russia, have not been destroyed but have been carefully stored. In the midst of all these frightening circumstances, Ukraine is forced to repeat the same actions with its strategic nuclear weapons. It seems to me that the high Ukrainian authorities differ in opinion on this issue. Otherwise, how could you interpret the 17 August 1993 statement of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his visit to Sweden on the fact that in several days, Russia and Ukraine are going to sign an agreement on the elimination of strategic nuclear weapons stationed on the territory of Ukraine. In turn, our former Foreign Minister K. Morozov negatively commented on Kozyrev's statement and refuted it. Briefly, Ukrainian Foreign Minister A. Zlenko issued his statement refuting Morozov's commentary. Therefore, my opinion on the lack of unanimity in the Ukrainian Government has a strong footing. However, currently, only nuclear weapons can guarantee the security and independence of Ukraine. We should not be so naive and shortsighted as to take seriously the promises of the United States to be our guarantor of independence because recent years have demonstrated a real price of such "guarantees." In addition, the issue is being discussed in a topsy-turvy fashion. The statement, which says that Ukraine, by refusing to eliminate its nuclear weapons, becomes an illegal nuclear power and promotes the proliferation of nuclear weapons, is ungrounded. Or, perhaps, you can compare Ukraine with the North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq which have no status of being a nuclear state but wish to gain it. In reality, Ukraine, as a sovereign republic within the USSR, became proprietor of nuclear weapons much earlier than Great Britain, France, or China, because it became a nuclear state simultaneously with the USSR. From the very beginning of its existence as a nuclear state, Ukraine has been and is a sovereign subject of the international community. Indisputable facts prove this concept. For example, Ukraine participated in the San Francisco Conference in 1945 and it signed the UN Statute. In addition, Ukraine has also signed the peaceful post-war agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Romania.... Ukraine, along with Great Britain, the United States, France, and other countries, is a member of numerous international organizations. Twice, it was elected a UN Security Council member. Moreover, the Russian Federation has never had such international prestige. Therefore, the legal international status of Ukraine after World War II has been similar to that of other independent states. I would like to add one more fact. Ukraine has suffered materially, financially, and ecologically during the process of the creation of the USSR nuclear missile potential. Most of these nuclear weapons were produced on the territory of Ukraine at Ukrainian factories, and by hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian workers, engineers, and researchers. A considerable amount of these nuclear weapons were stored in Ukrainian territory. All this gives Ukraine the right to say that it has been and is a nuclear power, along with Russia, and the nuclear weapons stationed on its territory have been, from the very beginning, the property of the Ukrainian state, though the imperial circles of the former USSR cynically ignored Ukraine's international legal status by making it a colony, while its military potential with nuclear missiles was considered to be the USSR's property. These circumstances give no right either to Western or to Eastern countries to demand that Ukrainian nuclear weapons be eliminated. According to international law, Ukraine could demand that the United States, the Russian Federation, Great Britain, France, and China, simultaneously with Ukraine, eliminate their nuclear weapons. Therefore, both West and East should realize a certain reality: The existence of Ukraine as a nuclear state has not upset the balance of power in the world; the formal appearance of Ukraine on the list of nuclear states has not added any additional units of weapons on the international arena. In fact, everything has remained without any changes. Political tricks will amount to nothing. West and East should realize that they can discuss the destiny of Ukrainian nuclear weapons only during the talks with other nuclear states, among which Ukraine will be a full-fledged member.
