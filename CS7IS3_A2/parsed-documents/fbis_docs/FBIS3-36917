He said that "measures taken yesterday were insufficient, because the government issued more than 10 written instructions to resolve the issue last year. Yet another written instruction will not resolve the problems that have become extremely exacerbated," he said, and noted that the coordinating committee expected the government's official response. If no solution is found, the industry's workers will continue their Russia-wide protest action, emphasized Anatoliy Nazeykin. Currently numerous regional communications systems in the Far East, Siberia, central non-black soil zone, and a number of other regions are taking part in the protest action. According to the Communications Ministry, approximately 40 percent of Russian radio communications facilities were taking part in the protest action as of midday 10 February. At an emergency meeting on Wednesday with Russian Federation Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the national Ostankino Russian state TV and radio company, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin instructed the Finance Ministry "to find an opportunity of a stage-by-stage repayment of the 80 trillion rubles debt that the state TV and radio companies owe to the communications enterprises." This measure was taken in response to a threat from the Russian Federation Communications Workers Trade Union addressed to the government and the TV companies that from 10 February onward "only the news bulletins from Ostankino and the national state TV and radio company would be put out in the morning and evening" until the debts to the communications enterprises were settled in full.
