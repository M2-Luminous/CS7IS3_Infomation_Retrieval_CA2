FR941019-1-00024 FR941019-1-00002 The sum of the estimates of potential future exposure for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract (A gross ), adjusted to reflect the effects of the netting contract (A net ), is determined through application of a formula. The formula, which employs the ratio of the net current to the gross current exposure (NGR), is expressed as: A net = .5(A gross + (NGR * A gross )) Gross potential future exposure, or A gross , is calculated by summing the estimates of potential future exposure (determined in accordance with section II.E.1. of this appendix A) for each individual contract subject to the qualifying bilateral netting contract. 43 The NGR is determined as the ratio of the net current exposure of the netting contract to the gross current exposure of the netting contract. The gross current exposure is the sum of the current exposures of all individual contracts subject to the netting contract calculated in accordance with section II.E.1. of this appendix A. The effect of this treatment is that A net is the average of A gross and A gross adjusted by the NGR. 43 For purposes of calculating gross potential future credit exposure for foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is defined as the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. 6. In Appendix A to part 325, the chart in Table III and its heading, as that section was proposed to be amended at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994, is revised to read as follows: Table III. *␣*␣* * * * * * Credit Conversion for Derivative Contracts * * * * * Conversion Factor Matrix A [Numbers in percent] 1Residual maturity 1Interest rate 1Exchange rate 1Equity B 1Precious metals 1Other commodities Less than one year 0.0 1.0 6.0 7.0 12.0 One to five years 0.5 5.0 8.0 7.0 12.0 Five years or more 1.5 7.5 10.0 8.0 15.0 A For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the factors are to be multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract.
