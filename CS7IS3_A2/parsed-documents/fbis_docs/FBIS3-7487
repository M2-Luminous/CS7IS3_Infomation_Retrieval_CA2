Basic Policy The measures are to help achieve over the medium term a highly significant decrease in Japan's current account surplus and significant increases in imports of competitive foreign products and services. Macroeconomic Measures -- The government will actively promote over the medium term strong and sustainable demand-led economic growth to cut the current account surplus significantly. Fiscal, financial and other measures will be reconsidered as needed. -- The government officially forecasts the surplus will fall to about 13.8 trillion yen, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1994 starting Friday from 14.4 trillion yen, or 3.1 percent of GDP, in fiscal 1993. -- The government will review by around June its 430 trillion yen public works spending program for the current decade, including reconsideration of the allocation and an increase of funds. -- Tax reform, including permanent personal income tax cuts, is intended by year's end. The bill with this year's tax cuts has been amended in the Diet, and the government will promptly implement tax reform including the permanent and structural individual income tax reduction. Deregulation -- The government will compile by the end of June a fast-track package of priority items, noting foreign opinions and focusing on improving market access, ensuring internationally compatible standards and approval systems, and simplifying and speeding up procedures. It will cover real estate and land, information and telecommunications, distribution, licensing and inspection standards and financial services. -- A comprehensive five-year deregulation program will be completed in fiscal 1994. -- The government will seek quick approval of a bill now in the Diet to set up an independent body to monitor deregulation and make recommendations, which the prime minister shall respect. Competition -- Investigative staff at the Fair Trade Commission will be increased by 9 percent with further increases in the future. -- Foreign opinions will be sought, and their adoption intended for the summer, on bid-tender guidelines to prevent "dango" bid-rigging. -- Guidelines on trade association activities and regulations on premiums will be reviewed. Import and Investment Promotion -- The government will implement fiscal 1994 measures enhancing the tax system and public financing to promote imports and will expand foreign access zones, import cargo facilities and customs systems and the business support center. -- Tax incentives for direct investment and loan programs by the Japan Development Bank will be expanded, and the Office of the Trade and Investment Ombudsman and the Trade Council will be actively used. Government Procurement -- The government will increase openness, fairness and competition before procurement procedures begin, to help competitive domestic and foreign suppliers enter and to change the mind-set of those involved with the procedures. -- Operational guidelines will be adopted going beyond those specified by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Information will be made available before tender and comments will be requested. Voluntary Steps in Japan-U.S. "Priority Areas" -- Procedures will be improved in government procurement of telecommunications and medical technology to facilitate the entry of competitive foreign products and significantly increase their sales, including nondiscriminatory access to information. -- Insurance deregulation will proceed, clarifying and making more flexible approval procedures for product development and premiums. A broker system will be introduced. Licensing and approval standards will be clarified. -- The government will facilitate, within its scope and responsibility, increased imports of autos and auto parts and purchases of local parts by Japanese plants overseas. It will financially support import car exhibitions and design-in promotions, with cooperation from the Export-Import Bank of Japan and the Japan Development Bank. A permanent Transport Ministry technical office will be stationed in Detroit to promote type-designation approvals.
