The U.S. embargo against Vietnam and the struggle for the lifting of this policy have been an animated matter, closely followed by the public during the past years. The declaration this time by President Clinton is a positive and significant decision which contributes to the opening of a new page in U.S.-Vietnam relations in the interests of the two countries. This decision not only meets the desire of the American and the Vietnamese peoples, but also meets the desire of many other countries. The lifting of the embargo and the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations will make a significant contribution to the common endeavour for peace, friendship and cooperation among nations all over the world, especially in South East Asia. I am honoured to inform you that the government and people of Vietnam welcome the decision of the U.S. government; the government and people of Vietnam wish to express their sincere gratitude to all those in the United States and in other countries, to the government and people of Thailand, particularly to H.E. [His Excellency] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri himself, for their contribution to the lifting of U.S. embargo and the improvement of relations between Vietnam and the United States of America. Ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam brings about the appearance of a series of new problems and many questions have been put forward, such as: -- Will there be any change in the policy of investment and trade of Vietnam? or, -- How does the lifting of the embargo affect the economic development of Vietnam? or -- With the coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam, will Vietnam pay more attention to the relations of cooperation and investment with its neighbouring countries in the region or not? And, so on. It is necessary to reaffirm that the lifting of the embargo and step by step moves towards the normalization of relations with Vietnam by the U.S. will not divert the foreign policy and foreign economic relations of Vietnam. The improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations will not obstruct or be detrimental to the cooperation of Vietnam with other countries, especially with countries in Southeast Asia. On the contrary, the lifting of the embargo and improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relations will contribute to creating favourable condition for the stability and economic development of Vietnam; promoting more quickly, essentially and effectively the political relations, economic cooperation and trade of Vietnam with countries in the region, including Thailand. The Vietnam National Assembly session in December 1993 and the mid-term Congress of our Party in January 1994 reaffirmed to continue our foreign policy of befriending all countries in the world, firstly with neighbouring countries; to continue the economic renovation, opening for cooperation with all countries; to overcome shortcomings, modify and amend policies to more effectively strengthen the investment cooperation with foreign countries. In other words, politically, we do not want to side with any country against others but we want to be the friend of all countries on the basis of mutual respect. We shall continue to adjust, amend and complete our economic cooperation policies and investment laws in order to create conditions to encourage foreign investors and partners. We should also recognize as a matter of fact that many U.S. companies will come to Vietnam in the post-embargo period. So far, more than 30 U.S. companies have already opened representative offices in Vietnam, some of which have begun to operate. Dozens of other companies have been applying to come to do business in Vietnam. With capital and technological advantage, U.S. companies will be competitive rivals for businessmen from other countries. It will be possible for Vietnam to draw capital and expertise of over one million Vietnamese residents in the U.S. But I myself believe that the coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam will not bring about an explosion of economic development of Vietnam. A major effect of the lifting of the embargo is to relieve psychologically for our friends to cooperate and invest in Vietnam. In the past, affected by the embargo, some countries seemed to hesitate to cooperate or invest in Vietnam; many kinds of goods technology and equipment which we would like to trade with other countries, were restricted. At present, the World Bank, the IMF and other financial institutions, together with the joining of U.S. companies in the Vietnamese market, there emerges a new atmosphere in investment, cooperation and trade. Vietnam has greater demand for economic development; the market of Vietnam has much potential as a source of labour, natural resources and consuming power. No individual country in the world, not even Japan and the United States could meet the development demands of Vietnam. We believe that the more the economy of Vietnam develops, the more investment opportunities and commercial relations will increase. Regarding the investment area, after six years of implementing the investment law, we have gained great achievements, but at the same time there still exist problems which need to be solved if we want to have rapid development in the post-embargo period. Over the past six years, we have granted 836 investment licences with a total capital of over U.S.$7 billion. The investment rate grew quickly. In the period of 1988-1991, it rose with an annual average of 51 per cent. In 1992 it equalled 70 per cent of the previous four years. In the first ten months of 1993, it surpassed the whole year of 1992, both in number of projects and total capital. Of the total investment capital of U.S.$7 billion mentioned above, the investment in 1993 amounted to U.S.$3 billion. The scale of investment also increased and there appears more big companies and groups. In the period of 1988-1990, the average amount of capital for one project was U.S.$3.5 million, but it rose to U.S.$7.6 million and $9.9 million in the 1991-1992 period and in 1993 respectively. Up to now, though small scale projects account for 73 per cent of the total number of projects, they occupy only 12 per cent of the total investment capital. The investment form of 100 per cent foreign-owned capital only accounted for 6 per cent in the period of 1988-1992, now increases to 17 per cent with 128 investment licences and promises a rapid growth in the coming time. During the initial years, most of the investment capital concentrated on the fields of oil and gas (32 per cent) and hotels (20.6 per cent), but since 1991, investment capital for industry has grown. Now, 70 per cent of the total investment projects is in the field of material production. Our other significant achievement is that we have increased the number of Vietnamese counterparts in joint ventures and cooperation with foreign countries. The mechanism relating to investment, management and regulations has made obvious progress. Especially, we have formed a contingent of staff capable of working with foreign counterparts. This is what we never had in the past and also it's not easy to achieve within a short period of time. With the momentum of economic development in the past years, we have also achieved initial successes in accounting and mobilizing domestic capital, contributing to the increased effectiveness of joint ventures with foreigners. Apart from the above-mentioned achievements, we also made mistakes and there remain problems which need to be solved soon. That is to quickly complete the legal system and regulations to protect and encourage foreign investment; to strengthen the state machinery, reduce the hurdles and bureaucracy; to urgently solve the problem of infrastructure; to effectively train management personnel, reinforce the contingent of staff capable of working with foreign counterparts. And in the coming time, priority should be given to investment projects in industry, oil and gas, and infrastructure. Viet-Thai relations have been finely developing. After the visit to Thailand last October by H.E. Secretary General Do Muoi, in the next few weeks H.E. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will visit Vietnam to further cement the relations of friendship and cooperation between our two countries. Parallel to the development of the political relations and the mutual confidence and understanding between our two countries, it is the remarkably encouraging growth in our economic relations. We are happy to notice that a number of big companies or groups such as CP, Bangpakok, Saha Union, Sahanarya, Siam Cement, Padang and so on and so forth, the big banks like the Bangkok Bank, Thai Military Bank, Thai Farmers Bank etc have made their presence felt in Vietnam apart from many small and medium sized companies, and a number of joint ventures and investment projects executed by Thai businessmen have started their operations with initial results. We also understand that some Thai businessmen still hesitate in doing business in Vietnam. You are worried about the uncertainty in our laws and regulations, the red tape and bureaucracies, the unfavourable prices, low level of management and the poor infrastructures. Your concerns are correct. In fact, those shortcomings and difficulties mentioned above are a hundred percent true. However, I hold that they only constitute our country's constraints and problems in its initial stage of development. Vietnam embarked on its new economic policy with the investment law less than six years ago. A six-year period is too short a time for us to bring about a dramatic change for a whole structure and a policy of economic development. I do not know if there is any country which can progress without stumbling in their initial steps of development. The upgrading of infrastructure is our pressing requirement and priority. Yet, to tackle this problem is not an easy task, especially in the case of Vietnam which has proceeded from a war-devastated economy with a low level of development. At the moment we are concentrating our efforts to develop our infrastructure through the use of funds provided by the IMF, the World Bank, the ADB as well as ODA from various countries. We highly appreciate the high determination of Thai companies like Bangpakok which has been taking part in projects to develop the infrastructure in Vietnam. We welcome a number of other Thai companies which have submitted their applications for their participation in building airports, seaports and upgrading of transport and telecommunication systems in Vietnam. Another concern of yours is whether or not Vietnam shall continue to cooperate with Thailand after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. I can assure you that we have and continue to encourage and promote economic cooperation, trade and investment with Thailand. It is our consistent policy that conforms with the interests of stability and development of the two countries as well as of other countries in the region. I firmly believe that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will provide a more favourable condition for our two countries to work together both in political and economic fields. Thai investors may join U.S. companies in investing in Vietnam. Thai-based American firms like Kodak Thai, Unocal Thai etc. may easily have access to the Vietnamese market. There are promising chances to realize the idea to turn Thailand into a financial and technical gateway to Indochina and Vietnam. The question is that in view of present constraints in the way to invest in Vietnam, like law and regulations, facilities, bureaucracies, low infrastructures and so on and so forth, whether Thai investors should start their joint ventures, investment or cooperation with Vietnam now or wait until everything is satisfactorily prepared. I am afraid that we can let the chances slip out of our hands if we hesitate. Excellencies, Friends, In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Vietnam will continue to carry out its process of economic renewal, openness and development of its economic, trade and investment with foreign countries. While the lifting of the U.S. embargo and particularly when the two countries can normalize their relations, will facilitate the entry of American companies to do business in Vietnam, we shall attach more importance to trade and investment cooperation with other countries especially with our neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand.
