Five basic forms, in accordance with which states' military doctrines are devised, are known at the present time. The first contains military-political aspects, in the main. Thus a coalition military doctrine of the Warsaw Pact countries was devised in 1987. With this content the document lays claim to being more a doctrine of the allies' foreign policy than a military doctrine in its classical understanding. The second encompasses only military-technical aspects of the doctrine. For this reason the document is called a "strategy" or "concept." The national military strategy of the United States has been devised in accordance with this form, for example. The third form incorporates two groups of aspects: military-political and military-technical. The requirements of such a doctrine are set forth in textbooks on the art of war, but its practical realization has proven impossible. As we have learned, this structure of military doctrine has been abandoned in the Russian Federation also. The fourth form consists of three sections: Military-political, military-technical, and military-economic. This form was adopted for the Military Doctrine of Ukraine because of the high sensitivity of the military organization of the state to the condition of its economy. The fifth form contains doctrinal precepts in the form of a military declaration. On account of incomplete information, this is the path that has been taken in certain European states. What has been said enables us to maintain that the first military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian state corresponds to its purpose in form and content. Its progressive nature is to be found in the fact that it is already connected with the doctrine of foreign policy and could in the future be linked with the economic doctrine of Ukraine and coordinated with the military doctrines of contiguous and other states. The basis of the first section of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine is composed of precepts of military-political content aimed at the prevention of war by nonmilitary means, and the basis of the second section, of precepts for ensuring military security by military means proper. The sum total of doctrinal precepts provides for the organizational development of armed forces capable of fighting the wars of the future, termed by modern military theory sixth-generation wars. The creation of the material basis of qualitatively new armed forces is the main content of the third section of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine. It has become obvious that the full-nomenklatura production of modern and prospective arms systems is not only economically inexpedient but also practically impossible. For this reason the doctrine contains the precept of supply of the troops (forces) in three ways: through national production; thanks to production in cooperation with other states; thanks to purchases overseas. Priority is given to dual technology here making it possible to manufacture output for military and civilian purposes, and in the competitive reviews of arms systems combat hardware making it possible to enhance the qualitative component of the troops (forces) and their fire and maneuver possibilities is considered the priority hardware. The strategy of ensuring military security and the use of the armed forces has always been, is now, and will continue to be a sphere of special attention on the part of the country's military-political leadership, since there continues to be the theoretical possibility of the invasion of troops and forces on the part of a state laying claim to some territory and not considering its borders final. In this connection the military doctrine reveals the purpose of military policy, which consists of guaranteeing the national security of Ukraine against an external military threat, preventing war, maintaining peace at the national, regional, and global levels, and endeavoring to be in the future a neutral and nuclear-free state. Proceeding from the main purpose, the strategic mission consists of the defense of state sovereignty and political independence and the preservation of territorial integrity and the inviolability of the borders. For the accomplishment of this mission it is essential that Ukraine have its own armed forces. The precepts of the military doctrine proceed here from the fact that the border with contiguous states is established conclusively and that Ukraine itself is not an enemy for any state. It is not hard to see that the strategy of the state is based on the principles of defensive actions. For this reason the military doctrine contains precepts of the use of the armed forces exclusively in cases of armed aggression and encroachments on our territorial integrity and the inviolability of the border and also in fulfillment of its international obligations. Ukraine's rejection of first use of its armed forces is sometimes erroneously confused with passive strategic defense. This is not the case. The military doctrine provides for active defense, which is expressed in the doctrinal precepts of preparation of the armed forces for a possible war. This preparation of the troops and forces consists of their assimilation of all the types, forms, and modes of military operations with regard to the laws of war and the principles of the art of war. Considering the strategic purpose of the state in peacetime and in war and also taking account of its strategic mission, it can be seen that the main type of strategic use of the armed forces of Ukraine under the conditions of peacetime is premeditated active defense on all salients. Under the conditions of a possible war this initial state of the army and navy predetermines the possibility of the use of all known forms of strategic operations of the armed forces. The modern art of war attributes to such forms: strategic deployment, the repulse of a strike from the air and space, a strategic defensive operation, a strategic offensive operation. The precise concordance of the combat operations of heterogeneous forces and assets of different branches of the armed forces and combat arms is possible only within the framework of a unified purpose and strategic plan with the strict centralization of command and control on the part of the supreme commander. This is why the Military Doctrine of Ukraine contains the precept of joint operations with the armed forces in wartime of the Border Troops, the National Guard, the Security Service, the Internal Troops, and the Civil Defense Forces. Summing up, I would like to emphasize that for the organizational development of armed forces capable of fighting a war of the future, military science of the future is essential. It is very important, therefore, that the first particular concept approved by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine following the adoption of the military doctrine was the Concept of the Organization of Research in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
