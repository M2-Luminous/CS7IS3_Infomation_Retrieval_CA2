The Daiwa Institute of Research, affiliated with Daiwa Securities Co., predicted a 15.8 percent rise in the same firms' profits for the current fiscal year ending next March 31. The think tank said the effects of restructuring measures will be quickly reflected in their business results because corporations listed on the OTC market are relatively small in scale. The listed firms also consist mainly of processing and service industry firms, whose recovery was quicker than that of the materials, construction and electric companies which are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The institute said improvement of their financial balances also contributed to profit growth. The combined deficit in their financial balances dropped 19.3 percent to 33.8 billion yen in fiscal 1993. It said the OTC firms moved to raise funds through new stock issues and convertible bonds by decreasing borrowings from banks.
