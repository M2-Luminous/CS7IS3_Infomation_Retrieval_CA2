It is designed for executive and business flights but can be reequipped, without special additional expenditure, to function as an air ambulance or training or cargo plane. Its short takeoff and landing means that it can be used on improvised grass airstrips. The creation of this aircraft marks the revival of mutually advantageous economic relations between the two states. A few days ago at the test range the new aircraft took off with enviable ease and reaching the required height successfully passed its first test. Present at the test range were head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, and Georgian and foreign journalists.
