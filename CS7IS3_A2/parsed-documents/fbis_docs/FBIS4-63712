"This action is connected with the president's wish to establish full control over actions by the premier and the entire economic bloc of the government and to deprive the cabinet of any independence, including independence of a political manoeuvre." Amplifying this theme, the ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper notes that "in the political respect, the president's 'economic' decrees gave a pretext for suppositions that he is forced to 'prod' the passive government, thrusting on it his 'strong-willed' decisions which were made all of a sudden". "According to information received at the presidential press service," the newspaper writes in another article, "Boris Yeltsin will meet the leadership of the Russian Government this week in order to analyse the progress of economic reform and to map out measures to remove 'bottlenecks' in its way." "Despite expectations, the Moscow talks between the Russian and Ukrainian premiers," writes the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA newspaper, "centred not on the conflict between Simferopol and Kiev but on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. "The sides stressed proximity and importance of these themes in bilateral relations. Although the discussion has not brought specific results, the cabinet heads appraised the meeting rather optimistically." The same newspaper writes in another article that "Russia should not fully rely on the Baykonur Cosmodrome as the main launching pad for Russian space explorations in future. "This is true even of the next 20 years about which the two presidents (eds: Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev) talked in Moscow. Governments were changing in the recent past more often than space rockets." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Vladimir Gusev, head of the Russian federal tax service, who said that "the state collected taxes worth over 38,000 billion rubles and 340 million U.S. dollars for 1993". The same newspaper features an interview with Vadim Gustov, chairman of the Russian parliament upper house committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States, saying that "economy dictates its rules to politicians. "These are stiff rules. Politicians should start thinking how to pool efforts, natural resources, workforce and the intellectual potential in order to pull out of the crisis. "It is clear for all that there is no way back to the former centralised rigid system of management. It means that we should look for another way, to find versions acceptable for all, to come to agreement. "It can be a Eurasian Union proposed by Nazarbayev or something else. However, it is necessary to start preparing now a legislative basis for it as well as a concept for cooperation and manageability of economies." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with speaker of the former Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying: "Serious praiseworthy opposition leaders are doomed to take a peaceful road and to act in compliance with law. But it is highly probable that authorities will reply with artillery volleys to their constructive initiatives". The TRUD newspaper informs its readers that "head of the Russian president's office Sergey Filatov submitted documents to the government about gold reserves of the Russian empire stored abroad. "The documents are supplied with Filatov's recommendation to set up an interdepartmental commission to return gold home." According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, "the Russian president will hear counterintelligence officers on Wednesday to hammer out a single concept for their operations. "It happened that starting from the year 1991, victorious for democracy, Russia had no common doctrine for the country's security, including the sphere of shielding against foreign secret services. "Confidential sources at the federal conterintelligence service inform that precisely this reason prompted the general summit of Russian counterintelligence leaders." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy Golovnev, deputy commander-in-chief of Russian land forces, who stresses: "The quality of training troops suffers due to the untimely development and delivery by the Ministry of the Munitions Industry of simulators to new models of weapons and combat materiel. "The cost of weapons grows, since we are forced to train on combat materiel. How soon will the situation change for the better? This depends on how soon we agree that the state's might is also a level of its army's training." The PRAVDA newspaper writes that "an official report that five prominent Latvian politicians had been KGB agents, became a real sensation in Latvia. The republican prosecutor-general made recently this report to local legislators. "Incumbent foreign minister G. Andreyevs is among the above five. True, the final say belongs to the court of law. However, all the five are now vehemently deny their former affiliation with the KGB."
