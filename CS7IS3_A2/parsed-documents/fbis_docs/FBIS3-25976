Zhou Zhekai, secretary general of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, will replace Lin Keping as head of the co-ordination department of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), Beijing's de facto embassy here, according to sources. Zhou will be in charge of "united front work", which means liaison and control of "friendly" local organisations in the territory. Lin, who came to Hong Kong to replace Yang Sing in 1990, is expected to retire. Zhou Zhekai, who is in his early forties, is a protege of Wang Zhaoguo, a rising party leader who heads the party's United Front Work Department in Beijing. Zhou plays a key role in cross-strait negotiations with Taiwan. This week, he is hosting a round of "unofficial" talks with his Taiwan counterparts. Zhou worked with Wang in Fujian Province in the late 1980s, then moved with his mentor to Beijing when Wang became head of the party's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs. As a Taiwan affairs expert, Zhou poses a potential threat to Wang Zhenyu, the head of Xinhua's Taiwan affairs office. A reshuffle is also under way within the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Offce (HKMAO). Though not yet officially announced, this could be the most significant shake-up since 1990, at the time of the promulgation of the Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In 1990, Ji Pengfei and Li Hou, director and deputy director of the HKMAO, retired to make way for Lu Ping and other middle-aged cadres. This time, Wang Fengchao will be made a deputy director, replacing Wang Qiren, who has been named president of the Bank of China. Wang's appointment suggested an attempt to maintain a balance of power among competing factions, sources said. Wang is considered relatively moderate compared to Chen Ziying, the other deputy director, who is in charge of foreign affairs and negotiations with Britain over the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. But his appointment does not necessarily mean that Beijing will modify its hard-line stance on Hong Kong. Wang's responsibilities will include negotiations on political reforms and preparatory work leading up to the 1997 transition. He was previously a deputy director of the Institute of Journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social Science, but he became involved in policymaking on Hong Kong and Macao affairs during the late 1980s and participated in last year's Sino-Hong Kong talks on political reform. His wife, Lei Yuping, deputy chief of the All China Journalists' Association, is in charge of dealing with Hong Kong and Taiwan journalists in Beijing. Her father, Lei Yingfu, accompanied the then Chinese Communist Party leader, Zhou Enlai, during the 1946 negotiations with the Kuomintang in Chongqing. In addition to Wang, three young cadres educated in Guangdong in the early 1980s are due to receive promotions. Chen Zuoer, a department head at the HKMAO, will replace Luo Jiahuan on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in Hong Kong, sources in Beijing said. Chen Guangming, also a department head, will be transferred to the Taiwan Affairs Office of Guangdong province, clearing the way for a promotion for his deputy, Xe Ze, who was Lu Ping's assistant during the drafting of the Basic Law. Zheng Liandong, who was involved in drafting the Basic Law, will also be promoted. In 1990, Zheng was sent to Hong Kong to join the Chinese team of the JLG as first secretary and later studied in Britain for one year. Guo Fengmin, leader of the Chinese side in the JLG, is expected to retire soon. He will be replaced by Zhao Jihua, director of the separate Foreign Ministry office handling Hong Kong and Macao affairs.
