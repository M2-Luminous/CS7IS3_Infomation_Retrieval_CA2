Persons from lower social classes who have attained high social advancement try to speak with an Oxford accent proper for the higher classes. But when such a politician or businessman gets tense, he tends to speak with his childhood accent, such as a Liverpool one. Well, it is a similar thing with the Polish politicians who belong to the governing coalition. They try mightily to obliterate their PRL [Polish People's Republic] origin and sometimes they succeed, but when they become nervous the Liverpool in them emerges. During the recent strikes, Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz said that there will be no negotiations so long as the strikes continue, that is, under the strike gun, while Prime Minister Pawlak said that on the day of the great strike a lot of good happened because many people kept on working. Such comments are ludicrous, because, of course, the negotiations did go on during the strike and even succeeded. The fact that a person works is something normal rather than good. But such reversion to Liverpool language is typical; it demonstrates not so much the difficulty of getting rid of the burden of the past (which is hardly surprising) as that the more difficult it is to get rid of that burden the less substantive a comment can be and hence also the less can be accomplished. And it is my belief that the new-old coalition has nothing to say and can accomplish nothing. It began its governance with empty rhetoric and lies. For such were the elements of the prime minister's opening address to the Sejm, which focused a lot on the evil doings of his predecessors and on making many promises, in particular to the world of science, education, culture, and health. It is not enough that since then nothing has been accomplished in those domains; on the contrary, they even regressed in terms of both budgetary allocations and restructuring. More even, at the Ministry for National Education for the time being only numerous personnel changes have been made, and at the Ministry of Culture "Liverpool" reached its apogee, as best exemplified by the affair of the letter of Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz. We also were lied to when they promised us a mysterious budget extending the social safety net; afterward Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was fired and the budget remained unchanged. Mendacity and blather are, besides, triumphant in practically every domain of public life and at every post. This is best exemplified by the unbelievably tangled affair of the "popiwek" [tax on wage increases], in which mendacity became an instrument employed not so much owing to lack of an opinion of one's own but deliberately and purposely. The Unsuccessful Return I am no Cato and know well that politicians lie all over the world, but there exist varieties of the political lie and turgid rhetoric is not so horrible when it substitutes for real political action and merely serves to satisfy the public demand for high-sounding phrases. But the politicians of the governing coalition lie, prattle, and do nothing. It is interesting that some of them, whether presumably or certainly more prominent, have lately clammed up. It appears they already know so much that they are not certain about anything. How did it happen? Why did the "worker-peasant alliance" [Alliance of the Democratic Left and the Polish Peasant Party] so soon reveal its hopeless fecklessness? Why is it even now clear that the return is a resounding failure, that presumably this governing coalition will remain in power for some time yet but it will doubtless be its swan song? It already common knowledge that this coalition won the elections by making promises it could not keep. But it is not as clear why it could not afterward, after taking power, formulate a clear program of action that would at least to some extent envisage fulfillment of pre-electoral promises. Well, I think that by now it is obvious why it did not happen. That coalition is a coalition of fear. From the very outset the factor keeping it together and determining its conduct was fear, and fear in several forms at that. First, there is the fear of repeating the past. Thus, it prevented taking any explicitly socialist decisions, for which the representatives of the Labor Union and the OPZZ [National Alliance of Trade Unions] are, justly from their point of view, reproaching that coalition. Second, there is the fear of interfering with the rather gratifying performance of the market economy, meaning the fear of forfeiting the accomplishments of the previous administrations, that is, the fear of deviating from the liberal course of the economy. Despite numerous attempts, that fear could not be covered up by clever social-democratic or peasant-populist speechifying, and it has become widely obvious. Third, there is the fear of the presumed ideological electorate of that coalition, which directly led to strikes at the end of April. Thus, the first decisions of the Pawlak administration, made last November, were to make every concession to the demands of the striking miners, and it became obvious that with the approach of the spring there would be more such strikes. Fourth, there is the fear of the coalition's own image, as clearly demonstrated by Prime Minister Pawlak when, on the very first occasion when something went wrong, he fired the concerned deputy minister (Kawalec) and recently also Deputy Minister Morawski, who is said to be the leading energy expert in Poland. Fifth, there is the fear of the mass media, initially less evident within the SLD [Alliance of the Democratic Left] but by now obvious there too. That fear is that they have nothing to say and do not understand the role of the mass media and, basically, show no interest in winning over public opinion, which wears no blinkers and is not deceived. Sixth, there is the fear of the president, who to be sure cannot, under the Constitution, wreak any real harm on the coalition but who serves as its only vehicle for credibility with the public, as could be seen from the enraptured faces of the SLD activists when they recently met with Walesa. Seventh and last, there is the fear of the people who get nothing out of the coalition government, a fear that has prompted it to distribute more or less 20 million zlotys apiece to each farmer, allegedly as a loan for fertilizers, and to keep that decision secret so that the remaining public would not know what its taxes are being spent on. Another factor accounting for the existence of the coalition is opportunism. To be sure, I do not think opportunism in public life to be something entirely negative. After all, opportunism as adaptation to circumstances which may not always be foreseeable is often proof of common sense. Provided, however, that such opportunism is accompanied by strong political convictions for whose sake compromises, often hardly palatable, are made. But the governing coalition has no such convictions, just as it has no program of action, and hence in its case opportunism is a totally negative attitude, a way of remaining afloat in spite of all undertows and eddies. This opportunism is, to cite just a few instances, clearly reflected in the nearly total turnabout in the governing coalition's views on Poland's membership in NATO. Prior to the elections the SLD was in many ways critical of that idea, but after the elections, when it realized that the Polish public is remarkably united on this issue, it jettisoned all of its criticisms. Another example of opportunist conduct is the budget voted by the coalition, which basically does not embody any of its campaign promises. That also applies to its attitude toward privatization, restitution of nationalized property, and other economic issues. But most characteristic from that standpoint is the avoidance of taking a stand on any issue that might provoke a serious political dispute. A coalition that won the elections upon proclaiming its desire to combat corruption, organized crime, and smuggling, has done nothing at all about the issues and has not dared to organize any major trial. Finally, the coalition's opportunism is reflected in its attitude toward other political parties and views. In that domain the governing coalition remains passive, does not try to prove anything, and does not show the will to demonstrate the justness of its (nonexistent) decisions. It simply evades any dispute. It also avoids, at any price, internal disputes. This is clearly demonstrated not only by its treatment of Deputy Prime Minister Borowski but also by the tacit consent of the SLD to the dangerous protectionist aspirations of the PSL [Polish Peasant Party]. The position of Prime Minister Pawlak is so strong for the very reason that the SLD's decision on such a precise structure of the government ensued from a rotten compromise or opportunism for which there is no longer any remedy. The PSL, as a supposedly Catholic party (something which it has never before advertised), serves as a liaison between the coalition and the Roman Catholic Church and thus takes care of the opinions of the peasants, which are anachronistic by virtue of their social and economic situation. But it is precisely this alliance with the PSL that prevents the SLD from pursuing any explicit policy and condemns it to failure in the struggle for a new shape of Polish domestic policy or, in other words, turns the SLD into an antimodernist force. A Weak Root Fear and opportunism are subjective factors, which depend more on the leaders and members of the coalition parties than on the external situation. But we also are dealing with objective factors owing to which there is not, and shall not be, any longer any future for that coalition. The most important of those factors is deracination. The unexpectedly big electoral win of the SLD and the PSL imbued the two parties with the belief that they have social support. But that belief is as illusory as were the social expectations that brought victory to the parties. We are perfectly aware that there will be no free lunch and no guaranteed procurement prices, and practically everybody had known it from the outset, but there was hope that in some mysterious way the new-old parties would alleviate the pain of the economic reforms. That did not happen because it could not happen. In Poland nowadays there is no social class that can fight for its privileges effectively and sensibly. The SLD and the PSL came to power with about the same attitude as that of the socialists of the late 19th century, that is, of an era when the working class had really been exploited and had something to fight for. Nowadays there are no such class and no justified partisan goals. The SLD and the PSL lack a past of their own, and as for the communist past ascribed to them, they want to forget it at any price. But no kowtowing references to Witos [Wincenty Witos, the prewar peasant-party leader] can obscure the fact that most of the PSL's current leaders used to belong to the ZSL [United Peasant Party], just as the leaders of the SLD used to belong to the PZPR. However, as that past is so burdensome, with what origin should these parties identify themselves and what identity should they clothe themselves with? Without a principled program, without support from a nonexistent class society--let us bear in mind that it was precisely workers who did not at all vote for the SLD--without a history and language of its own, a party is condemned to nonexistence. That is a problem that has also been encountered by parties of Solidarity origin. So how are parties of PRL origin to build their own image for internal and external consumption? But is that so important after all? Yes, because in the absence of roots surface existence is not possible. For a political movement, roots are what keeps it together and a means of internal communication and rapport with the outside world. Aleksander Kwasniewski lost headway after several brilliant speeches, because his party lacks a language whereby he could speak constructively about anything, and as for the linguistic utterances of Prime Minister Pawlak, they demonstrate that the PSL lacks any original concepts and approaches of its own. Standing on the brink of the abyss, and work ethic, and consider recently also that recent amazingly feckless Sejm speech, whose culmination was the following passage: "...I was raised under other circumstances and in another system of values. That is why accord, cooperation, mutual goodwill, and working together are closer to me than conflict...." The prime minister was probably thinking of his native rural community and he simply forgot that in the 1980's he used to be a member of the youth wing of the ZSL and that those times were hardly times of accord and goodwill. His desperate search for arguments led him to point to such roots at the expense of drastically deviating from the truth. It thus can be seen that the PSL under its present leaders can be, objectively speaking, only a peasant party, that this is its sole root, but it is not a root that qualifies it to govern the country. Lastly, deracination leads to a reaction that is literally reactionary, meaning that it prompts searching for people from one's old former world and shutting oneself up in that world. The suspicion that the SLD and the PSL will come to rely on men who had played the second fiddle in the former PRL has by now been proven on a large scale, and that is not surprising because these parties can form a world of their own jointly only with such people, a world that is not a world of ideas, programs, or politics, but merely a world of sentiments and resentments. Presumed Leftism Another objective factor ruining the chances of that coalition for the future is its--also objective--inability to build a constructive vision of itself and, as a consequence, a constructive vision of its own policy and of Poland. In that case, too, the SLD and the PSL suffer an ailment that is also shared by post-Solidarity groupings. But for the governing coalition the problem is much more difficult to resolve, because developing a constructive vision is difficult in the absence of roots, a program, social support, and internal human and ideological cohesiveness. That is precisely why, rather than owing to some special indolence, the government acts with such an improbable sluggishness that it can be only compared with the government of Jan Olszewski (with which it has many features in common anyhow). That also is why we so often perceive the absence of mutual loyalty binding members of the government, deputy prime ministers, and the prime minister. Still, even a constructive program is not what matters most if current problems can be effectively and rapidly resolved. But the absence of either leads to a paralysis of the political scene, in which the president now and then quite unexpectedly intervenes so as to either add to the general confusion or lead to some unexpected decisions. From the beginning it was known that this government can endure on two conditions: That it shall fairly consistently continue the economic policy established by former Prime Minister Balcerowicz and that it will somehow reach an understanding with President Walesa. For the time being the governing coalition is meeting both those conditions, but that does not mean that it has succeeded in making a contribution of its own to the new reality. If anybody thinks differently, how about giving me just one example of a constructive action by the new coalition. I am not aware of any. Besides, it is worth noting that this coalition came to power with the byword of "leftism." Even very serious people such as Stanislaw Stomma have acknowledged that the times are ripe for the Left, because in times of change the Left is more suitable than the Right, whose purpose is rather to correct excessively radical actions of the Left. We all for awhile let ourselves be bamboozled by that supposed leftism of the SLD and the PSL, whereas it now turns out that power was taken by an ideological zero. What will happen next? Why do I believe that the end has come? For awhile we can still expect this administration to continue, but it does not seem likely that the present governing coalition will endure until the next elections. What is still more important, it does not seem likely that this coalition or its components will develop into a clear and sensible opposition in Poland. If some members of the former Solidarity opposition went rather far in flirting with the representatives of the current coalition, that was because they had thought that a new partner in political life has appeared on the scene, a partner with whom they would have to cohabit long and therefore it was better to maintain sensible contacts with the Communists rather than to point a finger at their past. This approach has proven mistaken, not only because it has caused the society to accept its recent enemy, but also because for awhile it afforded some legitimacy to the old-new coalition. But even now it can be seen that there is nobody to talk with (not in the sense of any absence of reasonable and witty individuals in the government), because there is nothing to talk about. If that is so while this coalition is in power, then it will simply evaporate once it becomes the opposition after losing the elections, that being the fate that awaits it sooner or later. Essentially, everything depends on whether the present-day opposition learns to create a workable party organization and electoral machinery and on when that will come true. The expectation that the worker-peasant alliance will become a thing of the past hardly saddens me. But in the end we should consider the present and future consequences of this era of coalition government to the present and future of Poland. To the present, as can be seen, the consequences will be fatal, because the pace of the reforms will slow down, markedly, solely, and exclusively through the fault of the present government. As for the future, the consequences will depend on whether such political motivations as fear, opportunism, and negation as a principle of action, and such objective conditions as deracination and inability to build a constructive vision of Poland will become a permanent feature of Polish life. For it may happen that the coalition not only will itself become a loser, but also will drag down with it the entire Polish political scene. It may thus happen that a rebirth can be expected only after yet another revolution and that only then will virtue and courage resume their proper place in public life. I do not know whether this is an expression of hope or horror, but I know for certain that those who, though aware of the burden of the past resting on them, have nevertheless taken power, now find themselves in a much worse situation than formerly. Formerly they could argue that they had been unable to accomplish much under the PRL, but now they can only acknowledge that they can do nothing. As for us, we unfortunately have to endure all this somehow.
