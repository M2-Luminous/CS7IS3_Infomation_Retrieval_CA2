In an exclusive statement to a SANA correspondent in Rome yesterday, in answer to a question on Syrian-Israeli talks following Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent statements, Christopher said: I think that we are now discussing the forthcoming negotiations and when they may start. We are exerting efforts to facilitate these talks between Syria and Israel. Christopher added: I think we are facing a new phase in these negotiations. I also think that the problem is whether we can fulfill that mission and how quickly we can do it. The beginning is always difficult. SANA correspondent in Rome also asked U.S. White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers a question about the Middle East issue. She said: Naturally, we support moves for peace in the Middle East. Some progress has been achieved in this regard, but there is still a long way to go and we are doing all we can to facilitate progress on all tracks. We hope we will continue to achieve further progress. The process is long and hard. The U.S. spokeswoman noted Christopher's repeated tours of the Middle East. She said: The U.S. secretary of state has spent a great deal of time in the Middle East and has made several tours over a period of 16 months. We hope these tours have helped to achieve progress in the peace process during the past year. The spokeswoman added: Early this year, President Bill Clinton said that he hoped there would be fresh momentum given to the peace process through any means available. But there are several obstacles and we are cautiously optimistic. However, no one should feel despair in face of this difficult process. It is worth mentioning that Christopher and Dee Dee Myers are accompanying the U.S. President on his current visit to Italy.
