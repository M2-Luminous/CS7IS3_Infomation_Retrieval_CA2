Saiget] [Text] Beijing, Feb 17 KYODO -- China's growing coal consumption poses a huge threat to the environment, a leading Chinese official said recently, and things are bound to get worse as the country struggles to generate enough energy to fuel its booming economy. ``Our biggest environmental problem is coal. You cannot deny that in the next 20 to 30 years coal use will continue to grow,'' Yang Jike, vice chairman of the environmental protection committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. ``We have lots of coal...To generate electricity it's the cheapest,'' he said. ``Coal is easy to get, you only have to dig.'' China used between 1.1 and 1.2 billion tons of coal in 1993, mostly for heating and generating electricity. Industry sources predict China will consume as much as 1.5 to 1.6 billion tons by the year 2000. Coal burning emits several harmful air pollutants including carbon dioxide (Co2), a major contributor to the global warming or ``greenhouse effect,'' and sulfur dioxide (So2), the main cause of acid rain, which destroys the nutritional value of soil and pollutes rivers and lakes. ``As far as I'm concerned, laws are the only way to restrict the rapid development of the coal industry. We can also use laws and regulations to encourage development of renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power, wind, tidal, geothermal power and biogas, as well as nuclear power plants,'' Yang said. The threat of excessive dependence on coal is of such a serious nature that Yang sees the construction of nuclear power plants and the environmentally controversial Three Gorges dam -- set to be the world's largest -- as necessary projects to limit coal use in China. Despite nearly universal ignorance of environmental concerns among the general masses, Yang stressed the Chinese Government's commitment to environmental protection, citing its signing of the UN-sponsored framework convention on climate change and the convention on biological diversity at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The 1993 establishment of the NPC Environmental Protection Committee places priority on environmental legislation aimed at controlling pollution and protecting natural resources, he said. New construction projects in China now must first have an environmental impact statement approved, he said, while several draft laws will lay down standards for solid waste disposal, air and water pollution as well as standards for resource exploitation. China's environmental protection is an uphill battle against not only the demands of rapid economic development and growing energy use, but subject to the tremendous pressures of a massive, largely uneducated agrarian population which feeds the nation on only 7 percent of the world's arable land. Chemical fertilizers, deforestation and indiscriminate strip-mining are leading to rapid soil erosion, while new highly-productive seed varieties are diminishing genetic variety while increasing the susceptibility of entire crops to a number of destructive plant viruses. Although Yang is careful to support the party's official policy of fast, healthy and stable economic growth, ``my own opinion is that we don't want to develop too fast,'' he says. ``Ten percent growth is too fast. I hope we can control growth to keep it below that level, ideally in the range of 6 percent.'' ``We are faced with a very critical environmental situation,'' Yang said. ``Our challenge is to do our best to overcome this serious situation,'' he said.
