FR940318-0-00106 FR940318-0-00021 Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Deapartment has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives. Paperwork Reduction Act These final rules do not contain any information collection activities and, therefore, no approvals are necessary under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511). Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these final rules is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these final rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect payments to individuals and States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
