Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says: This is a sinister act trampling upon the sovereignty and dignity of our Republic and a crude interference in our internal affairs. And it is a deliberate act to block a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue by complicating the situation on the Korean peninsula. The author of the commentary further says: The DPRK is a special position today after temporarily stopping the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. At the DPRK-U.S. contacts last year it had agreed to receive inspection necessary for the continuity of the safeguards of the IAEA on its nuclear sites and discussed this matter with the secretariat of the agency. If the secretariat truly has the intention to peacefully solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must renounce its unreasonable demand going beyond the scope of inspection necessary for the continuity of safeguards. No threat and blackmail can work on the Korean people. The seditious quarters of the IAEA should look squarely at the reality and behave themselves properly.
