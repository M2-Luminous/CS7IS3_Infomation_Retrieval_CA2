Francisco Diez Canseco, peace adviser and human rights representative, is with us today to share his opinion on the legislative body's ruling, which, according to some experts, interferes with the judicial branch's duties. Good afternoon, Mr. Diez Canseco. [Diez Canseco] Good afternoon. We believe that the draft bill approved this morning by the CCD -- that is, by the democratic majority -- is unconstitutional because it is retroactive and thus violates Article 103 of the Constitution. It also interferes with the independence of the judicial branch set out precisely in Article 139, Chapter 2 of the Constitution, which was approved by a majority of this very same legislature. Therefore, we believe it is absolutely essential that the president of the Republic himself -- in accordance with Article 108, which grants him such powers -- assess this law. This is a gross violation of the law and should not be endorsed by the executive branch. In addition, it seriously damages Peru's image to the extent that it implies a cover-up in the La Cantuta case. This case should be thoroughly clarified and those responsible punished to the full extent of the law. Both the Peruvian and international public demand it. An attempt is being made in this case to defend the Armed Forces, but instead the institution is being seriously harmed. We who have objectively acknowledged the government's efforts toward national peace, specifically the Peruvian Armed Forces' struggle against terrorism and subversion, want to say on this occasion that this law is totally inappropriate for the very Armed Forces themselves, aside from the fact that it is unconstitutional. As we have said on other occasions, we believe La Cantuta is an isolated case that does not imply an intentional policy of human rights violations on the part of the government. In this case, however, the legislative majority has grossly violated the law. This cannot be ratified by the government. We hope it will lead to a presidential assessment of the law. [Vidal] But Mr. Diez Canseco, considering the close coordination between the legislative majority and the president, and supposing that this law will be published tomorrow in the official newspaper, thereby becoming effective, what will happen to Peru's relations with the international community? [Diez Canseco] In my opinion, they will be seriously and meaningfully deteriorated, adversely affecting not only the government but the entire Peruvian community. This is regrettable because the government has made significant efforts these past years to correct the errors of past governments with an eye to reintegrating Peru into the economic community, the international economic community. The Peruvian people have cooperated a great deal in this effort with stoicism and patriotism. We cannot, therefore, allow a gross violation of the law to put at risk a struggle that has cost considerable efforts. To this we must add another aspect which, in my opinion, is very important. We have already received the report and studies issued by Mr. Watson, U.S. under secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, during his visit to Peru several weeks ago. One of the points that they, the U.S. Government, stress is the need for an independent judicial branch. The independence of the judicial branch is being violated here. If President Fujimori does not assess the law, the Supreme Court has the means to prove its independence; that is, by applying Article 138 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can enforce a constitutional ruling over a legal ruling that violates the Constitution. I do not think we have to go to such extremes. I think there is a middle road, and the president should resolve this by taking that road.
