This possibility is about to become a reality. Discovered in Ecuador in the Province of Esmeraldas in the mid 1970's, Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by a fly bite which can end up causing blindness in its victims, received attention in the Ecuadoran press a little more than one year ago. The reason for the attention was unfortunately the low state of public health in that province. A discussion of the cause of this situation ranged between malaria, a viral disease related to AIDS, and "river blindness," or Onchocerciasis. The positive aspect of this discussion, as VISTAZO reported, lay in the possibility that, because the territory in which the disease has been found is limited to rural areas of the Province of Esmeraldas, its transmission can be controlled, and this illness can be eradicated. This prediction was made by Ronald Guderian, a North American researcher from Vozandes Hospital in Quito. It was regarded with healthy skepticism by VISTAZO. Up to now the only disease in the world which has been successfully eradicated has been measles. This was done following an effort made by thousands of scientists, the expenditure of millions of dollars, and the passage of more than two decades. Furthermore, the last time that the term "eradication" was used in Ecuador was in connection with malaria. And although the National Service for the Eradication of Malaria, or SNEM, the government office in charge of handling this disease, still does not consider that the illness has been conquered, malaria eradication in Ecuador for the moment remains a well-intentioned wish, rather than a realistic goal. Nevertheless, the control and eventual eradication of Onchocerciasis is quite probable in Ecuador. Guderian says, "Yes, Onchocerciasis can be controlled." In fact he is the principal author of the "National Plan for the Elimination of Onchocerciasis in Ecuador," which he wrote in collaboration with Dr. Mariela Anselmi and Dr. Alberto Narvaez, of the Ministry of Public Health. Action on the plan began in 1993 and will be completed in 1997. The difference between this document and other, similar plans which have only been on paper, can be summarized in two terms: money and the effective distribution of medicine to those suffering from the disease. Guderian and his team, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Health, have obtained funds from foreign sources amounting to $170,000 for the first year of the program. By 1997 these funds will have totaled $730,000. This will be the financial cost of freeing Ecuador and nearly 25,000 Ecuadorans -- principally black citizens and members of the "Chachi" tribe of Indians in Esmeralda Province. As a result Ecuador is in an excellent position to be the first country to control the spread of this disease and accomplish its eradication, due to the availability of money, including funds from the local, private sector, the limited geographic distribution of the disease, the previous experience of Ecuadoran and foreign researchers, the lack of excessive bureaucracy in the program, the improved, though modest, cooperation of the Ministry of Health, and the donation of a medicine called "Ivermectina" by the Merck Pharmaceutical Company. Guderian has said: "According to the goals agreed upon at two recent, scientific meetings, our goals are stopping the spread of the disease by the year 2000 and achieving its eradication by 2011." Evaluation of the program at the national level will be conducted by Dr. Jose Rumbea, professor of tropical medicine at the University of Guayaquil and an associate of Guderian in the control program. Key Drug Rural areas of the Province of Esmeraldas basically have onchocerciasis because, in the affected areas -- the basins of the Cayapas and Santiago Rivers and other, small areas where the disease is found -- there are flies of the "Simulium" variety, known popularly as "juros" [always there], which transmit the disease. For example, when a person living in the Province of Esmeralda or an Indian of the "Chachi" tribe goes to the rivers to get water, he or she is bitten by a fly already infected with so-called "microfilary" parasites. In the bite the fly injects onchocerciasis larvae, which eventually settle in subcutaneous skin tissue, where they develop into adult worms. These worms are encapsulated by the body. In an attempt to isolate them the body forms subcutaneous nodules. Inside these nodules are worms which produce thousands of microfilary parasites which spread out into nearby body tissue. Immune reactions against the microfilary parasites, which account for most of the symptoms, can cause anything from blindness to skin wrinkles. If the microfilary parasites block lymphatic circulation, it is possible to see elephantiasis, a grotesque and pendulous growth of tissue alongside the obstruction. Trying to control the flies has turned out to be impractical because of the cost. The strategy which Guderian and his associates have followed is based on "taking away the raw material," so to speak, from the flies transmitting the disease. How is this done? In the first place, by extracting the subcutaneous nodules, where the adult worms produce thousands of microfilary parasites. This procedure is called "nodulectomy." Secondly, trying to reduce the number of microfilary parasites which, after leaving the nodules, move to the surrounding tissue, waiting for a fly which transmits the disease but is not yet infected to bite the sick person. The fly then becomes infected and can bite another, healthy person, continuing the transmission of the disease. The drug which successfully kills these microfilary parasites is called "Ivermectina." It has been donated by the Merck Pharmaceutical Company to the control program, thanks in part to efforts made by Dr. Plutarco Naranjo, the former minister of health. During the periodic trips which the researchers make to the areas affected by the disease they have evaluated more than 20,000 persons who have the disease. They provide them with "Ivermectina" twice a year and, if necessary, perform nodulectomies to remove the adult worms. According to Dr. Marlene Silva, coordinator of the present program, "When we go to see them, the great majority of the patients are interested in receiving `Ivermectina.' We work with their community leaders. Only in this way have we succeeded in reaching those 20,000 patients." In effect, according to Doctor Rumbea, who evaluates the results, "We have seen how, in certain cases, the number of microfilary parasites has been reduced after treatment from about 1,000 microfilary parasites per cubic millimeter of skin down to two or three microfilary parasites per cubic millimeter. Furthermore, the program for controlling onchocerciasis in Ecuador can serve as a guide for other programs, like the one in Colombia." [passage omitted]
