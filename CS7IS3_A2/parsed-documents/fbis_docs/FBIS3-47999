Accordingly, the government will decide on its position after discussion with ministries concerned, including the Ministries of Foreign, Defense, and Finance, in February. On 21 January, a government official said, "The Russian Government recently sent official documents to the ROK proposing joint development and production of weapons." He added that, "The government is carefully reviewing the list of possible items sent by Russia for joint development." The Russian proposal, which was made on the level of ROK-Russian economic cooperation, says that Russia will provide the ROK with 25 end-products, that the ROK may manufacture weapons with Russia's permission, and that the ROK and Russia jointly develop and produce weapons. Ultramodern weapons -- such as missiles, submarines, tanks, and fighter planes -- are included in the list of items proposed by Russia for joint development and supply. According to the government official, the ROK Ambassador to Russia Kim Sok-kyu will return home soon for intensive discussions on this matter. The position of the Foreign and Finance Ministries on this matter is that the ROK should at least consider the Russian proposal, while the Defense Ministry is saying that the ROK should consider the proposal cautiously, taking into consideration ROK-U.S. relations, supply of parts, and compatibility of equipment. Russia proposed joint development and production of ultramodern weapons to the ROK through unofficial channels late last year.
