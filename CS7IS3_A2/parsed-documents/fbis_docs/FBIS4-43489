Berlusconi, who arrived in Bonn on Thursday [16 June] on his first visit abroad since he became head of a government of a right-wing alliance, mainly pointed to the successes of his party, Forza Italia, and of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in the European election. Kohl welcomed his guest with military honors in front of the Chancellor's Office, before withdrawing with Berlusconi for lunch and political talks. In his welcome address, Kohl mainly underlined the joint positions in European policy. He pointed out that the founding treaties of what was then called the European Economic Community were signed as "Rome Treaties" in the Italian capital in 1958. After the collapse of nationalism and fascism in Europe, Italy and the FRG established stable democracies, the chancellor said, adding that Italy's commitment to Europe has always been exemplary. Italy and Germany always pursued the same course in Europe, "and we will continue to pursue the same course for Europe in the future, too," Kohl said. Berlusconi took over responsibility as Italian government head in an era of dramatic changes. "For this I wish you all the best, and may God be with you," Kohl said. In his reply, Berlusconi told the unusually large number of journalists that, after the European election, it was a particular pleasure for him to be in Bonn "since the political forces that we represent" have done so well in these elections. The Italian government head, who is facing international criticism due to the participation of the neofascist National Alliance in his cabinet, referred to the joint heritage in the Christian tradition, which united him with Kohl. The work of his government will focus on the struggle for peace, against antisemitism, and for tolerance. Berlusconi said he was very proud that Russia would participate in the summit of leading economic nations that he would host in Naples in early July. He called for a European task force, which should take military action whenever humanitarian principles were violated. There was no room for questions after the short statements by Kohl and Berlusconi. Berlusconi's short visit to Bonn had caused some protest, mainly on the part of the opposition. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and Greens had called on Kohl to distance himself from Berlusconi's neofascist coalition partner. In interviews in German media, the Italian prime minister and wealthy media tycoon defended the cooperation of the National Alliance in his cabinet. Michel Friedman (CDU), member of the Presidium of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, on Saarland Radio called on the Federal Government to keep its distance from the Berlusconi-led government. In an interview with BILD, the prime minister resolutely rejected the accusation that members of his government alliance were fascists. "There are no neofascists in my government," he said.
