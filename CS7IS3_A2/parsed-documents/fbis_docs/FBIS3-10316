Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas indicated that with the treaty "an increase in Costa Rican exports to Mexican markets is anticipated," which could bring in from $60 million annually to nearly $250 million in 1996. This Thursday, Costa Rica and Mexico announced the conclusion of negotiations that began in August 1991, as well as the signing of an agreement by next April. The Costa Rican official stated that when the treaty enters into effect on 1 January 1995, it will be possible to freely export products such as televisions, electrical energy distribution equipment, and dry batteries. Items that will benefit from zero customs tax also include polyester filaments used in textile manufacturing, motorcycle safety helmets, and safety deposit boxes. "Likewise, preferences deriving from a partial extension agreement that includes 150 customs items with a five-percent maximum tax were also consolidated." Among the items included in this category are glass bottles, aluminum products, rubber tires, leather suitcases and wallets, leather shoes, and wood doors. Rojas added that the Costa Rican textile industry was favored with a $5 million quota for clothing garments which is expected to increase each year by 15 percent. The minister emphasized that in the areas of intellectual property rights and services guarantees the Costa Rican system "will not have to be substantially modified." The document establishes that "Mexican investment, already present in the country for several years now, will continue to be encouraged in Costa Rica." Rojas emphasized that this agreement is the result of several months of negotiations and close coordination between both countries' governments and private sectors. "All things considered, the agreement places us in the forefront of the political map of those Latin American countries that are drawing closer to the path of hemispheric integration," the Costa Rican official commented. The bilateral treaty includes chapters on areas covering market access, guidelines for country of origin, unfair trading practices, services, investments, solving disputes, purchases from the public sector, and intellectual property, among others. Costa Rican businessmen pointed out that the treaty will facilitate greater trade flow under conditions of openness, equality, and mutual benefit for Mexico as well as for Costa Rica. They stressed that Costa Rica was able to ensure that the principle of asymmetry was reflected in terms of customs preferences for the entry of most Costa Rican products into Mexico and the purchase of Mexican raw materials with zero taxes. With respect to the guidelines which will determine the origin of the items included in the treaty, local businessmen indicated that the Raw Material Regional Integration Committee (CIRI) was established. It will be responsible for evaluating and solving any disputes related to the supply of regional raw materials.
