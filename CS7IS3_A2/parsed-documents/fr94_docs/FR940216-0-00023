FR940216-0-00023 FR940216-0-00008 Under Amendment 31, approved on October 18, 1993, Atka mackerel was established as a separate target category beginning with the 1994 fishing year. The Council made 1994 recommendations of overfishing and ABC for Atka mackerel. Uncertainty about the biological status of Atka mackerel and the concern that Atka mackerel is a prey species for Steller sea lions prompted the Council to adopt conservative TACs for this target species category. The Council established a TAC of 3,500 mt and apportioned the TAC between the Western (2,500 mt) and Central (1,000 mt) Regulatory Areas. NMFS implements a TAC of 5 mt for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Regulatory Area, raising the total TAC to 3,505 mt, to accommodate small amounts of Atka mackerel that might be caught in this management area. The total amount that was reported to have been caught in the Eastern Regulatory Area during the 1993 fishing year was 0.6 mt. Providing an Atka mackerel TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area provides consistency with respect to reporting requirements for Atka mackerel in the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, and will be less confusing for the fishing industry. NMFS has adjusted the TAC for the ``other species'' category and the overall sum of TACs to account for this change. The Council, after adopting the TACs, recommended 1994 apportionments of the TACs for each species category among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1994 TAC specification for GOA groundfish; therefore, the Council recommended that the DAP allowance equal the TAC for each species category, resulting in no TALFF or JVP apportionments for the 1994 fishing year. NMFS has reviewed the Council's recommendation for TAC specifications and apportionments and hereby approves these specifications under ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), except for ``other species.'' The 1994 ABCs, TACs, and overfishing levels are shown in Table 1.
