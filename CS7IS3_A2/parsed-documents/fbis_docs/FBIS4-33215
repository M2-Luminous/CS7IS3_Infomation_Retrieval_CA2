"We have to separate the electoral side from the institutional side," he said, "Quercia knows about our decision and he understands that the PMDB, with its blocs in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, is essential for guaranteeing the country's stability." In return, Franco assured Luiz Henrique that the government will not put the government apparatus at the service of any candidate and the president will not demand a unified opinion on the subject from his ministers. "The president did not prohibit any government member from joining an electoral campaign during off-duty hours," he said, "He never said it, at least not that I know." Henrique explained that a government official -- he did not report his name -- informed Franco that he would hold an executive position in a campaign. "I do not know who the official is; I only know that the president advised him to resign," Henrique said, "There is nothing wrong with ministers, most of whom are politicians, publicly expressing their preferences."
