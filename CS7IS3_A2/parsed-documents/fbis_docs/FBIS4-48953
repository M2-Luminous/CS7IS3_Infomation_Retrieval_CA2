In 1993, the official said, Shandong Province approved 8,012 foreign-funded projects with 7.55 billion U.S. dollars in investment, equivalent to the total amount for the previous 14 years. These enterprises, he said, produced nine percent of the total industrial output value and the foreign investment in these firms makes up 14.8 percent of the total capital investment in fixed assets. Foreign investment has also brought in advanced technology and facilities to help improve the industrial set-up of state-owned enterprises. In 1993, some 30 percent of aging enterprises or nearly 10,000 aging enterprises benefited from technical renovations with the help of foreign investment. Yantai city, for instance, attracted 790 million U.S. dollars to renovate 55 percent of the enterprises above county level. Up to now, over one million people in the province have found jobs in foreign-funded enterprises. "Shandong cannot experience such rapid economic development and profound improvement in people's living standards without foreign investment," said Zhao Zhihao, the provincial governor.
