Emphasis on these goals and progress toward them will help more individuals, including people with developmental disabilities, to live productive and independent lives integrated into their communities. The Projects of National Significance Program is one means through which ADD promotes the achievement of these goals. B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is the lead agency within ACF and DHHS responsible for planning and administering programs which promote the self-sufficiency and protect the rights of persons with developmental disabilities. The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000, et seq. ) (the Act) supports and provides assistance to States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of and have access to culturally competent services, supports, and other assistance and opportunities that promote independence, productivity and integration and inclusion into the community. The Act points out that: •Disability is a natural part of the human experience that does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental disabilities to enjoy the opportunity for independence, productivity and inclusion into the community; •Individuals whose disabilities occur during their developmental period frequently have severe disabilities that are likely to continue indefinitely; •Individuals with developmental disabilities often require lifelong specialized services and assistance, provided in a coordinated and culturally competent manner by many agencies, professionals, advocates, community representatives, and others to eliminate barriers and to meet the needs of such individuals and their families; The Act further finds that: •Individuals with developmental disabilities, including those with the most severe developmental disabilities, are capable of achieving independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion into the community, and often require the provision of services, supports and other assistance to achieve such; •Individuals with developmental disabilities have competencies, capabilities and personal goals that should be recognized, supported, and encouraged, and any assistance to such individuals should be provided in an individualized manner, consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of the individual; •Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are the primary decision makers regarding the services and supports such individuals and their families receive; and play decision making roles in policies and programs that affect the lives of such individuals and their families; and •It is in the nation's interest for people with developmental disabilities to be employed, and to live conventional and independent lives as a part of families and communities. Toward these ends, ADD seeks to enhance the capabilities of families in assisting people with developmental disabilities to achieve their maximum potential to support the increasing ability of people with developmental disabilities to exercise greater choice and self-determination; to engage in leadership activities in their communities; as well as to ensure the protection of their legal and human rights.
