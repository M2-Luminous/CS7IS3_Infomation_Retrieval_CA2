FBIS3-32624 "drlat028_o_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 Colombia * Industry, Business Surveyed on Production, Outlook 94SM0200A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jan 94 pp 1-4C 94SM0200A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Article by EL TIEMPO Economic Editorial Staff: "Economy, Better Than Businesses"] [Text] For most businessmen, 1993 was definitely not the best of years. Although the growth of the economy as a whole was good, the manufacturing sector's profits were impaired, and low demand hurt the productive sector's performance significantly. At the beginning of the year, the expectations were optimistic. After all, the country had emerged from one of the most severe electric power rationings of recent history. Nevertheless, the businessmen's forecasts were not completely fulfilled; and this was demonstrated by the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll (EOE) that, during the four quarters of 1993, sought the opinion of 300 businessmen from the economy's principal categories. The latest poll, which assessed business performance between October and December of last year, indicates that the year's end maintained the tendency of the previous quarters. Although the manufacturing industry's production and the services sector's sales increased more than during the third quarter, this was not reflected in earnings: According to 57 percent of the 300 businessmen queried, profits after taxes declined or remained stable. The traditional increase in demand during the Christmas season did not salvage the year, as many businessmen in the industrial sector were expecting. The apparent explanation for this is the competition generated by the "apertura" [economic liberalization] process. In fact, apertura has been increasingly indicated as a problem of the economy and of business firms in the EOE results. During the first quarter, manufacturers and merchants were not expressing very marked concern over the deregulation of imports. Nevertheless, in the second quarter fear began to be sensed; and, in the latest EOE poll, it became obvious that the competition generated by foreign products has become the main problem hurting businesses. Growth and Predictions If the results for industry, agriculture, and commerce were not as satisfactory as had been expected, how does one explain the fact that the economy grew 5.16 percent last year, according to the latest estimates from the National Department of Planning (DNP)? Much of the performance of the gross domestic product (GDP) is explained by construction, which grew 9.3 percent in 1993; the machinery and equipment industry, which dynamized the manufacturing sector's results; and public spending which, according to the Finance Ministry, contributed nearly 25 percent of the final results. This means that the prosperity of other sectors managed to offset the problems of demand and reduced profits faced by businessmen in the agricultural sector and certain branches of industry. Moreover, the poll for the last quarter showed that no one would have wagered on a 5.16 percent growth in the product. They began the year predicting a 3.21 variation; and, in the final quarter, not one of the 300 businessmen queried dared to mention over 4.32 percent. On the other hand, they were correct in the prediction of cost of living, because, on the average, the businessmen queried by the EOE mentioned 22.6 percent inflation for last year. In 1994, they expect the price index to be reduced to 21.6 percent. And what about rating the management of the economy? Apparently, manufacturers and merchants have not changed their views in this regard, and believe that the direction of the economy is not the best. The government's economic team received a rating of 3.2 out of five during the first quarter, and that figure rose to only 3.49 in December of last year. Eighth Economic Opinion Poll The eighth Economic Opinion Poll sought the opinions of 300 businessmen regarding the performance of production, sales, and employment in seven major industrial and services activities during the final quarter of last year. The EOE, which has been taken since March 1992, also gauges businessmen' expectations for the performance of the cost of living and the growth of the gross domestic product. On this occasion, factors such as workers' productivity and their wage level were evaluated as well.

Although, during the Christmas season, production rose for 44.9 percent of businessmen, this rate is far removed from the one attained between October and December 1992, when 68 percent of businessmen posted gains. Despite this decline, the outlook for businessmen improved substantially, considering the fact that, in the second quarter of last year, only 29.2 percent of those interviewed in the Economic Opinion Poll claimed that their production had risen. Another indicator that there are winds of recovery (albeit mild) relates to the performance of profits, which declined in that period for 55 percent of businessmen; whereas, during the Christmas season, they were lower for only 32 percent. However, it is still disturbing that profits should be declining for that percentage of manufacturers. One of the sectors hardest hit by the drop in profits is the textile industry. According to calculations made by the Colombian Textile Producers Association (Ascoltex), 80 percent of the companies had a negative balance last year. The textile firms, like other industries, have been hurt by contraband, underbilling, and the importing of products at prices below cost. Moreover, apertura has helped to foster the most intense specter hovering over the industry last year: low demand. The complaint from businessmen all year long was over the decline in the volume of orders, and the substitution of national products with imports. Painful Apertura Although the apertura program has enabled businessmen to reduce their modernization costs, owing to the lower taxes on machinery imports, it has been a headache for income and profits. The competition from imports has forced businessmen to moderate the increases in prices of their products, so as to be able to remain on the market. Since this belt-tightening is done by force on many occasions, and not because of a drop in production costs, earnings and income are being impaired. According to 54.4 percent of businessmen, apertura has had an unfavorable effect on their profits; and only 20.5 percent claim that it has had a beneficial effect on their earnings. As for income levels, 44.1 percent of those interviewed think that it has had a negative effect on them, whereas only 20 percent consider its effect positive. Where the opinions are divided is on the effect of apertura on employment. Half of the businessmen think that it has had no effect, whereas 31.5 percent attribute an unfavorable effect to it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry [figures are percentages] | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Production |Sales |Profits | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increased |44.9 |51.2 |37.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Remained stable |33.9 |26.0 |28.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Declined |13.4 |21.3 |32.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no ans-|7.9 |1.6 |2.4 | |wer | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stable Employment Except for Farming Areas With the exception of the agricultural sector, Colombian businesses did not have any traumatic experiences on the employment level during the final quarter of last year. Based on the responses from half the businessmen queried by EL TIEMPO, between October and December the numbers of jobs remained stable, as had occurred during the previous quarters. The situation is explained by the absorption of new workers on the part of sectors such as construction and services, which compensated for the predicament in the farming areas. In fact, during the quarter that has just ended, the boom in building activity continued, generating an increased demand for labor. Medium-sized business had a particularly dynamic performance with respect to the generation of jobs, as did exporters. Nevertheless, the fact that 44 percent of the farmers questioned claimed that their personnel rosters were cut corroborates, once again, the evidence of a crisis in the sector. The decline in production in the farming areas, combined with the elimination of certain crops, the insecurity, and the low investment by businessmen, sustained the recession. Despite this, the government's data and that of the farmers themselves warrant the prediction of a recovery beginning this year. Transportation Boom Nevertheless, and contrary to what might be expected, the farmers joined with the majority of economic sectors in agreeing on the slight effect of the apertura program on employment. A total of 57 percent of the businessmen polled claimed that the process undertaken by the government has not generated a crisis in their personnel rosters. The results appear to confirm the latest figure from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), showing that the unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 percent in 1993. Therefore, the fear of a massive layoff generated by the internationalization of the economy has been precluded. In cases such as that of the transportation firms, the effect of apertura on employment was particularly favorable. This performance may be explained if one considers the boom in imports and, hence, the greater movement of freight from port terminals. On the other hand, some manufacturers claimed that the process had a negative effect on their companies' payroll. The sector hardest hit was medium-sized industry, while the effect on large industry was slighter. This is explained by the desire to cut production costs, so that an exaggerated price increase will not occur. What Happened to Employment?

Nevertheless, during the final quarter of last year, the sector slowed down, owing to the problems of raw material shortages. According to the builders, the sector's main problem is the formalities required with the planning authorities, which are making it increasingly difficult to obtain a permit. Moreover, insecurity has become the second factor upsetting the construction industry. Based on the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll, 26 percent of those polled consider the sector's main problem to be insecurity. Sales Stagnant The slowdown in the construction industry is reflected by the stagnation in sales recorded during the past three months. A total of 66 percent of the builders polled claimed that the final quarter sales remained stable in comparison with the previous period; while 26 percent reported growth, and 6.7 percent noted that sales had declined. Similarly, 53 percent of the construction firms froze their personnel rosters; while 33 percent expanded them, and only 6.7 percent reduced their employee payroll. The construction companies are relatively optimistic regarding Colombia's economic growth in 1994: 53 percent think that the GDP will rise between 4 and 5 percent; while a quarter of those polled expect the economy to grow between 5 and 6 percent. According to the construction businessmen, the apertura process has been favorable, or has had no effect on the sector. Only 6.7 percent think that the internationalization of the economy has been detrimental to the construction industry. With regard to inflation, two-thirds of the businessmen queried believe that the 19 percent goal will not be met this year; on the other hand, they think that the CPI [Consumer Price Index] will be more or less the same as that of last year. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction (Profits) (figures are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increased |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Remained stable |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Declined |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Insecurity Less Disturbing Although insecurity is still the chief problem of the Colombian economy, its effect has begun to wane, according to many businessmen. This is inferred from the Economic Opinion Poll taken by EL TIEMPO, in which 26 percent of those interviewed considered it the most disturbing factor during 1993. Nevertheless, it is less so when that figure is compared with the 46 percent of persons polled who cited it as the main problem during the third quarter of 1993, and the 59 percent of businessmen who regarded it as the most disturbing factor during the period October-December 1992. The insecurity reflected in the guerrilla attacks, terrorist assaults, kidnappings, ticket selling, and common crime has been an obstacle in recent years to the strengthening of the economy and to increased foreign investment. For a long time, Colombia has been considered abroad as a nation in which investment is not advisable, owing to the risks that businessmen and foreign capital might run. Nevertheless, during the past few months the public order atmosphere has improved. With the death of the Medellin Cartel chief, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, and the possible surrender of the Cali Cartel chiefs, hopes of a new climate of peace in the national territory have been reinforced. The transportation sector appears to be one of those most damaged by insecurity. This was the view of 50 percent of those interviewed. Revaluation a Worry Another problem that is still besetting the improved performance of the Colombian economy is the apertura process, which has been translated into greater competition for national products. The economy's nationalization, in effect for four years, has proven unfavorable for the agricultural-livestock sector, which has complained of unfair competition from the subsidies applied by other nations to their products. Yet another very disturbing factor is the policy of revaluation, or strengthening of the peso with respect to the dollar. It was promoted last year for the purpose of preventing a greater rise in the cost of living. The uncertainty surrounding the economic management, which had been a highly disturbing factor, moved to a secondary level. Only 10 percent of those polled claimed it to be the principal economic problem. Apparently, there is greater confidence regarding the goals proposed by the government and the direction of the monetary, exchange, and credit policies. Oddly enough, contraband appears to be a lesser problem, despite the constant complaints from businessmen of its damaging repercussions on the economy. When the problems of Colombian business firms are analyzed, the fears become reversed. Insecurity is not so important, while apertura and revaluation definitely are. The effects of revaluation are especially disturbing to the agricultural and industrial sectors. This is understandable when one considers the fact that they are receiving less income from the exports of their products. On repeated occasions, producers, and especially exporters, have insisted that the devaluation rate should be higher. In 1993, the devaluation was 13 percent, and a similar trend is anticipated for this year. Their argument is that, despite the efforts that they are making to compete, their profitability will not improve unless there is a shift in the exchange policy.

Although there have been no terrorist attacks on buses and trucks during recent months, kidnapping and ticket selling are still a disturbing factor for transportation businessmen. Proof of this is the fact that a high proportion of company owners queried refused to answer the question about the performance of their profits. According to EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll, although apertura increased the supply of freight, it also facilitated the entry of imported vehicles, which have flooded the market and caused a decline in the sector's profitability. Of the total number polled, 40 percent claimed that sales had risen during the final quarter of last year, while 25 percent maintained that the demand for their services had been reduced considerably. A small proportion reported stability in their sales. A similar situation occurred in the case of profits. Whereas 40 percent of the businessmen indicated that they remained stable between October and December of last year, a quarter of those queried claimed to have had losses in their operations. Nevertheless, 20 percent noted that their profits had risen during the quarter. Personnel Rosters Frozen Despite the difficulties confronting the sector, during the final quarter of 1993 there were no massive layoffs of workers. Half of the companies questioned froze the personnel payroll, while 25 percent expanded it, and only 15 percent reduced the employee roster. In the opinion of most transportation businessmen, the government's economic management deserves a rating of 3.5; while 30 percent of the businessmen polled even gave it a grade of 4.0 on a scale of one to five. Based on the inquiries made in the EOE, the transportation sector approves of the government's target for economic growth this year: 40 percent of them believe that the GDP will grow 5 percent during 1994. However, a quarter of the businessmen indicated that this year's GDP would fluctuate between 3 and 4 percent. The same thing holds true of inflation: 35 percent of the transportation businessmen polled believe that this year's CPI will stand between 19 and 20 percent. Nevertheless, a quarter of the businessmen queried claim that the government's inflation target will not be met, because it will exceed 22 percent. Others think that the CPI will exceed its bounds in 1994, reaching levels of over 25 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transportation (Profits, final quarter/93) (figures are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stable |40 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rose |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Declined |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exporters Improve Profits Despite the peso revaluation, the economic stagnation in the developed countries, and the decline in certain international prices, exporters ended the year better off than expected. During the last quarter of 1993, sales increased for half of the businessmen, and remained stable for 22.9 percent. This was converted into the year's best performance, with the exception of the first quarter. During the 1992 Christmas season, the sector registered a slight recovery, because on that occasion sales increased for only 46 percent of businessmen, according to the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll. Although profits improved, they are still the main source of concern to a third of the businessmen polled. During the Christmas season, according to 30.5 percent of those interviewed, their profits increased; whereas 33.9 percent thought that they had declined. This performance shows a substantial improvement over the results for the July-September quarter, when 55.3 percent of the businessmen posted reductions in their profits. The revaluation that coexisted with exporters throughout the year became one of the main factors depressing the sector's profits. The slower rate of currency devaluation caused businessmen to receive fewer pesos for their sales abroad, while this proved to be a good deal for importers. Last year, the devaluation was 13 percent, whereas in 1992 it stood at 14.84 percent. The other two problems hurting the exporting sector were insecurity and apertura. The most negative effect of apertura was concentrated on profits: 47.5 percent of those polled thought that it had an unfavorable influence on their earnings. This is due to the fact that most business firms combine their export labor with internal sales. Hence, the competition from imported products and unfair commercial practices that caused anxiety for industry also harmed this sector. The effort expended by exporters to improve their productivity is noteworthy. By the year's end, 60 percent had achieved gains in this respect, and only 6.8 percent registered declines. The government estimates that the increase in foreign sales will be 5.6 percent at the end of 1993. However, judging from the performance of exports between January and September, this goal does not appear readily attainable. The latest report from the National Administrative Department of Statistics showed a 13.5 percent rise in nontraditional exports as of September. This increase managed to offset the decline in sales of coffee, oil, fuels, and other banner products, and prevented the occurrence of a drop in total sales, which rose 2.0 percent. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exporting Sector (figures are percentages) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Production |Sales |Profits | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increased |44.1 |50.0 |30.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Remained stable |28.8 |24.6 |31.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Declined |11.9 |22.9 |33.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no ans-|15.3 |2.5 |4.2 | |wer | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Finance Ministry | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Skepticism Regarding 1994 Inflation Colombian businessmen remain skeptical concerning the 19 percent inflation target set for 1994, but are optimistic about the growth of the Colombian economy. Although the government and the Bank of the Republic's board of directors have claimed that they will do everything in their power to meet that goal, only 17 percent of those polled expect inflation to stand between 19 and 20 percent. The remaining 50 percent, on the other hand, claim that it will be higher. The uncertainty regarding the performance of the cost of living continues, because many sectors expect food prices to start rebounding. Nevertheless, with the latest measures adopted, the government took the first steps toward meeting its goal. It readjusted prices of fuel and public services, with the exception of electric power, based on the anticipated inflation. And, for the first time, it raised the salaries of public workers and the legal minimum wage below the inflation rate of the immediately previous year. As for the rise of inflation in 1993, precisely, half of those polled agreed on a figure, indicating that it would stand between 22 and 23 percent. Another 30 percent predicted that it would be higher. At the end of 1993, the cost of living stood at 22.6 percent, according to data furnished by the National Administrative Department of Statistics. Economy Will Grow Regarding the growth in the gross domestic product, 31 percent of the businessmen claim that, by the end of this year, the increase in goods and services produced in the country will range between 4.0 and 5.0 percent. The government maintains that it will be 5.0 percent. This index is similar to that for the growth registered in 1993 that, according to the preliminary figures submitted by the National Department of Planning, was 5.16 percent. A remaining 22 percent are more optimistic, expecting the growth in the economy to exceed 5.0 percent. The uncertainty over a greater increase is associated with the change that might occur in public spending, which was one of the main driving forces of the economy last year. However, sectors such as construction and transportation, which contributed much to the increase, could begin to show a decline. Nevertheless, the government claims that it will compensate for these possible reductions with an impetus to infrastructure, primarily to road construction and rehabilitation. With respect to the growth in the GDP for 1993, 48 percent of the businessmen interviewed were more cautious, indicating that it would stand between 3.0 and 4.0 percent. On the other hand, 26 percent thought that it could reach 4.0 or 5.0 percent; and only 11 percent estimated that the figure might prove higher. In general, manufacturers believe that the economic picture in 1994 will be quite similar to that during the immediately previous year. Workers: Fair in Productivity If it were finally decided to adjust the minimum wage based on the workers' productivity, Colombians would not come out so badly. However, they would not have excellent results either. According to the rating given by 300 businessmen queried in the Economic Opinion Poll, white collar workers would receive 7.3 points out of 10 on the productivity scale. Although it is a medium grade, the businessmen claimed it to be higher than the rating that the workers would have received before apertura. In fact, 54 percent of those polled reported that the efficiency of their labor increased throughout the year; whereas only seven percent cited any decline. And there is every indication that the rating rose as a result of the competition generated by apertura. Both businessmen and workers had to adjust to the standards of their international competitors, so as not be excluded from the market. The progress was especially significant in agroindustrial, manufacturing, and commercial firms. Without Purchasing Power Nevertheless, the improvement was not reflected in the monthly salaries of operative workers in companies: 52.3 percent are earning between the minimum wage and 200,000 pesos. This means that the majority of white-collar workers cannot purchase the basic family shopping basket which, according to October data from the National Administrative Department of Statistics, costs 195,418 pesos. Only 31 percent of the workers have the necessary purchasing power to buy the items included in the basket for one month. They will be even less able to purchase the products in 1994. If the 19 percent inflation target is met, the price of the basket for laborers and the lower stratum will reach 232,547 pesos by the year's end. The sector in which wages are most depressed is agriculture: something explained by the decline in that industry's profitability. The majority of workers in the farming areas, on the medium and low levels, earn even less than 150,000 pesos. The income level for most of the laborers working in construction also fails to suffice for the purchase of the DANE shopping basket. In fact, 66 percent of the operative white collar workers in that sector earn between 150,000 and 200,000 pesos. The average salaries among administrative workers are better: 39 percent are earning between 350,000 and 450,000 pesos per month. This means that they can only purchase the items in the basic shopping basket twice. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Workers' Productivity (scale of 0-10) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture |7.47 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry |7.29 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction |7.47 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commerce |7.36 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transportation |7.30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Services |7.33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exporters |7.30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average total |7.36 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commerce: Christmas Did Not Meet Expectations Although half of the merchants had increased sales between October and December 1993, the results were very poor compared with those of the same period in 1992, when they rose to 86 percent. But, low blow and all, the last quarter was the best of the year, as is traditional. Commerce is one of the sectors benefiting most from the reactivation prompted by the Christmas celebrations, even more than industry, because it distributes both national and imported products. It is not without reason that EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll shows only 10.8 percent of those interviewed reporting declines in their sales. Furthermore, the earnings of merchants rebounded during the final quarter: 40.5 percent showed increases in their profits, while 27.0 percent claimed that they remained stable compared with the previous quarter. Although apertura has been beneficial for the sector, facilitating imports of goods, it has also allowed contraband to remain protected by legal imports. A total of 43.2 percent of those interviewed think that apertura has had a favorable influence on their imports; and 40.5 percent say that it has been beneficial to their income. As for the effect on profits, the opinions are divided: 32.4 percent indicate that it was positive, and 29.7 percent, that it was negative. The dismantling of customs' controls, which occurred after the merger of the Tax Directorate and the National Customs, was also decisive in converting contraband into one of the sector's principal problems. The other major bottleneck for commerce was insecurity, which surrounded all economic activities. Merchants, who began 1993 rating the government very harshly (they gave it a passing grade with three "reprimands"), granted it a 3.5 rating at the year's end. According to the EOE, the services sector (excluding the financial system) showed a good performance during the final quarter of 1993. A total of 54.8 percent of those interviewed reported increases in their sales, while 21 percent cited stability. Included in this sector are restaurants, travel agencies, and consulting firms, among others. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Business Sector (Sales) (figures are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increased |51.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Remained stable |32.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Declined |10.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |5.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Agroindustry Did Not Fare So Badly in 1993 Amid the skepticism that has surrounded rural production, a considerable portion of agroindustry achieved gains in its principal indicators. According to the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll, 32.7 percent of those polled estimated that there was an increase in agroindustrial production.
