Perlamutrov, corresponding member of Russian Academy of Economic Sciences, doctor of economic sciences, professor, and deputy director of the Market Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "Reforming the Central Bank: Financial-Economic and Political Aspects"] [Text] A message from the president of the Russian Federation spoke of the need for reformation of the Central Bank of Russia, the ultimate aim of which was the creation of a federal reserve system. How do the reformers envisage the Central Bank? For the time being it is not clear--there is no precisely formulated concept. One thing is clear--the process of reform will be under the president's control. In an interview by our newspaper (BIZNES I BANKI No 17, 1994), F.Ya. Livshits, director of a presidential group of experts, called upon the Central Bank of Russia, scholars, and bankers to express their opinion on the subject of their vision of a new banking system for our country. Before posing the problem of converting the Central Bank of Russia to a federal reserve system, however, the status and authority of the Federation's constituents should obviously be determined. This opinion was expressed by those participating in an applied science seminar (Moscow, 14 April this year) at which a number of problems related to reforming Russian banking systems were discussed. It was organized by the Market Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Energiya Association of Independent Commercial Banks, and the newspaper BIZNES I BANKI. We offer for our readers' attention the speeches of the seminar participants. We have just heard the ideas of F.Ya. Livshits, doctor of economic science. I have the impression that these are not the thoughts of a financier, or a loan officer, or a money specialist, but of an economist in general. The question right now is really not whether the president does or does not need to issue a document on organizing financial-industrial groups--this is a matter for a different level of managing the economy. It is a question of something quite different, above all, of the processes in the entire financial-economic sphere. The main thing is that, after all, we are not simply bringing about a reform, we are in a profound economic crisis. Industrial production has dropped by 60 percent, agricultural--by one-third, and putting new production funds into operation--almost 100-fold. This is not simply an economic crisis, it is the collapse of the country's economy. Even the crisis in the American economy at the beginning of the 1930's was a lesser one. Now they tell us that a "constriction" of Russian industry has taken place. The Russian language is a splendid language, and one can find many synonyms for any concept, but the word "constriction" in no way corresponds to the concept "crash." As a result of Gaydar's reforms, the Russian economy has arrived at a state in which it soon may not need any banking system at all. It will either function in a regime like the economy of "militant communism," when it has no need at all for either a banking or a monetary system, but needs a Gosplan, Gossnab, etc., or it will arrive at a state of utter chaos. There has never been a situation in the 20th century when in peacetime, in an industrially developed country, production has dropped on such a scale. In the report which we heard from the director of the group of experts affiliated with the Russian Federation president, however, he speaks, in such calm academic tones, about converting the Central Bank of Russia to a federal reserve system of the type that exists in the United States. Generally speaking, this sort of structure for central banks is characteristic of large countries--the United States, Germany, India. This is possible, however, when the situation in the national economy is more or less stable. It is highly doubtful that, with a general crisis in the national economy, the problem of reorganizing the central bank into a federal reserve system should appear as top-priority. Many regional organs of authority are actively coming out in favor of reorganizing the Central Bank of Russia into a federal system. They picture each oblast or autonomous republic as now becoming a competent member of the federal system. But why? In those same United States there are 15 banking districts, when there are 50 states. In general, it is not compulsory, or even necessary, for the administrative boundaries of territorial formations to coincide with the boundaries of the banking districts. It is much more logical for these latter to coincide with the boundaries of the economic regions of a country, such as the Center of Russia, the Northwest, the Central Chernozem area, the Urals, West Siberia, etc. No reforms in Russia will be successful if we reject, from the very start, the experience of other countries that have undergone huge critical shocks and have found a way out of them. At the beginning of the 1930's a monstrous economic crisis shook the United States. Industrial production dropped by 48 percent, one-third of the farmers and 5,000 commercial banks were ruined, and the nation's unemployed numbered about 14 million. F. Roosevelt, who had become president of the country, put a series of anticrisis laws through congress in the early days of his presidency. The first of them was the "Emergency Law on Banks." The houses of congress passed it in one day and the president signed it, that is, it went into force, in the evening. The status of commercial and investment banks was separated, which could not prevent mass speculation by the commercial banks in "short money" (which is widespread in Russia right now), but stimulated capital investments, which can only be the basis for an upsurge in the national economy. Unless there is an increase in capital investments in spheres such as agriculture, power engineering, machine-building, and light, food, and pharmaceutical industry, no monetary, customs, price, or state budgetary measures will provide a positive return for the national economy. The experience of developing European and other countries after the second world war is extremely helpful to us right now. The regeneration of the economy, after the military collapse, on normal market bases, following the rigid state control of enterprises is very instructive. Once again, the main factor was the organization of investments, not the conversion of a unitary central bank into a federal reserve system or vice-versa. For example, Japan got out of the postwar economic crisis along two main channels. In the first place, the enterprises existing mainly through the treasury, in the course of approximately 10 years after 1945 converted to commercial bases, to self-financing, and moreover they were divided up, merged, modernized, respecialized, etc., preparing for market conditions of operation. In the second place, the law established that commercial banks were obligated to transfer a quota of their liabilities "to the custody" of a central investment bank. This created a source of investment for regeneration and structural and technological reorganization of the country's economy. The results of these measures were manifested in the postwar augmented growth and improvement in the country's national economy in 1970-1990. One more point--the interrelations between the central bank and the commercial banks. While up to the middle of our century, the Ministry of Finance and the treasury were the main monetary center for the state everywhere, since gold or primarily gold working capital were emitted, now the central banks come forth as this center. The country's central banks have essentially become the dictator of its monetary economy and relations with other countries. In our country the laws in force on the Central Bank and on commercial banks grant the latter more rights than is accepted in other industrial countries. This is one of the reasons why the economy has been brought to an increasingly chaotic state. For example, the Central Bank cannot or does not have the right to demand from a commercial bank everything necessary to analyze the statistics on its activity. Obviously, a unified law on the country's banking system is needed, in which the rights and duties of both the upper and lower levels of this system would be unequivocally stipulated. In addition, in a period of crisis, a third level of the banking system should be assigned--investment banks, as was done in crisis conditions in the United States, Japan, France, and other countries. On the whole, during the period of crisis, Russia needs emergency anticrisis laws, including those in the banking sphere. As we emerge from the crisis, measures can be taken to convert the present central banking system into a federal reserve system. But not before that. Preliminary developments, of course, must begin right now.
