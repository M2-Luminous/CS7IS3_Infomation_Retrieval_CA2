Hypothetical assumptions are also being made about personnel changes, says a statement released today from Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary. However, absolutely no such conclusions can drawn from the decree "On the structure of federal executive bodies" signed by the Russian president a few days ago. The government structure outlined in the decree retains the Interior Ministry, only specifying its constitutional accountability to the Russian president. It is only natural that the logic of reforms leads to changes both in the government and in the operation of individual ministries. However, as far as the Interior Ministry system is concerned, I have been authorized to state that the president and the government have no short-term plans either to reform Interior Ministry bodies or to make any personnel decisions, says the statement from the Russian president's press secretary.
