Chinese, Russian, and international mass media are giving wide publicity to the visit and the Russian-Chinese talks on expanding cooperation in economic and other fields. Our station commentator Mulatov comments: The focus of the ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing is to expand and improve economic cooperation and trade between these two neighbors, and implement modernization. A slew of major agreements in this regard has been signed. A dispatch from Beijing by Japan's KYODO news agency takes note of the broad representational nature of the delegation headed by Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, pointing out that many members of the delegation are leaders of government ministries and competent departments, and representatives of business circles. As everybody knows, Russian-Chinese trade has grown rapidly in recent years. The two sides, however, are proceeding from this understanding: that is, bilateral cooperative ties and the potential for cooperation are far from being fully utilized. The fact that Russia and China are neighbors and their economies are mutually complementary will enable them to greatly expand all-round cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefits. Pointing out the growing ties in military technology between Russia and China, some mass media in the West have not ruled out the possibility of an accord on Russian-Chinese military cooperation. However, prior to the Russian Government's departure for China, (Beleiyi), a ranking official of the Russian Foreign Ministry refuted such predictions. He told an ITAR-TASS reporter that no military agreement whatsoever would be signed. The ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing are aimed at, first of all, upgrading mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between the two neighbors. Certainly, the two sides will also discuss regional and international issues of mutual interest. We will soon find out the specifics of bilateral agreements reached between the two sides. These agreements are designed to create more favorable conditions for mutually beneficial trade, economic, and scientific and technological exchanges between the two nations. Russian-Chinese dialogue will resume at the highest level this fall when PRC President Jiang Zemin makes an official visit to Russia. All in all, for China, 1994 could be described as the year of Russia; and for Russia, the year of China.
