Necessary To Be Able To Adapt"] [Text] Yaroslavl -- Yaroslavl Oblast has managed to find a way to support defense plants and help them in the conversion process. But this is not charity by the administration. The aid has been and continues to be available on market terms. In 1993 the oblast made the first attempt in Russia to finance conversion mainly through soft loans. In accordance with the ratified program, more than 1.2 billion rubles [R] were to have been allocated from the oblast budget last year. But only 60 percent of these funds were allocated owing to limited financial resources, and the last R189 million was paid out to enterprises at the very end of the year. Consequently, investment has been delayed. The other problem reflected in the results was inflation and price growth. Nonetheless, the work on the conversion program has enabled a number of defense enterprises to survive at a time of a general production slump, to retain qualified staff, and to organize production of new types of output -- namely, 47 buses, 3,500 microwave ovens, 3,150 liquid-fuel stoves, 100 milk coolers, and so forth. In all, output worth R2 billion has been produced under the program, and goods worth R500 million have already been sold -- which shows that there is a good level of demand. Of course, there have been some unforeseen situations. For instance, the "Kholodmash" enterprise has stopped producing microwave ovens, since the oblast requirement for these products is met by the Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant. "Kholodmash" then quickly switched to domestic refrigerators instead. The "Start" Design Bureau gave up the manufacture of portable digital nitrate measuring devices, since demand for them had in practice fallen. Although you would have expected the reverse. After all, the entire world monitors food quality. But, clearly, we have not reached that point yet. And returns on investment have not always justified the expenditure. Thus, despite using a R238-million loan from the oblast budget and R235 million from its own resources, the "Mashpribor" Plant produced output worth just R197.4 million. The oblast conversion program has been under way for 6 months, and a number of items are at the experimental mockup stage, undergoing testing, or being made ready for series production. These include electric choppers and electric meat grinders produced by the "Mashpribor" Plant, portable color camcorders [televideoustroystva] from the Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant, domestic air conditioners and refrigerator compressors, a series of medical instruments, and so forth. This year, the administration's collaboration with enterprises from the defense industry complex is undergoing certain modifications. Whereas previously enterprises' programs were taken at face value, the reluctance to "throw money down the drain" has now forced the administration to somewhat tighten up the requirements it places on the plans that are submitted. Specialists have elaborated a standard type of investment project which answers the three main questions of: "What is being produced, how will it be produced, and who is it for?" Unless a product has a known sales market, projects will not even be accepted for consideration. At the start of the year the administration drew up proposals on the industrial side of the budget for the oblast's development in 1994. The budget includes 37 investment projects and programs -- 29 of which relate to conversion. Many of them have received expert scrutiny from a working group at the Institute of the Economic Problems of the Transitional Period. The very names of these projects show the great opportunities that exist for expanding defense enterprises' economic activity and for them to successfully find their place in the Russian consumer market and boost their export potential. The Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant has submitted a project for the production of electronic engine management systems, along with a plan to organize production of wind-power installations. The "Kholodmash" Plant will continue to produce compressor motors for refrigerators and transportation air conditioners. "Mashpribor" has elaborated a whole program for the manufacture of production and technical output. "Yaroslavlrezinotekhnika" has also joined the conversion program, with a plan to produce carbon strips and building structures made out of cellular concrete. The oblast administration has started to set up an investment projects bank. After all, if they survive, it will be necessary to move forward.
