Ciller spoke at a rally where thousands of Kemalists gathered in the streets of Istanbul at noon today as a reaction to the anti-Kemalist initiatives of a group of fundamentalist parliamentarians. The rally aimed at stressing Turkish citizen's dedication to the secular and democratic principles of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey) and his reforms. One reason for the sudden surge of Kemalism was a defamatory statement made by Prosperity Party (RP) Deputy Hasan Mezarci, who called Ataturk an illegitimate child and refused to call him "Ataturk," which means "father of Turks." The name was given to Ataturk by the Turkish people in 1934 to their hero who led them to victory against the invaders of the country. Ciller earlier called for the masses to express their respect for Ataturk and their reaction to fundamentalists who attempt to defame his memory. She said the people's love of Ataturk has passed from generation to generation. "No one, not Mezarci, will be able to erase the love we have for Ataturk from our hearts," Ciller said.
