German participants at the EPP summit consultation say that Lubbers does not want to risk a tough confrontation at the Corfu summit since he does not stand a chance against Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene. The EPP summit agreed that as soon as a substantial majority is reached in favor of one of the candidates at the European Union summit, the one who looks likely to lose will withdraw. In this way a consensus can be reached on who should succeed Frenchman Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. The EPP did not agree to promote any Community Christian-Democratic candidates. Before the meeting began, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on Lubbers and Dehaene to embrace "so show that we are all friends."
