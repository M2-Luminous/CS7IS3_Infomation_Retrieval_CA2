FR941013-0-00046 FR941013-0-00025 47 CFR Part 76 [MM Docket Nos. 92&hyph;266 and 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;234] Cable Television Act of 1992 AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted a Fifth Order on Reconsideration to revise certain cable regulations affecting small cable operators. Small operators now will be permitted a total of 90 days after their initial date of regulation to complete and submit required rate justification forms and provide to subscribers advance notification of service and equipment changes. Furthermore, small operators may make their initial basic tier rates, established in accordance with the Commission's revised rate regulations, effective on 30-days notice without prior approval from their local franchising authority. If, upon subsequent examination of a rate justification, a local franchising authority or the Commission finds that a small operator has implemented rates in excess of the maximum permitted rate, refunds may be ordered in accordance with the Commission's regulations. These actions will provide small cable operators with the administrative flexibility needed to comply properly with the Commission's rate regulations. The Commission also has adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which may be found elsewhere in this Federal Register . EFFECTIVE DATE: November 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Cosentino, (202) 416&hyph;0800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 and MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;234, adopted September 12, 1994 and released September 26, 1994. The complete text of this Fifth Order on Reconsideration is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service at (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Synopsis of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration Pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), the Commission has established a comprehensive regulatory framework governing rates for regulated cable services and equipment. Under that framework, all regulated cable systems generally must set rates based on a 17 percent competitive rate reduction from September 30, 1992 levels unless the system is (1) eligible for temporary transition relief, (2) is eligible for temporary streamlined rate relief, or (3) justifies rates based on a cost-of-service showing. The 1992 Cable Act requires the Commission to reduce regulatory burdens on small systems. Small systems are defined in the statute as systems serving 1,000 or fewer subscribers. Pursuant to that mandate, the Commission's regulatory framework governing regulated cable services incorporates several features designed to reduce administrative burdens on small systems. These small systems may elect to make streamlined rate reductions, unbundle charges for regulated equipment based on their average equipment costs, make use of a streamlined cost-of-service showing, or opt for transitional rate relief. Small cable operators also may elect transitional rate relief. Small operators are defined as operators serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers who are not affiliated with a larger operator. Under the Commission's rules, cable operators must file a rate justification or cost-of-service showing for regulated service and equipment, within 30 days of the initial date of regulation. All cable operators are required to have rates and service offerings that comply with our rules on the initial date of regulation. Operators with equipment or service charges that exceed permitted levels are subject to refund liability. As indicated, the 1992 Cable Act requires the Commission to reduce administrative burdens for small systems. We believe this statutory purpose would be furthered by permitting small operators a brief period of time to restructure and establish rates and service offerings that comply with our rules after a tier becomes regulated, rather than require them to be in compliance with rate rules on the initial date of regulation. We take these actions on reconsideration on our own motion. Petitions for reconsideration in Dockets MM 92&hyph;266 and 93&hyph;215 addressing other aspects of our rate rules remain pending and will be addressed in subsequent Orders. We take up these issues on our own motion in order to establish additional relief for small systems as required by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 47 U.S.C. ยง543. In the Rate Freeze Order, the Commission stated that it would consider lifting the freeze for a particular cable system if it could demonstrate that the freeze would impose severe economic hardship or threaten the viability of continued cable service. See Rate Freeze Order, MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, FCC 93&hyph;176, 8 FCC Rcd 2921, 58 Fed. Reg. 17530 (April 5, 1993). The Commission later denied Fidelity Cablevision, Inc.'s request for a waiver of the rate freeze for, among other things, failing to show that foreclosure proceedings had been, or would have been, initiated as a result of the rate freeze. See Order in the Matter of Fidelity Cablevision, Inc. Petition for Emergency Relief, FCC 93&hyph;445, 9 FCC Rcd 2629 (1993). In a July 28, 1994 letter, Jere W. Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, wrote to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that ``[p]roviding assistance at the time of bankruptcy or other type of loan foreclosure is too little assistance too late.'' In the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, the Commission made available hardship rate relief for an operator that concludes that the benchmark/cost-of-service regulations threaten its financial health or ability to provide cable service. See Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;39, summarized at 59 Fed. Reg. 17975 (April 15, 1994). Such relief does not require a showing that foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings have been or would be imminently initiated, and continued cable service need not be in jeopardy. An important factor in assessing any hardship showing will be the operator's ability to meet costs, including costs associated with capital improvement and debt service. We recognize that there are differences among cable operators based on system size, and that small operators may experience greater difficulty in assembling documentation to make a hardship showing. Therefore, we would expect that a small operator could rely on existing data rather than expending resources on obtaining an independent analysis of its financial situation. Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that for those operators facing financial challenges, time is of the essence. The Commission will work as expeditiously as possible to resolve any request for hardship rate relief filed.
