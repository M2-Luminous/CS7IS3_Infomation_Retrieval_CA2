The ink on the document was barely dry, as they say, when one of the newspapers already called the program inflationary. However, I am sure that the journalist did not even take the trouble to glance at it. How can the program be called inflationary when we are not taking a kopeck from the state budget for its realization? Out of the general sum of 40.810 billion rubles [R] needed for retooling the sector the enterprises' own funds comprise R28.168 billion, or 69 percent, and other funds that have been attracted comprise R8.526 billion (20.9 percent). Only R4.116 billion, hardly more than 10 percent, is from state investment credits. Credit, I emphasize, which needs to be returned and not grants or subsidies. Of course we will need state support in order to fulfill the program. It is necessary to review duty rates for stimulating the export of metallurgical products with a high technical preparedness and restraining analagous imports. Certain other tariff and tax relief is required, let's say for importing equipment which is not produced in Russia, and for a number of other instances. But this is normal state protectionism which is practiced everywhere for supporting basic sectors of a country's economy. And metallurgy, along with the fuel and energy complex, determines the viabiliy of Russia's economic organism as a whole. Fulfilling the complete volume of work for technical retooling of metallurgy goes beyond this century. However, the realization of basic measures intended before the year 2000 will allow significant improvement in the structure of metallurgical production. Introducing progressive technology will decrease the expenditure of steel for rolled metal, of coke, energy resources and pig iron for steel smelting. This will also significantly improve the ecological situation in the metallurgical regions.
