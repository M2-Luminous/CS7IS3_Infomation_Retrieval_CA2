Many government officials regret inheriting what they believe could have been overcome by the previous government -- a high budget deficit of more than 10 percent and an uncontrollable economic imbalance. According to government officials, the country is currently facing a severe crisis. Prices cannot be stabilized, nor can economic order be maintained to avoid additional burdens on the Honduran people. A lack of decisionmaking in the face of high fuel prices has angered the people. There has been a shortage of staple products, and, worse, prices are out of reach of ordinary citizens' pocketbooks. The people are also enduring a milk shortage -- a heavy blow to the children of Honduras -- without any solution to this serious problem in sight. The IFI's will continue to pressure the government to comply with its debt commitments. In order to meet this demand, the government must reduce its budget deficit and its expenses, stabilize the currency, and reduce the size of government. The IFI's are even recommending taxes, such as a sales tax of 7-10 percent. The World Bank itself, in it latest recommendations, demands that the tax structure be simplified; that the tax base be broadened; and that existing tax exemptions, including some income tax exemptions, be reduced. More serious to consumers is that the government has been asked to eliminate subsidies that are not directed at the poorest sectors, including urban transportation subsidies, and to improve supervision of the decentralized enterprises and to revise their rates, which means higher priced public services such as electricity, water, and telephone service. In the same way, there is a clear intention on the part of the IFI's to privatize as soon as possible Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise], SANAA [National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and ENEE [National Electric Power Company]. As a result, the people will continue to suffer through greater increases in the price of food and other household products -- in other words, the price of staples. At this moment there is a natural concern among the country's different organized sectors. These sectors already foresee a weak and wavering government, despite its promised humaneness and boasts of social liberalism. It is not easy for President Reina to carry out a definitive plan to face Honduras' economic and social problems in the first 100 days of his government. Moreover, the external pressure is so strong that the government is seen as being a (?hybrid) without a true policy of its own to confront the country's economic and social problems. In other words, nothing is getting accomplished. The campaign promises were a good means for gaining power, but thousands of Hondurans will continue to buy more expensive food. Thousands of Hondurans will continue to pay more taxes, and thousands of Hondurans will continue to bear an increase in public service rates. The country is on the brink of economic imbalance and desperation, hoping that a governmental solution will avoid so much abuse against its citizens.
