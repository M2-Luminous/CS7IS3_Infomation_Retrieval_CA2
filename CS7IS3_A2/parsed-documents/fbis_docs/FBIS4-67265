FBIS4-67265 "jptdd022__l94029" JPRS-TDD-94-022-L JPRS Narcotics 6 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Coca Dealers Reportedly Paid $200 Million to SL Leader Coca Dealers Reportedly Paid $200 Million to SL Leader PY1805025694 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 6 May 94 p A6 PY1805025694 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Article by Carlos Aponte, a correspondent in Tingo Maria] [Text] Interior Ministry intelligence analysts estimated the fortune amassed by Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "President Feliciano," at $200 million through kickbacks paid by gangs of drug traffickers operating in the area known as the coca belt region, which is located along the jungle. According to these analysts, who are conducting an investigation in the region, Ramirez started to collect this money--which accounts for one-third of the total flow moved through the marketing of cocaine paste in the region under Shining Path [SL] control; that is, $600 million--a few months before the arrest of Abimael Guzman. Ramirez managed to do this despite the fact that the SL has lost control of major drug centers such as Crespo, Castillo, Pueblo Nuevo, Pacayacu, Loro, and recently--as a result of Operation "Aries"--Mohena, Moyuna, Venenillo, Mongon, and Ancayacu, among others. By contrast, cassava, rice, corn, and other legal crops have yielded only $30 million. Through disclosures made by repentant drug traffickers at the 303d Battalion on the Huallaga Front, it has been learned that "Feliciano," "El Manco," and other SL leaders who deal with the drug traffickers have permanent ground-air contact through powerful receivers, portable transmitters, and using coded messages. Huallaga Front strategists believe Operation "Aries" prompted the suspension of flights by Colombian planes in the Leoncio Prado (Huanuco) and Padre Abad (Ucayali) areas. Despite the information obtained by counterintelligence agents from repented former SL leaders and peasants forced to work for the SL for some time, there is no firm clue as to the place where the fortune Ramirez amassed by exacting kickbacks from drug traffickers is hidden. There is evidence, however, that drug traffickers and SL members circulate large amounts of dollars through local branches of banks and financial companies. The fact is that not all the proceeds from drug sales are "laundered" in Lima by individual money exchangers or through investments in legally constituted companies. There are several financial companies competing for narcodollars along the coca belt region. According to intelligence sources, no one should be surprised if "Feliciano" made large deposits through a front, if he is keeping a major portion of the money, or he distributed it through his closest aides and henchmen. The truth is that the money is concentrated in few hands because those terrorists who are clashing with security forces--the ones called the "rank-and-file"--are poorly fed, dressed in rags, and suffering from contagious diseases such as scabies, tuberculosis, and cholera. Some repented SL leaders who were recently captured admitted that most of those now following "El Manco" have absolutely no morale, that they are following him out of fear for their families who have been kidnapped by the SL, which has threatened to murder them. It has been reported that drug shipments have been suspended after the dismantling of the so-called "Red Sea" battalion and as a result of the capture and/or surrender of many subversives and the action of antisubversive forces at the Ucayali Navy base. Based on information obtained in the region, it has been ascertained that each shipment consisted of 300 or 500 kg of basic cocaine paste, depending on whether the carrier was a single-engine or twin-engine plane, respectively. DEA agents said that basic cocaine paste produced in the coca belt is transported to large refinery laboratories located in the Amazon Trapeze jungle (an area located between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru) where, after being processed into cocaine hydrochloride, it is shipped to the United States and Europe.
