Rumessen was speaking at a protest meeting in front of the Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn. Weekly pickets are being held in front of the naval headquarters each Monday, and activists from the Estonian National Independence Party say protests will continue until Russian military have left the country. "The situation at the talks is very good for Estonia," Rumessen said today. "It's Russia's problem that the talks have run into a deadlock." Another MP, Enn Tarto, added that bending to pressure from Russia would mean acknowledging Moscow's policy of the so-called near abroad. "Russia wants to make Estonia put up with the situation when Estonia would depend on Russia," Tarto said. In Rumessen's words Russia is doing everything to overthrow Estonia's current government "with the help of her agents here." Another well-known political activist, vice-president of the Organization of Unrepresented Nations Linnart Mall, called on the Russian military to leave Estonia. "Russian soldier, I love you; please go home and build up your home country," he shouted in his speech. More emotional spots were added to today's picketing by the singing of Gaudeamus men's choir from Tartu.
