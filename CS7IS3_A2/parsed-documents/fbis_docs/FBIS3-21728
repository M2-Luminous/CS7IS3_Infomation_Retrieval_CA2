Within two weeks, 43 kg of cocaine was seized by the anti-drug brigade following the seizure of the 12 kg that a voodoo priestess was last week carrying to the United States. Since the beginning of the year, brigade authorities report they have seized 71 kg of cocaine and arrested 17 people involved in drug trafficking. Major Casimir Louis states that the greatest problem the service now faces is the problem of justice. [passage omitted]. About two weeks ago, the office broke up a drug network outside Port-au-Prince. At that time, the authorities seized two kg of cocaine, which is still in their office, and $100,000 U.S. In a statement by Maj. Casimir Louis on 1 March, the officer denied the accusation regarding the involvement of the Haitian military in drug trafficking. He recognizes, however, that just as in all other institutions, the military could be involved in drugs, a military Casimir Louis calls dissident.

The amount of the drug that the authorities seized on 1 March is evaluated at $2,800,000. [end recording]
