FBIS4-31343 "dreeu110__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-110-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Report on Government Economic Program for 1994 Report on Government Economic Program for 1994 94CH0259A Bratislava TREND in Slovak 20 Apr 94 p 27 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94CH0259A Bratislava TREND Slovak CSO ["Summary" in English: "Program Declaration of the Slovak Government"] [Text] In 1994, the government wants to achieve zero growth of GDP, to keep inflation between 10 and 13 percent, unemployment under 17 percent and maintain budget obligations. An increase in pure foreign exchange reserves is presumed so that the internal convertibility of the currency and positive payment balance would be maintained. The government will try to obtain a stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund to enhance macroeconomic stability. The government also plans to create conditions that will facilitate the wider use of foreign sources toward developmental aims. In 1993, the GDP in Slovakia dropped by 4.1 percent compared to the previous year. The state budget deficit grew to Sk23 billion ($697 million), representing 6.8 percent of GDP. Compared to 1992, exports have fallen by 11.5 percent and imports have risen by 15.4 percent, despite the devaluation of the Slovak crown. This leaves Slovakia with a passive balance of trade valued at Sk26.7 billion ($809 million). The clearing exchange with the Czech Republic accounted for Sk5.8 billion ($176 million) of the passive foreign trade balance. Unresolved financial obligations in the public sector including health care, transport and education were not included in the state budget deficit in 1993, thus adding Sk6 billion ($182 million) to the 1994 budget. In 1993, the increase of prices climbed to 23.2 percent which in comparison to price increases of 1992 is more than double. Unemployment rose to 14.4 percent by the end of 1993. The previous government did not take definite steps for stabilization and support in small business development, resulting in 57.5 percent companies in the red at the end of 1993 with a total loss of Sk42.5 billion ($1.29 billion). The previous government also is responsible for weakening foreign investment, particularly by not securing the necessary economic stability. At the end of 1993, the amount of foreign investment was Sk10.8 billion ($327 million), which was Sk4.2 billion ($127 million) more than in 1992. But excluding the capital of Czech investors, the increase was only Sk3 billion ($90 million). During the six-month mandate period, the government wants to speed up the process of economic transformation, especially regarding ownership matters. Privatization will be renewed with the previously successful voucher privatization process, which has earned the trust of citizens. The government considers the renewal of trust in the privatization process to be of utmost importance for both citizens and foreign investors. By the end of the second wave of voucher privatization, more than half of all properties under state ownership should be in private hands. The government will provide for the fairness of privatization methods among the participants and make the process clear for all. As opposed to the previous government, which considered the voucher privatization a residual method and delayed its preparation, the current government will approach it as an equal to other privatization methods. All branches of the economy will participate in voucher privatization, including many attractive investment opportunities. The government will try to hasten the sale of shares held in the portfolio of the National Assets Fund (FNM). The FNM should only passively execute ownership functions in companies which have major private shareholders. The government released this declaration with full knowledge that it has only a six-month mandate.
