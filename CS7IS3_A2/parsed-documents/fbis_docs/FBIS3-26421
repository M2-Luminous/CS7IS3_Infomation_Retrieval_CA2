C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- The Dalai Lama is expected to visit Taiwan in May or October in his capacity as a religious leader, an elder brother of the Tibetan spiritual leader announced at a news conference late Monday [7 February]. Gyalo Thundup, who led a four-member Tibetan group here, said that the Dalai Lama will meet with President Li Teng-hui, Premier Lien Chan, other ranking government officials, and religious leaders during his stay in Taiwan. The Dalai Lama, who has received a letter each from President Li and Premier Lien, admired Taiwan's political and economic achievements made during the past four decades, Thundup noted. A possible visit by the Tibetan spiritual leader has stirred great interest here since Chao Tze-chi, chairman of the World League for Freedom and Democracy, extended a formal invitation in 1992. On Beijing's possible reaction, Thundup said that the Dalai Lama paid no mind to Mainland China's views toward his planned visit to Taiwan, nor did Beijing express opposition to the visit. Currently, he pointed out, the Tibetan government-in-exile makes frequent contacts with mainland authorities. The Dalai Lama has headed the Tibetan Government-in-Exile since 1959 when he fled Lhasa, Tibet's capital city. Communist Chinese troops launched military campaigns against Tibet in 1949 and occupied the land in 1951. Meanwhile, Thundup noted, Premier Lien has given the green light to the establishment of a liaison office in Taipei by the exiled government. The exact time for the office's opening, however, has yet to be worked out, he added. The soon-to-be-established liaison office, aiming to strengthen cultural exchanges, will be similar to other offices around the world, he said. Thundup, who studied at National Chengchi University in the 1940's and speaks fluent Mandarin, left for home Tuesday morning. Chang Chun-yi, chairman of the cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that the government, while welcoming the Dalai Lama's visit, is deeply concerned about the Tibetans in exile. Statistics show that there are 120,000 exiled Tibetans in India, 20,000 in Nepal, 8,000 in Sikkim, and 4,000 in Bhutan. "We hope to work out with the Dalai Lama a solution to the problems facing the Tibetan exiles such as education and health care," Chang stressed.
