Imset: "Southeast Burden To Grow"] [Text] The strongest repercussion of the newly announced economic package is to be observed in the impoverished Southeast region of Turkey where Kurdish separatists have been fighting a bloody war since 1984 at the cost of more than 11,000 lives. Poverty and unemployment is high in this region where some 400,000 security forces consisting of soldiers, policemen and paramilitary village guards have been deployed. Reports from within the military is that Ankara is currently considering to send some 150,000 additional troops to the region this summer in a bid to deliver a final blow to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). News is that security forces are currently sweeping the mountainous areas and the PKK death toll is quite high. But there is a general consensus--even among security commanders in the region--that the campaign is not solving the problem but serving only to postpone it for the future. Just like Turkey's crackdowns on 28 separate Kurdish uprisings in its republican history. Each and every measure, meanwhile, is increasing the cost of this undeclared war--which the military, as in many countries where guerrilla wars are fought, insistently refer only to [it] as an armed conflict or "limited warfare." Turkey's military commanders and state officials naturally avoid accepting the concept of war for the crisis, aware that this would not only give legitimacy to the other side of the conflict but also turn it into a counterpart. Counterpart or not, the PKK has become a major problem for Turkey in many fields. Observers of the conflict argue it would be a severe mistake to insist on seeing the current problem as one of a terrorist nature alone. Indeed, Ankara's approach to the crisis has been a highly hypocritical one over the past two years, and this alone has put into force a military campaign without any economic, social or cultural backing. The promise, year after year since 1984, has been to "break the backbone of the terrorists." The argument, one which has gone bankrupt, has been that the problem: is a) One which stems not from Turkey but from foreign countries with foreign support; b) A problem of terrorist nature alone; and c) A problem which will surely be solved without having to "give in" to international demands aimed at "dividing Turkey." In other words, despite what Turkish representatives recite in foreign capitals with regard to Ankara's recognition of the "Kurdish identity"--a recognition which lacks any substance--Turkey insistently denies recognizing it is dealing with a Kurdish problem. Unfortunately, the "Kurdish problem," which Ankara fails to recognize, is not a problem of terrorism. Nor is it a problem created by "a handful of bandits" as claimed repeatedly by officials over years of ignorance. Fortunately for Turkey, though, it is not only a "PKK problem" either. As a moderate pro-Kurdish magazine recently summarized it, "The Kurdish problem is the problem of 20 million people (in the Middle East) wanting to live freely and like human beings." The problem, which started off as one based on demands for further rights, equality and even autonomy, has now turned into a battle on the Kurdish part for the restoration of principal human rights and the right to live. PKK attacks, mainly on Kurdish civilians, and counter-terrorist operations in the region have literally suffocated the local population--best expressed in increased migration to the cities, depopulation of villages and new deaths every day. Recently, SABAH newspaper columnist Hasan Cemal wrote after visiting the region and holding talks with the most senior officials there that Turkey had decided to introduce "bitter medicine" in the Southeast. According to him, the evacuation of villages, razing them to the ground, forceful depopulation of certain areas and "mystery killings" which are observed every day are part of this bitter medicine. In other words, what has taken place until now is being regarded only as mild medicine despite its results and the bitter dose is newly being injected. Thus, the people of the Southeast now face two doses of bitter medicine in contrast to Turks living in other parts of the country. On one hand, they have to suffer the "bitter medicine" in the military field and with military measures. On the other, they will suffer from the "bitter medicine" Prime Minister Tansu Ciller offered the nation on April 5. A medicine which even World Bank officials said was "medicine by the bottle rather than the spoon." Economic hardships are to be felt even more in this troubled region where unemployment is hovering at around 70 percent and investments and business have come to a halt owing to terrorism. All of the pain inflicted nationwide with the new austerity package is bound to be doubled, or even tripled, in this region where salaries are relatively low and opportunities are scarce. The Situation Since 1984, when the PKK launched its first attacks on two Turkish targets, Turkey has been seeking to solve the crisis in the region through military policies alone, refusing to see into the realities of the crisis, correctly diagnose it and treat it accordingly. The result of this policy can be summarized in three parts, disregarding how the PKK itself regards the situation. First of all, the mistaken policy put into force in the region and Turkey's insistent refusal to grant the Kurds their cultural and social rights has led to a strengthening of the PKK over the past decade. This strengthening has further been boosted by widespread human rights violations in the region. Despite the violations by the PKK, including the mass killing of Kurdish women and children, Turkish violations have received more coverage in the international media. Having accepted that the PKK is a "terrorist" organization, many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and even foreign governments have started to see PKK violence as "a natural phenomena of terrorism" but have rightfully expected Turkey, a state, to live up to the standards of being a state. This situation, on one hand, has strengthened the PKK's popular support in the Southeast and, on the other, has boosted international sympathy for the Kurds altogether-- often being mixed up with sympathy for the PKK, which claims it represents Turkish Kurds. Secondly, through its insistence on a military solution to the crisis and despite all that has been said, Turkey has been forced to change its overall approach to the Kurds in the recent years. Although officials may dislike the current position Ankara has fallen into, it is evident that PKK attacks and a constant wave of violence has a) Pushed Turkey into lifting a military-imposed ban on using the Kurdish language; b) Accepting the "Kurdish identity" although it has still not done anything about it and c) Debating the overall problem more freely even though "unwanted opinions" are still being repressed immediately. Turkey, in its failure to take any cultural, social or economic steps to lift the burden off the shoulders of its Kurdish people, has had to make concessions instead, ending up indexing its own "Kurdish policy" on the PKK alone. This is a concession which no state should end up making. Thirdly, the military solution sought for the Kurds of Turkey has not only strengthened the PKK, hurt Turkey's own image abroad and pushed Ankara to the point of concessions, but has also yielded some frightening results: 1. There has been an immense alienation between the Turkish and Kurdish people who have created this country hand in hand and who share 1,000 years of a joint history. Turkish frustration at terrorist attacks by the PKK has been channeled into reaction to the Kurds in general and vice versa. This alienation is now systematically being fanned by activists of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and certain local forces. 2. The failure of the military policy put in force since 1984 has finally forced Turkey's civilian administration into giving a major concession to the Army, allowing military commanders once again to play a dominant role in all national affairs. In the absence of any alternative and in the form of "a last bid," the civilians have surrendered authority to the military, believing "this time" again that the latter will be able to solve the problem. 3. Aware that it cannot tackle the Kurdish issue having strengthened the stance of the military to this extent, Turkey's civilian administrators have yielded to pressure for further authority and agreed with military plans to force the local populace "to make a choice." Currently, the 1994 campaign aims at forcing the civilian populace in the region to "decide which side they are on" and act accordingly. Both the PKK and Turkish security forces are against "undecided masses" and aim at forcing them to their sides. If this systematic campaign cannot be prevented, there will be no "undecided" or "innocent" civilians in the region and the society will be broken into two major parts, the village guards and the militia. 4. There has also been an increase in regional support to pro-Islamic policies in the region which, in the absence of a pro-Kurdish political formation, has led to a major victory of the Welfare Party. All of Turkey's past "Kurdish uprisings" have been Islamic in nature, and there is concern that this new development may trigger an even more serious crisis. 5. Finally, the cost of the military campaign on terrorism has grown by the day and continues to increase. It has now turned into an incredible burden on Turkey and the Turkish people. The Burden The burden is, to be frank, far greater for Turkey than any "political solution" to the problem could have brought forth until now. Whether Turkey is truly aware of the cost of this undeclared war is not quite clear although it is evident that the crisis is serving the interests of at least some regional circles such as the feudal landlords who are following Middle East fashion and are creating their own small-scale armies and making a great profit out of them. And, there have been those countries who have unwillingly participated in the conflict. Countries which are now exploiting their past decisions to blackmail Turkey on the international platform. Germany, for instance, is Turkey's largest light arms supplier in the sense of weaponry used in the Southeast "border region" and is now making trouble for Ankara, claiming its weapons have been used against the PKK while they were delivered only for NATO-related defense purposes. According to independent figures, Germany has delivered DM [German Mark] 3.6 billion worth of arms in the form of grants to Turkey in the 1985-1991 period. But it was only after the Gulf war that East German weapons were spotted widely in the region. A grant of 256,125 Kalashnikov-type assault rifles, 100,000 RPG Bazookas, 300 BTR 60 type armored vehicles and 450 million ammunition is part of this grant. The estimated cost of the package is somewhere around DM 1.5 billion. On top of this, it is noteworthy that Germany (or rather German companies) were those who supplied the weapons--especially chemical weapon components--needed in Saddam Husayn's past campaign against the Kurds. A campaign which, in Halabjah in 1988 alone, wiped away a total of 5,000 Kurdish civilians who were gassed to death. Western countries clearly have their "own" interests in the regional Kurdish conflict and often play a vital role in shaping events. But in the case of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, not even foreign assistance or grants have lifted the burden off Turkey. Ciller, while in Diyarbakir on Dec. 31, 1993 just before some 150,000 new troops were sent to the region, told journalists that there were a total of 160,000 military personnel and 40,000 village guards in the Southeast. Since then, many more villagers have been forced to take up weapons against the PKK, and the number of village guards, according to a REUTERS report on Wednesday, has reached 58,000. Now with these new troops deployed to the region, the cost of this decade-old "operation" is even higher. Special police crack teams, policemen, National Intelligence Agency (MIT) personnel and special squads have to be added to this cost in 1994. According to Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, Turkey has spent a total of TL [Turkish lira] 800 trillion on the Southeast campaign since 1984. HURRIYET newspaper columnist Nese Duzel recently wrote that Turkey was spending an annual $7 billion for the security campaign, the equivalent of DM 120 billion. In 10 years, this would make up a total of $70 billion disregarding increases in prices and the increase in the cost of the campaign. In 1993, the predicted inflation rate was at 53 percent but according to official figures was realized at 71 percent with the undeclared war making its impact on the overall economic situation of Turkey. The same year, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce put the inflation rate at 80 percent. Turkey's economic problem is great, but problems are even greater in the Southeast where the economy has come to an end. Now, with the government trying to tackle what Ciller has branded as "economic terrorism," the crisis is to deepen even further. By Thursday, it was evident that Ciller's bid to build a new structure on the one she herself ruined was not working out as planned. The wave of price hikes had increased public suffering throughout Turkey but appeared to be close to being worthless with the dollar rate soaring and reaching TL40,000 by Thursday morning compared to the TL23,000 on Monday. Even now, approximately $1.3 billion is being paid to village guards in the region while reports are that the secret budget allocated to Southeast officials is around TL6.6 trillion. Aside from these, the state is compensating and awarding security officials in the region. Policemen based there are receiving a monthly salary of TL20 million and senior soldiers are getting some TL19 million, around 10 million more than their colleagues based in other parts of the region. According to information with the Turkish Human Rights Association, there are 100 warplanes, 40 Cobra, 35 Sikorski and 230 classic helicopters in the region aside from hundreds of armored personnel carriers, trucks, jeeps and tanks. The approximate cost of one takeoff for a warplane is reportedly $4,000. Turkey's recent air raid on a PKK camp in northern Iraq some 500 kilometers away cost Ankara TL22.7 billion disregarding personnel costs. But even this amount was met with salary cuts from ordinary, compulsory soldiers who earn around $1 per month these days. Recently, the state issued 27,100 Kalashnikovs to villagers in Erzurum and Erzincan, in eastern Turkey. A total of 112,500 mines were planted on the Iraqi border and so on. The cost of the war is growing in a bizarre way each and every day. While the Turkish nation has paid for this war for 10 years, both with its martyrs and taxes, Kurdish citizens of the republic who live in the region have had to suffer the consequences in many ways. Says a recent issue of DENG magazine, believed to be affiliated with the moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party: "The Turkish state is cornered. It is not capable of meeting the economic bill of this warfare. Inflation and unemployment is spreading wildly. Investments have come to an end. Although the state is channelling all of its means to this unjust and dirty war, it is bound to be crushed by the economic burden of this war." On one hand, hundreds of innocent people have been killed. On the other, hundreds of Turkish soldiers have been martyred. Meanwhile, everyone is now "paying" for the policy currently underway. The people of the Southeast are to pay even more than the others in the days ahead. For they are to suffer both from the PKK's terrorism and the indiscriminate campaign said to be against terrorism. They are also going to suffer more under the new austerity package. Whichever way the Kurdish people turn, the locals of southeast Turkey face only one alternative: taking bitter medicine. The PKK is bitter medicine. The security clampdown is bitter medicine. And, economic austerity is bitter medicine. The people have been forced into becoming patients. But all prescribed treatments until now have been based on mistaken diagnosis. This problematic situation has already yielded its first result which some believe is even a greater threat for Turkey than the PKK. Islamic activism is on the rise in the region. Aside from the PKK, which is a "separatist" phenomenon against the establishment, there is now a Kurdish-Islamic outlet against the establishment. One which, in the past history of Turkey, has led to several severe Islamic Kurdish uprisings. The general feeling is that the Welfare Party will be skillfully exploiting the consequences of Ankara's so-called austerity package from now on and that it could gain more sympathy, not only among the Kurdish people, but also within the security apparatus in the region--claiming to be the only legitimate alternative to end the bloodshed. The impact of the new austerity package is bound to triple in the Southeast, where the pain is felt greater than in other parts of the country. Poverty is to be greater there. Unemployment is to soar. Businesses will go bankrupt. Villagers will be suffering and the anti-establishment trend will find optimum space to flourish more and more, with the touch of the green crescent. There, the burden is too great for everyone....
