FR940304-0-00076 FR940304-0-00019 Historically, Pritchardia affinis was found only on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains and along the western and southeastern coasts. Today, scattered individuals of the species can be found throughout much of the historically known coastal range at Kiholo, at Kukio, near Palani Road, on Alii Drive in Kailua, in Captain Cook, at Hookena, at Milolii, and at Punaluu. Most plants grow within areas of human habitation or development, and the trees may have been cultivated by Hawaiians or others rather than having occurred in these areas naturally. There are an estimated 50 to 65 known individuals at 8 or more localities which extend along about 110 mi (180 km) along the coast on privately and State-owned land (HHP 1991t1 to 1991t6; Norman Bezona, Hawaii Cooperative Extension Service, Brien Meilleur, Amy Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden, and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). This species typically grows in Coastal Mesic Forests at coastal sites or in gulches further inland at elevations between sea level and 2,000 ft (0 and 610 m), possibly associated with brackish water (HHP 1991t2, Read and Hodel 1990; C. Corn, pers. comm., 1992). Native associated species of this loulu are unknown, since all trees are found in cultivated zones, which have long been cleared of their native cover (B. Meilleur, pers. comm., 1992). The major threats to Pritchardia affinis are predation on seeds by roof rats, development of land where individuals grow, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing individuals. In the past, the species' natural habitat was cleared for agriculture and housing, and feral pigs destroyed seedlings of the species, preventing regeneration (Beccari and Rock 1921, Hull 1980; C. Corn, pers. comm., 1992). Gray (1854) mentioned an unnamed variety of Silene struthioloides , in reference to a specimen collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841. Sherff named this taxon S. struthioloides var. gracilis in 1946 and later elevated it to specific rank, resulting in S. hawaiiensis (1949). He chose the specific epithet to refer to the island where the plant is found. Silene hawaiiensis of the pink family (Caryophyllaceae), a sprawling shrub with slanting or climbing stems 6 to 16 in (15 to 40 cm) long originating from an enlarged root, is covered with short, often sticky hairs. The stalkless narrow leaves are 0.2 to 0.6 in (6 to 15 mm) long and 0.02 to 0.03 in (0.5 to 0.8 mm) wide. Flowers are arranged in elongate clusters. Each flower has a stalk 0.1 to 0.2 in (3 to 6 mm) long; a five-toothed purple or purple-tinged calyx 0.4 to 0.6 in (11 to 14 mm) long; and five petals, greenish white above and maroon below, with a stalk-like base and a flat, two-lobed, expanded portion about 0.2 in (4.5 to 5.5 mm) long. The fruit is a capsule about 0.3 in (6.5 to 8 mm) long which releases pale brown seeds 0.02 to 0.03 in (0.4 to 0.7 mm) long. This species differs from others of Silene in Hawaii by its growth habit; its covering of short, often sticky hairs; the shape of its leaves; the arrangement of its flower clusters; and the color of its petals (Wagner et al . 1990). Historically, Silene hawaiiensis was found only on the island of Hawaii from the western slope of Mauna Kea; the summit of Hualalai; Humuula Saddle; the northern, western, and northwestern slopes of Mauna Loa; and near Kilauea Crater. Today, over 50 populations are found in Hamakua District; on Humuula Saddle; at PTA, including inside MPRC; north of Puu Keanui; and in HVNP on privately, State-, and federally owned land. These populations extend over a distance of approximately 12 by 7 mi (19 by 11 km) and contain over 3,000 individuals (HHP 1991u1 to 1991u10, HPCC 1991j; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992, R. Shaw, in litt ., 1993). This species typically grows in Montane or Subalpine Dry Shrublands in decomposed lava and ash, but can be found on all ages of lava and cinder substrates, at elevations between 3,000 and 4,300 ft (900 and 1,300 m) and sometimes up to 8,500 ft (2,575 m) (Wagner et al . 1990; R. Shaw, in litt ., 1993). Associated species include Dodonaea viscosa ('a'ali'i), Styphelia tameiameiae (pukiawe), and Vaccinium reticulatum ('ohelo) (HHP 1991u6, HPCC 1991j; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Many populations of Silene hawaiiensis are threatened by competition with alien plant species, particularly fountain grass; grazing, browsing, and trampling by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; fire; and volcanic activity (HPCC 1991j). While the existing populations of Silene hawaiiensis are not in immediate danger of extinction, if these threats are not curtailed, the species will become endangered in the future. Gray (1861a) named a plant collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841 Vittadenia arenaria . Hillebrand (1888) transferred the species to the genus Tetramolopium and named a second variety, var. dentatum . In the current treatment of the genus (Lowrey 1986, 1990), two subspecies, ssp. arenarium and ssp. laxum , are recognized. Variety confertum , described by Sherff in 1934, is recognized (Lowrey 1986, 1990) as a variety of ssp. arenarium . Because of a recently recognized typification problem, ssp. laxum actually should be referred to as ssp. arenarium , leaving what was called ssp. arenarium without a published name (Laven et al . 1991). Tetramolopium arenarium of the aster family (Asteraceae), an erect tufted shrub 2.6 to 4.3 ft (0.8 to 1.3 m) tall, is covered with tiny glands and straight hairs. The alternate, toothless or shallowly toothed leaves are more or less lance-shaped, 0.6 to 1.5 in (15 to 37 mm) long, and 0.1 to 0.4 in (3 to 9 mm) wide. Five to 11 heads (dense flower clusters) are grouped at the end of each stem. Each head comprises a bell-shaped structure of 20 to 34 bracts 0.1 to 0.2 in (2.5 to 5 mm) high and 0.2 to 0.4 in (4 to 9 mm) in diameter beneath the flowers; a single series of 22 to 45 white, male ray florets 0.05 to 0.09 in (1.3 to 2.2 mm) long; and 4 to 9 bisexual disk florets with maroon petals 0.12 to 0.17 in (3.1 to 4.4 mm) long. Fruits are compressed achenes 0.06 to 0.1 in (1.5 to 3 mm) long and 0.02 to 0.03 in (0.5 to 0.8 mm) wide. This species is distinguished from others of the genus by its erect habit; the presence and types of glands and hairs on the plant; the fewer heads per flower cluster; the larger, male ray florets; the fewer, bisexual, maroon-petalled disk florets; and the wider achenes (Lowrey 1990).
