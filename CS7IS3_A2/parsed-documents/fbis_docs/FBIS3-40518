The amount of debris is increasing each year and is becoming a threat to space shuttles and satellites that are flying around the earth. In addition to numerous reports of dents and scratches found on the windows of shuttles, there is even a report of a near miss between a shuttle and a huge piece of debris. In light of the fact that the space station is expected to stay in orbit for 30 years and that there will be four-eight people living in it all the time, protecting the space station from meteorites and debris is an extremely serious matter. The debris in the space station's orbit, which is about 400 km above the earth, is moving at a speed of about 7.7 km/sec, and the relative speed toward the space station can be as high as 15.4 km/sec. The debris, classified by size, is as shown in Table 1. Pieces larger than 10 cm have been identified by radar observation, and the orbit of each of them has been calculated, so that the space station's orbit is changed to avoid the collision if the space station is expected to come in contact with one of them. The debris of the size range of 1-10 cm is a big problem for the space station program, and no effective means of protection has been found yet against them; our plan is to avoid potential collisions with them through an intensified observation network. A bumper will be placed around the experimental module and important equipment to soften the impacts of the debris smaller than 1 cm. The ultrahigh-speed impact test equipment being discussed here is designed to evaluate the protection capability of such a bumper and pressure bulkhead. This equipment was manufactured as a part of the basic experiments associated with the development of the JEM pressurized module and is installed at the Sagamihara Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; the preliminary test to collect the basic data with helium gas has been completed. At the moment, it is undergoing a modification to make it suitable for the tests using hydrogen gas, which has a faster expansion rate than helium. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Operating principle of ultrahigh-speed collision test equipment Fig. 1 shows the schematic drawing of the ultrahigh-speed collision test equipment. The phenomena that occur between the ignition of the explosive and the impact on the specimen are as follows: (1) ignition of the explosive in the combustion chamber; (2) breaking of the diaphragm by the combustion gas; (3) acceleration of the piston as a result of the pressure of the combustion gas; (4) compression of the light gas by the piston; (5) breakage of the diaphragm by the high- pressure gas; (6) acceleration of the projectile by the high- pressure gas; (7) separation of the sabot from the debris as a result of gas resistance; (8) measurement of the debris speed by a laser oscillator; (9) impact on the specimen. The sabot is a case that holds the debris; the use of the sabot and the debris as separate pieces enables one to test debris of various sizes and shapes. A good amount of experience is required to achieve a successful separation between the sabot and the debris. 2. Main specifications of ultrahigh-speed collision test equipment The specifications of the equipment using hydrogen gas are as follows: Total lengthapprox. 22 m Max. speed8 km/sec (target) Max. debris diameter8mm Max. debris mass0.5 g Equipped with sabot separator 3. Test results up until now Fig. 2 below shows the typical test example. Fig. 2 The picture shows the bumper at the left and the pressure bulkhead at the center. The debris went through the bumper and the pressure bulkhead as well, leaving a hole approximately 7 cm in diameter. The test conditions were as follows: Debris collision speed4.87 km/sec Debris mass1.73 g (AI) Distance between bumper and bulkhead10 cm 4. Future test plan Since the design of the bumper surrounding the pressure bulkhead has not been finalized yet and it is urgent that the structural design of the pressurized unit itself be finalized, the evaluation test of the pressure bulkhead will be conducted first; the evaluation test of the bumper will be conducted next. In the meanwhile, we also plan to accumulate data in coordination with NASA and ESA.
