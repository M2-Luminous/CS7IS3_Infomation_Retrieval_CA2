During the Friday [25 February] press conference in Gdansk Television, Lech Walesa was arguing that he is a supporter of passing the constitution quickly. He gave assurances that he is still "a man of balance." "Because, really, something must be agreed on," he said when asked about the constitution. If the constitution is "so deformed" that it will not allow the president to be the prime minister of the government, Lech Walesa declares that "many people," including himself, will not agree to that. He argued that he does not want great power, but the possibility of making quick decisions. According to Walesa, there is a possibility of building a coalition with the right-wing groupings. For the time being, Walesa is waiting "for someone to do this." He explains that he still wants to remain apolitical. If rightist leaders do not build such a coalition, he will organize it himself. He will then cease to be an apolitical president. He will take to "building a block which will allow us to do what should be done." Such a bloc will also help "win the next term of office," but it is a secondary task. I am wondering whether such a romantic road that I am going on makes any sense in Poland at all, said Walesa. Perhaps the president should be linked to political configurations, have money, participate in making decisions concerning the granting of licenses, he wondered. File-checking and decommunization must be carried out. Walesa does not say how this should be done. This should be discussed. "It cannot be that the decisions made by the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] are irrevocable. There are loopholes in the laws; if it should be necessary, some decisions of the council will have to be changed," stated Lech Walesa during the 25 February press conference. In Gdansk the president once again complained about the work of KRRiT. He is wondering whether or not to recall its chairman before long. Walesa believes that if "a few facts concerning the work of the council and the distribution of licenses" are revealed, the report of the council will be rejected by the Sejm. He did not rule out the possibility that the granting of licenses may be invalidated. Discussing personnel issues, he said that he is convinced that if he has to build a pro-presidential bloc, "many of his closest aides will have to leave the Presidential Office." The president does not intend to cause a conflict by refusing to sign the appointment of a new finance minister. "If the prime minister approves of that person, I will sign the appointment because I support the prime minister," stated Walesa. According to the president, "Solidarity" and the people are right when they participate in demonstrations on the streets, because "it was supposed to be no longer that way." The president will persistently recall the pre-election declarations of the present government coalition so that "during the next elections the people will make the right choices." * * * Is Drzycimski Leaving? Unofficial sources maintain that we can soon expect the recall of President Walesa's Press Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. Asked about this by RZECZPOSPOLITA, Drzycimski answered that he neither confirms nor denies this. He added that "frequently the interested parties themselves are the last ones to hear decisions." --by PAD
