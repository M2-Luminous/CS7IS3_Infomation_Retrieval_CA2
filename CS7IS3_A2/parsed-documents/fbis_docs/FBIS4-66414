Unlike the Chu group's approach of using super high pressure, this is research applying super high pressure to superconductor fabrication. It should be called research to discover new high-temperature superconductors, not just fabrication of new high-temperature superconductors. The two research projects are from the group of Professor Mikio Takano of Kyoto University's Chemical Research Institute, inorganic materials chemical research sector III (solid state chemistry), and the group of Professor Jun Akimitsu of Aoyama Gakuin University's Department of Science and Engineering, Physics curriculum. Although the two come from different disciplines (chemistry and physics), they are both attacking the problem of finding high-temperature superconductors with super high pressure. Super High Pressure Realizes the Dream of Infinitely Layered Material The Takano group achieved two very interesting results in 1992 and 1993, which are drawing a great deal of attention. In 1992, this group succeeded in fabricating an infinitely layered Sr(Ca)CuO[.sub]2[/] with only alkaline earth varieties and copper. In 1993, the group fabricated SrCuO. Neither are substances with exceptionally high critical temperature (Tc), but exceptionally high Tc was possible with super high pressure. Before explaining about infinitely layered materials, we should touch upon the relationship of Tc and the crystalline structure of materials in high temperature superconductors. Superconductors discovered thus far have been copper oxides. For these materials to become superconductive, the existence of CuO[.sub]2[/] planes is essential. It was after 1988 that it came to be realized, albeit slowly, that the number of CuO[.sub]2[/] planes in crystal structure might be related to Tc rise. As the planes increased one by one, Tc rose. So the question was asked, what would happen if the number of CuO[.sub]2[/] planes was increased, or if CuO[.sub]2[/] planes were layered in unlimited number? Many groups took up the challenge, but did not succeed. The solution was the Takano group's super high pressure fabrication method. The high temperature superconductor fabricated by applying 60,000 atmospheres was an infinite-layer material of only alkaline varieties and copper with extremely simple structure, but a Tc of 110 K was achieved in the group's experiments. The 1993 research built on those results, and produced a compound with a simple structure of only SrCuO. This substance does not become superconductive if fabricated under normal pressure, but if fabricated in an environment of 60,000 atmospheres, it becomes a high temperature superconductor. Figure 1 shows the structure with normal pressure fabrication and with high pressure fabrication. The CuO[.sub]2[/] planes, which play a critical role in superconductivity, show up remarkably in the case of high pressure fabrication. It is thought that the infinite-layer material discovered by the Takano group in 1992 is in the same family as this material. <graphic> </graphic> Mr. Takano characterizes his research position thusly: "In some ways, we are isolated from information here, unlike in Tokyo, but this gives us the resolve to do independent research." High temperature superconductivity was discovered at the end of 1986, when Mr. Takano was doing research on perovskite oxides, and he was researching super high pressure as part of that. He was shocked when the high temperature superconductor appeared because his perovskite research was focused mainly on iron, not copper. The sudden appearance of high temperature superconductivity was too alluring. "One chemist handles only a few compounds in his research life. Of these, no substance could be more interesting than this," thought Takano, and resolved to take on high temperature superconductivity. However, he thought that "With only three of us in the group, we will have to use methods that no others are trying if we are going to achieve remarkable results," and he decided to put his experience with "pressure" to use as the starting point of his attack on superconductivity. However, a co-researcher transferred out of a university that had super high pressure equipment, and the group lost access to such equipment. Therefore, they made arrangements with Kobe Steel, which was using the equipment to manufacture diamonds, and began the pursuit of creating superconductive material with high pressure. Because they used the high pressure equipment only when it was not being used for diamond production, it took a month between the time that they sent sample powder to Kobe Steel and got back the material fabricated under high pressure. Despite this, Takano's group achieved the above-mentioned result of infinite layers. As time passed, Kobe Steel's equipment was increasingly dedicated to its primary task of diamond production, until finally, there was no time to fit in Takano's research. At the end of 1992, the group's own equipment worth ¥30 million was installed in the chemical research laboratory. The 10-ton equipment has been installed in a brick building that was an ammunition storehouse for the former imperial army. The core of this huge equipment is barely the size of a thumb. As shown in Figure 2, superconductors are fabricated in a gold capsule 3mm in diameter and 3mm in length. <graphic> </graphic> Only 50 mg can be produced at a time. This is adequate for samples, but the expense -- ¥4,000-¥5,000 -- is a problem. Furthermore, it takes four hours to make one sample, so a whole day's work produces only four samples. The research is costly in time and money. On top of that, since the use of super high pressure for superconductor fabrication has just started, "Everything is based on intuition." What should the group's goals be? "To be honest, you cannot get away from the CuO[.sub]2[/] plane. We would like to overcome that somehow." It appears that, after all, the group's goal is to find a non-copper-base high temperature superconductor made of something else besides copper oxide. Material Search Wizard Mr. Akimitsu's goal also is to find a non-copper-base high temperature superconductor. The Akimitsu group is large -- 10 members. Even when we visited his lab, we saw students napping between the equipment, and instruments were going non-stop. Although many superconductivity labs tend to lose vitality, this one was overflowing with enthusiasm. Mr. Akimitsu's quest for superconductors is well-recognized and he has discovered more new superconductors than one can count on two hands. While any researcher would feel blessed to discover one new superconductor in a lifetime, the Akimitsu group has produced one high temperature superconductor after another. He truly is a wizard in finding materials. The materials include a neodymium-base material discovered in 1988. This is a very well-known crude type superconductor that subsequently was developed into an electron doping type superconductor by a Tokyo University group. More recently, there is the CO[.sub]3[/] base family of materials. This is a large family of over 10 in all, including a group called C1212-base materials that are fabricated under super high pressure. This group is seen to be the most promising in the CO[.sub]3[/]-base family. Joint research is being conducted on the C1212 group with Professor Nobuo Mori of Tokyo University's Institute for Solid State Physics, which has super high pressure equipment. Interesting data already seems to have been produced, and an announcement by Mr. Akimitsu is probably not far off. <graphic> </graphic> Why is Mr. Akimitsu, a physicist, searching for materials? "The creation of a new material means the birth of a new law of physics. As a physics specialist, that is my goal." Even Mr. Akimitsu says that the appearance of copper oxide superconductors was a shock, but his wealth of research experience has helped greatly in his subsequent quest. At one time, Mr. Akimitsu said, with regard to the quest for high temperature superconductors, that they were "substances created by God." Recently, however, he says that predictions can be made on copper oxide-base materials to some extent. The quest for copper oxide-base superconductors has entered the mature stage, although, to be sure, 10 times the number of announced successes have been fabricated and then discarded. "The quest for materials is a contest of ideas, but ideas are not enough. A new material is found only when ideas are multiplied by luck and tenacity." That is the way Mr. Akimitsu lightly dismissed the art of the material quest, but there is no doubt that some very awesome effort lies behind it. "For every new material, there is a new law of physics." This philosophy is what directs his students toward the difficult task of material hunting and their research achievements are the energy that drive the hunt. Mr. Akimitsu also is turning in the ambitious direction of the quest for non-copper base superconductors. "I think that discovering whether superconductivity is possible without copper will be the big game. We have to work hard to win it." There is great interest in what short of material will emerge, but when asked if he has any ideas, Mr. Akimitsu says, "No comment." Today, when Japanese superconductivity research has waned, the way to rejuvenate it is fabrication of non-copper-base superconductors. This will be a liberation from the strong fetters of copper oxides as well, and it will be when Mr. Akimitsu's goal, the birth of a new law of physics, will be realized.
