Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama on Tuesday [29 March] on a charge of bribing a former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator to seek his influence in pressuring the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] over a bid-rigging case involving Kajima. The indictment said Kiyoyama handed over a 10 million yen bribe to former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on January 13, 1992, asking him to pressure then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation against a now-disbanded, 66-company "bid-rigging consultation" group in Saitama Prefecture, of which Kajima was a key member. Nakamura, 44, was an acting chairman of the LDP's lobby of legislators concerning the Antimonopoly Law at the time he allegedly complied with Kiyoyama's request, it said. Kiyoyama, 68, is currently standing trial on a separate charge of bribing Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, to secure his political influence in pressuring the local government to award a public works project to Kajima. Kiyoyama's indictment over the FTC affair followed a decision earlier in the day by the nation's top prosecutors to indict both Nakamura and Kiyoyama on bribery charges, investigative sources said. However, the prosecutors decided to defer Nakamura's indictment until Friday, when his court-authorized 20-day detention runs out, the sources said. [passage omitted]
