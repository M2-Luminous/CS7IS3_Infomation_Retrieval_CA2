At Rinas airport, Berisha was seen off by Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, deputies, representatives of political parties, etc. On his way to Romania, President Berisha stopped over in Budapest. For more, let us listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Shpetim Roqi: [Roqi] President Berisha arrived at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport at 1400. From there the delegation headed toward the governmental residence in Andrassy. Hungarian President Arpad Goncz welcomed Berisha there, and invited him for lunch. During the luncheon, they discussed possibilities for further development between our two countries, countries that are related not only through a past history, but that should be related by a future history as well. President Berisha made an expose of the democratic reform in Albania and considered Albania to be a country that accepted the shock reform as a painful, but the only, reform to revive the country. Hungarian President Arpad Goncz said that he was informed about the reform and was amazed by the achievements of this reform, which really surprises one when thinks about what unfavorable geo- political circumstances Albania is in at present. He wanted to know about the problems that worry Albania today, such as relations with southern neighbors, the problem of Kosova, and the Albanian question in general. President Berisha considered Hungary to be an example for the peaceful way of passing into a new system. We will report more later.
