Colonel Kelly Conteh was appointed chief of the general staff in April on his emergence from a Ghanaian military college, with the job of shaking up the Armed Forces. "What I have discovered after taking office is that the Army's inability to win civilian support is due to its negative actions, including harassment, seizure of civilian properties and arbitrating in civil matters," Konteh said in an interview in this diamond centre 250 kiLometres (150 miles) east of Freetown. As a result, "we know of instances where civilians have openly collaborated with rebel elements, giving them food and (allowing) them to mine diamonds for their own benefit," he said. "We are also studying claims of people giving information of strategic locations to the rebels." Following his appointment, Conteh appealed for new recruits to the Armed Forces to help restore peace in the country, but he said that much of the current trouble stemmed from people being taken on without proper checks of their records. "We shall weed out the undesirables," he said, vowing that he would not compromise in whipping the army into shape. "I want to head an Army that has an unblemished record and keep on the side of protecting the nation," Conteh said. He claimed that the civil war between the military-led government and the United Revolutionary Front was all but over, despite continued reports of violent attacks by the rebels. "I cannot give a time frame but I doubt whether we would be talking about the war in six months' time," he said. But in the displaced persons' camp at Goindama, 120 kilometres southwest of Koidu, the largest in the country, the 200,000 inmates no longer believe in such assurances. Humanitarian aid workers said that more than half of them were in their third period at Goindama. Twice before, they had left to go home at the invitation of the government, only to be forced to return by rebel action. "We are fed up with coming and going," a former teacher complained.
