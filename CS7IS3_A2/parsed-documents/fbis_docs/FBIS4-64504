In official circles clear signs are beginning to emerge that preparations are under way for the head of government's resignation, despite his refusal to leave office. [Deputy Prime Minister] Narcis Serra is tipped as the most likely candidate to succeed Gonzalez, although there also is talk of a certain autonomous region president. Apart from the current deputy prime minister, rumors in Socialist circles maintain that the current president of the Valencia Generalidad also aspires to lead the government if Gonzalez steps down. Gonzalez insists on continuing to lead the executive, despite all the scandals, but murmurs from within his own party suggesting he resign are gathering force. Guerristas [followers of Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) Deputy Secretary Alfonso Guerra] like La Coruna Mayor Francisco Vazques have begun to speculate that only resignations can defuse the present situation and that the resignation of the PSOE secretary general cannot be ruled out because the institutions and his own party are above him. The government crisis could cost Felipe Gonzalez his job if [Convergence and Union (CiU) leader] Jordi Pujol carries out the threat he made yesterday when he warned that his 17 deputies could withdraw their support from the Socialist leader if he does not clean up his cabinet and his party. The executive has decided to postpone the appearance of [outgoing Interior Minister] Antonio [as published] Asuncion before parliament until Tuesday, and the possibility that Gonzalez himself will face the Chamber of Deputies, as the People's Party has demanded, depends on how far the CiU supports the initiative, since the IU [United Left] has already demanded the same thing. The CiU has called for the resignation from their current posts of former Interior Ministers Jose Barrionuevo and Jose Luis Corcuera, and of Socialist floor leader Carlos Solchaga, as well as a sweeping government reshuffle, all essential preconditions if it is to continue to support the executive. Jose Duran Lleida, chairman of the CiU's government committee, announced this decision on behalf of the Nationalist coalition, which supports the PSOE-led government. He stressed that, if these measures are not implemented immediately, it will be Felipe Gonzalez himself who has to resign. Although he was speaking in his own party's name, the speech had received the approval of Generalidad President Jordi Pujol only moments earlier. Duran Lleida confirmed that the CiU no longer has "any commitment" toward the government, since the governability to which the Catalan Nationalists aspired to contribute has been destroyed by the PSOE itself, the party solely responsible for the present state of affairs. He repeated that the CiU has no desire for early elections, but he warned that the instability it has sought to avoid with fresh elections was already a reality right now, so that all paths are open as we wait to see whether Felipe Gonzalez can show that he is able to bring the situation back under control. In that sense, he said, if Gonzalez does not firmly establish political responsibility for the Roldan and Rubio cases within 15 days, he himself will have to resign. [passage omitted] The government yesterday decided to postpone for 24 hours Asuncion's planned appearance before parliament's Internal Affairs Commission. He was originally summoned to appear today, to explain Roldan's flight and the reasons behind his resignation. Although opposition circles suspect that this is simply a move to gain time, as the security forces are thought to have come up with some clues as to the fugitive's whereabouts, government circles blame the People's Party for the postponement. Assistant People's Party spokesman Loyola de Palacio denied that his party was obstructing Asuncion's appearance before the committee and insisted that Felipe Gonzalez appear before the Chamber of Deputies to explain the situation.
