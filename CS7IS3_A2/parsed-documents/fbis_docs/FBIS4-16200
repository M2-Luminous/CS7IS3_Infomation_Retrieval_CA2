As many as 517 people, afflicted by radiation, were found in 58 Russian cities, including Novgorod, Izhevsk, Elista, Kurgan, Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Khabarovsk. But the Chernobyl zone of contamination remains most threatening. It embraces 17 regions of Russia with a total population of more than two millions. Some children were found to be suffering form cancer of the thyroid gland in those areas. In normal conditions there are only a few cases of this ailment per million of children. Today, the incidence of this terrible disease has increased more than 20-fold in Gomel and Bryansk regions. Specialists forecast a sharp growth of this disease in Kaluga, Tula, and Oryol regions. But Chernobyl is not the only danger zone in Russia. The second vast area of contamination is the southern part of the Urals. Several accidents there have contaminated with strontium-90 radionuclides an area of 2,000 square kilometres, inhabited by 300,000 people. 125,000 more people were irradiated by discharges of radioactive wastes into local rivers. The third territory is in the southern part of Siberia, contaminated by the fallout of nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk testing ground, where 467 nuclear devices were touched off in the course of fourteen years. Loyal to their "internationalist duty", Soviet servicemen carried out nuclear bomb tests only on days when the wind was blowing from China towards Altay territory, Kemerovo, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk regions. The population of those areas is now consuming contaminated meat and milk. Due to the deteriorating economic situation, people are beginning to fish and hunt intensively in contaminated woods. They are also consuming wild mushrooms and berries, picked in contaminated forests and meadows. New methods of measuring the "average doses" of irradiation were developed during the period that has elapsed since the Chernobyl disaster. Measuring "average" doses in populated localities is the same as measuring the "average temperature" of patients in a hospital ward. Even in populated localities, where the "average dose" is normal, there will always be people with large doses of irradiation, making up the principal risk group. Millions of people have suffered through the fault of the state. This is why the state must fulfil its commitment to lower to the maximum the consequences of contamination. But the Finance Ministry is now planning to sharply reduce or stop the allocation of funds for the Chernobyl programme. This will accelerate the already looming extinction of the nation's gene pool.
