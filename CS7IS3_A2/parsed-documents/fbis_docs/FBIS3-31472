Ibrahim Rugova, the democratically elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, was among the guests at the recent prayer breakfast held by Bill Clinton. Ibrahim Rugova gave an interview to our Washington correspondent. [Rugova] I had the opportunity to talk to President Clinton and Vice President Gore about the Kosovo issue. The U.S. position is clear: If the Serbs commit or provoke some atrocity in Kosovo, the United States will defend us. They already said that clearly one year ago. According to the United States, an explosion in Kosovo would inflame the entire region. They appreciate highly the fact that we, the Kosovo Albanians, want to achieve our goals in a peaceful way, free of violence. [Fuzes] Is it possible to achieve your goal, the secession of Kosovo from Serbia, without force? [Rugova] Yes, if Kosovo is demilitarized and comes under international protection. In that case, a normal and democratic dialogue can start. I have been proposing this for quite some time but, naturally, I am aware that the implementation of this desire depends on the future of this entire stormy region. As for ourselves, we would like, first of all, a free, independent, and neutral Kosovo, one open to both Albania and Serbia. This is also a compromise from our side because, for the time being and because of Serb sensitivity, we abandon the unification of the Albanian nation. I am a realist and I know that all this also depends on a variety of major-power interests, and the decision will be made at a future international conference. [Fuzes] At least one quarter of Macedonia's population are Albanians. What is their situation like? [Rugova] Their situation is made more difficult by legal and constitutional problems. I would like to see to it that these problems are solved and the Albanians living there can systematically participate in the normal development of democratic Macedonia. [Fuzes] Regarding Serbia, there is naturally a big difference between the situation of Kosovo Albanians and the situation of Vojvodina Hungarians. Nevertheless, is there any cooperation between the Albanian Democratic League of Kosova and the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians? [Rugova] Unfortunately, the Hungarians in Vojvodina are also subjected to great pressure and, in many respects, they have to bear similar burdens. It is our principled position that the Hungarians in Vojvodina also have a right to some kind of autonomy, namely a type of autonomy they would justifiably desire. We agree on this but, under the current circumstances, we can have little genuine contact and, unfortunately, we can hardly help each other. [Fuzes] The most timely question: Has any political solution been left at all to solve the Bosnian issue? [Rugova] No matter how difficult it is now to envisage a political settlement of the problem, one must try because there is no other way. If Europe and the United States are unable to put an end to this war, it will inflame Southern-Eastern Europe and later, perhaps the entire continent. [Fuzes] Only a historic rapprochement with the Serbs can bring a long-term calm. Are the Kosovo Albanians ready for this? [Rugova] If anyone, we are really aware of the importance of a rapprochement between the two nations. We are also aware of the fact that we must work hard for this. The issue at hand is that the Serbs should now become reconciled with all their neighbors, and this requires a change in the regime in Belgrade. Moreover, this would not even be enough. Unfortunately, the Serbs have become infected by the aggressive nationalist mythology that measures the greatness of a nation in terms of acquired and "ethnically clean" territories. It will take a long time for the Serbs to rid themselves of this sickness and become disappointed with their extremist chauvinistic leaders.
