Today Interfax received a statement of Khasbulatov. For instance, the statement said, "I am shocked by this tragedy and by the fact that armored vehicles and armored equipment were used in the center of a densely populated city." He said it was inadmissible to use such extreme methods even when confronted with criminals if this could lead to the death of innocent people. The armed clash took place last Sunday and Monday. The opposition headquarters told Interfax that the governmental forces had surrounded the group led by Ruslan Labazanov and subjected the residential areas of the district to heavy fire. Such developments followed the order issued by Chechen Military Commander Sultan Geliskhanov on the disarmament of illegal military formations. The opposition said that from 180 to 300 people had been killed during these events, most of them civilians. The official authorities said there were no more than ten people had been killed and no more than sixty wounded. The opposition headquarters told Interfax that Labazanov and 200 of his supporters had fled. Labazanov said he would enact what he called a bloody revenge on Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Military Commander Geliskhanov and on their relatives for the innocent people killed during these events.
