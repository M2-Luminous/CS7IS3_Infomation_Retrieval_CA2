This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts, racing a closed course race on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. A special local regulation which would restrict vessel traffic in the area is necessary to ensure the safety of life, limb and property on portions of the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel during this event. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060. The comments will be available for inspection and copying at the Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, Room 2083, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. Normal office hours are between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. (EDT), Monday through Friday, except holidays. Comments may also be hand delivered to this address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William A. Thibodeau, Marine Science Technician Second Class, U.S. Coast Guard, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch, Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3990. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, data or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (CGD 09&hyph;94&hyph;10) and the specific section of the proposal to which their comments apply, and give reasons for each comment. Receipt of comments will be acknowledged if a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope is enclosed. The rules may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received before the expiration of the comment period will be considered before final action is taken on this proposal. A 45 day comment period is used instead of the preferred 60 day period to unable the Coast Guard to publish a Final Rule within 30 days of the event date. It has been determined that a 45 day comment period is sufficient to allow interested persons to submit comments on this event. No public hearing is planned, but one may be held if written requests for a hearing are received and it is determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process. Drafting Information The drafter of this Notice of proposed rulemaking is Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch. Discussion of proposed regulations The Thunder on the Water will be conducted on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, between the South Grand Island Bridge and Tonawanda Island, on August 27, and 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts racing in a closed race course, oval in shape, approximately 0.5 nautical miles long, 0.25 nautical miles wide, running northeast/southwest in the Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. In order to provide for the safety of life, limb and property, the Coast Guard is considering a proposal to regulate vessel traffic within this section of the Niagara River, Tonawada Channel. Commercial vessels desiring to transit the regulated area shall provide prior notification to the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Buffalo, NY). This proposed regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 100. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
