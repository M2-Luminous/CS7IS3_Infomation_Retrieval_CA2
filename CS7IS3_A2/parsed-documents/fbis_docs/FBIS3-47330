FBIS3-47330 "dreas008__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Japan MAFF To Give Technical Aid to Rice Exporters OW1201113094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1201113094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] has decided to provide rice-exporting countries, including Thailand and China, with technological assistance in the fields of rice production and distribution. This is in response to the government's decision to partially open the rice market. The action is being taken because, if Japan fails to procure rice from exporting countries in line with its plan, it will affect its supply and demand policy. To promote stable rice shipments, MAFF plans to provide technological aid to rice exporters in such fields as planting rice intended for exports, controlling rice fields by the harvesting season, and storing harvested rice. Moreover, in line with rice exporters' requests, MAFF plans to instruct them in the technology for producing rice that will suit the taste of the Japanese people. Following the agricultural agreement under GATT's multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan must accept rice imports of 4 percent (approximately 380,000 tons) of annual domestic consumption in fiscal 1995 in return for a six-year moratorium on rice import tariffication. Moreover, it must increase the rate of rice imports gradually to procure rice of 8 percent (approximately 760,000 tons) of domestic consumption from foreign countries in six years. MAFF has judged that, to help rice-exporting countries maintain stable production of rice intended for export to Japan, it is necessary to instruct them in rice-producing methods such as cultivation technology for planting rice, using agricultural chemicals, and rice field controlling technology for securing the steady growth of rice plants. Moreover, MAFF plans to support rice exporters with the technology for storage and transport control to prevent rice from declining in quality after being harvested so that the rice can pass Japan's strict quality test. MAFF's decision is based on its fear that because the amount of the world's annual rice trade is small, reaching more than 10 million yen, a possible drastic change in exporting countries' production may hinder Japan's rice procurement. Recently, mold or alien substances such as pebbles were found in Thai-grown rice imported by Japan as an emergency measure to counter last year's poor rice crop. When such cases are taken into consideration, it is necessary to review the system for controlling the process of distribution. China, Thailand, and other countries are expected to be listed as recipient countries for technological aid. MAFF will study a possibility of providing technological aid to rice-producing countries, including the SRV and Burma. It will decide on recipient countries and work out concrete details of the plan. MAFF intends to begin providing technological aid during fiscal 1994.
