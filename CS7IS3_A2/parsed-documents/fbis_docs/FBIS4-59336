[Al-Dali] Thank you. [Al-Buluk] Doctor, Yemen has accepted Arab mediation. We know that an Arab League delegation has left for Yemen, seeking to end this conflict which has pained all the Arabs. How much can this mediation influence the crisis? [Al-Dali] Doubtless the Arab League's mediation and the arrival of an Arab League delegation is joyful news to us. We formerly asked the Arab League and its secretary general, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid for their good offices to end the crisis. I believe that the arrival of an Arab League delegation is a favorable sign that the other side is willing to accept the League's mediation in this crushing ordeal and continuing attrition on our good land, Yemen. [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, when people heard that Yemen was rejecting Arab mediation, it created widespread frustration and raised questions about the Arab League's role. However, when the mediation was accepted, this provided proof of the League's strength and influential role. [Al-Dali] This is true. We of the YSP, including Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid, expressed a willingness to accept the Arab initiative right from the start. Regrettably the other side, the people in Sanaa, rejected this mediation and hoped to settle the issue militarily. It appears, however, that their military option has run into a dead end. We are now in the second week of fighting without any sign of their professed ability to settle the issue militarily. [Al-Buluk] We must remember it is a conflict among brothers. [Al-Dali] Yes, yes, but remember that we are actually fighting each other. It is impractical to deny this. We are two sides fighting each other. We accepted mediation and a cease-fire, not out of fear but to spare Yemeni lives. The other side's subsequent agreement to receive an Arab League delegation is a good sign. We hope that the meeting between the Arab League delegation and the officials in Sanaa will achieve good results. [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, some countries are being accused of being behind what is happening in Yemen. It is said that these countries are fanning the fire of the civil war. [Al-Dali] Our actions are not in a vacuum, nor are they based on false accusations. What actually happened is that among the captured crew members of downed military aircraft belonging to the north and the prisoners taken in Abyan we found nationals of other Arab countries. One of these prisoners is an officer from another Arab country. [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz, 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP have urged dialogue as a way to end the crisis. In your opinion, how can a dialogue be carried out now that war has erupted? [Al-Dali] War does not preclude the principle of dialogue. On the contrary, you begin a dialogue to end a war. For this reason, despite the bitterness we feel, the bloodshed, and the arrogant intransigence of the brothers in Sanaa, we are willing to have a dialogue. Actually we fought each other in 1972 and 1979 but the current war is more ferocious. [Al-Buluk] Especially as Yemen has been united since 1990. [Al-Dali] Yes, this war is fiercer and bloodier. Nevertheless we are ready to sit down and negotiate. [Al-Buluk] Do you think that the dialogue could take place in an Arab land other than Yemen? [Al-Dali] I believe that this could happen. Under the current circumstances, it is impossible to meet on Yemeni soil. But it could be possible to meet in Yemen when circumstances change. [Al-Buluk] What is the current situation in Yemen now that the war has destroyed almost everything? Can you comment on the ongoing events? [Al-Dali] It's a tragedy, a big tragedy. It's a big tragedy that will have a grave impact on the next generation. Instead of presenting a united modern Yemen, a Yemen of law and order, a Yemen of stability and democracy to our next generation, we are passing on a Yemen ruled by terrorism, governed by the idea of settling matters through military means, governed by bloodshed and killing, and governed by a desire to annihilate the other side. This is very regrettable. [Al-Buluk] No doubt you know that President Husni Mubarak made several appeals to the brothers to cease fighting. How do you view the Egyptian mediation in the Yemeni crisis? [Al-Dali] The Egyptian mediation, particularly the mediation of His Excellency President Husni Mubarak, has had a positive effect and has been welcomed by every Yemeni. We rely heavily on the Egyptian role and the mediation of His Excellency President Husni Mubarak. We wish this mediation success. We and the YSP will give every possible support to this mediation and the Egyptian role. [A-Buluk] There is a question asked by every Egyptian citizen and every Arab citizen: Why did this happen in Yemen? [Al-Dali] Simply and generally speaking because the old power structure wants to maintain its position and old regime and does not want to give a chance to the new generation. The brothers in Sanaa refused to implement the first article in the Pledge and Accord Document, which calls for the arrest of those involved in the assassination of YSP leaders. This led to the failure of implementing the document. [Al-Buluk interrupting] This document was signed in Jordan in February 1994. [Al-Dali] Yes. The brothers in Sanaa regrettably miscalculated by liquidating the South Yemeni brigades. It is regrettable to talk about a southern army and a northern army. But in fact the two armies did not unite. They started to liquidate the [southern] brigades that were deployed in the north with the aim of weakening the army of the south so that it could be easily liquidated in an advance toward Aden. It is the same idea and (?impotent) mentality [words indistinct]. [Al-Buluk] Don't you think that the four years that preceded unity were enough to resolve the differences? [Al-Dali] We tried the impossible in order to end the problems. [Al-Buluk] We are broadcasting this dialogue and this is your personal viewpoint. We hope that the war in fraternal Yemen will end and that Yemen will again be as happy as it was. [Al-Dali] This is not my personal viewpoint. Rather it is the YSP viewpoint.
