ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, at the request of Mel-Mike Enterprises, Inc., substitutes Channel 237C1 for Channel 237C2 at Central, Mew Mexico, and modifies the license of Station KNUW to specify operation on the higher class channel. See 58 FR 5322, January 21, 1993. Channel 237C1 can be allotted to Central in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 18.6 kilometers (11.6 miles) northwest, at coordinates North Latitude 32&hyph;52&hyph;15 and West Longitude 108&hyph;18&hyph;57, to accommodate petitioner's desired transmitter site and avoid short-spacings to Stations KKRK, Channel 237A, Douglas, Arizona, and KLAQ, Channel 238C, El Paso, Texas. Mexican concurrence has been received since Central is located within 320 kilometers (199 miles) of the U.S.-Mexican border. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.
