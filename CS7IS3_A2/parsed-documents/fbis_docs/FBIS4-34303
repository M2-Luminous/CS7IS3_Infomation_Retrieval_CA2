The chiefs of state reaffirmed the intent and need for a regional integration system, and the importance this system has for the area's countries, and to which Chile's desire to become a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] must be added. Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle firmly pointed out the common projects the country has with Argentina and the fact that they have a solid footing, emphasizing the dredging of the Martin Garcia and Mitre channels. Lacalle explained the current stage in which the two countries now are permanently sharing the costs and maintenance of the common projects. He added that the [Paraguay- Parana Rivers] waterway, the road network, and the Colonia [Uruguay]-Buenos Aires bridge are projects that ratify the confidence and overall actions that go beyond governments, and he termed these initiatives a "positive vision of goodwill with an eye on regional integration." Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy termed the meeting a historic event, and he highlighted the fact that the Argentine and Uruguayan presidents are undertaking the dredging of Martin Garcia channel, which is something that marks the intention of uniting, of integrating the region's countries, and he pointed out Mercosur as a sign of the desire to integrate. Wasmosy indicated that his country cannot remain outside this effort because Paraguay needs a sea outlet with lower freight costs in order to become more competitive in international markets. He also referred to the importance of the waterway that will join the region's five countries. Argentine President Carlos Menem emphasized the integration process, indicating that these three brother countries are walking a common path that is leading them to regional integration. He referred to the River Plate Treaty and the Maritime Front signed 21 years ago by then-Presidents Juan Maria Bordaberry and General Juan Domingo Peron, pointing out that even at that time Peron spoke about regional integration, stressing that countries must be "united, not dominated." Menem said trade "is the soul of nations," indicating that the river projects are very important and help link countries. He announced that within a few days that Salto Grande [hydroelectric project on the Uruguay River] will be put into operation with Paraguay's Asilerta Dam [as published] and thus integrate it with the free trade zone as its central objective. Menem also indicated that the Chilean Government had submitted a note in which it indicates that it has the intention of joining Mercosur, in other words, expressing its concern regarding an expansion of the integration spectrum. Lacalle said that for Uruguay this treaty means the "definite opening of its river ports to international trade with an outlet to the Atlantic that has a depth of 32 feet." He added that the treaty also means that the ports of Nueva Palmira and Montevideo will be given a new life, and the same will apply to all the ports within the basins of the Paraguay, Parana, and Uruguay Rivers. Lacalle said: "This must be complemented with the importance of the waterway--3,000 km of rivers--that has a common legal statute that was ironed out by five nations and will allow the products of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, southern Brazil, and Uruguay to reach the Atlantic, and thus the world." The Uruguayan president believes it "is an undertaking that will be written into history as one of the most truly influential and real endeavors of our countries." Menem said the documents' signing means "the end of a process that began more than 20 years ago with the signing of the River Plate Treaty on 19 November 1973. This cycle began at that time and it concludes with the documents that were signed today that will make the Parana River, the Martin Garcia channel, and, of course, the River Plate navigable." Referring to reports about alleged threats received by Argentine Ambassador to Uruguay Alicia Martinez Rios, Menem said: "All of us involved in the world of politics receive threats. Moreover, he added that he had to acknowledge that Martinez Rios has a lot of courage and is very enterprising. And I also must acknowledge that in a large measure it is thanks to her and her always-positive attitude that this document has been signed." On leaving Taranco Palace, the three presidents chatted with the media. Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy gave his opinion on the ceremony that had just concluded. He said: "Both for Bolivia and Paraguay, in their role as landlocked countries, these documents that were signed today (yesterday) basically mean that we have an outlet to the Atlantic through two very important corridors." "I would like this project, which has concluded happily today, to be joined with another outlet to the Atlantic that is located just a little more to the north: the port of Pederneira [Brazil] "so the Southern Cone countries will really become integrated when the Itaipu Dam is completed and inter-river navigation begins."
