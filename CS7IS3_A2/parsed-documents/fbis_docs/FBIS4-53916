FBIS4-53916 "dreas100__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-100-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Former Premier Nakasone Assesses Politics Former Premier Nakasone Assesses Politics OW2005123094 Tokyo CHUO KORON in Japanese May 94 pp 64-78--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005123094 Tokyo CHUO KORON Japanese BFN [Interview with Yasuhiro Nakasone, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member of the House of Representatives and former prime minister, by Soichiro Tahara, commentator and TV producer; date and place not given] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Man of Crisis: Ichiro Ozawa [Tahara] Mr. Nakasone, you mentioned in your speech in London that the coalition government incorporates Komeito, which stems from the Soka Gakkai. How do you view this? [Nakasone] I do not particularly think it has to be refused. Now that it is the time of multiple parties, it is all right to have men of different thoughts in the government. The Japan Communist Party is out of the question because it will not participate in the coalition even if it is solicited due to its way of thinking. I am in agreement with the idea that political parties other than the Communist Party can hold hands when their policies and ideas are tune with one another. However, it is always necessary to keep an eye on the method of management of political parties and their policy direction in order to safeguard democracy. In connection with Komeito's relationship with the religious organization, after reading an article contributed by Mr. Junya Yano in Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU, a question flashes through my mind of whether complete separation of religion from politics is observed internally. Whether such a problem contributes to bringing harmful effects is another question, but it is certain that caution is required. [Tahara] Another point I would like to ask you is what you said in connection with Ichiro Ozawa and his Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] that the party is carrying on intraparty guidance based on authoritarianism with a tendency toward nationalism. Is this criticism or praise? [Nakasone] It is criticism. Looking at Shinseito, I come to have questions such as whether such consultative bodies like the executive committee or general affairs committee of the party are working or whether decisions reached by a few people are relayed to the lower echelon. For example, when the new electoral system of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation is introduced, the biggest problem will be how to keep despotism in check. In this connection, those who safeguard democracy should keep an eye at all times on whether despotism sprouts or whether it has a possibility of developing in that direction in the future. [Tahara] Is there any indication that Shinseito will become despotic? [Nakasone] I suspect it to be so. [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa was a former LDP member and a junior to you, Mr. Nakasone. As his senior, what do you think of him? [Nakasone] I remember telling Mr. Kanemaru about him, "He has the qualifications to be a "yokozuna" [sumo grand champion] someday, and also has elements of a rascal." [Tahara] Rascal? [Nakasone] And I added, "He has to correct them, because it is important not to suffer injury if he wants to be a grand champion." [Tahara] What do you mean by elements of a rascal? [Nakasone] He had a quarrel with newspapermen, don't you remember? You may say he is gallant because he dared to confront someone nobody dares to, but he should not have because he is a public figure in an important position. In the past, Mr. Shigeru Yoshida threw a cup of water on the face of a newspaperman, but he was such an old man that his act was dismissed as a joke. [Tahara] You would say it is 10 years too early for him to act like that? [Nakasone] So, Mr. Yoshida could be admired, but Mr. Ozawa's case could not be praised. Furthermore, he summoned Messrs. Miyazawa, Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka to his office for an interview prior to deciding on the candidate for the LDP presidency to succeed Prime Minister Kaifu. I hope that way of thinking is now discarded, but ordinary citizens still suspect that he may still have such a subconsciousness which is reflected in the management of Shinseito. He is egoistic in abruptly going abroad with his family when the Diet comes to an important moment. [Tahara] It could be interpreted as an outburst of youthful vitality. [Nakasone] He is, however, a man of crisis, like Messrs. Ichiro Nakagawa, Michio Watanabe, Shintaro Ishiwara, and the like. [Tahara] They have in common a little tinge of somebody like a "yakuza" [hooligan]. [Nakasone] That's right. [laughter] In other words, a man without something like forcefulness, decisiveness, swiftness, or an intuitive flash of ideas will be good for nothing when confronting a crisis. Mr. Ozawa has that ability, and that good quality must be valued. [Tahara] That is the point. Mr. Nakasone, you maintained the government for five years without harm; what is the knack of not being harmed? [Nakasone] For one, you have to be humble, but you do not have to be as humble as Mr. Takeshita. [laughter] And you must keep a scrupulous watch around you at all times. Mr. Ozawa seems to be rather meticulous about this, but he is half-witted sometimes. Japanese Politics Adrift at Sea [Tahara] When the Hosokawa cabinet was desperately trying to accomplish political reform, Mr. Nakasone brushed it aside by saying, "the current political reform is concerned about small politics and is insignificant." What did you mean by that? [Nakasone] The Hosokawa cabinet drafted political reforms to be limited to amendments to the law governing elections. The most important things are where Japan has to head now that the Cold War has ended and the world is at a great turning point? For that purpose, what kind of switchover in the basic structure of politics should be made and what kinds of policies are needed for that? What combination of political parties is beneficial for the nation? How can the conglutination between the administration and the Diet be remedied? I am talking about "zoku-giin" [Diet members lobbying for specific ministries of the administration]. And how will the Diet be reformed? These questions were left untouched and the reform ended up just touching up the election law. In the beginning, the political reforms were intended to prevent corruption; this originates from the Kanemaru scandal. In other words, the major intent of the reforms was to prevent the recurrence of such grave problems. And I am afraid that the single-seat constituency election system has the danger of escalating such corruption. Further, it incorporates a danger of sprouting a legal autocratic system if things go wrong. Such advantages and disadvantages should be presented for everyone to see and let the people decide through repeated discussion. Things were worked out recklessly without giving plenty of time for discussion. I think this surely will fail and in the long run it will not necessarily bring happy consequences to Japanese politics. [Tahara] The LDP helped the election system reform materialize in the end. What do you think about this? [Nakasone] I do not think the LDP should have compromised in the first place. In view of the characteristics of a constitutional government, the fact that the bill was rejected in the House of Councilors should have carried weight. The conference committee of both houses should not have been the place to discuss such an important issue which is directly related to the fundamentals of politics and that was rejected by the House of Councilors. The matter should have been dealt with anew, from the start, I think. [Tahara] The bill would have been stillborn if LDP President Kono had not extended his helping hand at the top-level talks with the ruling parties. [Nakasone] You are right. [Tahara] How do you appraise the LDP as it is now? Did it change after becoming an opposition party? [Nakasone] Some within the LDP favored passage of the political reform bill, although it is insufficient. Still others worried about continuing the same thing for another year, if the bill was shelved and the deliberations started all over again. Considering these and various other elements, that sort of judgment was made, I suppose. Since I and others were not handling the matter directly, we followed what the party had decided upon. [Tahara] But you think that judgment was incorrect? [Nakasone] History will render such a decision, I suppose. [Tahara] In connection with what you said about such a macroanalytic matter as how to deal with Japan's basic structure, a number of magazines insist that what we should ponder now is the matter of the Japanese Constitution. [Nakasone] Before going in that discussion, I think what is important in building the basic structure is what will become of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the future. And this is related to the Constitution. The SDPJ joined the coalition under the condition that the major LDP policies would be carried on, without telling the people why. This is the No. 1 violation of its public pledge. In the ensuing SDPJ response to various policies, it is making repeated compromises under the pretext that such compromises were inevitable to maintain the regime. It raises the question of whether the SDPJ regards its being within the power structure as more important than sacrificing what it had publicly promised the people and what it had insisted on as its policies. In party politics and parliamentary politics, can it so easily throw away what it had promised the people during election campaigns? Is this not originating from opportunism or from authoritarianism? Properly speaking, prior to joining the coalition, the SDPJ should have convened a party convention, made certain amendments to its policy platform or decided on measures in response to the new cabinet, and should have decided on an official change of its stance in the name of the convention. Instead, it did so in a sneaky manner somewhere, like in the central executive committee. It did not matter much or raise a public furor, only because the people think the SDPJ policy platform is dead. Rather, the people think the changes in the SDPJ are not so bad, and this means that the party is no longer supported by the people in a sense. [Tahara] The SDPJ has become realistic and reasonable, so the people think. [Nakasone] But in a long-range view of constitutional government and parliamentary politics, it cannot rid itself of the blame that it has sacrificed chastity for power. In the House of Councilors, there were SDPJ members centered in its leftist faction who opposed the political reform bill, probably out of such a view. Or they attempted to defend on the most important occasion freedom of judgment and action as members of the upper house. It may sound strange, but these leftist members staged an independent struggle against control and demanded freedom. [Tahara] In a sense, they stuck to their principles. [Nakasone] In that connection, I give them a certain good score. The SDPJ is urged to solve that matter at the earliest possible date; whether it will or will not split as a party, and redefine its policies by convening a party convention. They are prerequisites to entering into discussions on the Constitution and PKO [peacekeeping operations] problems. [Tahara] You mean you cannot trust those who easily change their way of thinking? [Nakasone] It may be so in essence. And this applies to Mr. Hosokawa, too. [Tahara] And that kind of a government is at the helm of Japan. [Nakasone] That is why the current Japanese politics are adrift. As for Mr. Hosokawa, he said he would head for a third way and would not become prime minister after the election last summer, did he not? [Tahara] He told me so in a talk with me. [Nakasone] Then you are a witness. Despite this, he became prime minister at last. And at a post-midnight press conference, he said that the consumption tax rate will be raised to 7 percent and it will be renamed the national welfare tax, followed by the cancellation of his remarks the next day. He publicly stated before the people concerned and the press that he would carry out a cabinet reshuffle, but gave up very easily. He is good at brushing aside his remarks. It may be a kind of opportunism necessary to maintain his regime and enforce his policies to a certain degree. [Tahara] In that connection, Mr. Hosokawa and the SDPJ have something in common. [Nakasone] However, Mr. Hosokawa is attempting, in the name of his cabinet, to realize higher objectives and the people seem to be generous towards him. [Tahara] Is the SDPJ deviating from permissible limits? [Nakasone] That is right. In view of its history, it cannot change its weighty public pledges so easily. [Tahara] You mean that the SDPJ should have acted more intelligently during the Nakasone cabinet days, if the SDPJ were so intelligent in the first place? [Nakasone] You are right. [laughter] Absence of Crisis Control System [Tahara] If you think that you do not feel like discussing important matters in sincere manner with the coalition government in which the SDPJ participates, is wrecking the government not the only thing you can do? [Nakasone] What is more grave is that the present government has no crisis control system in its basic structure. [Tahara] What do you mean by that? [Nakasone] It is demanding that bureaucrats be in charge of crisis control, but it has nothing like that in its political base. One example is problems related to the DPRK. I doubt whether Japan can immediately respond with measures that can satisfy the international community, if and when the United Nations adopts a resolution to that effect. You remember, Japan could not win respect from anywhere because it was late in responding even though it contributed $13 billion later. As long as the present government keeps its perverted condition in its basic structure, there is no guarantee of not repeating the same fiasco. In other words, it is a grave national defect that the cabinet does not firmly establish a crisis control system in its base. If this situation is allowed to go on, Japan will be ruined for sure in two years. Such perversity exists between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary. It is the extremity of disorder in public authority that a vice minister discusses important taxation matters with a party leader, without the chief cabinet secretary. As such, no other ministries will follow the leadership. [Tahara] That is an important subject, about which I will ask you later. Now I would like to focus our talk on the DPRK problem. What is your opinion? [Nakasone] It is a serious problem. In my opinion, it will become a problem that will give the whole Japanese people an opportunity to reconsider Japanese security and what Japan should do in the international community. [Tahara] That is the point. The Japanese people have a strong tendency to think that it is a problem between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and DPRK or between the United States and DPRK, and Japan has little to do with it. [Nakasone] Exactly. And that is a big mistake. First, as I said before, what will Japan's response be if the United Nations adopts a resolution of sanctions and the like? It would have an immediate impact on domestic affairs. And there is a possibility that it would touch on constitutional matters. Another problem is how Japan would respond cleverly so it would not lose its value in the international community. If this problem is taken too lightly and overlooked and the DPRK succeeds in getting way with it, many other countries would follow suit. You cannot be sure that countries in the Middle East and its vicinity are not alert for every possible chance to produce nuclear weapons. [Tahara] You used the expression "getting away with it"; do you mean by that to succeed in the development of nuclear weapons? [Nakasone] I meant that the matter is overlooked with ambiguity. By that, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] would be rendered almost ineffective and would collapse. It will pose a hindrance to the problem of extending the NPT, due to be considered next year. Stern attitudes are required not to collapse the NPT. I do not think the DPRK desires a decisive rupture like war. It should know that war will lead that country to ruin. However, in the international community, where it is cornered, the DPRK wanted to demonstrate to the world that it is dealing with the United States on equal terms, disregarding both the ROK and Japan. Thus, it is playing a poker game with the United States, with nuclear weapons as the hostage. It wants to gain as much time as possible and will give out minute compromises to evade a decisive catastrophe. For us, it is important to let them put more weight on settlement through dialogue and evade the catastrophe as much as possible. In that sense, the DPRK is succeeding. On the other hand, the United States is no ordinary negotiator in that it is dealing with the matter with a strong intention to lead the dialogue to settlement, knowing it is a poker game. Japan, for its part, must get along with the poker game by providing the United Nations Security Council with wisdom or talking with the United States strenuously, with full knowledge of the DPRK or PRC position. As for the United States, it cannot make easy compromises as the whole world watches before the NPT's extention. When the United Nations adopts a resolution as a last resort, Japan should wholeheartedly support it and do whatever it can. And I think the matter should be dealt with by such a basic attitude. [Tahara] You said Japan should take a stern attitude, precisely what do you mean by that? [Nakasone] Production or possession of nuclear weapons will not be allowed. Withdrawal from the NPT will not be permitted. Allow the IAEA to inspect nuclear facilities. Japan should take a stern attitude to uphold such policies. [Tahara] I do not know how to put it in words. Imagine that economic sanctions took place. It is suspected that quite an amount of money is remitted by North Koreans in Japan to the DPRK and it will have far-reaching effects if Japan stops the flow. If an economic blockade is enforced, the Maritime Self-Defense Force has to dispatch its fleet to the Sea of Japan. These kinds of problems will come up. [Nakasone] The Security Council will issue unofficial warnings. Then they are followed by gradual sanctions, probably in three steps. For example, warnings will be issued to stop human exchanges or to stop landings of aircraft in the beginning. It is necessary to see how the other side responds to this. Prior to this, the government has to work out proper measures at this stage, in preparation for the worst. For example, North Korean ships cannot be denied entry into Japanese ports because of the treaties signed in the Ansei period [1854-1859]. A new law is required to do otherwise. In addition, there are problems related to trade, foreign exchange, and management of remittances. Dealing with such problems early will also serve as a warning to the DPRK. From such loose measures to severe actions in an emergency, Japan has to discuss such a multistage diplomatic strategy with the United States and the ROK, while at the same time carrying on preparations for both domestic and external measures in order to be prepared for the worst. And this is the task of the cabinet. [Tahara] If a second Korean war breaks out, in the worst case, how is Japan going to cooperate, regardless of becoming either a member of UN forces or multinational forces? I am afraid that the case of the Gulf war will be repeated unless these matters are considered and properly dealt with. [Nakasone] Since that matter is a delicate problem, I would rather not comment now. It may unnecessarily get on North Korea's nerves, and it is related to the constitutional problems. At any rate, a solution is being sought through diplomatic negotiations at this stage and we politicians must make remarks praying for the success of such negotiations. What you mentioned are things to be commented on when the situation comes to a certain stage. Diplomatic negotiations and military actions are completely different matters. [Tahara] You mean that thoughtless remarks on military actions should not be made? [Nakasone] Yes, at least at the present stage. They are engaged in a poker game, not a war game. The politician's task is to attain objectives with patience. Although the DPRK is a difficult country to deal with, its neighboring countries must display a certain amount of consideration. It is also necessary to show, where proper, that the Japanese people have such consideration for the DPRK. Political Organization of APEC Urged [Tahara] By the way, Mr. Nakasone, you were for amendments to the Constitution before becoming prime minister. After becoming prime minister, you refrained from referring to that matter. What is your opinion now? [Nakasone] When I was in charge of the cabinet, there were piles of problems before us, such as diplomacy toward the United States and the ROK and administrative reform. Therefore, I said I would not put constitutional amendments on the political agenda. I have consistently insisted, however, that it is necessary to examine the Constitution. There were fundamental defects in the Constitution when it was formulated. At the Cabinet Commission on the Constitution, Chairman Takayanagi said "it was a joint work of Japan and the United States, but we resisted by saying that `it is a nonindependent constitution formulated under U.S. leadership with Japanese cooperation.'" At the time of its formulation, at least over 6 million Japanese had not been repatriated from China or Siberia. In addition, several hundreds of thousand people could not act because they were purged from public office. That Constitution was formulated under such completely nonfunctioning conditions. Properly speaking, a new constitution should have been formulated when everybody abroad was repatriated. But it was neglected, due in part to leftist pressure. Mr. Shigeru Yoshida took advantage of such a situation in a veiled attempt to push through his policy priority on the economy. When I formed my cabinet, I mentioned "the final settlement of postwar political accounts," and I was referring to getting rid of such Yoshida-style politics. [Tahara] Mr. Ichiro Ozawa wrote in his book Nippon Kaizo Keikaku [Blueprint for Building a New Japan] that Mr. Yoshida's choice was good at that time, but now it has to be amended. But Mr. Nakasone, you are more severe about it. [Nakasone] You are right. At present, the United Nations has great power. Properly speaking, the matter should have been settled when Japan joined the United Nations. Now this problem must be presented before the people; the link between Article 9 of the Constitution and cooperation with the United Nations must be reexamined to get a consensus. [Tahara] I will ask you a straight question. Do you mean that the Constitution should be amended and that Japan should cooperate militarily when a situation like the Gulf war breaks out, and that this reflects what Japan should be? [Nakasone] It depends on the meaning of the word "militarily." Japan will have to cooperate with UN forces or with military actions taken at the initiative of the United Nations. But it must be limited to such fields as transportation, communications, medical treatment, construction, and the like. Self-Defense Forces will not be dispatched for the purpose of using armed force. [Tahara] Is it not possible as UN forces? [Nakasone] It should not be done before the Constitution is amended. [Tahara] When the time comes when the people are asked what they think, what kind of view will you present for the people to see, Mr. Nakasone? [Nakasone] It is difficult to say at this time. But you cannot deny the possibility of participating in acts of hostilities in accordance with the mutual security treaty [with the United States], in such inevitable situations as Japan being invaded and its security in peril, or Japan being on the verge of ruin due to an oil supply cut off. But it may be wise to have a certain safeguard to restrain, to the best of Japan's power, such acts from taking place as acts of the government, while the constitutional possibility to undertake such acts are acknowledged. For instance, make the consent of the Diet necessary. [Tahara] Now let us talk about the Mutual Security Treaty between Japan and the United States, which is different from the constitutional discussion. Now that the Cold War structure has collapsed, what do you think about the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty? [Nakasone] The Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has undergone some changes in its character, and due to these changes I think it is functioning extremely well. [Tahara] Is that so? [Nakasone] What I mean is that the presence of U.S. Forces from the Aleutian Islands to the Persian Gulf plays an extremely vital role in deterring conflicts from occurring. Asian nations welcome it. In this connection, I think the Mutual Security Treaty, with important bases in Yokosuka and Okinawa, is functioning as a potential deterrentforce in the prevention of international conflicts. In that sense, the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has become a kind of political alliance beyond one that focuses on the defense of Japan. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is similar in that it is a military alliance and at the same time a political alliance. I think it necessary to respect and maintain such functions to the full extent. [Tahara] To maintain the security of such a wide region from the Aleutians to the Gulf, it is conceivable that Asian nations and the ROK or Indonesia, not only Japan and the United States, will be included as in the case of NATO, is it not? [Nakasone] I am not considering it. This is because there are constitutional problems: Such problems as individual self-defense rights or collective self-defense rights are not defined as yet. I think we have the right to collective self-defense under the present Constitution. But the government is keeping it under control and a popular consensus has not yet been obtained. I want to say loud and clear that I want to set up a political framework to discuss peace and security or to bring about trust in the Asia-Pacific region. What I have in mind is to set up an organization to talk about international security or such a political framework as the CSCE and let world leaders get together maybe twice a year and talk over the state of military affairs, control of military expenses, measures to bring about mutual trust, and prevention of arms transfer and of conflicts. I wish to make the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty a double structure backed up by such a political framework. [Tahara] You envision the United States in that setup. [Nakasone] Yes. [Tahara] Is it something like a political version of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Conference]? [Nakasone] Yes. I think it is indispensable to maintaining the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty. Sole Reliance on Bureaucrats Would Not Do [Tahara] With respect to the United States, the counterpart in the Mutual Security Treaty, the common adversary has disappeared and its relationship with Japan has begun to be jerky. What is your view of the recent talks Hosokawa had with Clinton? [Nakasone] It is still too early to call it a failure, but it certainly is not a success. Both sides have made mistakes. [Tahara] What were they? [Nakasone] On the U.S. side, there was a Glen Fukushima paper. Parts Clinton was said to underline read, "Japanese bureaucrats are exclusively for the status quo. It will result in a big mistake to accept the suggestions of such bureaucrats." It added, "Japan has never honored its promises. It has not put into practice the agreement reached between Miyazawa and Bush two years ago." "It will do no good to repeat the same thing in dealing with such a unique country" "Let it set up precise numerical targets." The paper read something like that. This paper had a big impact. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative followed the parts underlined by Clinton as they had been advised. Clinton handed that paper to such government economic officials as Bentsen, Kantor, or Cutter, but the State Department did not seem to get it. In the past, leading State Department authorities like Shultz, Baker, and so on handled negotiations between Japan and the United States, but now economic officials with the background of lobbyists or lawyers are in charge of negotiations. These people, with less diplomatic experience, have confronted Japanese bureaucrats of the Finance and Foreign Ministries. Thus their talks ended in rupture. Such excuses as "relations between adults" or "excluding ambiguous agreements glossing over the problems of the times" were used to cover up the failure, but the aim of diplomacy is to lead the negotiations to an agreement, and that is what adults are to do--parting after quarrels is what children do. [Tahara] What were Japan's mistakes? [Nakasone] When the Bush-Miyazawa talks threatened to break up two years ago like it did this time, the administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, Owada, sat up all night negotiating an agreement with the United States. [Tahara] A consultative organization was set up as a result. [Nakasone] When it realized in detail how the crisis had reached a boiling point, the new regime should have immediately started to work out the problem, but it did not and entrusted the whole work to bureaucrats. Those bureaucrats had to protect the interests of their own ministries, and no progress was made in their negotiations. And Glen Fukushima's paper added fuel to the fire. In other words, no diplomacy existed. [Tahara] You mean that the negotiations were carried out between bureaucrats, and political diplomacy had no part in it? [Nakasone] Yes. And the primary responsibility rests on the foreign minister rather than Mr. Hosokawa. [Tahara] Many think that agreements are worked out by bureaucrats beforehand and the prime minister and foreign minister go to Washington only to shake hands. Is it not so? [Nakasone] At least, not in my case. When the Japan-U.S. cooperation on military technology was worked out in 1983, I persuaded the director general of the cabinet legislative bureau to reach an agreement, although the bureau itself had insisted that it was absolutely impossible. And between Reagan and I were MOSS [market-oriented sector-selective] negotiations which resulted in market opening in the telecommunications field. At that time, I gave instructions to the then administrative vice minister of posts and telecommunications, Koyama, and dispatched him to Washington three times. There had never been such precedents as dispatching vice ministers abroad for negotiations -- and on three occasions! From the stage of prior consultations, the prime minister or the foreign minister must instruct bureaucrats what to do, not letting them do the work by themselves. Without doing this, the prime minister went to Washington without giving too much thought to the matter, relying solely on the worksheet written by bureaucrats. The same thing can be said about the Uruguay Round. When the chief cabinet secretary made the final draft public, he did not refer to the sixth item that "after six years, tariffication will be abolished and additional commitments have to be taken by Japan." [Tahara] Mr. Takemura said he "had not heard about that part." [Nakasone] It revealed that the prime minister or the chief cabinet secretary had not given instructions of "their ideas" to the bureaucrats, the foreign minister, or minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, but that the chief cabinet secretary merely read what the bureaucrats in Geneva had decided. If they had committed themselves from the beginning, this sort of important thing could not be forgotten. As you see from what I mentioned so far, the present politics are solely dependent on what the bureaucrats suggest. I think this is a dangerous practice. There is no denying that Japanese politics were carried out dependent on bureaucrats. In the case of the LDP, however, there were fastidious members in various divisions and prime ministers, to have their ideas reflected in policies, made good use of them. In that sense, the Office of the Prime Minister and Foreign Ministry bureaucrats were working together as a unit. Now the unity is completely torn to pieces. [Tahara] Mr. Hosokawa said in his press conference after the collapse of the Japan-U.S. summit "from now on, say frankly what we can and what we cannot compromise on." How about this point? [Nakasone] It is a foolish remark. If you say "No" to the United States, it was said earlier by Mr. Shintaro Ishihara. If letting talks collapse is relations between adults, are they who make talk successful children? [Tahara] That means Mr. Nakasone was a child. [laughter] [Nakasone] That is nothing but an excuse. Yosuke Matsuoka was welcomed home by nationwide applause after having made Japan withdraw from the League of Nations. And that action later led Japan into World War II. It looks like the same thing is happening again. Generally speaking, nationwide applause or national frenzy tend to hurt the nation. Examples are Hitler of Germany and the Cultural Revolution in China. [Tahara] You mean the high popularity of Mr. Hosokawa is somewhat dangerous in a certain sense? [Nakasone] It is all right to have high popularity, but I mean that he should not become elated. Qualifications of a Prime Minister [Tahara] Incidentally, I would like to hear from a man who served in the premiership for five long years what the important qualifications of a prime minister are. [Nakasone] It varies according to time and country. I think three qualifications are required for a Japanese prime minister today. One is the ability of eye measurement, an ability to handle and solve problems, in other words, an intuitive ability of conjecture. The second is an ability to unite talented persons, wisdom, and clean money. And the third is persuasive power, to persuade foreign countries as well as his own people. [passage omitted on evaluation of past prime ministers] [Tahara] The LDP, a professional group led by such successive party presidents, is now an opposition party. The ruling coalition government has an amateur as its head and embraces a dangerous entity, the SDPJ, within its fold. What do you think the LDP should do under these conditions? [Nakasone] The important things are how to make the basic structure of Japanese politics stable in a medium-to-long range prospect, rather than how to attack the ruling parties and recapture the helm of government. The present coalition government has some twisting elements in it and disproportionate phenomena, something like detached farmlands. Real political realignment can be possible by touching them up. Our utmost task is to remedy as soon as possible the present disproportionate and cloudy situation which take so much time in reaching decisions. Foreign countries trust a government that is predictable. Right now, it is in a fog. The other day, I told an LDP Diet member that the present LDP has no "navel," like a frog. It has to make a "navel." Without it, the LDP has no driving power. [Tahara] I take it that "navel" means "hatajirushi" or policy objectives. What objectives should the LDP have? [Nakasone] Policywise, a neoconservative liberalism. It means a small government, an open-door policy internationally, and daring deregulation that will let free economic activities demonstrate dynamism to the maximum. It is to learn many lessons from history and tradition, respect self-responsibility and treasure one's home, and stop wasting money for welfare for no definite purpose. Those who work hard will be rewarded. Those are the principles. [Tahara] They seem to be close to the lines of the U.S. Republican Party. Mr. Hosokawa, if anything, is close to the Democratic Party of the United States. [Nakasone] Since we live in a time of fertility, I think it is our task to let individuals display their dynamism under free competition. In this connection, there may be a need to reexamine the bureaucratic system. The number of ministries would be reduced to about 10. Employment of high-echelon public servants and redistribution of personnel would no longer be handled by each ministry or agency, but by the cabinet. A free appointment system would be introduced to certain high-level ranks. Once done, the present Japanese bureaucracy would change. [Tahara] What do you think about the long-advocated public election of the prime minister? [Nakasone] By and by it is becoming realistic. Now that the duel between liberalism and socialism has ended, such confrontation seen in a free society like the Republican and Democratic Parties in the United States emerges at this time. As the sentiment grows that the current parliamentary cabinet system, which has been subjected to great stress, has to be replaced, the choice between public election of the prime minister or the parliamentary cabinet system will be strongly demanded. In the LDP, Mr. Taku Yamazaki and others are sponsoring a study group on public election of the prime minister, and many in the SDPJ are in favor of such a move. [Tahara] What is the biggest defect in the present method of choosing a prime minister? [Nakasone] Because the prime minister is not chosen by a direct mandate from the people, the authority of the executive power is weak and tends to be short-lived. A major reason why my cabinet could carry out powerful policies was that I became prime minister after mustering 50,000 to 60,000 votes in an earlier preliminary election. Yeltsin could wield power for the first time after having been elected president in a public election. I think that the Japanese prime minister should follow this example. The emperor is the symbol of the unity of the people in accordance with traditional authority and the prime minister will be the functional political unity under the emperor. Thre is one more thing I would like to add that is politically important and that is to reflect on the 20th century with the 21st century at the threshold. I propose to establish a censuring committee on the 20th century, because it was the gloomiest period in the history of mankind. Two world wars, financial crises, a 70-year confrontation between communism and freedom, the menace of nuclear weapons and so on. No other century witnessed so many miserable deaths of human beings through wars and purges than the 20th century. Of course, there were such encouraging factors as the denouncement of colonialism, the birth of so many independent nations, advances in scientific technology and medicine, Olympic Games, and Nobel Prizes. Taking all these pluses and minuses into account, there has never been such a miserable century as the 20th. [Tahara] It was the worst century of all? [Nakasone] There is a need for those who have lived in that century to analyze and pass judgment on the 20th century during a transitional period toward the 21st century and appeal to the world that the same course not be repeated in the coming century. How about each political party setting up such a committee and make public that voice from Japan. I think it would be better for Japan to initiate such a large-scale civilized idea.
