Thus, he called on them to thoroughly implement our party's economic strategy. We should thoroughly carry to accomplishment the agriculture- first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy in socialist economic construction during the upcoming three years, which were designated as an adjustment period at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee. At the same time, we should give precedence to the coal industry, electric power industry, and railway transport -- the priority sector in the national economy -- and should continuously develop the metal industry. Our party's economic strategy is a just policy put forward based on a deep analysis of changed circumstances and practical demand of socialist construction in our country, and is a revolutionary line for effecting a new upsurge in socialist construction. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: During the adjustment period of socialist economic construction, we should thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy. Thus, we will firmly consolidate the foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy and will more satisfactorily ensure the people's living according to the demand of socialism. We will hold a new position of attack to attain the higher goal of socialism. Our party's economic strategy will, above all, enable us to consolidate rock-firm the foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy. We registered a great advance in the development of the national economy during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. We further consolidated our nation's economy to be a socialist self-supporting national economy in which all domains, including industry and rural economy, were armed with modern equipment and which have sufficient segmental structure [pumun kujo]. The party's revolutionary economic strategy has elucidated ways for strengthening self-reliance and the might of our economy in every way while consolidating our achievements. During the adjustment period of socialist economic construction, we will further perfect segmental structure so that the self- reliance of the nation's economy will be strengthened. In particular, we will continuously direct efforts to the coal industry, electricity, and railway transport -- the priority fields in the national economy -- and will more satisfactorily resolve the problems of fuel, energy, and transport. By implementing the revolutionary economic strategy, we will be able to epochally develop our economy by depending on the unbounded potential of our self-supporting economy and on abundant natural resources. We will more vigorously accelerate economic construction without wavering in the face of an economic blockade by the imperialists and the worldwide economic crisis. Another economic strategy of our party is to more smoothly guarantee the people's living standard in accordance with the socialist demand. Endlessly enhancing the people's living standard is the supreme principle of our party's activities. During the recent years, our party took great interest in enhancing the people's living standard even under the difficult condition of carrying out the acute political and military confrontation with the imperialists. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is anticipating that the state investment will be increased in the agricultural, light industrial, and foreign trade sectors, which are directly related to the people's living, and that development in these sectors will be vigorously accelerated. Therefore, if this strategic policy is embodied, our people's century-old desire of everyone eating rice and meat soup, wearing silk clothes, and living in tile-roofed houses will be brilliantly realized, and our people's material and cultural life will be all the more abundant in accordance with the intrinsic demand of socialism. As such, our party's revolutionary economic strategy makes it possible to more vigorously accelerate socialist construction by consolidating, like bedrock, the country's self-supporting economic basis and more smoothly guaranteeing the people's living standard in accordance with the socialist demand. The superiority of socialism of our own style will be more vigorously displayed when thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy, and we will also occupy a new offensive camp to possess a higher ground of socialism. Today we are faced with the task of highly upholding the military task presented by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and of thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy. This year is a significant year marking the passing of 30 years since the socialist rural theses was announced. We must first of all vigorously carry out the struggle to complete the historical task of the agricultural theses so that a new turning point can be achieved in the development of the rural economy. To achieve this, irrigation and electrification work must be consolidated in the farms, mechanization and chemicalization must be realized at a high level, and the chuche farming method must be thoroughly implemented so that all sectors of agricultural production, including food grain crop can be further developed. Next, the light industry revolution must be vigorously accelerated so that a great innovation can be achieved in the production of mass consumption goods. To achieve this, the light industry plants must be put in good order, reinforced, modernized, and active measures must be established to strengthen the production of raw materials of the light industry, including synthetic fiber and synthetic resins so that all the light industry plants will operate at full capacity and normalize production at a high level. Along with this, various mass consumption goods must be produced at a large scale in all sectors and units, the variety of consumer goods must be increased, and their quality must be decisively enhanced. Also, foreign trade must be developed to thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy. To develop foreign trade in accordance with the changed environment, foreign markets must be actively sought and thoroughly maintain good credit. The production bases of export products must be firmly consolidated in various sectors of the people's economy, the production of export products must be increased, and their quality must be enhanced. Along with this, the source of exports must be actively investigated and mobilized in all sectors and regions so exports can be increased and processing trade can be developed. Efforts must be put into the coal industry, electric industry, and the metal industry to develop agriculture and the light industry and vigorously accelerate the country's overall economic construction. Also, rail transportation must be carried out more smoothly. All the functionaries, party members, and workers must highly uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy so that socialist construction can be more vigorously accelerated.
