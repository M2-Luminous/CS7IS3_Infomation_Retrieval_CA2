The agreement was signed by Mexican President Carlos Salinas, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. They will participate, beginning on Tuesday, in the Fourth Ibero-American summit of chiefs of state and government in this city in northwestern Colombia. The treaty, which was signed at the Presidential Home for Illustrious Guests, will benefit 150 million inhabitants of these three countries, and in initial stages, will generate business amounting to $600 million per year. Its signing was achieved after more than three years of efforts that nearly failed in May. The G-3 agreement will go into effect in early 1995, and for Colombia and Venezuela it offers an opportunity to request membership in NAFTA, of which Mexico is a signatory as well as the United States and Canada.
