The latest reports from the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Command in Gorazde said that Bosnian Serb troops have withdrawn from the exclusion zone around the town, said Akashi. He explained that available information seemed to indicate that the conference might begin on Monday morning. U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived in Geneva during the night, in an effort to use his authority to help surmount controversial issues and finally open the conference on a general cessation of hostilities in Bosnia. On Sunday night, Akashi had separate meetings with the Bosnian Serb and Muslim delegations, and indicated a certain reconciliation of stands from which it appeared that the conference might be held after all, after four days of delay. He said, however, that the Muslim side was still making its attendance conditional on receiving a report from its observers confirming that "armed Serb elements" had withdrawn from the exclusion zone around Gorazde. In his most recent statement, Akashi said that the three sides were coming to the talks with different positions, but were willing that the conference, called at Geneva's Palais des Nations, should finally begin.
