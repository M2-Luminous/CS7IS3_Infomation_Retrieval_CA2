The document submitted to the committee members for analysis will then be presented to the assembly for a vote. The author of this bill, Deputy Evans Beaubrun of Leogane, while acknowledging that the right to grant amnesty in political matters is exercised by the president of the Republic, believes that legislators have the right to legislate on all matters, including amnesty. It should be noted that the chairman of the Justice Committee, Deputy Samuel Madistin, went underground after receiving threats. Vice President Edmond Mirold tells us about the bill: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Mirold] It is a bill that the Justice Committee is going to work on. Since the president of the deputies, Deputy Samuel Madistin, has not given any indication, I am going to try to get in touch with him as soon as possible to see whether we could work on the bill and submit an efficient work to the assembly for the deputies' vote. [Reporter Jean] In view of the importance of this amnesty law, how long do you think it will take the Justice Committee to submit the bill to the assembly? [Mirold] As I am not the chairman, I do not want to give any date. I will become the chairman, once I write to the chairman of the Justice Committee and he fails to answer. Then I will assume my responsibility as vice chairman, and I could give a date. Until I meet with President Madistin and he either gives me the green light to work or does not show up and I start working, I remain subject to his decision. [Jean] What is your personal opinion, Deputy Mirold? [Mirold] It appears to be a good work. However, I think that the committee will have to do a great deal of work on the text, taking into account the passions of the context in which the bill will be voted. The assembly will have a lot of work to do after the Justice Committee does its work. [end recording]
