According to information obtained by BNS, there are no more newer-type seamines in the Naissaar base. Russia now continues destroying its supply of older types of mines by burining them on the island. The Naissaar base as recently as Dec. 1, 1993 was reported to have a stock of some 1,280 seamines, including 80 of the newer types. Estonian authorities until now don't know the exact number of Russian military staying in the country. Sources in the Central Staff of the Estonian defense forces said different estimates put the number at 2,700-3,000. There has been no remarkable movement of Russian military from the country in January, neither have any major changes taken place in the structure of the Russian units still stationed in Estonia. Some technical equipment, however, has been taken out, officials said. Russia's chief negotiator for talks with Estonia, Vasili Svirin, in early December said his country had about 2,600-strong military presence in Estonia. Reports by the 2nd department of the Estonian Central Staff say Russian naval forces account for about 1,100-1,200 of the remaining troops. About 300-400 are still present in different kinds of auxiliary units and supply depots. Some 500 Russian officers and noncommissioned officers whose units have left the Estonian territory are also staying in the country. Russian units of any remarkable size are stationed only in Tallinn and the surrounding Harju region.
