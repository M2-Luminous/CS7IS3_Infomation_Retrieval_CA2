Moscow Urges Restraint"] [Text] Following Saturday's tragedy, when 68 people were killed and around 200 were wounded by a mortar shell in the Sarajevo city market, the Bosnia situation is extremely tense. Few people in the West doubt that the Serbs besieging the Bosnian capital are responsible for what happened. On the initiative of France and Britain representatives of the 16 NATO states are meeting in Brussels Tuesday [8 February] to consider air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has also come out in support of such a step. According to him, the decision to bomb Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo does not require a special Security Council resolution: A positive decision by the NATO council is sufficient. Moscow is categorically opposed to such an approach. "We do not accept Butrus-Ghali's arguments and we do not believe that the present case is covered by previous Security Council resolutions. There need to be consultations with the Security Council members," a senior Russian diplomat observed. Russia has resolutely condemned the organizers of Saturday's attack and said that they must be severely punished, but Moscow is in no hurry to place the blame on the Serbs. "The investigation is not yet completed. According to ballistics experts, the mortar shell came from an area where both Serbs and Muslims have positions. Until the Serbs' responsibility is proved, the international community must not take any steps," an informed source in Smolensk Square [site of Foreign Ministry] told IZVESTIYA. Moscow is anxiously awaiting the results of the investigation: If it is established that the mortar was fired by the Serbs, Russian diplomats are unlikely to be able to persuade the West to refrain from taking decisive steps. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who was quick to dissociate himself from Saturday's action, calling it the "work of war criminals," would be in an extremely unpleasant position. Although Belgrade does still have a chance to save face by blaming extremists who do not answer either to Milosevic or to Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. If the West accepts this version, you might merely get a show trial, with the question of the bombing of Serbian positions removed from the agenda. "The West's reaction has to be rational, not emotional. Before embarking on extreme measures it is necessary to consider whether this would bring us nearer a settlement or, in fact, lead to an exacerbation of the conflict," the Russian diplomat, who deals with the Balkans, believes. Smolensk Square makes no secret of its annoyance that the recent Russian initiatives on Bosnia were so coolly received in the West. "We were actually proposing strengthening the security zones, including Sarajevo. If our arguments had been heeded, Saturday's tragedy might have been avoided," one of the authors of the rejected peace plan said.
