"We freed ourselves from the latter, now we must free ourselves from the former." Marco Taradash has become the first chairman of the RAI Oversight Committee of the Second Republic and has a specific plan in mind: radical reform of public broadcasting as the precondition for any discussion of a reorganization of the Italian television system. A representative of Pannella's "reformers" group, ready to proudly declare his membership of the liberal Left, though elected on Forza Italia's lists ("There is a Right that is democratic to a greater or lesser extent, but that in any case behaves democratically now. On the other hand, there are the post-Christian Democrats and the post-Communists"), Taradash has always been accustomed to controversy and is not frightened by the polemic sparked by his initiative to report the spoils system within the RAI to the legal authorities. Nor is he frightened by the reserve with which his move was received by the majority to which he belongs. "Who says Berlusconi has distanced himself from it? Whoever says so is committing journalistic libel, displaying a lack of professionalism and correctness. Anyone who knows about terrorism knows that the people who distance themselves are those who, having done something together with others, subsequently change their minds and say: I will never do it again." [Ricci] What about Berlusconi? [Taradash] Berlusconi knew nothing about it, and there was no reason to involve the prime minister in this matter. Indeed, he merely said that he knew nothing about it, that he did not criticize it, and admitted that it was a personal initiative on my part, meaning that it was an initiative of the reformers' political movement. That is all there is to it. [Ricci] So are all these reservations expressed by forces which, after all, belong to the same majority, not part of the atmosphere of ill feeling that exists at present between you and the Berlusconi government? [Taradash] I am doing what I have always done. Already two weeks ago I condemned the prejudiced and discriminatory attitude that Fininvest adopted, especially toward the smaller lists, in the European election campaign. I think that Fininvest has the duties of a public service, even though these are not envisioned by the law. [Ricci] Do you not think that your institutional role as chairman of the Oversight Committee limits your flexibility, your ability "to do what you have always done"? [Taradash] I prefer to say that it liberates. I presented the judiciary with documents concerning the past, in order to avert a vast whitewash in connection with the RAI's domination by the parties. This has nothing to do with the future work of the committee, which is what concerns me since I became chairman. I see no conflict here. [Ricci] Who is under investigation in the RAI? The Justice Ministry has not confirmed any names. [Taradash] If anyone asks me whether they are under investigation, I have always said, I do not know. But journalists have always stated the opposite. [Ricci] Nevertheless, [RAI Chairman] Dematte and the other "professors" of the RAI top management seem convinced that you do not have your sights set on them, as you do on previous administrations. [Taradash] That is true. I have no issue with them. The problem is that when the system of party domination collapsed, the regime entrenched itself within the RAI. I suspect that even the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] eventually allowed itself to become involved in a system of party domination entirely internal to the RAI, even when this system of party domination no longer existed outside. Consider the fact that such people as Dematte and [RAI Managing Director] Locatelli, who have backgrounds as in academia or journalism: They have been destroyed. Or involved in a kind of Stockholm syndrome -- the psychological link created between a bank robber and his hostage. [Ricci] So is their time over? [Taradash] I am not interested in manhunts, which some people on the Left, however, would like very much. I want a war to liberate the RAI from this regime. The Salo Republic, too, must be liberated. [Ricci] How? [Taradash] I cannot reveal my plan for the Oversight Committee because that would be unfair to the other Committee members. What I can say, is what I think its objective should be: Managers, producers, officials, and journalists must be chosen on the basis of criteria of efficiency, productivity, and professional skills. This is the way to end the Salo Republic and to enter the democratic republic. [Ricci] How can those appointed according to the spoils system be identified? [Taradash] It is enough to turn on the radio or television to see whether or not this applies to a particular producer. [Ricci] But the issue here is not the assessment of the average listener. I want to know what the Oversight Committee will do: Will it pass judgment on individual programs, say which are subject to the spoils system and which are not? [Taradash] Thank heavens, the Committee has neither the legal nor the administrative powers to do this. The Committee will assess broadcasts to the extent that it can. The Committee can adopt a political stance. Then it is up to the government, the judiciary, the IRI [Institute of Industrial Reconstruction], the management board, the director general, or the director of the individual program to act. [Ricci] How is this "liberation" of the RAI connected with containing Fininvest's hegemony, the issue of efficient antitrust legislation with regard to the media? [Taradash] The two things are connected chronologically, though the RAI is a public broadcaster and has different problems from private broadcasters. The building of a commercial RAI network, that is, with commercials, means that the commercial competitor that is being established must have the same dimensions and that we cannot now consider reducing Fininvest's strength without first taking action on the RAI. [Ricci] Would such action extend as far as shielding it in terms of advertsing? [Taradash] Definitely not. Advertising distorts public broadcasting. Furthermore, only if the RAI does not compete in the advertising market will the resources be made available that will ensure that an antitrust authority will not penalize firms capable of being active at the international level and that will favor the growth of new alignments. If on top of this we add new technologies -- cable and satellite -- which are not so new abroad and which must be made available to both new and old users, the problem of monopoly and duopoly will acquire a completely different aspect. [Ricci] Do you mean that these three steps -- reform of the RAI and its advertising, the introduction of new technologies, and the formation of new alignments -- are dependent on one another and that the technological revolution cannot be carried out unless the RAI is reformed and reduced and that antitrust legislation cannot be implemented unless the other two steps have been carried out? [Taradash] We could draft antitrust legislation even now and say that it takes effective in six monthse or in two years, depending on the fulfillment of the other two conditions.
