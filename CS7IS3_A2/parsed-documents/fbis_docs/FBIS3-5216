Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, chief U.S. nuclear negotiator with North Korea, will come to Seoul on March 10 and meet with several South Korean officials the following two days to coordinate a bilateral stance. Gallucci will likely be accompanied by David Brown, chief of the Korea desk at the State Department, and Gary Samore, deputy chief in charge of non-proliferation. Tom Hubbard, the top U.S. representative at working-level negotiations with Pyongyang, is unable to accompany the delegation because he is acting as assistant secretary in lieu of Winston Lord, who is on a trip to Asia. Seoul and Washington will draw up measures expected after the IAEA team, currently in the middle of inspections, successfully concludes its monitoring of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities in another week or so. They will discuss the agenda and principles for the next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, set for March 21 in Geneva. A key point concerns their demand for an inter-Korean presidential envoy exchange before the high-level talks can open. North Korea has yet to indicate that it will meet this demand. Seoul and Washington are expected to reconfirm their position that substantive inter-Korean dialogue is a condition for the March 21 meeting. Gallucci plans to hold a press conference on March 12 and leave the following day.
