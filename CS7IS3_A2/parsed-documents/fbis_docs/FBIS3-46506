The United States is claiming that these four Japanese industries are closed to foreign competition. The survey showed that "they have been improving their business practices as can be seen in one case in which a company has stopped giving rebates to its agent, a practice which can prevent other companies from entering the market." The FTC had earlier conducted a similar survey based on an agreement reached between Japan and the United States at a follow-up meeting held in July, 1992 for the Japanese-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks. The results showed that special agents dealt only with commodities from certain makers and they were receiving progressive rebates from the makers in return for their agreement to set targets for business transactions between them. In June 1993, the FTC notified the four previously-mentioned industries of problems in their business practices. The recent survey was conducted in November and December to see how the industries had improved business practices following the warning. The results of the survey apparently show that "each industry is making sincere efforts to improve its business practices." According to the survey, companies in these four industries have taken such measures as abolishing rebates and sending messages to agents saying "we do not restrict your freedom to deal in the products of rival companies." The FTC plans to "keep watching to see if the industries maintain their improvement in business practice."
