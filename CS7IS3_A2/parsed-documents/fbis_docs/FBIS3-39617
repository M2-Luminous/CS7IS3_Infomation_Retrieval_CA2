In effect, Pyongyang agreed on Tuesday 15 February -- barely a week before the expiration of the ultimatum issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- to resume international inspections of its officially listed nuclear installations. Inspectors will therefore once again be visiting the seven sites which they have been unable to visit for more than a year because of opposition from Pyongyang. Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo were immediately pleased with this new attitude and talks between the United States and North Korea resumed within hours. Nevertheless, both Japan and the IAEA hastened to point out that this agreement still did not cover the two sites which the Kim Il-song regime is accused of using to try and develop the atomic bomb. Both the CIA and certain well-informed Russian circles are convinced that Pyongyang already has several nuclear warheads. North Korea's past attitude calls for caution. This is not the first time that it has laid down the law or reneged on its commitments. Just last week, it was still threatening to respond to international sanctions, whereas it is undoubtedly this very threat which led it to compromise. In any case, its maneuvering will have gained it a year that could be turned to profit by its atomic scientists. Under these circumstances, it is important that we not deceive ourselves too much. Pyongyang's gesture cannot be considered a success for President Clinton, whose hesitant attitude contributed not inconsiderably to prolonging the crisis, and who has shown his inability to force a state that was openly violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to yield. On the contrary, North Korea can feel that it was correct to force a crisis, and rightly so: In order to force the country to return to a "status quo ante," the Americans had to agree to initiate a political dialogue with Pyongyang and even to promise it possible diplomatic recognition and aid which its totally collapsed economy most urgently needs. And yet, the two contested sites have still not been opened up. Even worse, the White House had to put up with the combined pressure of the North Koreans and their neighbors, who are worried about the risk of aggravating tension in the region. In the Korean peninsula -- the final frontier of the Cold War -- like elsewhere in the world, be it yesterday in Iraq or today in Bosnia, only a decisive and united attitude by the international community will prove effective in maintaining peace. Gaining time or yielding to pressure without a coherent strategy has its price sooner or later.
