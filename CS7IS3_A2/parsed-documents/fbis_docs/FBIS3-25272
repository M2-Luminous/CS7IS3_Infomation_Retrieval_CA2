At the end of the meeting between the traditional chiefs, the Sultan of the Air, El Hadj Ibrahim Oumarou, in a statement broadcast on national television, called on Tuareg people to show "civic-mindedness and patriotism " in order for them to give a "precious contribution" to the settlement of the Tuareg conflict. He also regretted the current economic situation that is "particularly preoccupying" in northern Niger and asked "all countries who are friends of Niger such as France, Algeria, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso" to give "full support" to a definitive return of peace in the north of country. At the beginning of the month, the four movements of the rebellion, grouped within the Coordination of the Armed Resistence, agreed to resume dialogue with the Niger government and announced the holding of a meeting in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), with no date fixed as yet. On 5 February, a French diplomat, Mr. Jean-Francois Nodinot, was appointed "mediator" in the conflict, which has left 91 people dead since November 1991.
