FR940418-2-00017 FR940418-2-00005 Although information obtained at verification indicates that ILVA paid Finsider less than it would have paid a commercial guarantor, we have concluded that ILVA received no benefit. Given that Finsider was in liquidation and presumably could not have carried out the guarantee, ILVA was receiving nothing in exchange for its payments. Therefore, we find that these loan guarantees are not countervailable. D. Interest Grants for ``Indirect Debts'' Under Law 750/81 At verification, we established that Law 750/81 was passed as a result of the 1981 Iron and Steel plan to provide interest grants to sectors within the steel industry which were designated as strategic sectors. The program was in place from 1981 through 1983. One of the sectors designated as a strategic sector was forgings and castings, as these steel products were used in the construction of electrical power plants. Since Terni was the only producer of this type of forgings and castings, the GOI provided assistance to Terni to allow it to reach full production capacity. Because these benefits were provided for the production of forgings and castings, we determine that they do not provide a benefit to the subject merchandise. E. ECSC Article 56 Redeployment Aid Under Article 56(2)(b) of the ECSC Treaty, redeployment assistance is provided to workers affected by the restructuring of the coal and steel industries in the ECSC member states. The assistance consists of the following types of grants: (1) Income support grants for workers affected by unemployment, re-employment at a lower salary or early retirement; (2) grants to enable companies to continue paying workers who have been laid off temporarily; (3) vocational training grants; and (4) resettlement grants. The decision to grant Article 56 assistance is contingent upon a matching contribution from the member state. The portion of Article 56 redeployment grants funded by the ECSC comes from the European Commission's operational budget for the ECSC steel program. This budget is funded by (1) levies imposed on coal and steel producers in the member countries; (2) income from ECSC's investments; (3) guarantee fees and fines paid to the ECSC; and (4) interest received from companies that have obtained loans from the ECSC. Because payments from the ECSC under Article 56 are sourced from producer levies, we find them to be not countervailable (see Certain Steel from Italy at 37336). (The matching contributions from the GOI for the training elements of Article 56 were discussed above under Law 181/89.)
