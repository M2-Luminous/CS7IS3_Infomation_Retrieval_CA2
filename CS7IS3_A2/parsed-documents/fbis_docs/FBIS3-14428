[Al-Majali] Thank you. [Husayn] Prime Minister, His Majesty King Husayn has just ended a Gulf tour that took him to the Sultanate of Oman and Qatar. This tour coincided with important developments on the Arab scene. What was the outcome of that tour? [Al-Majali] We are going through a delicate phase. His Majesty King Husayn always makes a point of exchanging views with his brothers the Arab leaders. His visits to Qatar and Oman were in this context. His Majesty is an advocate of Arab reconciliation and coordination. He does not want a new order to emerge in the region without all the Arab brothers being actively involved in shaping it. [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, Jordan and Egypt held intensive consultations with the sides of the Yemeni crisis. The Yemenis then signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman. Soon afterward, disagreement surfaced again in Yemen. Is Jordan currently engaged in any mediation efforts to resolve the crisis in Yemen? [Al-Majali] Since the onset of the Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni president and vice president have been in touch with His Majesty King Husayn, who they saw as able to settle the differences between them. With characteristic patriotism and pan-Arab enthusiasm, His Majesty worked closely with them until the pledge and accord document was signed in Amman. Differences then surfaced over the implementation of that document, but I think that consultations are continuing and we pray to God Almighty that the difficulties facing the implementation of that document will be surmounted. What matters is that they have succeeded in formulating a good document; and I think that everyone is committed to it. There are practical obstacles right now, but God willing, they will be overcome. [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, the Arab League Council will hold its 101st session a few hours from now. Would you tell us about the Jordanian position on the issues on the agenda, particularly Arab national security matters and the amendment of the Arab League Charter? [Al-Majali] Approximately half a century has passed since the Arab League Charter was written. The number of member states has increased and the international scene is no longer the same. Therefore, we believe that the charter should be revised. We also believe that there is a need to revise the UN Charter, not just the Arab League's. This charter [not further specified] should take into account the changed international scene, or risk being outdated. That is one thing. Also, we believe that the Arab League should be a forum for discussing the new order in the Arab world. The Arab world should strive for more cohesion and solidarity so as to be able to avoid the type of disasters that have befallen it due to divisions in its ranks and a certain lack of communication. [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, will Jordan press for a change in the original text of the charter or does it support the view that a new addendum would suffice? [Al-Majali] Actually, I think that the charter's original text should be amended. But if the Arab brothers agree on an addendum and if that addendum is as binding as the original charter, this would be a mere technicality. What matters is the spirit in which the charter's amendment is made or the addendum formulated. [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you see the situation now, following UN Security Council Resolution 904, which denounces the Hebron massacre, and in light of the current consultations concerning providing international protection to the Palestinians? [Al-Majali] We hope that the spirit of this resolution will find practical expression. The Palestinians are in desperate need of protection, both during the negotiations and the transitional phase, the phase we hope will begin soon. We want this protection to be provided. Practical measures should be taken in this regard. There must be a clear vision on the other [Israeli] side. The Israelis must abandon the fears they had in the past. The Hebron massacre proves the absurdity of talk about the settlements remaining where they are. These settlements are bad news for peace. The United States has expressed this view hundreds of times, as did the whole world. Therefore, there must be enough boldness to take the right step and remove these settlements, because they are quite a serious obstacle. I am aware that the two sides agreed that the settlements will be discussed in a later stage of the negotiations, but it is clear that the presence of settlements and the attacks by settlers are responsible for delaying the current negotiations. [Husayn] That is right. What is happening on the Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks? [Al-Majali] The situation is this: We believe in a just and comprehensive solution and want to see progress on all tracks. At the same time, we believe that every track has its particular nature and features. As we move along, we keep an eye on what is happening on the other tracks, because it is in the interest of all sides, including the Israelis, that a comprehensive solution emerge, rather than isolated agreements. Isolated agreements would only strengthen the hand of those who oppose peace and wish to wreck what we may achieve. Therefore, I believe that we have to move forward. We hope that Israel is as serious as we are in this regard so that the peace process can advance on all tracks. [Husayn] Thank you. [Al-Majali] You are welcome.
