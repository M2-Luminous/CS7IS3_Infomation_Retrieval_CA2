Some are even equipped with garages and elevators. Shanghai, the fastest-growing city in China, has become surrounded by a batch of rich rural villages. Statistics show that more than 740 villages, a quarter of city's total, registered over one million yuan each in profits last year. The villagers grossed an average of 5,300 yuan each in annual income, five-fold the national average. The income of four million farmers in Shanghai has topped the list in the country for 13 years running, with the average per capita income reaching 2,650 yuan in 1993, compared with the national average of 921 yuan. Thanks to brisk local markets and advantages in personnel and technology, the booming township enterprises in the region have become jackpots for rural residents. Last year they achieved an output value of over 70 billion yuan, more than 70 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value in the region. Qizhong village, which tops the list of rich communities, achieved an output value of one billion yuan, and profits and taxes of 300 million yuan in 1993. Most of the farmers put house-building on top of their agenda, spending from 100,000 yuan to one million yuan. At present, the average per capita living space has exceeded 40 sq m [square meters] in rural Shanghai. The new generation of farmers also invests in cultural pursuits like travel. Zhou Yingjian, a farmer and head of a small auto repair workshop in Hongqiao town, earned 300,000 yuan last year. "My family belongs to the middle class in the village," he said. According to Shanghai's growth plan, the sales volume of township enterprises is expected to reach 100 billion yuan this year, up 20 billion yuan over 1993. It will also plant 35 percent of its 600,000 ha [hectare] of land with crops for export crops.
