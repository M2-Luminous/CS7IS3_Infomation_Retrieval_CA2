Like other banks, the BGZ, which is one of Poland's largest financial institutions, is affected by the country's current financial crisis and requires a substantial overhaul. The U.S. auditing firm of Arthur Andersen estimated that the BGZ needs 16.2 trillion zlotys [Z] for capitalization, but, at the end of 1993, the Finance Ministry allocated to the BGZ only Z4.27 trillion out of the Z21 trillion of bonds available for the transformation of banks. The remaining Z12 trillion the BGZ needs will be granted in the form of government bonds after it converts to a joint-stock company. Current BGZ losses "are being covered from the state budget, but the reccurrence of losses is due to the continued granting of preferential loans" and to unprofitable investments such as sugar mills and fruit and vegetable plants. The NIK (Supreme Chamber of Audit) reports that at least Z21 trillion was lost because of unrecoverable loans. (GAZETA BANKOWA 12 Feb 94) The losses due to these bad loans make the BGZ "unable to achieve its potential for making reserve provisions from internal funds." Making provisions for reserves in the required amounts may result in the bank's "generation of losses on the balance sheet, which cannot be covered by the bank's internal capital." In such case, additional "capital support from the State Treasury would be necessary." A condition for recapitalization of the BGZ is its conversion to a joint-stock company (rendering it BGZ SA). Once the BGZ SA is formed, the bank will be capitalized by restructuring bonds. (RZECZPOSPOLITA 26-27 Feb 94) At a 9 March conference devoted to the BGZ conversion, in which 49 BGZ branch directors participated, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak assured those present that the work on converting the BGZ into a cooperative structure is continuing. Pawlak added, however, that "unfortunately, the Finance Ministry backed out of formerly agreed-upon decisions and put a stop to the entire process"--referring to the conflict between former Finance Minister Marek Borowski and him over the dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. Despite such difficulties, Pawlak is convinced that the conversion process will be completed this year "and will employ such tested methods as those used by the French Credit Agricole." Three variants for restructuring the Food Industry Bank--as well as other cooperative banks--into a corporation bank in June of this year were presented by BGZ Deputy Director Ryszard Turpin for discussion. The first model calls for a three-tier structure and assumes that a National (Domestic) Co-op Bank will be created, and about nine to 12 regional banks with legal entity status will be formed. Turpin stated "in such a structure, the BGZ could become a national bank coordinating the activities of the entire co-op banking sector." This conversion model has the support of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the Finance Ministry, and the Union of Polish Banks (ZBP). The second model makes the BGZ the clearing and financial center specifically and only for co-op banks. The BGZ would retain a two-tier structure as a central bank and would serve its branches, which would be the regional banks functioning without the status of legal entities. In Turpin's opinion, this model "lacks strong support because it is not sufficiently refined and does not take into account the already existing regional banks, which include co-op banks such as BUG SA, GPB-Z SA, GBW SA." The third model provides for the BGZ conversion into a specialized state agricultural bank able to issue long-term loans. Alongside this proposed state bank, a national holding bank would be formed, maintaining a three-tier structure of a national holding bank, regional banks, and local-level cooperative banks. Turpin emphasized the importance of a prompt Sejm debate on the drafts of the cooperative banking system "to foster the development of co-op banking." He also said that such a draft, with a two- or three-tier structure, has already been prepared and should be submitted to the Sejm as a government or a Sejm deputy initiative." In Turpin's opinion, the first model has the best chance of passing in the Sejm. "If passed, the competences of both national and regional banks should be clearly defined, and all cooperative banks should be obligated to merge with regional branches." (RZECZPOSPOLITA 10 Mar 94) After the Sejm accepted the first model, BGZ Director Kazimierz Olesiak, nominated by Pawlak in February, expressed hope that the Sejm would employ the "accelerated legislative process" in recommending the bank's transformation strategy to complete the BGZ's conversion to a joint-stock company. Olesiak maintained that "only then will the government allocate over Z10 trillion in restructuring bonds," without which the BGZ and 1,200 other co-op banks "will not be able to serve about 30,000 organizations and people" in the agrarian economy. In Olesiak's opinion, implementation of this model could "save about 250 co-op banks from bankruptcy" and could make the BGZ the country's second-largest bank, after the Main Commerce Bank ("Panorama" newscast, TV Polonia Network 25 Mar 94).
