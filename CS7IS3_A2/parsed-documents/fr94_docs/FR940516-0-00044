FR940516-0-00044 FR940516-0-00013 h.1. Primary cells and batteries having an energy density exceeding 350 Wh/kg and rated for operation in the temperature range from below 243 K (^30 ○C) to above 343 K (70 ○C); h.2. Rechargeable cells and batteries having an energy density exceeding 150 Wh/kg after 75 charge/discharge cycles at a discharge current equal to C/5 hours (C being the nominal capacity in ampere hours) when operating in the temperature range from below 253 K (^20 ○C) to above 333 K (60 ○C); Technical Note: Energy density is obtained by multiplying the average power in watts (average voltage in volts times average current in amperes) by the duration of the discharge in hours to 75 percent of the open circuit voltage divided by the total mass of the cell (or battery) in kg. h.3. ``Space qualified'' and radiation hardened photovoltaic arrays with a specific power exceeding 160 W/m 2 at an operating temperature of 301 K (28 ○C) under a tungsten illumination of 1 kW/m 2 at 2,800 K (2,527 ○C); i. ``Superconductive'' electromagnets or solenoids specially designed to be fully charged or discharged in less than one minute, not controlled by 3A01, having all of the following: Note: 3A92.i does not control ``superconductive'' electromagnets or solenoids designed for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) medical equipment. i.1. Maximum energy delivered during the discharge divided by the duration of the discharge of more than 500 kJ per minute; i.2. Inner diameter of the current carrying windings of more than 250 mm; and i.3. Rated for a magnetic induction of more than 8 T or ``overall current density'' in the winding of more than 300 A/mm 2 . 31.
