S. assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, has visited Pakistan include such important points as political and economic restrictions, the sensitive situation of the Kashmir issue, Pakistan's role in it, nuclear policy, and China's supply of missiles to Pakistan. All of these were included to give the impression that newly elected government under the leadership of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will be able to take care of this pressure. It was also hinted that the present tension between the United States and Pakistan may not end. By the end of the U. S. assistant secretary's trip, and until her last speech, many incidents surfaced; however, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto demonstrated a high level of political savvy and did not compromise our national interests and policies in any agreements. Instead, she presented the interests of the people of Pakistan in a better light. One proof of this is the request to review the Pressler Amendment and reinstate economic and military aid to Pakistan. It is a fact that the United States has always considered Kashmir a contested issue. However, in the present situation, the way it has mentioned it openly and has hinted about negotiations between India and Pakistan, as well as hinting to Pakistan that it review its peaceful nuclear program, the United States will not only resolve the Kashmir issue, but will also create a positive atmosphere for reinstating economic and military aid. The United States will also give political support at the international level. In this context, the United States has declared the presence of nuclear weapons in this region a danger to world peace. It was also announced that if Pakistan stopped its nuclear program, the United States would then also pressure India to do so. The fact is that this strategy is being used just to make Pakistan stop its peaceful nuclear program, because India is not willing to review its nuclear program at all. It has not accepted any restrictions or expressed any willingness to sign an international pact. The whole world knows that India's nuclear power is far ahead of Pakistan's peaceful atomic program. India is working continuously for its military use, and it also has a large number of atomic bombs. In contrast, Pakistan wants to use its program just to alleviate its energy problem. However, international propaganda is against it. A specific international lobby is propagating that Pakistan's program is for military goals, even though the Pakistani government has denied it repeatedly. It has declared its intention to participate in any agreement for establishing peace in the subcontinent in which India is also involved. In this context, Pakistan has also hinted at its willingness to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]; however, India has opposed such an agreement because of its malicious designs. It does not support any plan that could result in peace in this region. The recent visit by the U. S. assistant secretary was part of the effort to pressure Pakistan again; however, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto refused to accept any pressure in this context. She instead welcomed any concrete efforts to stop nuclear proliferation in south Asia. This was also reflected in the U. S. assistant secretary's statement, in which she clearly said, "Pakistan has presented its stand about its national security, which will not change until India changes its attitude." The Pakistan People's Party's [PPP] president and Pakistan's prime minister have always taken a principled stand, according to patriotic feelings. The U. S. assistant secretary expressed her feelings in her statement. However, it is unfortunate that our opposition leader, who, until yesterday, talked about a third option for Kashmir, hinted about rolling back the nuclear program, and has opposed the idea of negotiations with India, is talking about starting a "campaign" over the Kashmir issue and the nuclear program. This is a character flaw, and the people see and understand everything. A decision about it will be made in the people's court in the future. The fact is that the PPP and its leader, Madam Benazir Bhutto, have never made a decision that has been detrimental to national security, and they never will.
