Before choosing between these two options, which is already being negotiated in Washington, Chile must commit itself to improving its intellectual property system, among other things. This probably involves one of the most complex issues of Chilean legislature, affecting thousands of people. For the time being, nothing has been decided on the changes that must be made. The studies that are being made center on a TLC chapter referring specifically to intellectual property and the negotiations that Chilean officials have been conducting with the White House. No matter what is decided, intellectual property is an important issue that must be studied. Mexico is well aware of this, as when it negotiated its entrance in NAFTA last year this was one of the issues that raised the most difficulties. The issue that will cause the most difficulties is probably that of medicine patents. Chile was the first Latin American country to implement regulation for the protection of pharmaceutical inventions. This will be the "letter of presentation" for achieving a treaty. The United States is, however, demanding from its commercial partners regulations that are rejected by some local sectors. One of the issues to be amended in the current legislation refers to the period of time during which a patent holder is granted a monopoly to exploit one product. The TLC establishes that the duration of this monopoly must be 20 years from the time the patent is requested. In Chile this period lasts for only 15 years from the time the patent is granted. The Economy Ministry has explained, however, that this issue should not raise many problems, because in practice the proceedings involved for the issuance of a patent may take up to 2 or 3 years. This means that in Chile a patent may last for up to 18 years from the time it is requested. There are problems concerning the second issue that should be amended in Chilean legislation in view of the TLC. It concerns the recognition of patents granted abroad before the Chilean regulation was enforced. When the patent law was approved in 1991, it was explained that it was not applicable to existing medication because one of the requirements for requesting a patent is that it should be an innovation at the international level. This article is precisely the one the United States wants changed. The Association of Pharmaceutical Industries and Laboratories (Asilfa) is opposed to this possibility. Asilfa Chairman Miriam Orellana said that such an amendment would erase from the market a large percentage of inexpensive medicines, which would affect consumers. To justify her argument she cites the case of Mexico, which in 1991 had to accept a clause retroactive to 1987. Orellana said: "Prices experienced a considerable increase, and the promises of greater foreign investment fell through when many companies shut down their local factories because imported products were preferred." However, it is not only a question of drafting amendments. There is no Chilean legislation on some of the issues demanded by the TLC, and we will be compelled to make commitments during the negotiations. Experts say that there are many technical details that must be studied. Among them is the industrial secrets issue, which in the United States is controlled by extensive and strict regulation. It deals with any technical knowledge of important value to a company and which that company does not want revealed. [passage omitted] In Chile some laws state that an employee cannot divulge confidential information of the company he works for, but we must draft legislation that includes stricter measures on company secrets. Another issue absent from Chilean legislation is that concerning integrated circuits. The United States asks for special legislation covering integrated circuit designs that currently allow the operation of any electronic device. Integrated circuits are not included in the law because the current level of national technology does not allow a true incursion into this field. It is obvious, however, that for more developed countries these constitute a major business. Beyond any conflicts of interest that may arise, most people believe that any amendments to the legislation should aim at decreasing the piracy of legally patented works. [passage omitted] Many believe that the secret lies in officials not discussing issues separately, but as a package. The idea is that although we have to yield on some issues, in others we can make Chilean interests prevail.
