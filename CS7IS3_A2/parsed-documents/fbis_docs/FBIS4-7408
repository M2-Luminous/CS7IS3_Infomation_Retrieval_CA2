However, North Korea has not allowed essential inspection activities. Thus, the IAEA decided to temporarily withhold dispatching the inspection team. David Kyd, director of IAEA Information Department, said that the IAEA, when accepting the North Korean proposal concerning the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, demanded that North Korea allow essential inspection activities, and requested the issuance of visas for two inspectors to be dispatched as advance team members. Director Kyd said that the IAEA urged North Korea to allow essential inspection activities pertaining to the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. He stressed that as long as North Korea does not show a change in its basic position, the dispatch of the inspection team will be withheld. Director Kyd said, however, that if North Korea flexibly accepts the IAEA proposal by Thursday [28 April], the IAEA would consider dispatching an inspection team on Thursday.
