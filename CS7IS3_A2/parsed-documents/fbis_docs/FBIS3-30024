This is the topic of a NODONG SINMUN commentary today. The inspection agreed on recently is not routine or ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement but, to all intends [as received] and purposes, an inspection for ensuring the continuity of safeguards, the analyst says, and continues: The DPRK and the IAEA could reach an agreement because the United States and the IAEA voluntarily withdrew their demand that the DPRK accept routine and ad hoc inspections and promised to make an inspection only for the continuity of safeguards. As we have reached an agreement with the IAEA, we are willing to accept such an inspection and welcome an inspection group of the IAEA. Whether the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards is made at an early date or not depends on the United States, not on the DPRK. If the inspection is to be made soon, an agreement on follow-up steps for simultaneous actions must be reached as the DPRK and the United States promised. Such steps must include an inspection of the DPRK for the continuity of safeguards and, at the same time, an official proclamation by the United States of the suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises in 1994 and the joint publication of the date of the third-stage talks by the DPRK and the United States. So, it is unfair that one side ought to take an action first according to the promise, while the other side can take no action, breaking the promise. The problem cannot be resolved in this way. It is a decisive moment in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and making a positive progress in improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. It is evident that if the United States throw a snag in the way of reaching an agreement on steps for simultaneous actions or resort to pressure, the agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA cannot be implemented. Some quarters of the United States, however, are arguing that only when the North and the South exchanged special envoys and the IAEA's inspection was fully made, is it possible to stop the "Team Spirit" and hold the third-stage talks. It is attributable to this unreasonable position of the U.S., not to ours, that though the DPRK and IAEA agreed on the inspection for the continuity of safeguards, it has not been carried into effect. Only when the United States show in action the fulfilment of its responsibility and obligation, will the inspection for the continuity of safeguards be made at the same time.
