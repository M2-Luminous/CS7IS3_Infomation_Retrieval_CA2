It is worse than the killing fields. It is slaughter that is comparable, in terms of the number of victims and the manner in which they are being murdered, with that which took place in Cambodia. It is different than and occurring on a larger scale than what I saw in Somalia, Sudan, and Bosnia." This was the reaction of an indignant Development Aid Minister Pronk in Nairobi on Sunday [15 May] evening, following a short visit to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, where heavy fighting took place on Sunday. [passage omitted] According to Pronk, most of the murders are being committed by government troops. The rebels belonging to the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) are also killing out of revenge, "but unlike the government militia they are not making themselves guilty of systematic, preplanned genocide," Pronk said. "After the attack on the presidents, the entire opposition was eradicated in a single night. And the carnage is still continuing." In the meantime, 400,000 Rwandans have fled to other countries. According to Pronk, in the country itself between 1.5 and 2 million people have fled for their lives. Of this total number of refugees, 1.2 million are located in the south. "That is the least fertile part of the country, and it is the area that has suffered the greatest drought. The government troops are in charge there. It is becoming a major disaster. In the north, the situation is quieter. Aid organizations have already been able to achieve a great deal there and are negotiating with the RPF," Pronk continued. Pronk emphasized that a maximum amount of aid must be provided as soon as possible: "An airlift must be organized because a great deal of food has to be shipped to Rwanda. And hopefully the United Nations will be able to send a force of 5,500 men there. Everyone from the United Nations here says that it is the minimum. I hope that the United States takes the initiative to organize the airlift, for it is U.S. troops who have the greatest capacity to do so. [passage omitted] Apart from the airlift, a cease-fire must be achieved in the near future. "However, the RPF no longer wants to talk with the government, but rather with the military. Yet they only want to talk if the government is present. So an impasse has been created. And I fear that the murdering will go on, because nobody has any hold on the militia," Pronk concluded.
