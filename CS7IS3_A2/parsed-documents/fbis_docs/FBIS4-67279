Ma made the statement while meeting with a delegation from the G-7 Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a group of regulators set up in 1989 by the Group of Seven industrial countries to fight cross-border financial crime. Many industrial countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Australia, Italy, Holland, and Luxembourg, have passed legislation outlawing money laundering. Ma said the Ministry of Justice will start to draft regulations soon in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of China to prevent laundering of criminal money from drug and other illegal dealings. "The legislation is needed as Taiwan is playing an increasingly important role in global trade and financial exchanges," Ma noted. Under the draft regulations, Taiwan will require banks to report suspicious transactions to government authorities. The draft bill is expected to be completed by the end of this year, Ma said. The FATF delegation, headed by John Gieve, British undersecretary of treasury, said the Paris-based organization initiated in the 1988 G-7 economic summit would provide counseling services for Taiwan to pass legislation against money laundering. The group, composed of experts from America, Japan and Britain, arrived in Taipei Sunday to check Taiwan's progress in the fight against money laundering. They will depart Wednesday.
