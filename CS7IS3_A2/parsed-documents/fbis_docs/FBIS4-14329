The step had been approved by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the defense establishment. The bodyguards received personal handguns, which had been purchased by Palestinians after receiving special Israeli approval. The decision to approve the employment of armed bodyguards was made in the wake of an explicit Palestinian request. In discussions with senior IDF officers, senior Fatah officials explained they had to protect themselves against assassination attempts by peace-opposing organizations. The defense establishment's approval was granted on the strict condition that the bodyguards should only fire for protection and that they would not exhibit their weapons in public. The bodyguards have been issued appropriate permits. It should be noted that before the handguns were handed to the bodyguards, they were registered and ballistically tested.
