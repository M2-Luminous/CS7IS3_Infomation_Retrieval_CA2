The agenda of the Thai side is clear: of the US$2.3 billion worth of two-way trade in 1993, Thailand suffered a US$1.2 billion deficit and this deficit is expanding as a result of growing Thai imports of South Korean automobiles. So one of the key missions of the Thai delegation is to negotiate for larger South Korean imports of Thai products. "For a country that now ranks as the eighth or ninth largest trading partner of Thailand, the level of knowledge and interest in South Korea from the Thai side has been minuscule," said a senior Thai diplomat based in Seoul. Unlike the deep-rooted relations between Thailand and other major diplomatic and trading partners in Northeast Asia, such as Japan and China, there has been far fewer exchanges between businesses and educational institutes in Thailand and South Korea. As such, Thailand knows or understands little about South Korea. The Thai side is not to be blamed entirely, however. It took four years for the South Korean side to hold what was supposed to be an annual, rotational meeting of the two countries' trade ministers. Following numerous delays, the meeting was finally held in Seoul last August and it is Thailand's turn to host the meeting this year. All this could change for the better as a result of Mr. Chuan's visit. The prime minister brings with him about 10 ministers responsible mainly for trade and investment plus a small delegation of Thai businessmen. "The visit underscores Bangkok's recognition of South Korea as an important trading partner," said Surachai Sirikrai, director of Thammasat University's Institute of East Asian Studies. "This should pave the way for more Korean investors to set up business here instead of in Indonesia, which is one way of easing the trade imbalance," he added. In ASEAN, Indonesia has been preferred by South Korean investors partly because of its abundant natural resources and partly because they want to avoid stiff competition with Japanese businesses that are already well-established in Thailand. Outside ASEAN, major South Korean corporations such as Hyundai, Daewoo and Ssang Yong are actively investing in Indochina, especially Vietnam, where they enjoy the same head start as other foreign investors and even a competitive edge over the Japanese. The Thai emphasis on expanding economic ties will certainly appeal to South Korean leaders, who are not only intent on improving bilateral relations with Thailand but also on grander schemes. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam made clear in an interview with the Bangkok Post that he wanted Thailand to serve as a base for South Korean businesses venturing into Indochina and Burma. He also held out hope for the dynamic economies of both countries to work jointly in leading economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Judging from those statements, it is clear that Seoul is adopting a foreign-policy strategy similar to the Japanese as far as its relationship with Thailand is concerned. Former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, during his Bangkok visit in January 1993, also proposed a Japanese-Thai partnership to undertake the task of helping to rehabilitate the Indochinese economies. In sum, Seoul is placing a greater emphasis on both economic and diplomatic relations with ASEAN. And just as South Korea sees itself as the centre of Northeast Asia, it also regards Thailand as its strategic partner in ASEAN. Seoul also sees itself playing an important role within the broader framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. South Korea is chairman of APEC's Trade and Investment Committee, which is one of the few institutionalised bodies in the regional grouping. "As a dialogue partner of ASEAN on one side, and enjoying close economic linkages with North America on the other, we want to serve as the bridge between AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) and NAFTA (North American Free Trade Area)," said Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Choi Dong-chin. The US is South Korea's biggest trading partner, taking one-third of its exports. Though ASEAN ranks fourth in terms of trade, it is South Korea's second-largest investment partner after the European Union. Economic issues aside, the Thai and South Korean leaders will discuss measures to enhance cooperation on regional security. In fact, security matters are topmost on the minds of the South Koreans. This is hardly surprising in light of the South's preoccupation with the North's suspected nuclear weapons development programme. Asked what specific issues he would raise for discussion with Mr. Chuan, President Kim responded: "First of all, we will focus our attention on how our two countries should pull together to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which is threatening the security of not only this region but also of the entire world..." As part of its diplomatic lobbying for international backing to force North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons programme, Seoul intends to solicit Thailand's support for sanctions against Pyongyang. Bangkok has all along maintained a low-key stance on the Korean nuclear conflict, apparently preferring to leave the issue to the major global powers to resolve. But the Thai Government is on record as saying that it would go along with any sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council. However, the prospect of imminent sanctions has now been momentarily blunted by North Korean leader Kim Il-song's pledge to freeze the North's nuclear programme plus his offer to hold the first-ever summit meeting with his southern counterpart. These messages were conveyed to former US president Jimmy Carter during his recent visit to Pyongyang. Nonetheless, measures to resolve the nuclear dispute on the Korean peninsula will still feature highly in talks between the Seoul leaders and Mr. Chuan. The South Koreans are attaching much importance to next month's meeting in Bangkok of the ASEAN Regional Forum. The last thing they want is to fight another Korean War with the North. Hence they are placing high hopes on the forum to evolve into a venue for addressing vital regional security matters such as arms control and preventive diplomacy. "We'd like to actively participate in the Southeast Asian security forum," said Assistant Minister Choi. "We want to defuse potential conflict and promote confidence-building measures." In the final analysis, Seoul wants to develop an economic and diplomatic partnership with Thailand so that both countries can help promote growth and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Given such high expectations, South Korean officials say Mr. Chuan's visit will be more than just a goodwill trip.
