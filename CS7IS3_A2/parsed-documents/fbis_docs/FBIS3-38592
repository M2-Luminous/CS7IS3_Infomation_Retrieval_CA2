The budget situation left no scope for this. Rexrodt and the steel managers agreed that further capacity reductions "are possible only within the framework of an agreed upon, Europe-wide program." Moreover, close attention will have to be paid to the proper use of the subsidies for the steel industry in all EU countries, Rexrodt said. The EU subsidies could not be used to acquire new shares of the market. The crisis meeting was called by Rexrodt. The steel sector was represented by the executive boards of the steel concerns and German Steel Federation President Ruprecht Vondran.
