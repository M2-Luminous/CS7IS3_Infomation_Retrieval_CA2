Shiphiwo Mogoda asked Mr. De Klerk for his thoughts on the televised debate which was held last week? [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I feel that overall the debate was good for South Africa. It had two sides; the one side was the party political side, and I feel that the National Party's cause has firstly not been harmed by the debate, I think it has been advanced by the debate. But it had another side, which was also important, and that is that the two leaders of the two biggest parties in South Africa were seen by all South Africans and the whole world as being able to debate in a civilized manner, and when it came to the interests of the country, that they will be capable of rising above their differences and working together in a government of national unity in the best interests of all the people. [Mogoda] Mr. President, what has caused you to cry, or let me put is this way, to laugh, if necessary, in all these things that have happened during your rule? [De Klerk] What makes me happy, what makes me buoyant, is my confidence in the future, is the achievement of what I have set out to achieve -- the achievement of free and fair elections for all South Africans, the achievement of a new South Africa being born, which I worked for from the very moment when I was elected as leader of the National Party. I am thankful that I was able -- and I am not saying this in a holier than thou attitude -- to really keep all the promises that I made. Originally people said talk is cheap, but money buys the whisky: Is he really going to do it? Is the National Party really going to do all these things that it has set out to do? And we've done it! What makes me cry is the violence. It is the one thing which I would have liked to see different. I sincerely believed that when we reached agreements, when a new constitution was agreed upon, when we focused all South Africans on participation in the election, that the political violence would abate and would come to an end. Maybe the lack of inclusivity, with Inkatha standing out until so recently, was one of the main causes why it didn't stop or abate. But now they are in and I am praying everyday that that will now make a big contribution to really bringing the tension and the violence and the confrontation to an end. [Mogoda] President, what do you think is the most exciting thing about you since you entered politics? What I mean is that, what do you like most about yourself since you entered politics? [De Klerk] I am not a vain man. That is the most difficult question I've had in this whole election campaign to answer. Let me rather say, what do I like most about that which I represent in politics? I like the commitment of my party, the honesty of my party, the courage which my party had to also admit mistakes and to change that which was wrong. I am proud of the way in which my party has changed and has become a party for all the people of South Africa, representing all the population groups, the most nonracial party participating in this election. [Mogoda] You refer to your new National Party as somewhat an overhauled party. It's not an old one. Now, are you maybe trying to convince people that a leopard can change its spots? [De Klerk] Yes. I think it is a very shallow saying that a leopard can't change its spots, because we are not dealing with the skin. We are dealing with the heart, and too much emphasis is being put on skin and color in South Africa. What is in your heart is what counts; it is warmth, it is caring for the needs of the people, it is that you have succeeded to remove racism from your pattern of thinking. Yes, we have a new heart in the National Party. [Mogoda] Well, another question. Some of your opponents, I would say, have accused you of having intervened to stop your son from marrying a colored girl in Cape Town sometime. I have never heard you commenting on this. Now is your time. [De Klerk] I have at all times with regard to that taken the viewpoint that my son is an adult. He must make a choice, and I have no color prejudice in my mind. I am not a racist. Parents are concerned about whether the choice of a son or a daughter is the right one. In this case my son's decision not to marry was his own. [Mogoda] Well, Mr. President, there have also been reports that a number of white people are stockpiling for fear of the aftermath of elections. What does this indicate to you? [De Klerk] I think many of them have fallen prey to media reports and speculations which gave rise to a little bit of panic. I don't share the analysis that we will have vast disruptions after the election. I think we will have some festivity. Some parties might be very quiet and licking their wounds, but generally speaking I think apart from the festivities we will return very soon to normal. The public is tired of politics. They want a little bit of relaxation again on their television screens. They don't want to be inundated with political propaganda all the time, and I think the whole country is really looking forward to get the election behind us now so that we can resume our ordinary normal lives and really, I see no cause for grave concern.
