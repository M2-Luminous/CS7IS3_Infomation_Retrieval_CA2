This is proposed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate Coalition Party) in an open letter addressed to opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson. In the letter Bildt writes that he warmly welcomes the clear decision on the question of EU membership reached at the Social Democratic Party congress at the weekend. But the prime minister also writes that he was "very surprised by the message from the congress that the lid must now be put on the Europe debate until after the election campaign." Carl Bildt argues that the government that is elected in September will represent Sweden in important negotiations on the EU's future, provided that the referendum says yes to the EU. The prime minister therefore takes the view that it is "our democratic duty to make clear to the voters before the election in September along what lines we want Europe cooperation to develop after November." Therefore Carl Bildt proposed a discussion in early August. Yesterday the letter did not raise pulse rates in the Social Democratic camp. "If Carl Bildt had listened more carefully to what was said at our congress he would not have needed to write this letter," said Laila Edholm of the Social Democrats' press service. She gave assurances that the Social Democrats have not put the lid on the EU debate, but that the actual campaign will naturally be intensified after the election. Ingvar Carlsson is currently on holiday and the invitation to a public debate will therefore have to wait until he comes back to work in mid-July.
