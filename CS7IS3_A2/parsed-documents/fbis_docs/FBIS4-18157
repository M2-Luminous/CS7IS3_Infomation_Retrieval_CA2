In Helsinki on Saturday [12 March], Andersson asserted that the country's striving for freedom from alliances had been mentioned when Finland first applied for EU membership. "An attempt has been made to conceal the freedom from alliances [doctrine] in order not to jeopardize the membership talks," he said. According to Andersson, the strengthening of Russian troops on Finland's eastern border is partly because Russia is preparing against a change in Finnish security policy in the event Finland becomes an EU member and that organization develops its own defense policy cooperation.
