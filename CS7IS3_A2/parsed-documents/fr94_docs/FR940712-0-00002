FR940712-0-00002 FR940712-0-00001 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 50 Regulation of Advanced Nuclear Power Plants; Statement of Policy AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final Policy Statement. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to improve the licensing environment for advanced nuclear power reactors to minimize complexity and uncertainty in the regulatory process. This statement gives the Commission's policy regarding the review of, and desired characteristics associated with, advanced reactors. This policy statement is a revision of the final policy statement titled ``Regulation of Advanced Nuclear Power Plants, Statement of Policy'' that was published on July 8, 1986. The purpose of this revision is to update the Commission's policy statement on advanced reactors to reference the Commission's metrication policy. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen P. Sands, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone: 301&hyph;504&hyph;3154. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 8, 1986 (51 FR 24643), the Commission published its final policy statement on advanced reactors in the Federal Register . The Commission's primary objectives in issuing the advanced reactor policy statement were threefold: •First, to maintain the earliest possible interaction of applicants, vendors, and government agencies, with the NRC; •Second, to provide all interested parties, including the public, with the Commission's views concerning the desired characteristics of advanced reactor designs; and •Third, to express the Commission's intent to issue timely comment on the implications of such designs for safety and the regulatory process. On August 10, 1988, Congress passed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act [the Act], (19 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. ), which amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, (15 U.S.C. 205a et seq. ). Section 5164 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 205a) designates the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce. In an effort to effect an orderly change to the metric system, the Act requires that all Federal agencies convert to the metric system of measurement in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end of fiscal year 1992, ``except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units,'' Section 5614(b)(2). In response to the Act, the NRC published its metrication policy statement for comment in the Federal Register on February 10, 1992 (57 FR 4891). The purpose of the metrication policy statement was to inform NRC licensees and the public how the Commission intended to meet its obligations under the Act. Comments on the draft statement were submitted by 12 responders, including 5 power reactor licensees, 3 standards organizations, a reactor vendor, a materials licensee, the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, and a joint letter submitted by three individuals. All commenters supported the Commission's position and the final policy statement was published on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46202). The Commission supports and encourages the use of the metric system of measurement by NRC licensees and applicants. However, Commission experience to date in design certification reviews is that it is impracticable and uneconomical to convert a design to the metric system late in the design process and that applicants should consider metrication early in the design process. Therefore, the Commission is revising the advanced reactor policy statement to incorporate its policy on metrication to encourage licensees and license applicants to employ the metric system of measurement wherever and whenever its use is not potentially detrimental to the public health and safety or is not economically impracticable. Commission Policy Consistent with its legislative mandate, the Commission's policy with respect to regulating nuclear power reactors is to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety and the environment. Regarding advanced reactors, the Commission expects, as a minimum, at least the same degree of protection of the public and the environment that is required for current-generation light water reactors. Furthermore, the Commission expects that advanced reactors will provide enhanced margins of safety and/or utilize simplified, inherent, passive, or other innovative means to accomplish their safety functions. The Commission also expects that advanced reactor designs will comply with the Commission's safety goal policy statement and the policy statement on conversion to the metric system. Among the attributes that could assist in establishing the acceptability or licensability of a proposed advanced reactor design, and that therefore should be considered in advanced designs, are:
