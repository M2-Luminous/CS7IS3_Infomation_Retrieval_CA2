The session is being held after the date stipulated in the National Assembly law, because there were certain urgent, significant tasks that we had to settle during the period that the session was expected to be convened. Our session is now being held in an atmosphere in which the international and regional situations have continued to develop in the manner which is both favorable and unfavorable to the implementation of the two strategic tasks and the restructuring line of our party and state. As the situations have developed, various hostile powers have not abandoned their intentions of effecting change through peaceful means and interfering in the internal affairs of various countries with a view to turning the entire world into their orbit. The tension and conflicts between peoples of different nationalities, origins, and religions in certain countries and regions have continued. Various nations, particularly developing and underdeveloped ones, have made great efforts in struggling to safeguard political independence while developing their economies and societies to raise their standard of living. In Southeast Asia, the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation among various countries has become ever more evident, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of our country. Our ordinary session on this occasion is also being held in a joyous atmosphere in which our entire party, army, and people have been striving and won initial satisfactory achievements in realizing the sixth and seventh resolutions of the fifth Central Committee, the socioeconomic development plan, and the state budget plan for 1993-94 as endorsed by the Third National Assembly in its second ordinary session. Our National Assembly has also promoted and expanded its role, which are thus beneficial to the implementation of the constitution and various laws. Members of the National Assembly in each constituency also have promoted and expanded their roles. They have visited the people of all strata in each region regularly to encourage them and to inspect, follow up, and boost implementation of the socioeconomic development plan, state budget, and various regulations and laws at the local level. They have also given attention to the petitions, views, and problems presented by the people and brought them to the attention of local party and administrative committees for joint discussion and settlement. Through the National Assembly members, the people have come to clearly understand the roles and duties of the deputies who represent the people and have worked for their interests and rights to mastery. In each area the people have felt comfortable in earning their living and been confident in their future and our popular democratic system. Along with these favorable conditions and achievements won by our people, we should frankly accept the fact that our nation and people still face many difficulties and complicated problems in carrying out socioeconomic development work and improving their living conditions. It is, therefore, required that we take appropriate measures to settle those difficulties and problems step by step. To meet the requirements of state and social management, the Third National Assembly has endorsed the Constitution and a number of laws. Following the enforcement of the Constitution and laws, the state and society have been managed more effectively. Steps have been taken to manage the state and society through the implementation of the laws. Our country's socioeconomic foundation has developed and prospered. The requirements of national development have increased daily. Economic relations and cooperation with foreign countries have been also enhanced. It is, therefore, required that we reconsider, improve, and perfect certain laws which have been already enacted in order to make them conform to today's practical conditions. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to study and implement more laws to perfect our state and social management apparatuses. Based on the said requirements, in this session, we will discuss and endorse the amendment of the labor law and the law on the promotion and management of foreign investments in the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The reason why we must urgently improve the two said laws is that the law on the promotion and management of foreign investments in the LPDR was put into effect before the enforcement of the constitution. As for the labor law, it is consisted of certain provisions which run counter to the constitution. It, therefore, needs to be readjusted so as to be in conformity with the constitution as well as the practical conditions on the socioeconomic development. The amendment of the aforesaid two laws is part of the amendment of various laws that will be done in the subsequent sessions. After having the laws, the important point is organizing their implementation. Their implementation is considered to be a factor in determining the success and the efficiency of the enforced laws. In the past, we are of the view that law enforcement has also done its best in performing its duties. But, as the socioeconomic foundation has been increasingly expanded and the number of state and social management apparatuses has increased, the political quality of various law enforcement organizations must be raised in order to guarantee an ever more effective implementation of the laws. In addition, the tenure of these organizations as stipulated in the constitution has come to an end. In this session, it is, therefore, imperative for us to elect the chairman of the Supreme People's Court and the chief public prosecutor. We will also have to discuss the internal regulations of the National Assembly in order to make the organizational system of the National Assembly to become ever firmer and stronger so as to enable it to continue to efficiently implement its normal roles. We will also review experiences scored by our National Assembly in carrying out activities since the second ordinary session. Distinguished assembly members, our ordinary session on this occasion is very significant, because contents of the issues that we will discuss and endorse in this session are related to the implementation of our party's restructuring line. They are also related to the raising the quality of this National Assembly. For this reason, it is required that all National Assembly members heighten their political responsibility. As representatives who have worked for the interests and rights to mastery of the people, we should comprehensively, profoundly, and thoroughly look at the problems and then contribute views to the session in a straightforward manner to successfully fulfill the objectives and expectations in making decisions on and endorsing the various significant issues that will be brought to the session for consideration. In this arousing and joyous atmosphere, as chairman of the session, I now would like to announce the third ordinary session of the Third National Assembly be officially opened. Thank you. [applause]
