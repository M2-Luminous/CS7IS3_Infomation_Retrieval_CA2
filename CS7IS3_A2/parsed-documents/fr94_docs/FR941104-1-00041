FR941104-1-00041 FR941104-1-00008 The Guam trade is unique in that the trade is a very small portion of the carriers' overall service. However, whether the current method of allocation is appropriate in such a case need not be decided here, because the two carriers serving Guam, APL and Sea-Land Service, Inc., currently file most, if not all, of their rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Neither carrier files full financial reports under 46 CFR Part 552. In the event an FMC-regulated carrier initiates such a service in the future, the Commission will address the need for any change in 46 CFR Part 552 in a separate rulemaking proceeding. Paragraph (d) was eliminated because the Commission did not want such determinations to be made on an ad hoc basis during a rate investigation. It is essential that significant issues relating to the underlying methodology to be employed in determining the reasonableness of rates be settled prior to any rate investigation. The 180-day limit specified by section 3 of the Shipping Act, 1933, 46 U.S.C. app. 845, cannot be met if parties are permitted to change methodologies during the course of a rate case. Moreover, it is unfair; parties to a rate proceeding are entitled to rely on the Commission's rules. They should not have to respond to ever-changing methodologies proposed by other parties. It is understandable that APL is concerned that the Commission's decision here may affect the outcome in Docket No. 89&hyph;26. However, any changes that may be made to Part 552 as a result of this proceeding will only be applied prospectively. They will have no application in pending cases such as Docket No. 89&hyph;26. Conclusion The Commission will permit reply comments to be filed by any interested person, not only those that commented on the proposed rule. Those parties who filed comments are on the attached list. All previous commenters are directed to provide copies of their comments to anyone upon request, so as to facilitate timely comments. Copies of comments are also available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Office of the Secretary. Pursuant to Commission Rule 53, 46 CFR 502.53, parties shall serve reply comments on initial round participants. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary. Robert T. Basseches, David B.
