Alarcon and other ANPP leaders participated in a three-day visit to the province, along with seven of its work commissions, to inspect preparations for the forthcoming report the province will render to the ANPP. [Begin Alarcon recording] [Words indistinct] I must stress that beyond a doubt, if we seek that part of Cuba where the roots, heart, and struggle of the fatherland have been alive for over 120 years, we must immediately think of the Cuban region we today call Granma Province. Here one finds many people aware of the progress report process, aware of what is being done in this regard. It is a stimulus, something that helps boost the tasks conducted by the provincial organizations, things they were doing anyhow. This process, however, helps to give a certain impetus to the entire collective effort. [end recording] The ANPP presidency stressed the fact that in Granma, over 500 low-cost houses have been built of a semester plan for 1,000, and the fact that the province has confirmed it will fulfill its current sugar production plan.
