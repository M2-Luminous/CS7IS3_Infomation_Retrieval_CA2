The policemen had boarded the iron-hulled ship while it was trying to escape from their two Makung-based police cutters, but discovered the crew barricaded behind a locked cabin door, which they tried without success to break down. After a two-hour stand-off, they were forced to jump into the sea when the mainland vessel made a drastic turn to the west and sped up to enter the territorial waters of Mainland China. All six were immediately picked up by the trailing police boats. By jumping off the smuggling boat, the policemen prevented a rerun of a similar incident two years ago in which a mainland iron- hulled vessel kidnapped a Taiwan patrol guard when the guard boarded the mainland vessel to arrest the crew for smuggling. The guard was repatriated to Taiwan a couple of weeks later after bargaining between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the two semi-official organizations edicated to the promotion of civilian exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland.
