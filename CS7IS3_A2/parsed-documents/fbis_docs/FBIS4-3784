[passage omitted] While touching on how to explore ways to promote Inner Mongolia region's economic development and to resolve financial difficulties, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: The broad masses of cadres have created many good ways and methods in the course of practice, playing an exemplary role in promoting great development in all localities across the region. He stressed: In developing agriculture and animal husbandry, it is necessary to resolutely manage things in line with the market economic law, serve the market, readjust the structure in line with local conditions, and actively develop good quality grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar, fruits, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, and other brand-name, special, and quality products. After analyzing the present situation and potential for developing Inner Mongolia's agricultural and animal husbandry, Comrade Wang Qun said: Agriculture and animal husbandry are our region's basic industries and the best and most important industries among all. In agriculture and animal husbandry, we should seek extraordinary development and advance by leaps and bounds. This conforms to the policy stressed repeatedly by the party Central Committee on stabilizing and promoting agriculture and is the fundamental way for making the people rich and the banners and counties prosperous, as well as the reliable guarantee for resolving financial difficulties. Our region is rich in land resources with great potential for development. We still have 30 million mu of cultivated land awaiting development. The existing cultivated lands and the unreclaimed lands all have great potentials for increasing production. Our region has 1.35 billion mu of grassland, but each mu of grassland can only produce one jin of meat, showing that the potential for development is very great. Our region has a very good foundation for agricultural and animal husbandry development and high quality scientific and technical workers and managerial personnel. With these land and water resources, as well as the technology and labor forces, it is absolutely possible for us to realize an extraordinary development in agriculture and animal husbandry. [passage omitted] In studying ways to resolve the current financial difficulties along with grass-roots cadres, Comrade Wang Qun believed that the financial issue is actually an economic development issue. It is necessary to resolve it by using the new ideas of reform and development and by broadening the sources of income and reducing expenditures. [passage omitted] On the issue of strengthening tax revenue collection and management, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: At present, the masses of cadres at all levels, the party and government organs at all levels, and the tax departments should strengthen propaganda on the new tax system, make the broad masses of cadres clearly understand the new tax system of our country and the relevant stipulations of the autonomous region, and strengthen the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm in tax revenue collection and management. Government leaders at all levels should personally attend to tax revenue and successfully carry out tax collection and management. It is necessary to increase the number of temporary tax collectors in an effort to strengthen the tax collection force and to guarantee that all sorts of taxes are collected in full and in a timely manner. Comrade Wang Qun also put forward specific demands on maintaining stability, doing a good job in pricing, nationalities, and religious work, and strengthening party building and spiritual civilization. He expressed hope that party committees and governments at all levels and all party leading cadres at all levels would always keep a sober mind, carry out these aspects of work in a down-to-earth manner, and further consolidate and develop a political situation of stability and unity in Inner Mongolia.
