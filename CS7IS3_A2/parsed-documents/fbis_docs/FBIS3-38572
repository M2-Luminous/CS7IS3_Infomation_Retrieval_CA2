In his letter to the board containing provisional yearly results, Agnelli said after-tax losses may reach 1.75 trillion lire, more than 1 billion dollars, although the parent holding company, Fiat SpA, will show profits of between 50 and 100 billion lire (between 29 and 58 million dollars), far less than the 507 billion lire of profits reported the previous year. The global slump in car sales, which saw 24 percent fewer vehicles sold in Italy in 1993, has brought the Fiat group its first negative results since it began publishing consolidated reports in 1979. The group in 1993 launched the largest rights issue ever made in Italy and almost doubled its capital, from 2.424 trillion to 4.096 trillion lire, giving the parent company financial resources of some 5.1 trillion lire (3 billion dollars) at the end of last year. Other items of the yearly report, according to Agnelli's letter, will not be so bad: revenues are expected to amount to 53.7 trillion lire (31.5 billion dollars), a 1.7 percent drop roughly equal to the revenues brought in by the ailing Rinascente department store chain. While revenues of the two leading vehicle production units, Fiat Auto and Iveco, dropped about 11 percent, revenues by New Holland rose 23.8 percent, Teksid 6.1 percent, Prodotti e Sistemi Ferroviari (railways) 9.9 percent, SNIA Bpd 9.7 percent and Toro Assicurazioni 12.5 percent. Indebtedness remained very high but, said Agnelli, mostly because of investments in research and development. Debts at the end of 1993 amounted to 5.5 trillion lire (3.2 billion dollars) but thanks to the rights issue the ratio between debt and net assets has remained balanced, Agnelli said. Investments reached nine trillion lire (5.2 billion dollars), a record 16.8 percent of revenue (compared to 14.8 percent in 1992) and 1994 is expected to show improvements thanks to restructuring plans and to the launching on the market of a series of new models, spearheaded by the Punto compact model, which is apparently selling well. Restructuring plans, which include massive layoffs, are at a standstill because talks with the trade unions have broken down. Meanwhile in 1993 the total number of group employees fell from 270,876 (of whom 9,531 on long-term redundancy pay) to 261,500 (9,106 long-term redundancies). The board that today received Agnelli's preliminary report was the first since the family's two holding companies, IFI and IFIL, formed pacts with major institutions such as Alcatel, Deutsche Bank, Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali. It was also the first time that Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, son of Gianni's brother, Umberto, sat on the board as representative of the fourth generation of the family dynasty. Prospects for 1994 remain "critical" but the accounts are expected to end up even at the end of the year, Agnelli said. It is not clear when economic recovery will come but when it does, he continued, it will be "very gradual" and with "long pauses." In other words, the car market probably will not see real recovery before 1996, when sales may top the 13 million vehicles of 1992. But this year the market slump should bottom out, although investments will continue to be reduced because of political instability and a more general "climate of mistrust," Agnelli predicted. The chairman then turned to the layoffs which caused a deadlock in talks with trade unions, saying that "the adoption of painful measures" was necessary to adapt the number of workers to falling production levels. These measures, he added, "will reduce permanently some structural costs that are no longer sustainable and will obtain a more effective plant production make-up." Investments will allow eight new models to be placed on the market this year, Agnelli announced. Two new Alfa Romeo models will be unveiled at the April auto show in Turin, a coupe and a spider will be ready after the summer, and in autumn it will be the turn of a Ducato transporter, a Fiat mini-van, a top-of-the-line luxury Lancia and the Lancia Dedra station wagon. Separately, the Fiat textile unit, SNIA Fibre, said it expects to end 1993 in the black, after posting losses of 33.8 billion lire in 1992, and that it will launch a rights issue of up to 152.4 billion lire (89.64 million dollars). The capital increase would include a convertible bond issue for a maximum of 34.05 billion lire (20 million dollars) at a nominal value of 1,000 lire per share, a communique from the SNIA board said. The Fiat board approved a fixed-rate bond issue of one trillion lire (588 million dollars) at 1,000 lire per share linked to a lottery for 100 Fiat Coupe and 100 Fiat Punto models. Rates for the 10-year bonds will be tied to yearly yields of the latest 10-year Treasury bonds and will be issued by a consortium of guarantors coordinated by the merchant bank, Mediobanca, "as soon as improved market conditions appear," the Fiat board announced.
