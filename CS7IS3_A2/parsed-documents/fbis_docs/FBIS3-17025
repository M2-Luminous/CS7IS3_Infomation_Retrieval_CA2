Under the agreement Ukraine was to receive nuclear fuel in exchange for giving up its nuclear warheads. Whereas Ukraine is abiding by the accord "it cannot be said the same about Russia", Shmarov told a news conference after a meeting with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. Ukraine has already dispatched two trainloads of warheads but "there is no adequate steps from Russia". Ukraine has got nothing in response so far, Shmarov stressed. According to him, Russia has not supplied a single lot of nuclear fuel, complaining in turn that the USA was failing to abide by the accord under which it was to pay Russia 60 million dollars. Shmarov said Russian leadership had promised to "straighten things out". But the political tension in Ukraine grows and it might, as a result, suspend fulfilling its obligations under the trilateral agreement, he said.
