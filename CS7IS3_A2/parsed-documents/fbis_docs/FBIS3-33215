Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary general, said during his inaugural speech that the participants' purpose in the event was "to encourage the reestablishment of good sense and equanimity needed to banish war from all corners of the world as a means of solving political and social conflicts." Perez de Cuellar, one of the promoters of the negotiation process that concluded with the signing of the Chapultepec Agreement, said: "El Salvador has given Latin America and the world an example of the participants' political willingness to find peaceful and negotiated solutions to a conflict." Meanwhile, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, UNESCO general director, in his video message seen by all the participants, congratulated all those who had the sense, courage, and unselfishness to achieve peace in El Salvador. Mayor said: "I want to congratulate President Cristiani, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], all those who put the force of reason before the reason of force, those pioneers of the peace culture, who are convinced that violence and conflict lead to sacrifice and the death of the causes that deserve to be lived through education, science, and culture." Mayor expressed that the participating nations' contribution of reason and experiences to this forum shall be decisive in orienting the debate and analysis. Upon inaugurating the Forum, President Alfredo Cristiani expressed his happiness and satisfaction that the nation had been chosen for this period of reflection. Nevertheless, FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal said before the event's inauguration: "We believe it is not appropriate to hold this forum before the elections because it makes the government look like it is complying with the peace agreements. Handal criticized UNESCO for agreeing to organize and promote the forum before the 20 March elections, as this, he noted, gives the government party a lead. President Cristiani in this regard said: "It is unfortunate that Handal, one of the promoters of the peace process, has expressed himself in this manner." After the inauguration, Dr. David Escobar Galindo and current Presidency Minister Dr. Oscar Santamaria, who were members of the government commission that signed the peace agreements, each gave a lecture on "The Nature of the Peace Culture" and "The Salvadoran Case," respectively. In addition, the Forum, where 80 nations and 140 domestic and foreign organizations assembled as observers, continues today with the topic "Local and Regional Contribution for the Installation of a Peace Culture."
