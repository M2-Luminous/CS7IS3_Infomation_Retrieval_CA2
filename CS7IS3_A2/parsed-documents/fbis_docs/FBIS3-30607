As the Serbian president's office has announced, they discussed the creation of conditions for restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and the stabilization of the overall situation in the Yugoslav area. It was noted that the negotiating process has no alternative as the path toward peace, and that it should not be allowed to suspend the negotiations before a final peace agreement is reached. They stressed the close link between lifting the sanctions against Serbia, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and finding a peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and pointed to the forces still opposed to this. They also discussed the efforts for an overall normalization of relations in the Yugoslav area, and decided that the normalization of relations between Serbs and Croats is of great importance in that context. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part in the talks.
