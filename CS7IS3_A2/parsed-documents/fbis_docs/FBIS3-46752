In his first public comment about President Suharto's strong criticism of recent demands for greater individual freedom, Murdiono said no one should take stability for granted. "Stability is not a self-made product and must not be taken for granted," he said. "It is our collective responsibility to maintain the nation's dynamic stability," he told reporters after addressing a seminar on the cultural aspects of Indonesia's second long term development program yesterday. [passage omitted] "I think the essence of the President's statement is that criticisms and statements must not undermine national stability," Murdiono continued. "You must remember that what the President actually said was that their methods resembled the PKI's," he said when asked about the comparison. The specter of the PKI, which was crushed and outlawed in 1966 after a failed coup attempt the previous year, has often been raised in discussions about possible threats to national stability. Murdiono in his paper at the seminar said that national stability ultimately depends on greater public participation in the nation's economic political and cultural development. "Greater public participation will expand the state's political basis. This, will in turn enhance national stability," he said. Murdiono acknowledged however that governing was not always a smooth process. "It is not realistic to expect a society to be free of frictions and conflicts." He suggested that some kind of a limit be imposed on how far these conflicts could be tolerated that does not lead towards destruction. "To ensure that differences of opinion remain as constructive as possible, we should set a limit on the maximum conflict allowable." Murdiono said the "limit" would vary according to the situation. "This limit must be formulated and agreed upon collectively. It must be dynamic and dependent on both the society's development and the ability of the state apparatus to control the situation," he said.

They are likely to be charged with defaming President Suharto an offense punishable by up to six years in jail, the police said. [passage omitted]
