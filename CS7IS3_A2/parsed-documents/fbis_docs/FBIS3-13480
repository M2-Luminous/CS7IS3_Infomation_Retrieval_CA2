Detailing the American policy, Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, said that of the $330 million in assistance sought by the U.S. Government from the Congress for the assistance program in South Asia, $112 million is earmarked for Bangladesh, $155 million for India, $28 million for Nepal, and $35 million for Sri Lanka. No fund has been allocated to Pakistan and Afghanistan. That the dreadful civil war in Afghanistan is posing a problem to providing assistance to that country is understandable to a certain extent. But Pakistan is being subjected to this biased treatment by the United States for the sole reason that it is not prepared to roll back its nuclear program. Now the United States is exerting pressure to roll back the program rather than halting or freezing it. This American tendency has been construed by India as an appreciation for the production of its nuclear weapons. After noting that the United States exempts India from all such activities and after discerning the American designs toward Pakistan, now there exists no scope for optimism. The United States also does not want a developing Muslim country to attain capability in sophisticated nuclear technology, and if this occurs the U.S. wants to deprive it by tormenting it through various sanctions. The announcement to grant maximum assistance to India despite its gross human rights violations and the manufacture of nuclear weapons as well as the plan to keep Pakistan out of the assistance program until 1995 warrants us to revise our domestic and foreign policies and set fresh priorities. The government also should clearly understand that the United States will not be content with this and will take steps to cripple Pakistan economically and to further torment it by joining hands with its Western allies. Therefore, in view of this situation, the government should think about taking steps to make the entire nation demonstrate total harmony and perfect coordination to safeguard its interests and protect its independence, sovereignty, and resources. This is possible only through total solidarity among the people, and in a broader sense, through full coordination of thought between the government and the opposition to deal with the situation because it is not a matter concerning any particular political party or the government, but it concerns the entire country and the people.
