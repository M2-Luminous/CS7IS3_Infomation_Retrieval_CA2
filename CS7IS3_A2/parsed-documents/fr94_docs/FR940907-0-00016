FR940907-0-00016 FR940907-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AEA&hyph;07] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Trenton, NJ AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Trenton, NJ. Presently, this area is designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control tower located at this location is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when the control tower is closed. DATES: Effective Date: 0901 U.T.C. December 8, 1994. Comment Date: Comments must be received on or before October 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the rule in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, AEA&hyph;500, Airspace Docket Number 94&hyph;AEA&hyph;07, F.A.A. Eastern Region, Fitzgerald Federal Building # 111, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, New York 11430. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address listed above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments on the Rule Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace extending upward from the surface at Trenton, NJ. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Mercer County Airport, Trenton, NJ when the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at this airport when the control tower is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645). The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish this Class E surface area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
