That is 400 million U.S. dollars more than in 1992, resulting from stable bilateral relations and complementary economies. It shows a strong momentum for the two sides' trade and economic cooperation. Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) figures show that in the first ten months of this year, this trade volume reached 2.8 billion U.S. dollars. "Latin America, among China's trade partners, has jumped from no. 5 to no. 4, following Asia, Europe and North America," said Wang Zhiquan, a MOFTEC official responsible for trade with Latin America. Wang attributed the thriving trade mainly to the frequent summit contacts between China and Latin American countries. Chinese President Jiang Zemin toured Cuba and Brazil in November and the presidents of Uruguay, Dominica, Guyana and Mexico visited China one after the other. "The visits have offered a favorable environment for the further expansion of Sino-Latin American trade, " Wang said. During the visits, agreements were reached in the fields of economy, trade, investment, and scientific and technological cooperation. Some of the Latin American countries are negotiating with China for accords on scrapping double tariffs. "A sound legal foundation has been laid for the growth of Sino-American trade," Wang said. China has been a traditional importer of Latin America's major exports, such as copper, iron ore, steel, petrochemicals, paper pulp, timber, wool, grain and leather. China's exports to these countries have been commodities of choice because of their good quality and reasonable price. "We have shipped more machinery and electronic products to Latin America. They are leading items next only to light industrial goods among all China's exports to that region in 1993," he said. As China is vigorously developing its economy and looming as a huge market, it welcomes Latin American businesses to invest and produce here with their technology and resources," Wang said. China has established over 80 joint ventures and enterprises with exclusive Chinese financing in 17 Latin American countries. On the possible effect of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Sino-Latin American trade relations, Wang held that the competition will be fiercer on the American market for labor-intensive products, as the United States will shift its labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, garment-making and shoe-making industries, to Mexico to take advantage of the cheap labor and resources there. However, China will be given more opportunities of trade and economic cooperation when the economies of Mexico and other Latin American countries are spurred in the wake of the NAFTA implementation.
