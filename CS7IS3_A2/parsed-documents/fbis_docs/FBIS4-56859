The possible candidacy of Perez de Cuellar was supported because it could open the path for the installation in the country of a democratic regime capable of ending dictatorship and effectively fighting poverty and unemployment. The PCP, headed by Jorge del Prado and Secretary General Renan Raffo Munoz, said the current administration is trying to remain in government to continue a neoliberal policy that has eliminated social and economic rights, worsened the crisis, and run rampant over democratic institutions. The 10th PCP Plenary Session also decided to hold the Ideological, Programmatic, and Organizational National Conference from 26 to 28 August in Ica. The political programmatic guidelines to be debated include the "reestablishment of democratic institutions with the full enforcement of civil, political, and social freedom." It will also debate the democratization of the state, the main role of which should be the promotion and management of overall development through coordinated planning and the market; and the implementation of municipal and regional decentralization and autonomy.
