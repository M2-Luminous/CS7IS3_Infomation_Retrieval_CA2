According to Chubays, "the privatisation has been carried out despite numerous experts' forecasts and stormy political developments around it." At the same time, Chubays believes that as far as the state property committee is concerned, and for him personally, the goal of privatisation goes far beyond the framework of privatisation itself. He described privatisation as a very deep process "which modifies processes taking place in an economic organism at a molecular level." According to Chubays, a total of 70 percent of Russian enterprises will be auctioned for vouchers, 20 percent for money and 10 percent will not be subject to privatisation at all. According to Chubays, enterprises excluded from monetary and voucher privatisation include those connected with the production of nuclear splitting materials, cipher equipment and special kinds of armaments.
