The 12 other members will be chosen from the occupied territories.

'Arafat will continue his consultations today before leaving for Johannesburg tonight to attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa. Palestinian sources have stated that a number of prominent Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories have expressed a desire not to participate in the National Authority Council. They include Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah representative in the West Bank; and Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian negotiator at the Washington talks.
