Stabnikova, V.N. Ivanov, N.N. Gregirchak, A.N. Dulgerov, Food Industry Engineering Institute and Microbiology and Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 612.3:576.8] [Abstract] The mechanism of bacterial neuston development on the air and water interface of reservoirs and the surface-active and hydrophobic layer on the water surface (10-100 �m) is discussed, and it is noted that today, there are virtually no bacterial preparations which enhance the self-treatment process on the basis of neuston forms of microorganisms. An attempt is made to produce such preparations based on adaptive selection of neuston bacterial forms with an elevated cell surface hydrophobia and to examine the efficacy of using neuston forms of bacterial preparations for treating water by removing petroleum hydrocarbons and for biological decontaminating of waste water already treated by traditional methods. To this end, Bacillus megaterium 1BD, Pseudomonas putida BS-2, and Alcaligenes paradoxus BS-1 from the microorganism collection of the biosynthesis technology division of the Microbiology and Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences grown in test tubes in a rocker making 240 strokes per minute were used. The possibility of selecting neuston bacterial forms which concentrate on the water/atmosphere interface is demonstrated; the preparation on the basis of Bacillus megaterium is more effective in treating petroleum-based hydrocarbon contamination than the preparation on the basis of the plankton form of the same culture. The preparation developed on the basis of the neuston form of aerobic spore-forming bacteria is more effective in biological decontamination of waste water treated by traditional methods. The preparation was tested under full-scale conditions by treating a reservoir in the Sula river flood plain. The experiment shows that water treatment with the biological preparation for 48 h reduces the total microbial dissemination and makes it possible to get rid of staphylococci and Shigella. Thus, neuston forms of bacteria with antagonistic properties with respect to pathogenic microflora may probably be used for waste water decontamination and for improving the hygienic reservoir conditions. The use of neuston forms also makes it possible to enhance the microbiological processes in a 15-40 �m surface layer. Figures 3; tables 3; references 14: 10 Russian, 4 Western.
