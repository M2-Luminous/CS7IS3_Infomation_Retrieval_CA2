For -- 37 percent; against -- 61 percent; no reply -- 2 percent. How would you reply if the referendum question was: "Are you for or against partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full peace with Syria and appropriate security arrangements?" For -- 62 percent; against -- 36 percent; no reply -- 2 percent. The poll, which was conducted on 19 and 20 January, included 565 interviewees constituting a representative sample of the entire adult Israeli population. An analysis of the connection between voting patterns for the incumbent Knesset and on the referendum question on full withdrawal from the Golan Heights indicates that Labor supporters are almost equally divided between support for and opposition to full withdrawal. However, the voting patterns of supporters of other parties in the Knesset ballot and the poll were obviously comparable, with only a minority "crossing the lines": For instance, only 12 percent of Likud followers support full withdrawal, and only 14 percent of Meretz followers oppose it. There is a similarly significant majority of full withdrawal opponents among the supporters of ultra- Orthodox parties (20 percent for withdrawal versus 80 percent against among Agudat Yisra'el supporters; 25 percent for and 75 percent against among SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] supporters). With the introduction of the question on partial withdrawal, the trends change: Only 19 percent of Labor supporters are against it versus 80 percent in favor; partial withdrawal garners the support of 39 percent of Likud followers, some 50 percent of Tzomet and Moledet followers, and 44 percent of the National Religious Party followers. The maximum margin of error in this poll is 4 percent. [passage omitted]
