For three days, from 13 to 15 February, Haitians attempted to forget their worries by delivering themselves, body and soul, to the delirious atmosphere of Carnival. During the three days, the capital throbbed to the rhythm of meringues composed for the occasion. There were no colors or traditional floats in the 1994 version of Haitian Carnival. However, Champs-de-Mars and other main streets of Port-au-Prince welcomed thousands of people who celebrated this huge popular festival to their heart's content. No official theme was designated for 1994 but there was music, which served as a bridge among the various social classes hugging each other in the streets, forgetting the embargo and the political crisis. Although the major topics of the news were not totally absent from the songs, a political truce was observed during the three carnival days. No major incidents were reported but tens of persons were stabbed and there were arrests by the Port-au-Prince police, who were out in force on the Carnival streets.
