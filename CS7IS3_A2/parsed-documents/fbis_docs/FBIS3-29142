The order followed the yen's surge on the Tokyo foreign exchange market Tuesday to the 101 yen to 102 yen range against the dollar, stemming in part from the failure of Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton last week to reach accord on a bilateral trade framework. Hosokawa issued the order at an informal meeting of cabinet ministers. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the meeting that Japan should take the initiative in reducing the surplus, regardless of the progress in the framework talks. Other cabinet ministers supported Hata's view, the officials said.
