The ROK and the United States agreed to a resolution clearly stating the deadline for additional inspections on North Korean nuclear facilities and discussion for additional measures. Thusfar, the PRC has insisted on replacing the format with a UNSC presidential statement and on not including "binding articles" in the content. However, it is noteworthy that the PRC expressed its position in unofficial negotiations that it might partially accept the demand of the ROK and the United States if the format of a presidential statement is accepted. Particularly, the PRC implied that rather than "oppose" the moves by the ROK and the United States, it may abstain if the issue proceeds to a vote thus expressing that they "do not support" the measure.
