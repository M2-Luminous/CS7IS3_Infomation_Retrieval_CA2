It seems that Britain focuses more attention on its long-term interests than on its long-term allies. So it is no coincidence that mutual interests have brought Britain and Azerbaijan closer. Considering requirements earlier this century, British officials have turned to Azerbaijan again, never mind that 70 years have passed since the last time. Several officials have linked that with Britain's bid for Baku's oil. But Britain, which has established links with the Caucasus as one of the most developed countries, maintains more serious objectives, which will serve stability in the region. Of course, all that will be widely discussed in the high-level talks between Britain and Azerbaijan in London. Undoubtedly, President Geydar Aliyev and Prime Minister John Major will deliberate on the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia and try to establish a way to remove the dispute. Britain's position on it is common knowledge. After Turkey, it was the second country to establish its final approach to the Karabakh dispute. And it did that long ago. Perhaps that is why President Ter-Petrosyan left Britain with empty hands at the end of his visit there 10 days ago. He visited Britain with a great deal of hope. But malicious circles in Azerbaijan have described President Aliyev's visit as an effort to seek Western support. They have made unreasonable and wrong statements in that regard. There is nothing in Azerbaijan's cooperation with Britain to harm the interests of third countries. Naturally, Azerbaijan also wishes to cooperate with France, Germany, Russia, and several other countries. Everyone knows that those countries have adopted a [word indistinct] approach to Azerbaijan's sincere wish to cooperate with them. The bilateral agreements that will be signed during President Aliyev's visit to London will further consolidate the legal and political basis of bilateral relations. Consequently, our relations will become more productive. The cooperation with Britain, which is a leading country in modern technology in industry and agriculture, will create an opportunity for Azerbaijan to reorganize its industry somewhat. And President Aliyev's visit may lead to surprising and favorable developments. Naturally, all that will create a new opportunity for Azerbaijan to improve its cooperation with Western countries.
