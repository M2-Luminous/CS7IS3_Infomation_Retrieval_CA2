FBIS4-29235 "dreas116_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 North Korea `War Fever' Denounced `War Fever' Denounced SK1606081594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1606081594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 15 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] Timed to coincide with its attempt to further drive the situation on the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war with the U.S. imperialists by finding faults with our fictitious nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets staged a game with a large-scale civil defense drill across South Korea on 15 June by dragging out thousands of residents, according to radio reports from Seoul. The puppets made a stir by blowing warning sirens at 1405 all over places in South Korea and staging an evacuation drill preparing for all contingencies. In addition, the puppets ran amok in staging a drill simulating chemical, biological, and nuclear attacks in every place. The South Korean warmongers incited war fever by babbling that the drill has been restored as a war time evacuation exercise to prepare for contingencies in the wake of the North Korean nuclear issue. Prior to this, the puppets announced that in future drills, not only some 6.5 million reserve forces but also the U.S. Forces in South Korea will be mobilized and that it will wage a large-scale war exercise using various types of war equipment. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are continuously staging war exercises and increasing their degree by extremely heightening tension on the Korean peninsula. This shows that the rascals' war hysteria attempting to crush us has reached an extremely reckless stage.
