The command of the Russian peacekeeping forces took this decision. An address to the population broadcast on Abkhaz television says that the curfew will be in force from 21:00 till 6:00 in the security zone covering 12 kilometers along both banks of the Inguri river. All people who have arms (except the state management bodies) must give them over to local power bodies. Charges will be brought against those who disobey this order. All armed people in the security zone except the state management bodies will be detained and cars will be inspected. Peacekeepers are allowed to use arms in case of violation of this order. Headquarters of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the zone of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict warned that if there were attacks against detachments and servicemen of the peacekeeping forces they could "open fire without warning." On Friday two Russian motor rifle battalions came to Zugdidi (western Georgia) from Batumi. Air landing detachments will arrive in Abkhazia's Gali region the same day. Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, private envoy of the Russian president, also arrived in Abkhazia Friday. He plans to meet with chairman of Abkhazia's parliament Vladislav Ardzinba. During this meeting they will discuss the course of the peacemaking operation and several issues related to the upcoming Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations scheduled for June 30 in Geneva.
