This year, the sweeping changes of tax policy in China will not end tax exemptions for foreign-funded productive enterprises in their initial two years of profitable operation, said Dong Shukui, deputy director of the overseas-related tax bureau under the State Administration of Taxation. He added that the newly introduced value-added, consumption and operational taxes have equalized the government's tax levies on both Chinese and foreign enterprises. Dong reiterated that the valued added tax (VAT) has more advantages compared with the old turnover tax, known as the consolidated industrial and commercial tax (CICT), which was applied to most foreign businesses before this year. The new VAT regime provides a channel for businessmen to claim refunds of VAT assessed on certain goods, mainly raw materials. This could help reduce the production costs of foreign businesses in China. Exporters might also benefit from the new regime for the same reason. They are now entitled to claim a monthly VAT refund from Chinese authorities, representing the VAT incurred on the acquisition of VAT-recoverable goods and services. Foreign businesses engaged in industries, where the proportion of VAT-recoverable purchases as a percentage of turnover is high and where the new VAT rate is lower than the old CICT rate, may also benefit from the new regime. However, China's tax collecting officials admitted that the new tax reforms have caused confusion and other problems. The current high retail price level, which stood at more than 20 per cent during the first quarter, was partly due to the misunderstanding by many taxpayers on the new tax system. They also failed to know the regulations on issuing special receipts for VAT and "blindly" raised their products' prices. To cope with this situation, the government's tax collectors pledged to take prompt measures to ensure their smooth implementation, including sending working teams to grass-roots areas to enforce the new laws and the collection of State revenue. Dong said a patient introduction of the country's new tax system to foreign businesses is especially crucial to the country's opening drive as well as the economic reform. The reformed taxation system now specifies 11 items of tax collection on foreign-invested firms and overseas businessmen in China. They involve industrial production, consumption, business operation, institutional and individual income, natural resources and land utilization, real estate, stamps, automobile and ships, and animal slaughter. This year, some provinces and municipalities have also cut down their money collection on 21 categories of products manufactured by foreign-invested factories, Dong noted. These products are mostly computers, TV sets, refrigerators, tape recorders, drinks, cigarettes, air-conditioners and a cluster of chemical goods.
