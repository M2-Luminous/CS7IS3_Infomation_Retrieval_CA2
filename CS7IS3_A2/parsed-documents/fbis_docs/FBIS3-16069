The committee unites people who were sent to clean up the areas polluted by the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine in 1986 when Estonia was still part of the Soviet Union. The meeting stated that noone could be sent to dangerous areas without guarantees with a specific reference to nuclear training reactors at former Soviet submarine training base, Paldiski, in northwest Estonia that will be dismantled soon. Victims of Chernobyl lack social guarantees in Estonia as tax reductions were abolished by the new Income Tax Law and new reductions have not been drafted, the meeting stated. Radiation victims in Estonia also include people who have been to nuclear sites on Novaya Zemlya and other places and also members of the Rescue Board.
