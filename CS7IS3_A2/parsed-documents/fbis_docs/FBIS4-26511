It can help to some extent alleviate the tense state involving long term inadequacy of the police force. The profession dated back to 1985 when Shenzhen took the lead in setting up a security service company, the first of its kind in China, according to sources from the public security department. Other places followed suit since then and there were more than 1,000 security companies across the country with employment of 200,000 as of late last year. The security profession is regarded as an auxiliary force to help the police prevent crime and safeguard social order, according to relevant regulations. Security workers comprise demobilized military men, unemployed young persons from urban areas and young persons from rural areas. The security business, which offers service at certain charges, has developed into new groups to defend social order. The Beijing Security Service Company, for example, is now providing service for 2,278 entities, including foreign diplomatic missions stationed in China, apartment buildings for diplomats, foreign-funded enterprises and domestic industrial enterprises. Most security companies just offer gate-keeping service at present. The level of service available as well as the quality of service and employees urgently need to be improved. A security association is said to be established in the near future in a bid to boost professional guidance and administration of the security business.
