A spokesman for the security forces told ACAN-EFE that unidentified persons inside a vehicle fired at the diplomatic mission as they drove by. No one was injured, and there was no property damage. Embassy guards did not repel the attack, which took place at around 2330 (0530 GMT Friday), when the city was still without power as a result of three downed high tension towers in different areas of the outskirts of the city. No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack.
