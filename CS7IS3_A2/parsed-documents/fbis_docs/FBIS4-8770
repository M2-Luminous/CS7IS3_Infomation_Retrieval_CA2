UN soldiers abandoned the city as untenable. Did you take new NATO attacks into account? [Buha] We are at a turning point, either toward peace or toward a dramatic escalation of this war. I have the impression that NATO is, meanwhile, irritated at its spirit of adventure. However, should it continue its bombardments, a world war will begin. [DER SPIEGEL] Serbia against the rest of the world? [Buha] This might develop into an uncontrollable avalanche. We are only a ball in the game of the international community. [DER SPIEGEL] However, it was your decision to fire at the UN protection zone of Gorazde. [Buha] Gorazde is not a protection zone for us -- the inhabitants were neither disarmed nor have the borders of this zone been fixed. [DER SPIEGEL] This is not true. Even Russian President Boris Yeltsin accused the Serbs of aggression. [Buha] Gorazde has outskirts with a Serbian population. If the Muslims attack them, we will, of course, strike back. These are counterattacks. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you prohibit UN General Rose and foreign journalists from convincing themselves of the situation on the spot? [Buha] We only warned General Rose against the danger. Foreign journalists have no business there. [DER SPIEGEL] Your artillery is also shelling the protection zone of Tuzla again. [Buha] Only the airport, which, as agreed upon, may only be used for humanitarian help. The packets have to be controlled by the Russians. None of these conditions was fulfilled; therefore, we bombed it. [DER SPIEGEL] Do the Serbs want to oust the blue helmets from Bosnia? [Buha] If the United Nations orders further bombardments, our people will see to it themselves. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you place more than 200 blue helmets as hostages under house arrest? [Buha] It is better that we protect them, instead of leaving them to the rage of our people. [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic has called for the withdrawal of Western mediators from the peace talks on Bosnia. Who is to take over this task? [Buha] If the international community withdraws Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, we will determine our new, impartial mediators -- Russians, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, and -- you will be surprised -- Germans. [DER SPIEGEL] I beg your pardon? Which Germans are you thinking of? [Buha] Peter Glotz, Hans Modrow, Graf Lambsdorff, retired General Schmueckle. I hope very much for an improvement of the relations between Germans and Serbs. [DER SPIEGEL] Your only hope is currently based on the Russians. Did Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin encourage you to continue your fight for the independent Serbian state during his mediation last week? [Buha] No, just like the whole world, the Russians do not care about the price that we have to pay. They only want peace quickly. I also do not believe that Yeltsin would risk a war for a greater Serbia. However, since the Muslims and Croats were able to conclude a federation without us, we have the same right to a Serbian state and its international recognition. The inclusion of the Srpska republic in Bosnia in this Muslim-Croatian federation is completely out of the question.
