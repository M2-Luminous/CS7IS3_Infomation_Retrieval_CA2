The KHABAR-SERVICE agency learned about this from the UN government [as published] in Azerbaijan. By a stroke of luck there were no casualties among the members of the delegation. As Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov told a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency, this happened despite the fact that while visiting Yerevan the leader of the delegation, Mr. Mathias Mosberg, a deputy of the Minsk Conference [as published], informed the leadership of Armenia about a forthcoming visit of the mission he heads to Azerbaijan's Terterskiy Rayon, which is located in the immediate proximity of the front line. It should be stressed that the delegation was in the region on a peace-making mission, and the belligerent parties had been informed about the future route to be traveled by foreign diplomats several days in advance of their arrival. After firing on the motorcade of Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, this winter, the armed forces of Armenia have in this manner now expressed their attitude toward the peacemaking efforts of intermediaries for the second time.
