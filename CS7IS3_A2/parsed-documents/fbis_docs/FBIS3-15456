But people in the president's entourage are today making desperate attempts to rewrite the State Duma's decree on political amnesty -- which, incidentally, was adopted by an absolute majority. Some call this decision "political madness," others try to frighten us by talking about "the beginning of civil war," while still others, taking advantage of the opportunity, seek to heap all the blame for the events of last October exclusively on the defenders of the House of Soviets. But what do the people, the selfsame people in whose name statements are often made, the people whose voice they do not want to hear, think about this? For more than a month now my heart has been wracked by these two huge files of readers' letters. They convey the penetratingly clear voice of hundreds of people. And not to heed this voice, to "file it away" in the archives, would mean to forego conscience and honor, cowardly to evade direct questions which require equally direct answers: These letters are in defense of the prisoners held in Lefortovo, and the overwhelming majority are about Rutskoy. These hundreds of messages include 23 collective letters, and very many family letters; there are also some which are signed by all (all!) the inhabitants of a village or members of a labor collective. There are only two letters which condemn the vice president's actions. There was nothing even close to such a phenomenon in the times of the hounding of B.N. Yeltsin. "Dear Editors! This letters comes from the inhabitants of the village of Zhdanovka and the village of Maresovo in Krasnooktyabrskiy Rayon, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. We often read reactions to the events of 3-4 October on the pages of your newspaper. We support the actions of A.V. Rutskoy and parliament. We believe that the actions of the president and the government were provocative. The shelling of the `White House' by heavy artillery was really quite inhuman. Thus we are on the side of those who are calling for the liberation of A.V. Rutskoy and all the prisoners of Lefortovo. Let the real culprits suffer punishment...." It is signed by: Yu.N. Dydykin, teacher; L.V. Dydykina, teacher; N.A. Fomichev, welder.... Fifty-five signatures in all. Another letter is from the village of Dubrovka in Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk Oblast. The letter, which carries the message "We are with you!" is signed by as many as 73 people. A third letter, which carries 52 signatures, sent by workers and technical and engineering personnel of the "Armizonagropromsnab" AOOT [expansion unknown], Tyumen Oblast, reads: "We demand the release from custody of A.V. Rutskoy, R.I. Khasbulatov, and the other deputies held in jail. Every self-respecting person would have acted in the same way in their position." Geographically, the writers of collective letters come from all over Russia: Bryansk, Rostov, Smolensk, Volgograd, Ryazan, Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Chelyabinsk, Tambov, Leningrad, and Kursk Oblasts; Altay and Kuban; the Republics of Komi and Chuvashia. Participants in the Great Patriotic War and veterans of agricultural production V.S. Belashov, N.T. Zasoba, and M.A. Mironenko from Rostov-na-Donu write: "We are with you, Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy]. Don't lose courage and steadfastness. All honorable people are on your side. Demand that you be given the opportunity to appeal to the people and tell them the truth about the October events. Sooner or later retribution will befall those who ordered the tanks to open against unarmed people. Despite everything, the people will recognize those `heroes' who sold themselves for dollars, who opened fire on their own parliament, and beat up deputies. Whatever happens, history will tell the truth and put everyone in their proper place." Yes, history will undoubtedly tell the truth and give everyone their just deserts, when the many hidden springs which prompted the bloodshed in the center of Moscow are declassified and made public. This will not be tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow. But there is no doubt that this will happen -- our readers are absolutely right on this account. I think that the nearer the presidential elections draw, the more pressingly and vociferously the problem, which I would conditionally call "the Rutskoy question," will arise. The ruling team will do their utmost to limit the former vice president's activity as much as possible and to prevent him from running for president. The opposition will feverishly seek a national leader on whom to place its major stake. On whom will this choice fall? On Baburin? An extraordinary and attractive figure without a doubt. But I think that, in view of his youth, his moment of glory still lies ahead. On Svetlana Petrovna Goryachevaya? But she, I think, will not want to soil her shining conscience and clean hands in politics any further. There is Gennadiy Zyuganov, the pragmatic and powerful leader of the Communist Party of Russia, who has grown before our very eyes into a major political figure, with whose opinion even the "hawks" on the democratic wing have to reckon. But Communists have been so tarnished and discredited in the eyes of the public, that years will be required to melt the ice of distrust and wariness. On Zhirinovskiy? But no self-respecting left or center party will want to have dealings with the impulsive and unpredictable leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (we have already tried "unpredictables"). I venture to suggest that the stake will be placed on Rutskoy. He will "satisfy" the patriots and statists -- the vice president's recent statements give them no reason to doubt his "reliability." The Agrarians and Travkin's party undoubtedly find him attractive. The depoliticized Army will probably vote for him so as to rehabilitate themselves, so to speak, for participating in the shelling of the House of Soviets. I think that even the Communist Party has already forgotten Rutskoy's schismatic stance in the early days of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, and will back him for the sake of achieving their strategic goals. Women, and also veterans, will undoubtedly vote for the young and likable Hero of the Soviet Union and general. But Rutskoy's biggest support could be the people, who did not attach themselves to any of the dwarfish or more massive parties, but kept their sense of compassion for a man who had been mistreated -- there is always a peculiar sympathy for the persecuted in Rus (does not the coming to power of the current president also illustrate this?). I think that voters will forget Rutskoy's excessive hotheadedness and emotionalism -- he had plenty of time in Lefortovo to cool his ardor, to soberly reflect on his views and actions, to "settle down" once and for all and mature into a major political figure. Especially today Rutskoy must be viewed in two dimensions. The 1991 model of Rutskoy the wounded hero, and the Rutskoy of today. The past three years have been for him not simply a time of getting to know the corridors of power, not simply a political academy -- the three past years, for him as perhaps for no other, have contained enough events and trials to last others a lifetime. Let us recall that it was not without the aid of Rutskoy, who split the communist faction in the Congress of People's Deputies, that B.N. Yeltsin became chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Having become vice president, Rutskoy zealously served his boss, but then made a sharp retreat. Let me remark that this retreat came at the time of the beginning of drastic reforms which cast Russia into the abyss of the severest crisis. The evolution of Rutskoy's views and actions took place in parallel with the evolution of the majority of the people, who have entirely lost faith that the reforms promise them work, peace, and sufficiency. In other words, in these troubled times Rutskoy, in his world outlook and actions, as it were reflected, upheld, and defended not so much his own position, as the position of the majority of the people, and not the so-called capital electorate. That is to say, he showed himself to be not above the voters, but with the majority of his voters. And it is probably this which explains the fact that it is above all the ordinary people that have come to his defense. Now that Rutskoy is free, people -- but this time people in the investigative and judicial organs -- will probably begin to speak again about his imaginary millions in a Swiss bank account, and the initiative in completing the investigations will belong, not to the masters of fabricating falsehoods this time, but to Rutskoy himself. The exposure of the authors of falsifications, the furor which will be raised in the mass media, will undoubtedly help to foster his image. Let us not forget either another major trump card which he will undoubtedly use, and which no other aspirant could possibly hold. After all, it was he, Rutskoy, who was the first of the president's entourage to affirm the perniciousness of the chosen course; it was he who warned that the "Chicago kids" would bring Russia to ruin, it was he who lifted the curtain on the corruption that has embraced the upper echelons of power -- it was for this, in point of fact, that he was initially slandered and ridiculed, and then removed from the political stage as an actor displeasing to the ruling regime, one who knew too much. In focusing attention on Rutskoy as the potential leader of the organized opposition, I by no means rule out other candidates. These could even include the current State Duma Speaker I.P. Rybkin, or someone else, perhaps as yet unknown to the broad mass of political commentators. For the time being I am reflecting only on possible candidates. It is entirely possible that the opposition will fix its choice on V.D. Zorkin, whose civic and political standpoint in many ways absorbs the views and aims of those who are simply dissatisfied with the progress of reforms, and those who decisively disagree with their content. In view of the Russian mentality, Zorkin, like Rutskoy, has many chances of victory, if, of course, he agrees to take part in the presidential elections. He is a faithful servant of the law and a tireless defender of the Constitution who is "sick of cringing" to the present authorities. He in no way compromised himself or blackened his reputation in the events of October; by nature and by upbringing he is a peacemaker, inclined to speak and find compromises in crisis situations. Moreover, he was humiliated and persecuted. But, in comparison with Rutskoy, Zorkin is a great diplomat, a more sensible and balanced politician, and, let us not forget, a highly experienced lawyer. It seems to me that the ideal scenario would be for them to enter the elections in harness. This is not a case of the "fiery steed" and the "timid doe" hitched to the same wagon, but rather, two horses who wish to haul the heavy burden of Russia's difficult problems from the abyss. Undoubtedly, this does not exhaust the list of potential presidential candidates. There is no doubt that Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] will put forward his candidacy, though his daily plunging popularity hardly leaves him any hope of victory, especially since a major split will probably occur in the liberal democrats' camp. The current prime minister will most likely stand. But his chances will, in my view, also be slim, since hitherto unknown facts about the October events, which will by no means be to his advantage, will emerge during the preelection wrangles. Nor will the ever-deteriorating economic background, the growth of prices, and the mass impoverishment of the people, work in his favor. We could see other well-known names also on the list of aspirants to the post of president. Shakhray's move away from democrats like Gaydar, Chubays, Ponomarev, and Yakunin, who have failed and compromised themselves, his attempt to glide along the "center," and his statement on the need to free the Lefortovo prisoners, are nothing less than the start of his bid for the presidency, an effort to stake out for himself political territory for the future. Experienced in palace intrigues, a man who knows how to look ahead, and who is flirting with the regions, Sergey Mikhaylovich is clearly seeking to undermine the vigilance of the Russian people. Without a doubt, the economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy -- author of the once-sensational "500 days" program -- will also make a bid for power. The democrats are already today trying to convince us all that there is no more popular man in Russia than Yavlinskiy, and thereby an attempt is already at this early stage being made to pave his way to the coveted office. Oh, this made-to-order sociology! I would like to believe that Yavlinksiy's name is well known to the inhabitants of a small town or rayon center, let alone a village. Alas, the name of this undoubtedly clever person, who, however, apart from composing projects, has not yet managed to do anything specific, means little to them. There is also another undoubtedly brilliant personality in the country, who today has been undeservedly thrust into the backwaters of public life -- Yu.V. Skokov, the current chairman of the Federation of Russian Commodity Producers. It is hard to explain why he is out of favor with the powers that be, but it is even harder to explain why he is himself deliberately keeping to the shadows. Is this a subtle game? A tactical ruse: Let the irreconcilables "slug it out," and the enfeebled collapse? Time will answer these questions. Here is the game of patience that is being played. There can, and probably will, be other names in this pack of candidates. Yegor Gaydar, on whose altar the main efforts and votes of the democrats will be placed, will not fail to try his hand, I think. It goes without saying that he has acquired huge public influence, plus there is his fine political education and lofty intellect. That experienced administrator, Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov, also has chances of fighting for the highest state post. Indeed, even the current president could, as they say, shake his grey locks. But when it comes to the degree of broad renown and popular trust enjoyed by future candidates, the name of Rutskoy is today on everyone's lips. The numerous letters to the editorial offices are also, incidentally, a confirmation of this. The fact that the authors of these letters are not members of the liberal intelligentsia or the capital's "gilded youth" trading in the kiosks strikes me as important; they are people remote from group or party prejudices; people of action. Perhaps this is the voice of reason and justice? "Justice will remain on Rutskoy's side!" -- this is how M. Zimin, labor veteran of the Lenin Kolkhoz in Vladimir Oblast's Muromskiy Rayon headed his letter to the editorial offices. Whether this will be the case or not, time will tell. We have not long left to wait.
