"How else would one interpret the 51-49 agreement given that Serbs own 64 percent of the entire territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and control even more land than that?, asked Krajisnik. "The proposed percentage could in the future create a real chaos with far-reaching consequences, and the Serb republic parliament will discuss everything in detail at its next session," he announced. The world has finally realized that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina must be divided, Krajisnik said, warning that the Serb republic would not allow its territorial integrity to be disturbed. Commenting on reports of a possible withdrawal of the peace-keeping forces, Krajisnik said that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] should remain in this former Yugoslav republic, but that it must adopt a completely neutral stand which, unfortunately, has not been the case so far as the UNPROFOR has even openly been siding with the Muslims, Krajisnik said.
