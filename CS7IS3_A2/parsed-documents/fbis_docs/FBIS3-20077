The leader of the majority Socialist group in the European Parliament, Jean-Pierre Cot, made it clear the necessary minimum vote to block Euro-legislation had to be 27 in practice. Otherwise, he said, EU [European Union] accession terms for Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria will not get the legally required backing from Strasbourg. "The Council of Ministers would do well to take account of this point when it decides now on a blocking minority," he said. Accession requires the votes of 260 of the 518 MEPs [members of the European Parliament] by early May if enlargement is to go ahead on time at the start of next year. The leader of Britain's 45 Labour Euro-members, Pauline Green, said she hoped enlargement would go ahead but warned: "John Major is not out of the woods yet. He has a Cabinet meeting tomorrow which could well see him lose his foreign secretary. All this is of his own making." A majority of the centre-right Christian Democrat MEPs -- the group to which the 32 British Tories are allied -- are also likely to oppose endorsing an enlargement deal which gives Britain or any other government a firm blocking option with less than 27 votes. The fear is that even if the Cabinet accepts the terms of the weekend compromise -- offering a "reasonable time" to find agreement where more than 23 but less than 27 votes are mustered against EU laws -- some other EU governments will reject it, throwing the Union into renewed confusion. "All bets are off it that happens," said one official in Brussels today. The responses of the 12 governments to the compromise will be made tomorrow, probably by "written procedure" -- followed by a formal gathering of ministers in Brussels on Wednesday [30 March] if a deal is on. But any celebrations would have to wait until the European Parliament delivers its final verdict.
