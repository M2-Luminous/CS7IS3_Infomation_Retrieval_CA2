At the Government Palace, the president met with 42 representatives of 280 peasant and Indian organizations. For one and one-half hours, he listened to the demands of the various representatives, all of whom spoke with great sincerity, and he had answers for each one of them. He told them that, first, the emergency would be addressed, but he added that measures also would be taken to combat and resolve long-term problems. President Salinas listed the specific plans to assist those people who have been affected by the violence that has been unleashed since 1 January. He said: 1. In terms of supplies, Conasupo [National Company for Basic Commodities] Director Javier Bonilla Garcia will remain in Chiapas to ensure regular food supplies to the conflict zone without overlooking other areas. 2. In terms of medical services, the Health Secretariat and the Mexican Social Security Institute will establish aid centers, especially for families within the conflict zone. 3. Widows and orphans will receive aid through a trust that must begin operating before the end of the week. It will give government assistance to widows, as well as scholarships to orphans of the conflict. 4. The authorities will offer facilities that will enable families to return. 5. Facilities will be offered to the State Council of Indigenous and Peasant Organizations of Chiapas. 6. The president said that human rights will be respected, and he gave assurances that the commission headed by Dr. Jorge Madrazo will not conceal anything and will review with impartiality and resolve all reports from and charges made by the people. 7. Regarding Agrarian topics, Agrarian Reform Secretary Victor Cervera will open an office in Chiapas to help in whatever way it can and to offer alternatives to land demands that cannot be met. 8. To benefit conflict participants under the Amnesty Law, Dr. Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary for the Amnesty Law Commission, is also in Chiapas State. The president explained that in terms of crimes committed prior to the enforcement of the Amnesty Law, the state government, together with the National Indian Institute, will study how to implement a comprehensive system of justice, which will include reforms to the Penal Code. 9. The president also dealt with the issue of peace -- the great goal being sought at this moment in Chiapas State. Let us listen to what the president said: [Begin Salinas recording] We want peace, and not merely to return to the old situation. We want peace, but we want to begin on a new footing. I quote [words indistinct] said: A new stage in Chiapas State of solidarity, respect, support, and construction. This is the promise all of us are making in favor of Chiapas, and I want to tell you [words indistinct]. I am convinced that this will allow us to move ahead in the projects, as was explained here, not only has prevented the solution of urgent problems, but also in- depth problems. [sentence as heard] This is what it is all about, and this will prevent a return to the previous situation. We will confront this situation with the agenda that several of you have outlined, and this will enable us to jointly enter this new stage. [end recording] President Carlos de Gortari's trip was doubtless unexpected, but it was carried out after peasant and Indian organizations last night invited him to travel as soon as possible to Ocosingo or to San Cristobal de las Casas to listen first-hand to those affected by the violence there. On Tuesday, 25 days after the conflict began, the president began his trip at approximately 0800. He arrived at Military Base No. 6 in Tuxtla Gutierrez accompanied by his private secretary (Justo Ceja) and General Arturo Cardona, chief of the presidential general staff. The meeting with the Indians and peasants was held at the Government Palace. After listening to all of the participants -- 20 in all -- the president stressed that the government will comply with all that was promised, adding that it will continue to nurture the project he called Life Through Dialogue, Reason, and Respect for Human Life [para la vida, por la via del dialogo, la razon el respeto a la vida humana]. The president left a message for the people of Chiapas. This message was broadcast over the local radio and television stations. The message justifies the Army's work in Chiapas State. [passage omitted] At about 1500, the president returned to the official Los Pinos residence. Before entering, he was interviewed by reporters. He was asked about the work of Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. The president responded by saying Manuel Camacho has fulfilled the responsibilities he assumed, adding that Camacho Solis has exhibited loyalty to the institutions, the president of the Republic, and the entire Mexican nation. In addition, when asked whether the national solidarity program would remain in effect, the president said solidarity has proven it can produce specific results for the benefit of the poor, and this is why the program will continue to be strengthened, because this has been requested by those who have been helped by the program.
