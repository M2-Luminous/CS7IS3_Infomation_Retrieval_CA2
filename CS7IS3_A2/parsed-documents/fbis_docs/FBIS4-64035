This can be achieved mostly by means of consultations, negotiations and compromises", Ukraine president's spokesman Viktor Stelmakh said in an exclusive interview with TASS on Thursday. Commenting on the decision by Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to strip three newsmen of the Ostankino TV network of their accreditation and on the protest of Russian media chiefs against this decision, the spokesman noted that recently Ukraine had become "an objective of a massed information onslaught by Russian and some foreign mass media", adding that "for some objective reasons, our information capacities cannot be considered adequate". "Perhaps this prompted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to resort to such a drastic measure as a means of self-defence", he explained. According to Stelmakh, Ukraine is also concerned over certain statements by Russian top officials, which he described as "far from being friendly", which cannot but affect relations between the two countries. The spokesman expressed confidence that there would not be any reasons for "raising a question about violation of international law with respect to media representatives" if the two states carry on a constructive dialogue for better mutual understanding and if newsmen comply with rules of journalists' ethics. Stelmakh dismissed recent reports about the possibility of discriminatory measures towards TASS correspondents in Ukraine.
