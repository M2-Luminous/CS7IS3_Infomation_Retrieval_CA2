S. Grachev, Russian Federation Minister of Defense; reprinted with permission from the editor of the journal VOYENNAYA MYSL: "Urgent Problems in the Development and Training of Russian Armed Forces Today"] [Text] The end of the Cold War and positive changes in Eastern Europe and in the Far and Near East are creating fundamentally new conditions promoting a decrease in the level of military confrontation between the East and West, a transition from confrontation to cooperation, and consequently a soon-to-occur reduction in the probability of major wars. At the same time the sources of military danger remain. Principal among them are the presence of sociopolitical, economic, territorial, religious, national, ethnic and other contradictions, and the persisting desire of a number of countries to resolve them by military force. All of this, as well as the breakdown of the unified defense system and the military infrastructure, is having an effect on Russia's military development. The long economic crisis is the most important factor determining the course of military development. The transition to a market economy is gathering momentum today, and the production slump has been surmounted. This necessitated major review of a number of points in the state's military-technical policy, and required the Ministry of Defense to reexamine traditional approaches to outfitting and supplying the armed forces. Thus, the current international situation and the internal political situation in Russia are developing under the influence of extremely contradictory factors, which is why the geopolitical and geostrategic realities on the planet must be accounted for in Russian military development. Military policy is the foundation of military development, determining its orientation and content. The military-political situation that has evolved in the world arena, as well as in adjacent countries and in Russia itself, requires deep analysis of all of its aspects. We are striving to make military policy scientifically substantiated and realistic. Russia's rejection of ideological confrontation is a favorable basis for comprehensive cooperation, including military, with all states, but chiefly with the USA, European countries, Japan and neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Pursuing its military policy, as with any other state Russia must attach priority to its own interests, based on observance of the UN Charter and other international agreements. In this case the priority of political over military resources in preventing and resolving conflicts is being observed, the desire to maintain military-political and strategic stability under the conditions of the new ratio of forces in the world arena is being maintained, and the armed forces and defense matters are under civilian control at all levels of government. The essence of the state's policy regarding military security will be reflected in military doctrine, official adoption of which will promote a proper understanding of Russia's defensive goals and intentions by all states and the world community. Together with other documents it will become the basis for developing and training the armed forces and carrying out military reform, and defining the main directions for the development of military art and military science in general. From my point of view the content of military doctrine must be based on new approaches to the issues of war and peace, and to supporting the country's defensive capability, with regard for the mutual security interests of all states. We have been able to surmount the direct threat of world war. However, we recognize that there are no guarantees yet that the positive changes are irreversible, and that maintaining the country's defense capabilities and strengthening its security are among the most important objectives of the state and the entire nation. The political foundations of military doctrine will rest upon the Russian state's peace-loving policy. We do not intend to attack anyone or use military force to resolve interstate conflicts. The Russian Armed Forces are intended to repel aggression and to provide for the security of their people, and defend Russia's territorial integrity, sovereignty and other vitally important interests. The ways and means of preventing war and possible allies in reaching such an important objective must be examined in military doctrine in accordance with the main goal of the state's policy--ensuring peaceful conditions for the country's comprehensive development. Russia does not view any state of the world community as its enemy. At the same time it would be premature not to consider the realities that may generate tension in interstate relations. Given the nature of my duties--the role of the Minister of Defense is reducing more and more to fulfilling military-political functions--I go abroad rather often, including to NATO countries. I should note that as is true of the leadership of the Russian Federation, the leadership of the North Atlantic alliance is troubled by the problems of developing a system of collective European and global security. We welcome NATO's departure from a strategy oriented on neutralizing the so-called threat from the former USSR and its allies. At the same time a desire by some states (coalitions) to achieve domination over certain regions and the world as a whole, and to incite internal conflicts, which cannot but evoke natural anxiety in Russia, can be observed. We are forced to consider the probability of change in the political course of certain countries, possible attempts at rethinking postwar borders, and the maintenance of armed forces by some states that exceed the needs of defense. Five hundred thirty divisions, 42,000 tanks and 12,000 warplanes are concentrated near Russia's borders. This impressive instrument of war and how politicians will use it in the future is a problem with many unknowns. It is often said today that the situation in the world has changed fundamentally, and that the threat of aggression no longer exists because differences are disappearing from the ideologies of Russia and foreign countries. However, historical experience indicates that the ideas of peace and justice are often found as working concepts in the doctrines of states that are far from peace-loving. Military force is still one of the main instruments of the policy of a large number of countries. We are especially alarmed on one hand by the possibility of proliferation of nuclear and other types of mass destruction weapons, their means of delivery and the latest technologies of military production, and attempts by some countries to use them to realize their own military-political goals; and on the other hand by the increasing threat of international terrorism, including with the use of such weapons. Growth of nationalistic and separatist tendencies and massive violations of universally recognized human rights and freedoms are seriously destabilizing the situation in the world. Under these conditions Russia's military doctrine cannot but consider at least two contradictory tendencies: The first--the desire of nations to create a nonviolent world, to achieve civilized mutual relations, to reinforce measures of trust, and to exclude wars from the arsenal of the means of resolving disputes; the second--the desire of some states to solve international problems from a position of strength, to live by laws under which military force plays an important role in policy, if not the principal one. The latter tendency requires elevated attention, and were circumstances to come together in a particular way, it could bring on armed conflicts and wars. When it comes to the military principles of doctrine per se, it would be suitable to reveal the nature of wars and armed conflicts; to determine the kind of aggression, which the state and its armed forces must be prepared to repel; to direct the development, training and means of combat use of the armed forces. In evaluating military conflicts we need to base ourselves on the fact that the probability of world nuclear or world conventional war is significantly reduced under today's conditions. At the same time the possibility of armed conflicts, of local and regional wars, is not only the same, but it is also increasing. In my opinion the most probable thing would be not direct armed intervention against Russia but its gradually increasing involvement in conflicts started in neighboring countries and regions. Given the complex interrelationships and interdependencies in the interests of different states and peoples, any armed conflict can grow into a major war. Considering the above, the following are the country's main objectives in the area of defense. In peacetime: Preventing military conflicts through a combination of political, diplomatic and other measures and maintenance of the military potential and fighting power of the armed forces at a level ensuring reliable defense of the country's vitally important interests; guarding state borders; cutting off possible provocations and transgressions upon the security of citizens and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. In a period of danger and at the beginning of a war: Promptly adopting the decision to switch the country and the armed forces to a war footing, and practically implementing this decision; mobilizing the country's necessary forces and resources to repel the aggressor; using the possibilities of the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn and isolate the aggressor, and to force him to stop the war and restore peace. Despite reduction of strategic defensive arms on the basis of START-2, it is obvious that nuclear weapons will continue to be the principal element of European and global stability today and in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we view strategic nuclear forces as the most important guarantee of the military security of Russia and its allies. As far as the military doctrines of the USA and other developed states are concerned, they are experiencing certain changes as well. New focuses in evaluating the probability of different wars are a positive aspect of changes in doctrine. However, the general classification of wars adopted in the USA and NATO in the 1980's remains the same. Armed forces have the mission of preparing to fight any kind of war--universal (global) and limited, using nuclear or just conventional weapons, two-sided and coalitional, and of preparing for participation in any possible conflicts. According to the principles of the USA's revamped military strategy, until the end of the 1990's and in the beginning of the next century the outcome of wars employing conventional weapons, should they be started, will be resolved in air, land and sea operations. Nuclear weapons must remain in the background, performing the role of strategic "deterrence." At the same time should the situation grow worse in the course of conventional wars, the possibility of using nuclear weapons is not excluded. Thus in determining the new approaches to ensuring Russia's defense and military security, we need to base ourselves primarily on a comprehensive assessment of the current military-political situation, and of the changes that have already occurred and will occur in the world and in our country. The nature and tendencies in the development of the international situation and the internal situation in Russia and in CIS countries are creating exceptionally complex conditions for the development of Russian Armed Forces. The main goal of the present stage of development of the Russian Federation Armed Forces is to create qualitatively new armies and fleets meeting the requirements of the present military, political and strategic situation in the world and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and reflecting the trends of its development and the real degree of military danger. In this case the numerical strength and structure of the RF Armed Forces must correspond to the missions assigned to them, to the economic, demographic and other possibilities of Russia, and to agreements on reducing armed forces. As we know, Russia was among the last of the union republics of the disintegrated USSR to begin creating its own armed forces, but there were reasons for this. There was simply no other alternative in the situation that established itself by May 1992. The president, the Russian Supreme Soviet and the Ministry of Defense had a question to answer: What should the Army and Navy be? I feel that considering the geostrategic situation and the geopolitical interests of Russia, its armed forces must be highly mobile, and outfitted with modern equipment and armament. We need to do away with the large, slow-moving, hard-to-control armed forces of the former USSR which are now part of the Russian Army and Navy, but we also need to make maximum use of their potential. Our proposals have been supported by the country's leadership. In this case a real possibility has appeared for reducing the armed forces and easing the excessive burden of military expenditures. Two highly important principles of ensuring military security are at the basis of the concept approved by the Russian president for the development of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces: The first--deterring any aggressor from world nuclear and conventional war by maintaining the Strategic Nuclear Forces in a state allowing them to retaliate with the needed effectiveness under any conditions. The second--deterring an aggressor from starting regional and local wars and armed conflicts by creating general-purpose force groupings (covering forces, mobile forces, Supreme High Command reserves) guaranteeing repulsion of aggression and ensuring the possibility for promptly augmenting the armed forces as the scale of military activities increases. As we know, the Russian Armed Forces are being reorganized in stages. With regard for current conditions, formation of new armed forces groupings on Russian territory has been started, planned reduction of their numerical strength and force composition is proceeding, reorganization of the central administration of the Ministry of Defense and of force structures and transition to a combined manning principle (through the draft and through voluntary enlistment on a contract basis) have been started, the principal measures associated with development of the armed forces in the immediate future (up to 1995) have been determined more specifically, and the directions of their future reorganization (to the year 2000) are being developed. As a result of the work done thus far, the overall numerical strength of the Russian Army and Navy has been decreased by over 260,000 servicemen. There are plans for maximally decreasing the number of large combined units and units of reduced strength. An active effort is being made to conclude formation of a new military-technical policy having the main goal of comprehensively solving the problems of equipping the Army and Navy with contemporary models of armament and military equipment under the conditions of a significant reduction in appropriations, conversion of military industry and new economic relations. On the whole, the results of the first stage confirm the correctness of the selected course for development and reorganization of the Russian Armed Forces. However, the complex economic conditions in the country are making this work difficult. Formation of the armed forces and the creation of the basis for their extensive transformation are foreseen in 1993-1995. During this period, creation of force groupings will be continued, withdrawal of forces from other countries into Russia will be basically completed, and the numerical strength of the armed forces will be reduced to 1.5 million persons by 1995, as determined by the law "On Defense." We concurrently plan to create a military infrastructure capable of supporting stable function of force groupings and their command and control in peace and in war. And finally, we need to carry out comprehensive research with which to substantiate the numerical strength, force composition and structure of the armed forces that will be required after 1995. Later on (after 1995) we plan to finish establishment of qualitatively new armed forces, which means radically transforming their structure, switching to a combined manning system, forming force groupings, and creating the military infrastructure on Russian territory. The planned volume and deadlines for development and reorganization of the Russian Armed Forces are naturally not written in stone. They will change under the influence of external and internal conditions. In addition to the problems of developing the armed forces, developing the theory of the art of war is acquiring no less important significance. Under today's conditions the role of strategy is increasing significantly. It must first of all determine the nature and content of possible military conflicts, and the conditions under which they arise. It will predetermine the nature of tasks directed on one hand at finding effective military-political ways of averting war, and on the other hand at revealing the laws, principles, forms and means of preparing for and conducting armed conflict; at developing specific measures by which to prepare the country directly to repel aggression promptly and the means of modern strategic development of the armed forces and their commitment to war; and at providing leadership to them. Developing scientifically substantiated recommendations and the military-technical means of averting war should be considered to be the central task of the theory of strategy. It stands to reason that world war must be averted chiefly by political means, and this should be reflected in defensive activity. As I see it, a prompt and adequate response to actions by an aggressor preparing for an attack may be considered to be the essence of deterrence. In peacetime this will force him to reject armed attack because of the inevitability of retaliation, while in wartime it will restrain him from using nuclear weapons and other mass destruction weapons, limit the scale and intensity of military actions, and force their termination under terms acceptable to us. The solution to this problem depends on the readiness to strike a possible adversary at any time with losses that would be unacceptable to him. Taking this into account, important significance is attached in military art to developing a system of measures to prepare the country for the repulsion of possible aggression. The main ones are: Developing doctrinal principles and concepts defining the actions to be taken by the Russian Armed Forces to repel aggression; theoretically studying and practically mastering new forms of armed conflict and the most effective means of defeating enemy groupings; developing and practically implementing a new system of mobilizational deployment, and of preparing and committing reserves; improving the system for training staffs and forces; preparing effective fortifications in the Russian Federation. Changes in the nature of military threats and defense objectives require more precise definition of the possible forms of strategic actions and combat use of armed forces. From my point of view, under today's conditions they may include: Strategic deployment of the armed forces (partial for armed conflicts and for local and regional wars, and full for repulsion of major aggression); use of armed forces in armed conflicts and in local and regional wars; use of armed forces in major war. Strategic deployment of the armed forces has highly important significance to organized repulsion of aggression. The main requirement on it is that it be based on real military-political and operational-strategic conditions of carrying out missions in a particular evolving situation. This was rarely done in the past. There was often a gap between political and strategic considerations and the system of combat and mobilizational readiness. Consequently, the means and the organization of strategic deployment must develop with regard for the possibilities of potential adversaries for carrying out aggression in any form. Under the new conditions, special attention should be turned to the theory of preparing and conducting strategic operations in regions (strategic sectors), which will play the decisive role in conventional warfare. Unfortunately, in the postwar years the forces were ready either for offensive or for defensive forms of combat activities. This was hardly right. We cannot ignore the objective principles and laws of armed conflict. If an enemy begins aggression, we have the right to select and use those types, forms and means of military action which would be the most effective under the given situation. This could mean both offense and defense. In solving the problems of repelling aggression in different regions and sectors, we need to take a differentiated approach that accounts for the real political, economic and strategic situation. We must not give contiguous states the grounds for interpreting our actions as provocative, but at the same time we do not have the right to fall behind in the development of military affairs. In preparing the armed forces we need to keep in mind that in the initial period of war, defense must ensure the possibility of successful repulsion of enemy aggression in the absence of previously fortified lines. They will have to be prepared in the course of the developing invasion--that is, simultaneously with conducting defensive engagements with forces that are not fully deployed. This is precisely the time when commanders of all ranks must display initiative in reasonably combining different means of conducting defensive operations. We are in favor of stubborn defense, but we must also know how to maneuver. This is especially important today. The field manuals of 1942 and 1943 contain special chapters devoted to defensive maneuver, but we have forgotten about it. In developing our guidelines we need to expand our treatment of this problem. It is now the turn for our military scientists working on the problems of operational art and tactics to make their contribution. Offensive operations should obviously assume their place in the theory of military art as well. At the same time we cannot forget the counteroffensive, which was so widely employed during the Great Patriotic War. A number of problems are arising in connection with air and air defense operations in a strategic area, and with the enemy's defeat in ocean and sea regions. Given the present nature of armed conflict, the effectiveness of all forms of operations and of strategic and operational actions will depend to an increasingly greater degree on the reliability of troop command and control. The problems of raising the combat readiness of command and control units, the efficiency of their work, the viability of control posts and communication systems, and wide use of automated control resources have acquired special acuity. A number of immediate steps will have to be taken to raise the effectiveness of the principal forms of operational, psychological, technical and rear support. All of this must be reflected in the manuals being currently written to regulate the use of the armed forces, and it needs to be meticulously honed in the course of operational and combat training. I feel that under today's conditions we need to lay our emphasis mainly on preparing command and control units and maintaining them at a level ensuring dependable leadership of forces in both peace and war. Russia's complex economic position forces us to count every kopeck. This is why there are plans, in the immediate future, for training command and control units at command-and-staff exercises, which are to be carried out under the leadership of senior chiefs, with the wide use of automation resources. Of course, the best form of training of staffs and forces is major troop exercises. However, circumstances are evolving in such a way that we need to devote our main attention today to training tactical subunits, to teaching them to work together, and to developing firm skills in the personnel in the use of military equipment and weapons. Fundamental changes in the military-political situation and in the development of the resources of armed conflict are raising the role of science, including military science, to an unprecedented level. This is explained by the fact that fundamentally new directions are opening up in the development of military affairs, by the continuing existence of posssibilities for the armies of the most highly developed states to achieve military-technical superiority as a result of the creation of new models of high-precision weapons, as well as of weapons based on new physical principles with destructive force close to that of nuclear weapons, and by other factors. Military science is faced by extremely serious tasks associated with theoretical development of the problems of developing and using the armed forces, equipping them, and substantiating the structure and optimum composition of every armed service, branch of troops and special troops. However, it should be noted that the economic difficulties the country is experiencing are having a negative effect on the solution of many problems. For example, while the models of attack resources we have are quite modern, in terms of many parameters we are behind in the resources of their information support, and in command, control and communication systems. We are behind in electronics, and without a highly developed microelectronic base, it is difficult to count on generally raising the country's industrial, scientific and technical potential, and on maintaining Russia's defense capabilities at a modern level. In the immediate future we need to consolidate the positions we have gained, and then devote special attention to technologies which predetermine the industrial might of the country and the fighting potential of the armed forces. Nor can we ignore the technology of so-called artificial intelligence. In a number of countries (chiefly the United States of America) "artificial intelligence" resources, which represent the apex of technical progress, have already undergone their period of development and have earned the right of citizenship. They can be used in developing the armed forces, controlling combat activities and weapon systems, training the personnel, and so on. We are significantly behind in this area. We also need to consider that shortcomings in modern combat systems and resources cannot be compensated by either military art or quantity, as was confirmed by the war in the Persian Gulf zone. In order to catch up, we need to conduct scientific research and experimental design work at a forced pace. In this case, the real influence scientific research has upon solving the practical problems of developing the armed forces and raising their combat readiness must be the main criterion of the effectiveness and results of this research. Timely introduction of scientific accomplishments into practical activities is acquiring special significance. Solution of this problem involves improving the forms and methods of operational, mobilizational and combat training of troop command and control units. Scientific work in the forces and fleets must consist primarily of generalizing the experience of exercises and introducing research results into the practice of operational and combat training. Research in military history requires revamping. Study of the experience of local wars is acquiring special significance today. Local wars and conflicts (both large and small) directly influence stability in the world, global development of policy and the disposition of military-political forces, as was confirmed by events in the Persian Gulf. However, this does not mean that we should weaken attention to the Great Patriotic War--the richest treasure house of combat experience. In connection with celebration of the 50th anniversary of the war's most important events, we need to activate the study of military history with the purpose of deeply analyzing operations and extracting practically valuable lessons. Declassification of archival documents and materials should be considerably helpful. Objective analysis of these materials will make it possible to reveal both the sources of our victories and the causes of failures. Thus, life itself is requiring us to create new armed forces and to eliminate the significant gap between the composition, structure and numerical strength of troop groupings inherited from the former USSR, and the real needs of Russia's defense, between the nature of modern wars and the traditional forms of the use of troop groupings. The most unique feature of solving these problems is that in addition to ensuring reliable defense of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the fatherland, and of its state interests against external threats, new tasks are arising before the armed forces today: Closely coordinating with bodies of state government and administration, making a transition to a new manning system, providing social protections to servicemen and their families, and resurrecting the prestige of military service and the system of military-patriotic values and ideals. It should be noted, in conclusion, that the time has come to initiate broad discussion of all problems in the military-theoretical journal VOYENNAYA MYSL and other military publications, with the participation of scientists and scientific collectives, in order to permit subsequent generalization and implementation of the most sensible ideas and proposals. We are standing before the need for shaping, reorganizing and reducing the Russian Armed Forces, and within a short period of time at that. The desire to accomplish these tasks in one or two years is growing stronger in some circles of our society. However, the social, political and economic situation in Russia doesn't allow us to do this. Military development is proceeding under complex internal and international conditions, and it requires meticulous, extremely lengthy work. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 8 1993
