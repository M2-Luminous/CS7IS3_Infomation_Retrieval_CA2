Under the agreement, the Kazakh-Turkish MU NAY company jointly established by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation and the Kazakh oil company will begin production in August. The agreement was signed by Veysel Atasoy, minister of energy and natural resources, and by Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan deputy prime minister. In a speech at the signing ceremony, Atasoy said that oil exploration has ended in Kazakhstan and no obstacles remain before production. Abishev said, in turn, that his country wants to share its riches with Turkey. He pointed out that with the agreement, Turkey is no longer an oil-consumer but an oil-producer. In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television after the signing ceremony, Atasoy said that the agreement covers a period of 36 years: 11 for exploration and 25 for production. The Turkish Petroleum Corporation will invest for exploration, while the two sides will share the investment for production in proportion to their shares. Of the oil to be produced as of August 1994, 206,000 tonnes will be brought to Turkey. The total oil reserves in the area are estimated to be $4 billion barrels. At the end of 1995, 130,000 barrels of oil and 13.5 million cubic meters of gas will be produced daily. The agreement envisages daily productions of 481,000 barrels of oil in 2001 and 68.5 million cubic meters of gas in 2002. [Begin Atasoy recording] The oil reserves in our shared area with Kazakhstan is estimated to be 4 billion barrels and the gas reserves to be 387 billion cubic meters. Of this, 2.16 billion barrels of oil and 208.9 billion cubic meters of gas belong to the Turkish Petroleum Corporation. In dollar terms, this means we will save $32.4 billion from the oil and $16.7 billion from the gas. In other words, a total of $49.1 billion will be saved in a period of 25 to 26 years. Turkey will close its energy deficit. Of course, natural gas is as important for us as oil. Environmental issues are very important in our day. Natural gas is the cleanest source of energy. In the future, we are thinking of building natural gas power stations.

[Begin Ciller recording] Our share of the production there will be almost as much as our production in Turkey. Our revenues will be about $1 billion yearly as of next year. We aim at expanding this further in the future. This is a very happy occasion for us. [end recording]
