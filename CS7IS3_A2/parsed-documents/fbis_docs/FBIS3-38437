Ver." interview with Rete leader Leoluca Orlando; place and date not given: "Orlando: It Is All the PDS' Fault"; first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] [Excerpts] Rome -- Leoluca Orlando took a mouthful, then said: "Now that we have won on all fronts...." Another mouthful: "...We must be careful over the issue of candidates...." A third mouthful: "...because we must offer the voters a credible progressive alignment." [passage omitted] [CORRIERE] Why do you say that you have won on all fronts? [Orlando] Because we have secured acceptance at the negotiations among the progressive forces of the idea that the socialist stance is not represented exclusively by [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco. Because Craxi, De Michelis, and Di Donato are no longer present in the new PSI. Because the impossibility of standing for reelection has caused La Malfa to veer off toward the Christian Democrats, thus fragmenting the PRI [Italian Republican Party]. Because my doubts about [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who is with the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and not with us, are now gaining substance. Are these enough successes? [passage omitted] [CORRIERE] Let us return to what is happening in Rome. Let us talk about the progressive forces' candidates in the coming general election. [Orlando] I say we must beware of quick-change acts at the local level. We will pay close attention to ensure that this danger does not materialize. We will also implement the following principle rigorously -- each candidate's establishment at the local level. [CORRIERE] Do you mean that you will field all the candidates in Sicily? [Orlando] Why not? Will the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] not do the same in Emilia? It is a democratic practice.... [CORRIERE] But your allies would not like the idea of a Rete candidate standing in all Sicily's constituencies. [Orlando] No, not in every constituency, but in almost all. In any case, our strength is very well established in Sicily. We could even compete on our own, but we are not doing so. We decided to align with other forces: This is the meaning of the alliance. [CORRIERE] Is it a government alliance or merely an election cartel? [Orlando] It is an alliance that for the present is aiming at victory. [CORRIERE] Yes, but then what? [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema is talking in terms of a government with [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli.... [Orlando] I disagree with approaches to the man who is now again putting forward the 1960's model of the DC's position as linchpin. Moreover, there must be rather more respect for the voters; they must be offered an option characterized by a clear break. [CORRIERE] Is it true that Rete has offered to field Naples District Attorney Agostino Cordova as a candidate? [Orlando] I spoke with Mr. Cordova over the telephone 10 days ago, and I certainly could not discuss such matters. We have not met or spoken since then. [CORRIERE] Are you also obsessed with fielding magistrates as candidates? [Orlando] Actually, I am opposed to magistrates' standing as candidates if they are conducting criminal investigations. Or, rather, I believe that if a judge wants to engage in active politics, he must first resign. It would be a sign of the judiciary's independence, and I will be proposing this in the progressive forces' negotiations.
