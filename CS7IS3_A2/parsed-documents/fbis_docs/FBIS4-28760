With regard to the announcement by North Korea on the evening of 13 June that it would withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "We are not sure about its real intention." However, since North Korea has not indicated it would also withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), MOFA is unable to determine whether the DPRK has now adopted a completely confrontational line. MOFA is watching North Korean reaction when former U.S. President Jimmy Carter pays a visit this week. According to a senior MOFA official some people in the ministry believe that "North Korea is still groping for a solution through dialogue." They see the behavior of the DPRK during Carter's visit as one indicator by which to judge the intention behind the announcement to withdraw from the IAEA. Meanwhile, Kakizawa called ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on 13 June to inform Han of the substance of his discussions on 12 June with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen concerning the North Korean nuclear issue. Han expressed the hope that Japan would continue to exert efforts to persuade China to play a constructive role. The two foreign ministers confirmed that Japan and the ROK will keep in close contact.
