FBIS4-5639 "dreas071_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Philippines Romulo on Dispute With Malaysia Over Maids Romulo on Dispute With Malaysia Over Maids BK1104063794 Quezon City Radio Filipinas in English 0230 GMT 11 Apr 94 BK1104063794 Quezon City Radio Filipinas English BFN [Text] Leading Malaysian journalist has criticized what he called the highhandedness of his country's enforcement agencies dealing with immigrants. Kadir Jasin, editor of Malaysia's influential NEW STRAITS TIMES, was referring in its Sunday weekly column to the roundup by Malaysian police on Palm Sunday of more than 1,000 Filipino maids in front of a Catholic church in Kuala Lumpur. In his column, Kadir said he did not think many Malaysians were pleased by the highhandedness by enforcement agencies in the operations against foreigners. In the operations, 711 Filipino maids were detained. All but 33 of them were later released after their employers produced their work permits. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed directed authorities, including the police, to exercise greater care when carrying raids of suspected illegal workers in places of worship. As this developed, Prime Minister Mahathir is reported sending to Manila a personal emissary to meet with President Ramos on the Palm Sunday arrest. Meantime, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo says the Philippine Government has reached what he called a meeting of the minds with Malaysia on how to cool down the dispute. Romulo said he and the Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi have agreed to discuss the matter in a joint commission set up last year. That commission carries the task of improving bilateral relations chilled by a 30-year-old Philippine claim of Malaysia's Sabah State. Speaking of Sabah, President Ramos has evaded making a direct response to a proposal raised in Congress for the revival of the country's claim to Sabah. Speaking to reporters in Cebu in the Visayas, the president said Malacanang [presidential office] will issue a statement today on its position on the proposal. Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo presented a proposal the other day asking President Ramos to again assert the Philippines' territorial claim of Sabah. Arroyo made the proposal shortly after Senator Ernesto Herrera suggested that the Philippine Government withdraws its invitation to Malaysia's ceremonial king to visit Manila beginning this Thursday to Saturday.
