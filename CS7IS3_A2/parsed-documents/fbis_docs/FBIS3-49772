Or is it really a continuation of the methods employed so far? This is the diagnosis that the participants of a seminar organized by the Economic Sciences Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences tried to make. According to Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, who participated in the seminar, the weakness of the ownership transformation processes carried out so far has been the lack of a privatization strategy, linking it to the economic policy, lack of the criteria for the evaluation of the transformations, and analyses of their effects. The founders' supervision over the partnerships was insufficient; however, these shortcomings are not being eliminated. There are still difficulties in communicating with trade unions. Privatization with the participation of private individuals acting as strategic investors was also not always successful. Motivation for privatization is still only passive (the desire to escape dividends and the popiwek--tax on excessive wage increases--or the managers' desire to maintain a "row of souls" in the enterprise). The characteristic feature of Polish ownership transformations is also the modest participation of capital privatization; employee's privatization is dominating, which large enterprises advised against. In the past, the ownership laws were not set in order; it concerns reprivatization and cooperative property. Minister Kaczmarek wants to continue employing the privatization techniques that have been used so far; however, at the same time, along with other ministries, he intends to draw up a "privatization map." The map will show strategic areas, in which the Treasury will maintain most of the shares, and the other areas, which will not be limited in ownership transformations. Privatization procedures will be set in order. It is also planned that a dormant path of privatization--that is, auctions--will be established. The minister believes that most of the property that could be sold at once was actually sold; the rest of the enterprises need restructuring before this could be done. This is supposed to be achieved through the program of National Investment Funds, EFSAL [expansion unknown] and the SRP [expansion unknown], financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community. The scientists participating in the seminar focused first on remarks concerning the transformations that have been made so far, as well as on conclusions concerning the future. According to Barbara Blaszczyk, in the "Directions of Privatization" for 1994, too many priorities were adopted; therefore, it will be difficult to implement all of them. So far, the employees' privatization, powered by the initiative "from below," has been the quickest; therefore, the "Pact on State Enterprise" unnecessarily imposes on enterprises a six-month period for selecting a privatization path. The employees of large and good enterprises--for example, those that are sent to the Stock Exchange--gain too much in privatization. In comparison with other countries, the overall balance sheet of privatization looks good; it is just a pity that some partnerships have become stuck in the intermediate stage. According to Tadeusz Kowalik, the tensions concerning privatization need to be lessened; however, he does not know whether the minister will manage to achieve this. Privatization should be accelerated, but this process must be healthier than it has been so far. According to Anna Fornalczyk, privatization depended on politics, it still does, and it will continue to depend on it; however, efforts will have to be made to eliminate it. In Poland, there is still not enough evaluation of privatization results; therefore, continuous monitoring [preceding word in English] must be established. Maria Jarosz believes that employees' partnerships should be looked upon as a transitional form; she adds that they should be allowed to look for capital and to concentrate on property. Zofia Dobska fears that partial privatization--where the Treasury keeps some of the shares--is not being employed as much as it should be. In the meantime, as a result of the recession, which is felt not only in Poland, the prices that are arrived at in transactions are not really satisfactory. The lack of foreign capital should be explained by the fact that, in recent years, privatization in the postsocialist states has amounted to merely 5 percent of the global ownership transformations; 25 percent in Third World countries and 75 percent in developed countries [as published]. While answering questions, Minister Kaczmarek mentioned the possibility of supporting privatization through the emission of obligations, which could be converted into ownership titles, and the establishment of a system of credit pledges guaranteed by the state.
