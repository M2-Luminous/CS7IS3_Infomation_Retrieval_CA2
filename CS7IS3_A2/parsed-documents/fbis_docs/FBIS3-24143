Judging by court statistics, there was also no gangsterism. But when special subunits in the fight against organized crime were finally established, "an unexpected discovery" followed: being without them is like being without hands. And the most drastic type of modern crimes is their stock in trade: rackets, hostages, and gangster showdowns. War every day. Novices have assumed leading roles. The Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime (RUOP) was established two years ago, and from its very first days it has been headed by Colonel of Militia Vladimir Rushaylo. [Danilkin] Vladimir Borisovich, recently employees of your directorate had a housewarming, when you had to exchange the legendary address of 38 Petrovka for 6 Shabolovka... [Rushaylo] Yes, we moved to a separate house, but it is not necessary to search for any secret reasons or undercurrents, or for distrust toward the rest of the militia service. It simply became too crowded for us at 38 Petrovka, inasmuch as the number of our employees had increased, and rather significantly. We were forced to take this step. Incidentally, thanks to the concern of the Government of Moscow and the mayor. [Danilkin] If it is not a secret, by how much did the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employee staff increase? [Rushaylo] During the last year--fourfold. Judging from the situation, this is not the maximum. Many call our subunit elite. I do not regard this as superiority over other services, but as the level of demands that are made on us. [Danilkin] So, two years have gone by. In your opinion, has the new subunit justified the hopes that were associated with its creation? [Rushaylo] It would be improper to give an evaluation of one's own work, but I think that it is possible to claim that we have succeeded in occupying a noticeable niche in the law enforcement area. Organized crime is a phenomenon that is purely social, intruding into all spheres and trying to get ahead of the law enforcement system, mastering increasingly newer types of crimes. Owing to this, certain dead zones are being organized, which our militia branch services were not succeeding in looking into, as narrow departmental barriers interfered. But we use simultaneously the principle of criminal search (from the criminal offense to the person) and the principle of the subunit in the fight against economic crime (from the person to the crime), with the latter dominating. We are able to take in those dead zones, which have begun to turn into volcanoes. For example, a crime has been happening here recently which we previously only heard about, or knew very little about. For example, extortion: As recently as 1986 there were four cases in all of Moscow. But in the past year alone we have registered 333 cases, and, consider this, this type of crime is one of those that are especially latent. Or kidnapping people to obtain a ransom, as we say, seizing hostages: two cases were registered in 1990, and last year here there were 77 citizens' appeals for a similar reason, and 62 criminal cases were instituted. Finally, in January of this year 30 citizens filed complaints with us regarding seizure of hostages. Our employees worked on each case, freeing the people. [Danilkin] But how many criminal cases on seizure of hostages were instituted? For example, in January? [Rushaylo] Unfortunately, only six. Inasmuch as the article of the Criminal Code "Seizure of Hostages"--the jurisdiction of the Procuracy--allows for ambiguity in the classification of the crime, which leads to casuistic legal games. We are trying to conduct a practical dialogue with the Procuracy, but for the present we are able to bring only a third of the cases to a juridical result. [Danilkin] Organized crime is feeding on the particular weakness in the sphere of the economy... [Rushaylo] In connection with the fact that the state sector has almost disappeared completely, numerous associations with limited responsibility have appeared, but, as we say, with unlimited opportunities. In this situation criminal groups, especially of an ethnic orientation, have set themselves up quite successfully. They are organizing associations that would seem to be engaged in commercial activity. But they are in fact laundering criminal money. Frequently, the very trade kiosks that congest the city are used as a cover for criminal activity. [Danilkin] Are our mafiosi laundering money, taking the experience of their Western colleagues into account? [Rushaylo] The traditional spheres of organized criminal activity in the West are the gambling business, prostitution, and drugs. In our country, organized crime has chosen other types of trade; for example, extortion is rather widespread. A so-called protection tax is imposed on businessmen. The criminals approach a commercial structure: "Do you have a `roof'? What are you standing under?"--this is nothing other than extortion, and it brings in colossal incomes. Some prefer not to make a fuss, and make the payoffs. Anyone who appealed to us received professional assistance.. [Danilkin] It is said that almost all entrepreneurs are covered with this same "roof?" [Rushaylo] It is impossible to give a precise figure. But it is impossible to say that absolutely everyone is paying tribute. More than a dozen people come to us every day with complaints. And many of them say that the extortionists had approached them for the first time. It is advantageous for the criminals to spread rumors that everyone is paying up. Then it is easier for them to tell people: "If everyone else is paying--why are you not paying up?" A psychological working-over goes on. [Danilkin] Thus, it turns out that you have to work in various directions. But how in your opinion did Moscow organized crime spot your unit? How dangerous an opponent are you? [Rushaylo] First of all, it is necessary to make a reservation--at the present time there is no single organized crime structure in Moscow. There are a number of organized crime groups: regional, ethnic, interregional, and transnational. Internecine wars rage continuously between them for spheres of influence. So, for these groups the regional directorates for fighting organized crime frequently become a bone in the throat. Our opponents' arsenal includes threats, intimidation, attempts to influence our relatives--we feel all of this personally, since we have occasion to affect someone's criminal interests all the time. [Danilkin] And how do you react to such threats? [Rushaylo] In an appropriate way. We guard our people, and we are in a position to protect them. However, credit must also be given to the opposing side; they have begun to approach "raids" on the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime in a creative way. [Danilkin] What do you mean? [Rushaylo] I have in mind an organized campaign to discredit the subunits in the fight against organized crime. A whole series of articles have appeared in the press recently which, trying to "scoop" us, "expose" our employees and our operations. No, we are not suffering from megalomania and infallibility, we have ordinary people working for us who make mistakes and miscalculations. But from the articles I have in mind, the telltale signs were too strong. We later conducted our own small investigation and we have an idea how much these articles cost somebody. [Danilkin] Are you not too categorical in your conclusions? [Rushaylo] Not at all. In all the articles there is one thought on the surface: Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime members fire at whatever comes to mind, they are creating tyranny, and guiltless citizens are suffering. [Danilkin] But what is really the case? [Rushaylo] For this it is necessary to return to reported cases. For example, the incident at the Koptevo bathhouses in November of last year. Here is the sense of the information released in the newspapers: Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employees opened fire for no reason on a suspicious group of men in a residential rayon, as a result of which one of them died under obscure circumstances, and two militia men were wounded. It is totally incomprehensible, on the other hand, it is a pity about the member of the Koptevo group who was a victim. But this is the way the official investigation interprets the events. An operational group was surveilling Zhiguli's, one of whose passengers had a weapon. The militia employees stopped the car at the Koptevo bathhouses and asked for documents. In response to this, a passenger in the Zhiguli snatched a screwdriver and struck an employee in the face. Almost simultaneously shots were fired in the direction of the militia employees from three cars standing nearby, and afterwards a dozen men armed with baseball bats, knives, and guns went after the militiamen. Only then did they employ their official weapons. As you see, there is a substantial difference in the description of the events. [Danilkin] What other articles are you talking about? [Rushaylo] The events of 25 January at the Izmailovo hotel complex are described in this same vein: operatives opened a barrage of fire on a Cherokee jeep because, as it seemed to them, people from an Izmailovo group were sitting in the vehicle. The jeep jumped into the oncoming lane and collided with an oncoming vehicle, whose passengers perished in the crash. There was not a word about the fact that before this, the jeep, coming out of a chase, rammed into a militia Zhiguli (one of the employees incurred concussion of the brain), that sitting in the jeep was the authority of an Izmailovo criminal group who was under federal investigation for robbery with use of firearms, that they fired at the wheels... A militia operation in the private club White Cockroach was described in the same vein. [Danilkin] Do you want to say that the Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime has declared a psychological war? [Rushaylo] We have always been in a state of war with crime. It is simply that new, legal forms of struggle against us have emerged. And we must be prepared for this. For discreditation of our employees, unfounded accusations, and fabricated compromising material. These methods are known throughout the world. [Danilkin] How do you intend to react to such accusations? [Rushaylo] I can firmly promise our opponents one thing: Any attempt by criminals to employ weapons against our employees will end with one and the same thing--we will shoot to defeat them. This is our tough, principled position. No kinds of rumors or planned accusations of alleged illegal actions will prevent our employees from acting within the scope of the law and the powers granted them. Incidentally, the series of newspaper articles apparently lack one more thing. The other day, during the arrest of a group of criminals, a Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employee shot one of them. It happened this way: When a bandit pulled out a TT [Tula Tokarev] pistol with a bullet in the cartridge chamber and pointed it at the operative, the militia employee proved to be faster on the draw. Now we are awaiting a new description of our "criminal errors." [Danilkin] But you will agree that it was just a few years ago that every time the militia used a weapon was almost a sensation and a reason for endless justifications. [Rushaylo] Yes, it happened. The press wrote for a whole week about a mentally ill person who fired a hunting rifle several times from a balcony, and the entire militia leadership came to the scene of the incident. Today shots can be heard on Moscow streets every day. How can this wave of violence be stopped? Only with harsh measures. But, I emphasize, within the scope of the law. In the last five years crime in Moscow has increased by a factor of three. Our service often frees four to five hostages in a day, we are fired upon, we confiscate mountains of weapons, drugs... [Danilkin] Do you not get the impression that Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime employees are now working in an "emergency first aid routine"--there are not enough hands despite regular increases in the size of the directorate? [Rushaylo] There is such a danger. But we are counting on the people's understanding and the support of the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the municipal authorities. This will greatly help us in suppressing the criminals' ever-increasing onslaught. * * * In one day, just before this material was sent to press, employees of the Moscow Regional Directorate for Fighting Organized Crime arrested a group of hired killers from Saransk (four murders), a crime kingpin, and three authorities in the criminal world; prevented the theft of money in the sum of 2.4 million French francs; solved six crimes; confiscated four firearms; and began work on seven complaints that came in that day.
