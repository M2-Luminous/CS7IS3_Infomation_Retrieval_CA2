He was reported as warning that no one should approach the plane, and reiterating his demand to talk to the press. Two members of the Carabinieri police and one of the Italian police force were reported as being on the passenger list. The plane was surrounded, at a safe distance, by large numbers of Carabinieri and other police, as well as 50 or so firemen. Cizio was reported to be brandishing a package he said contained a hand grenade; talking with police and Meridiana officials on the plane radio, he is believed to have declared his intention to publicise an "injustice" he received in a recent judicial inquiry. Cizio has a record of petty crime including burglary and "verbally assaulting a public official". Rome police chief Fernando Masone was reportedly on his way to the airport.
