After the failure of two major deals France is expecting to win the missile order. Balladur's lengthy letter is dated 2 March, and Carl Bildt replied on 10-11 March. According to information from French sources, Carl Bildt's more than three page reply in French was perceived as "cool" and "gave rise to gloom" in Paris. Both letters have been classified as secret in the Cabinet Office's computer system. The last day for tenders in the missile deal was 15 March. The value of the deals totals 3 to 5 billion kronor. Three companies are fighting for the order: France's Matra with the Mica missile, British Aerospace with Active Skyflash, and the United States' Hughes/Raytheon with the Amraam missile. The Defense Materiel Administration, FMV, has begun evaluation of the bids. France is mourning the failed Volvo-Renault fusion and the loss of the tank deal, which was worth 7 to 10 billion kronor. Now the French want revenge and have clearly placed the missile deal at the highest political level. According to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources in France and Sweden, Balladur's letter to Bildt can be taken as sarcastic in places, but at the same time it is diplomatic and cleverly written. However, there is a clear underlying message that now it is France's turn. Balladur gives Bildt an account of the missile's advantages and of the industrial gains that can be achieved through Swedish-French missile cooperation -- this chiefly affects Saab Missiles in Linkoping and Ericsson Radar Electronics in Molndal. Ericsson already has a contract with Matra regarding the radio link between the aircraft and the missile and is negotiating with the French to also manufacture the target seeker. If these negotiations succeed and Saab Missiles becomes involved in the comprehensive work of integration and in the fitting of the robot and its electronics systems on the aircraft, this will lead to more secure employment in the hard-pressed Swedish missile industry. In his reply to Balladur Carl Bildt points out that an official purchase procedure is taking place involving the customary bidding practices and that the Swedish Government will reach a decision on the basis of the Air Force's needs and the merits of the various missiles. In the formal letter Carl Bildt leaves no room for a generous interpretation of France's advantage. Competition for the missile deal is tough. Some time ago the U.S. Pentagon announced that the FMV had asked to buy 500 Amraam missiles valued at 3.7 billion kronor. The FMV subsequently announced that no decision has been reached and that scrutiny of the bids will continue. In January the head of the FMV's air force materiel department, Major General Sven-Olof Hokborg, became defense attache in Washington. He is said to be fighting hard for the United States to win the order and a few weeks ago a group of missile experts from Hughes/Raytheon paid a study visit to Sweden. An important question is whether the United States really is prepared to allow the further export of Jas-39 Gripens equipped with Amraam missiles. The U.S. Congress keeps careful check on further exports and has in the past been particularly restrictive. The United States has not even permitted the testing of Amraam on foreign soil, both Britain and Germany have been refused permission. It is still unclear how many missiles Sweden is planning to buy. But according to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's information, it is likely to be quite a lot less than 800. Neither Amraam, Mica, nor Active Skyflash is likely to be able to resist the missile threat which is growing rapidly in the world. Modern wars are to a large extent about air supremacy and missiles as weapons to be used against important central military installations and attack systems. It is possible that the government will decide to buy a smaller number of missiles now and then invest in the next generation. Intensive discussions are taking place between Matra and British Aerospace about a possible merger. Saab Missiles and Ericsson are waiting in the wings. The four companies could come to play an important role in the next generation of radar attack missiles. The choice facing the government is to continue along a traditional transatlantic path with regard to the purchase of military materiel from the United States, a technological superpower, or choose a European path with the possiblity of cooperation and mergers with Europe's defense industries. FMV is expected to nominate the winners of the missile deal in the course of the spring and the government will probably reach its decision before the summer recess.
