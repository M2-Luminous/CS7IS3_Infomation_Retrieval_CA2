Three people were injured. The explosion occurred just after 0830 [1130 GMT] when embassy employees opened the door to the offices on the 9th floor. According to Alberto Crescenti, director general of the SAME [expansion unknown], the explosion at Paseo Colon 279 caused eye problems and suffocation to the following: Roberto Blanco; Carlos Catalano, 23; and Andrea Vousou, 22. The three were quickly taken by ambulance to the Algerich Hospital in La Boca District where it was determined that their injuries were not serious. Pamphlets with the slogan "Down with Japan, lay off Maradona," of the Revolutionary Organization (ORP) were found in the building. This shows that the attack was in reprisal to the Japanese Government decision to not grant Maradona a visa. [passage omitted] One employee told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS: "It is all very strange because the building has a contracted security organization in addition to the embassy security guard. Thus it is very difficult to understand how the grenade could have been planted in the building." [passage omitted]
