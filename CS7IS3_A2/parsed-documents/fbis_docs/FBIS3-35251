Your Excellency the chairman of the Presidential Council; Your Excellency the vice chairman of the Presidential Council; dear brothers: God's peace and mercy be upon you, the creme de la creme of the Yemeni people; our people and beloved ones, may you enjoy God's protection, and may he guide us to what pleases him. You and Yemen, like every remote and wondrous destination that can only be reached after one has travelled a distance toward it -- a distance we covered over five long months in response to the call of duty to brotherhood and to safeguard unity and all the hopes and ideals and values that reside in the hearts of all the Arabs. Our hopes have been drawn to Sanaa and Aden, to the men who have made unity and carried the burden of protecting it so it can be a vanguard and contribution to a comprehensive Arab awakening in the face of fragmentation, divisions, and territorial parochialism -- a reawakening founded on freedom and democracy, justice, brotherhood, purity, confidence, and complementarity. We began this reawakening years ago, when we met as brothers in Arabism and Islam and rid ourselves of any parochial benefit or regional sense or minor objective, as we went about setting up the Arab Cooperation Council with our cousins. We called for the introduction of a new age among ourselves, armed with awareness, patience, and content. We argued for a joint march seeking good for all the Arabs and a mobilization of the nation's energies on the road of unity and dignity. We have wanted it to be a march that branches out like a blessed tree -- one that does not bow unless to offer its bounty to all of us. Let the tree's march be to the heights, in the name of the generations that dream of the nation and the Arab message, in their human dimensions and awareness, in the shadows of which flourish books, universities, schools, banners, cities, and villages, where human rights and human dignity are respected, and where dreams are nurtured, in the manner of our grandfathers, the leaders of the Great Arab Revolt, when they surprised the world with the great dream of a united Arab state extending from the source of wisdom in Yemen to the sunset of 'Uqbah Bin-Nafi', standing at the shores of the ocean of darkness If today there is a dream to achieve Arab integration and to open new fields of sincere and good cooperation for and among all Arabs, let this be in accordance with God's saying: Help you one another in righteousness and piety but help you not one another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse] When the Gulf crisis occured and our nation suffered from its pains, we tried, before it took place, to find an Arab remedy to Arab wounds. We acted with all the power and capability we had to avert this national catastrophe. Our only objective was to please God and satisfy our conscience. But, events took a different turn than what we wanted. Despite the divisions and the rubble it left behind, we did not despair that a new dawn would break after a long dark night, returning the water to its course, pure and limpid in the great and boundless river of our nation. Brothers, kin folks, and beloved ones, Amman is happy to have you meet in it. It lost sleep over the disagreement and the confrontation that took place between the brothers. Amman is also losing sleep over the starvation of the children of the nation who are besieged, by the illiteracy of some of its generations, by the dryness of some of the nation's trees, and by the squandering waste of many of its resources. In this homeland, we have struggled in the face of gloomy and regrettable surprises. Free Arabs have struggled in many locations in this homeland so the image of unity can remain vivid in the minds and so our nation can remain, as God almighty has wished it, the best of peoples evolved for mankind [Koranic verse], rescuing those in distress, justly treating the wronged, feeding the hungry, protecting borders, and reassuring the frightened. We have sought unity formulas. The Arab League formula was not the first of these unity ideas. The first of these ideas was an Arab government in Damascus at the time of Faysal Bin-Husayn. We welcomed all pan-Arab initiatives. We called for establishing a new Arab order. We stood against all foreign interference, in the hope that our efforts would succeed in healing our Arab wounds, from which we all suffer. We tried to prevent any estrangement of the brothers. We still take the same position. If the world around us changes, let us change for the better, under the guidance of God almighty. This is natural. What does not change are the principles firmly embedded in the consciences of men who once built the Ma'rib Dam, men who spread the message in and outside the peninsula, and their grandsons who rebuilt the dam, upheld the edifice of unity, and championed the banner of amity among the sons of the one homeland, in the realization of the dream that the enemnies of the nation try to shatter and to send into oblivion. The document of pledge and accord, drafted by a good group of Yemen's sons representing various trends and views, demonstrates real national unity and proven the success of the principle of pluralism within the framework of unity. It demonstrates a comprehensive vision for the subjects under discussions by the Yemeni people. The document fixes dates for implementation. It presents plans for all of the Constitutional, political, security, and legislative fields. It defines general fundamentals and principles for building the new state, its central and decentralized establishments, and its laws and bylaws. The document demonstrates all of this in a comprehensive, accurate, and systematic way that will lead, God willing, to an advanced model of the state of law and institutions, to sound relations between authorities. Dear kinsfolk: You are starting on a difficult road of comprehensive reform. This will require all your efforts and time, as well as the purest images of purity and fraternity the revolution can have. It will require the highest spirit of satisfaction and strength, so we will see no dark sea or gulf, so no blood will be shed at the hand of a brother who is unaware of the consequences of such action. Therefore, we view your agreement as a resumption of the unity march and an enhancement of your democratic march. So you have the glory. Peace be upon you while you unleash the spirit of unity so it will waft across the entire Arab nation's land with its good scent, demonstrating your generosity -- known since the dawn of our history -- and drafting a Yemeni epic with Arab objectives and vision. Brothers: We do not call our concern for your situation a mediation, because we do not consider the spirits of brothers to be separate. We, together, have been aware of our historic responsibilities. We have been engaged in the battle for freedom, democracy, and unity. We have been calling for the power of knowledge, awareness, and culture. We have been dreaming of a pan-Arab awakening that will light the streets of the nation's cities and liberate them from oppression, slavery, greed, fear, sedition, starvation, civil war, and alien cultures. It is an honor for us that you came to us and chose us because of your confidence in us. We view this confidence with much gratitude. We are eager to serve your best and great objectives so we will continue to be Arab brothers, with the honor of serving their brothers and kinsfolk, at the start of a new road for dealing with all Arab issues within the Arab framework, and in a spirit of brotherhood and duty, hoping to carry out this duty fully with God's help. Esteemed kinsfolk: We do not conceal our happiness over the fact that you are among us. Jordanians believe their guests are the grandsons of the Ghassanides who built this land, who carried the banners of conquest to the whole world, becoming history's masters, knights, and creators, and who carried the nation's concerns and stretched their struggle to all its causes and places. Let us advance together as one nation that supports the weak, feeds the poor, the orphans, and the prisoners, and reminds the world of great 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab's [second caliph] call: How can you enslave people who are born free? Let us open the windows of freedom and the doors of the future for our new generations. Let us call for returning the right and restoring the Arab land's youth, strength, power, and memory. Let its awakening be based on science, construction, factories, and universities so no hungry, grieved, or sad man is left out. Our hands are stretched out toward your hands. The Arab and Islamic sanctities in the holiest city, Jerusalem, are a stone's throw away. We urge that no side, except God, should have sovereignty over them. Let the faithful compete for fearing, worshiping, and respecting God. Palestine can be seen with its minarets and domes. We are defending the Palestinian people's rights in response to their's and the nation's demand and in accordance with international legitimacy. Let us depart from the clouds of hesitance in this troubled, changing world and come up with a vision based on an intellectual foundation, on our tolerant values, on our great message. Let us follow the road of the righteous human intellect and awaken the pan- Arab sense of honor and vigorous will. Let the pledge and accord document on which you are unanimous be a landmark on an irrevocable comprehensive movement that reaches its unionist goal and sees Yemen emerge as an Arab peak that connects what has been cut in the march of our great history. Blessed be your effort, o our kinsfolk in Yemen. Be happy with the unity you have achieved and with the road you have chosen. Let new joys prevail in Sanaa, Aden, al-Hudaydah, Hadramaut, and Ta'izz over unity and the spirit of brotherhood. Let the nation awaken like Yemen, which has decided to be at the forefront. Let the joy be Yemeni, the satisfaction Arab, and the talk free and unionist. Let us read in the holy Koran: Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. [Koranic verse] O dear kinsfolk, you will return to Yemen after agreeing to what is good. You will resume the Yemeni unionist march. I beseech God to grant you success and guide your steps on the right path and to help you shoulder your great responsibilities toward your homeland and your nation. Peace and God's mercy be upon you.
