Trash spills out of the few containers available, looking ugly and acting as a vector for "epidemics," as our grandparents used to call insect-borne diseases. This image, which leaves much to be desired, has two causes: inadequate trash collections, and the unfortunate carelessness of those of us who live in the city. We toss things to right and left as we complain about the city's trash collection services, not thinking about the difficulties caused by the fuel shortage and the poor condition of the equipment. This depressing and ugly situation--which is not seen in other Cuban cities and provinces--could be avoided if we paid a little more attention to the beauty of which we boast. I remember the residents of my neighborhood when I was young sweeping their little section of sidewalk every day. One of my childhood memories is hearing people tell us to "listen for the trash to come," meaning the open carts that at a set time of day collected, block by block, the cans or bins every resident took out at that precise instant so that unpleasant odors would not linger until the air carried them away, and so the flies would fly after the trash collection vehicle. What do we and the People's Councils need to do about this?
