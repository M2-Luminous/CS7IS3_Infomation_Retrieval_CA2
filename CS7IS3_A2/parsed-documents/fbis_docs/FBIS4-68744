The participants in a two-day meeting of the leaders of regional privatization organs, organized by the State Committee on the Administrations of State Property together with the Federal Property Fund, which concluded yesterday in Moscow, have come to such a conclusion. It is obvious that the fears of the ideologists of privatization relative to the prospects of their activity have been aroused by the fact that until now the strategy of denationalization was determined exclusively by the political situation. Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays considers fulfillment of the task of completing voucher privatization before 1 July 1994 "a question of the life and death" of his department and its regional structures. At the meeting of the leaders of privatization organs he stated that all checks which will "surface" after the completion of voucher privatization "will be aimed point-blank at us." These fears are not unfounded. According to the data of the Fund's chairman, Vladimir Sokolov, some 48 million more checks "are making their way through the hands;" moreover, "about 5 percent of them are in secondary circulation." That is why the work of the privatization organs will be directed in the immediate future to a sharp increase in the scale of the exchange of vouchers for the shares of privatized enterprises as well as to identifying secondary circulation checks. Otherwise the ideologists of voucher privatization will be rather vulnerable not only "from the right" (on the part of the opponents of "handing out state property dirt-cheap," specifically the mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov and the leader of the YABloc Grigoriy Yavlinskiy) and also "from the left" (on the part of the advocates of "collective ownership," specifically the communists), since the social meaning of "people's privatization" will appear to be under question. In Chubays' opinion, one of the basic as yet unutilized reserves in the work of the privatization organs is "the information-advertising-propaganda component." The vice-premier intends to rectify this omission by personal example in the very near future. Within the framework of the "100 days until the end of check privatization" campaign initiated by the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, he will address the inhabitants of the regions through local television channels and personally explain to them the advantages of exchanging the checks for the shares of privatized enterprises. This also will permit Chubays to "make a low-level test-run" of the basic provisions of the draft of the new state privatization program, which is directed to the redistribution of capital (including privatized) in favor of the "rational owner" (the expression of vice-premier Aleksandr Shokin) and to enlist "popular support" for subsequent activity. Success would give Chubays additional trump cards in the struggle to retain complete control over post-check privatization. For now the final results of check privatization are unclear. The prospects for retaining Chubays' department are governed only by the intellectual potential of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property which has outstripped other departments in developing a new concept of denationalization. One has to also take into consideration the policy of the "big seven," which stimulates the pro-reformer attitudes of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. It is obvious that after the endowment of the head of the Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr Shokin, with powers regarding coordination of the ideology of the reforms as well as of negotiations with the West regarding questions not only of indebtedness but also of loans and investments, not one of the trump cards will be superfluous for Chubays. Especially as last week parliamentarians already advanced the idea of transferring the Federal Property Fund from under the control of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property to the Ministry of Economics. In this situation the State Committee on the Administration of State Property has basically changed its tactics and intends to conduct post-check privatization to fit the special features of the regions and the departments. However, in the State Committee on the Administration of State Property they will be unbending with respect to those enterprises which "dodge" compulsory privatization. In this case the enterprise will be deprived of all the advantages not only of check (privileges for the labor collectives) but also of post-check privatization support (the direction of the funds gained from the sale of state property to an enterprise's disposal).
