MITI has made its decision in consideration not only of the fact that voluntary export restraints [VER] have become meaningless due to decreased auto exports from Japan as a result of expanded local production in the United States by Japanese automakers, but also of the fact that it was agreed at GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round) that VER, among other measures, would be abolished by 1999. In view of expected progress in the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks in which the automobile trade is one of the key issues, MITI plans to make an official decision as early as January 1994. To ease Japanese-U.S. trade frictions over automobiles, a quota of 1.68 million units was imposed on Japan regarding its VER for fiscal year 1981. The quota was increased to 2.3 million units thereafter, but because actual exports began dropping after peaking in fiscal year 1986, the quota was cut to 1.65 million units in fiscal year 1992. It has been kept at the same level for the current fiscal year. Actual automobile exports, however, remained below the quota from fiscal year 1987 and fell to 1.56 million units in fiscal year 1992. Thus, VER have become meaningless. Concerning the quota, MITI has so far maintained that it "wishes to have the measure abolished because it runs contrary to the principles of free trade." But MITI has been forced to continue VER due to expected objections from the U.S. automobile industry should MITI decide to discontinue them. While local production of Japanese automobiles in the United States has increased, however, Japanese export models have weakened in terms of their price competitiveness due to the yen's appreciation. The U.S. Big Three automakers have also regained their competitiveness. Therefore, MITI has judged that Japanese automobile exports would not increase immediately even if VER were to be lifted. Concerning VER, the United States has ostensibly maintained that "it is a voluntary measure taken by the Japanese automobile industry, and the U.S. Government has no part in it." It is said that the issue will not be taken up in negotiations at the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks regarding the automobile and auto parts sector to be settled before the summit meeting in February. MITI plans to eventually decide to discontinue VER while monitoring progress in the negotiations, and then to present its proposal to the U.S. Government.
