It may be premature to jump to conclusions but cautious expectations are being voiced in Washington that because of the move, working-level U.S.-North Korean talks may resume around next weekend to discuss additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In fact, a few signs backing up such expectations have trickled out of the communist country in recent days. One was Western press representatives' invitation to North Korea for the April 15 birthday of President Kim Il-song, aged 82. The invitees included correspondents from CNN-TV and the WASHINGTON TIMES in the United States and Japan's NHK-TV. The invitation was taken by North Korea watchers as a conciliatory gesture by the normally intransigent North Koreans. In an interview with CNN-TV, Kim Yong-sun, a Workers' (communist) Party secretary involved in inter-Korean affairs, said, "We do not want a war and are prepared to return to the table of dialogue." Kim then tried to tone down the inflammatory remark, "in a war Seoul will be turned into a sea of fire," made by the chief North Korean delegate to a recent inter-Korean working-level meeting at Panmunjom. It was this statement that prompted Seoul and Washington to take hasty steps to ship sophisticated defensive weaponry to South Korea. Diplomatic sources here observe that once Kim Il-song's birthday celebrations are over, North Korea may renew dialogue with the United States as a face-saving tactic. The sources say that North Korea is well aware of the early-May deadline for its acceptance of additional inspections and that it would face harsher pressure if it failed to heed the deadline. One source said, however, that even if working-level talks resumed late next week, rough sailing would await the two sides before they could manage to hammer out an agreement on additional checks. The North Koreans are likely to continue demanding that working- level Washington-Pyongyang talks precede additional checks, while the United States will maintain that a full inspection of all declared facilities should occur before any talks with North Korea. State Department Spokesman Mike Mccurry made it clear at a press briefing Friday that no further U.S.-North Korean talks would take place before inspections have ensured the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea. In other words, Washington's strategy is to address the issue of inspecting undeclared North Korean facilities at a third meeting by winding up the question of looking into declared sites before the talks open. North Korea's plan, on the other hand, is to obtain the maximum possible concessions from the United States by using the card of additional inspections of its declared facilities.
