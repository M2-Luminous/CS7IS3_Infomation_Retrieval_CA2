ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation granting complainant Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Inc.'s (``3M'') motion to amend the notice of investigation to correct the identification of one respondent and to delete another respondent. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James M. Lyons, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;3094. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation and sale of certain tape dispensers, on July 15, 1993. Complainant 3M alleges infringement of U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180. On November 29, 1993, complainant filed a second motion to amend the notice of investigation to clarify the identity of the named respondents. Complainant moved to delete one respondent, Shiang Shin Trading Co., and to change the identification of another respondent, Safina Office Products, to Shiang Shin International, Inc., d/b/a Safina Office Products. In requesting this action, 3M stated that an affidavit received from one of the respondents had revealed that Safina Office Products is merely the assumed name for Shiang Shin International, Inc. and that Shiang Shin Trading Co. is an unrelated company that is not involved in the importation or sale of the subject tape dispensers. The Commission investigative attorney supported the motion. On December 13, 1993, the ALJ issued an ID (Order No. 4) granting complainant's motion. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and Commission interim rule 210.53(h), 19 CFR 210.53(h).
