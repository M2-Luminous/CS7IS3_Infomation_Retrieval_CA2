Nazarbayev had arrived in the United States for an official visit. [passage omitted] The talks centered on matters aimed at further refining bilateral cooperation and at strengthening security in the world, the development of the situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Central Asia. The signed charter on democratic partnership "marks a qualitatively new stage in our relations which gain in scope and assume a long-term character", Nazarbayev said. During the visit, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding and cooperation between the Defence Ministries of the two countries, an agreement on cooperation between the U.S. and Kazakhstan in science and technology, as well as a bilateral agreement on the exchanges of technical information and cooperation in nuclear safety. Later on a three-sided agreement was signed between Kazakhstan, the U.S. and Russia on technological guarantees in view of the launch of a U.S.-made Inmarsat-3 satellite from Baykonur cosmodrome by a Russian Proton booster rocket. Nazarbayev later visited the Pentagon. A U.S.-Kazakh accord was signed on joint defence cooperation and providing U.S. help to the new republic in converting its arms industry to civilian use. Defence Secretary William Perry said he would visit Kazakhstan next month to begin implementation of the accord.
