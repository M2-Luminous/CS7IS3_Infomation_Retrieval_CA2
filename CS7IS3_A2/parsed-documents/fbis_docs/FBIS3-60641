In the recorded interview conducted in an unidentified room in Seoul, Im Yong-sum speaks in Korean with Japanese voice-over translation. Date of the interview is not given. Concerning North Korea's alleged construction of various facilities underground, Im Yong-sum, who was reportedly in charge of facilities construction, says: "[In building underground facilities] North Korea is making use of Iraq's Gulf War experience, wherein the U.S. military and allied forces made saturation air raids and Iraqi airfighters were unable to demonstrate their abilities. Therefore, an effort is being made in North Korea to build a runway under ground so that airplanes can be launched even if a runway is destroyed." With regard to the DPRK's suspected development of the missile "No Dong," the exiled officer notes: "Missile launch pads have been built in Hate, North Hamgyong, and in Munchon, Kangwon; and another missile launch pad is under construction in Chungan [as heard] in a border area near China. These are the major launch pads. When I was building military facilities, I heard that the existing missiles are deployed to counterattack Japanese and U.S. air raids, and at that time, I firmly believed that if we got serious about it, our missiles could destroy even Japan, the United States, or South Korea." Asked if he thinks North Korea has already had nuclear weapons, Im Song-sum answers: "Yes. In North Korea, even rank-and-file soldiers think so. All North Korean executive military officers know that two facilities located in Yongbyong are the nuclear facilities. If these two facilities are open to inspections, North Korea's nuclear development technology will be revealed." He then notes that when he was in North Korea, he believed that North Korea had already developed nuclear weapons as a nuclear deterrent. He then stresses if North Korea should provoke a war, the United States would joint the war, and therefore, Japan's participation in the war would be inevitable, noting: "As a preemptive strike, North Korea would attack U.S. military bases in Japan and then make air raids on Japan's major military bases." He says all the soldiers were ordered this year to prepare for a semi-war. Im Song-sum then discusses growing dissatisfaction with Kim Chong-il within the military. He also speaks about North Korea's food situation. He says "living condition of the people living beyond Pyongyang is miserable." The interview ends at 0234 GMT.
