This was after Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer decided not to present his proposal for allocating contractors 51 percent of the land freed in return for building apartments for candidates eligible for mortgages. The government will meet again on Wednesday to discuss Ben-Eli'ezer's proposal. This is aimed at ensuring that contractors winning tenders allocate 25 percent of the land for apartments to those who have the right to Housing Ministry support. Harley Braidman reports: [Begin recording] [Braidman] The government approved the joint Housing Ministry and Treasury plan of minimum state intervention in construction. The main point of the program is an article relating to the marketing of land. The Israel Land Administration and the Housing Ministry presented a clear detailed plan for marketing 50,000 units annually in the center of the country. Contracts will tie down builders to fixed dates for start and completion of construction to prevent them stocking up on plots. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat was pleased with the government's decision. [Shohat] We think that we decided about the proper things to do, and I believe that in order to carry out a massive building program we are creating the proper environment to the market to start building. I believe that we made a proper decision. The main thing is that we got clear information about the amount of plots that are going to be sold on the market in order to build houses and this is quite a big number of 50,000 in 1994 and 50,000 in 1995. I think that will reduce the cost of the apartments. [Braidman] In addition to the 25,000 foreigners allowed in, the government approved 13,000 workers from the territories to return to construction in Israel. Planning procedures will be simplified and infrastructure work speeded up. The government will not return to budgetary purchase of flats nor promise to buy apartments in demand areas.
