The poll revealed that the majority would have preferred the voluntary surrender of the most wanted drug trafficker in the world. Whereas 76.7 percent of those polled responded affirmatively to the question, "Would you have preferred Pablo Escobar's voluntary surrender?", only 14.2 percent replied that they would not. Of the four cities surveyed (Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla), the latter had the most responses favoring surrender, with 82.5 percent affirmative answers. It was followed by Medellin, with 80 percent; Cali, with 79.7 percent; and Bogota, with 73.1 percent. In Medellin and Cali, 11.4 and 8.7 percent, respectively, answered that they would not have preferred Pablo Escobar's voluntary surrender. Nevertheless, the majority of those queried described the drug trafficker's death as a positive event. This claim was made by 48.3 percent, compared with 12.4 percent who considered it negative. It was immaterial to 30.3 percent of those polled. In Medellin, however, Pablo Escobar's death was immaterial to the majority of persons (40.9 percent); whereas 33 percent regarded the event as positive, and 13.9 percent viewed it as negative. In Cali, on the other hand, 48.1 percent replied that it was positive; 30.4 percent said that it was immaterial to them; and 13.9 percent described it as negative. As for the possible consequences of Pablo Escobar's death for the law and order situation and drug trafficking activity, those polled thought that there would be very few repercussions. According to the results, 34.4 percent did not believe that the law and order situation would be affected, and over half expected drug trafficking activity to remain the same. These are the optimists: 29.1 percent thought that the law and order situation would improve, and 29.3 expected the drug traffic to decline. And these are the negativists: 11.5 percent claimed that drug trafficking activity would increase, and 23.5 percent expected the law and order situation to worsen. Bogota residents, however, were more positive compared with those of Cali, Barranquilla, and Medellin; because there were more in the nation's capital who thought that the law and order situation would improve than there were those expecting it to worsen. In Cali, on the other hand, a larger number of those queried claimed that the law and order situation would remain the same, representing 40.5 percent of the responses; while 25.3 percent expected it to worsen. Only 12.7 percent replied that it would improve. In Medellin, 32.2 percent responded that the law and order situation would remain the same; 30.4 percent expected it to improve; and 20.9 percent thought that it would worsen. With regard to drug trafficking activity, in Cali, for example, 58.2 percent of those polled replied that it would remain unchanged, whereas 26.6 percent claimed that it would decline, and only 8.9 percent expected it to increase. In Medellin, 47.8 percent believed that drug trafficking activity would remain the same; 25.2 percent expected it to decline; and only 12.2 percent maintained that it would rise. In the breakdown by sex, more women than men would have preferred Pablo Escobar's voluntary surrender. Similarly, more women than men expected the drug trafficking activity to remain the same. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poll on Death of Pablo Escobar (in percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |As an event, it is.... | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Positive |48.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Immaterial |30.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Negative |12.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |8.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Law and order situation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Not affected |34.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will improve |29.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will worsen |23.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug traffic | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will remain the same |52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will decline |29.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will increase |11.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |7.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Would you have preferred voluntary surrender? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |76.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |14.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Immaterial |6.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know/no answer |3.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: EL TIEMPO -- Yankelovich | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Poll Profile On 2 and 3 December (the same day and the one following the death of Pablo Escobar), EL TIEMPO and the firm Yankelovich Innova de Colombia began taking the public opinion poll. The four questions were asked, by telephone, of a sample of 500 persons in four cities: Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla. The distribution was as follows: Bogota, 250 polled (50 percent); Medellin, 113 polled (23 percent); Cali, 83 polled (17 percent); and Barranquilla, 54 polled (10 percent). A certain number of surveys were made in each city, based on the socioeconomic distribution of the Colombian population: 25 percent representing the upper stratum; 60 percent, the middle stratum; and 25 percent, the lower stratum [as published]. Of those polled, 41.4 percent were of the male sex, and 58.6 percent, female. The majority had completed their studies for a high school diploma, or had a higher level education.
