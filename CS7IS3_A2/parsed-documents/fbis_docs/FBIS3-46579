In the program moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Yuko Ando, guest commentators Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, professor of Keio University, take part at the FNN studio; five others join the discussion through remote hookups: Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Kochi Prefecture Governor Daijiro Hashimoto, businessman Yasuyuki Nanbu in New York City, writer Yasutaka Tsutsui, and writer Yoshimi Ishikawa. Most of the first 70 minutes of the program is devoted to discussions on such subjects as Japan's politics, education, and freedom of speech in general. At 2240 GMT, newscasters turn to Foreign Minister Hata and ask him questions about the political situation. Kuroiwa asks the foreign minister what kind of year 1994 will be as far as politics is concerned. Minister Hata says: "We must make this year a year when politics will go forward and not backward, and a year when we can make proposals internationally." Kuroiwa brings up the political reform issue, and asks Hata, who is president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party): "Will the current Diet enact the political reform bills?... Please tell us about the outlook of the bills getting passed." Hata replies: "Some people predict it will be difficult. But public opinion shows that if the politicians, blinded by their own interests, fail to pass the bills again this time -- no one will trust what the politicians say in the future. I think the Diet members have come to realize that too." Kuroiwa notes that the economic recession remains another big issue, and asks for Hata's comment. Hata responds: "That issue can be dealt with at the same time the political reform issue is taken care of. We have a minister in charge of political reform. Mr. Yamahana is that minister. He heads the Political Reform Committee. It can take care of the matter, while other people can take care of the economic issues. And that is actually what they are doing. Some people talk as if everybody were running around busy with the political reform issue, neglecting the economic issues. Reality is nothing like that." Newscaster Kuroiwa reminds Hata that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had pledged to carry out political reform by the end of 1993 and had to apologize when that was not done and that Hosokawa then pledged that the reform will be carried out before the current Diet session ends. Kuroiwa asks Hata: "If the bills do not get passed again, will that mean the Diet will be dissolved?" Hata answers: "We cannot just dissolve the Diet because we have many things to do now. On the contrary, however, it is possible, if we make serious mistakes, that the people may start demanding that we dissolve the Diet, calling for election system reform." Citing the recent election in Russia as an example of rapid reform, Takemura points out that it takes time to make changes in Japan. Hata responds: "I agree. It seems that the Japanese people do not have enough courage to make changes." He adds: "Nearly 50 years have passed since the end of World War II and there are many things which are outdated in our society." He then explains the need to change some outdated rules and systems. Ishikawa says Japan cannot make changes without pressure from other countries (gaiatsu). Hata says: "Mr. Ishikawa is quite right. Unfortunately, everything started to move in the past because of other countries." Kuroiwa asks Hata if he is willing to become Japan's next leader. Hata answers by saying: "As I have been doing, I will continue to exert all-out efforts to support the Hosokawa administration, which we created." The discussion on political reforms ends at 2251 GMT, and the whole program ends by asking all the participants to give their views on what the Japanese should do in the future.
