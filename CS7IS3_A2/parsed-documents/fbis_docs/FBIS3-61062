Far From Russia...." -- first two paragraphs are introduction] [Text] Colonel General Boris Pyankov was born in 1935 in Sverdlovsk. He is a Russian. He has been in the armed forces since 1954. He graduated from the Far Eastern tank school in 1959, the military academy of armored troops in 1969, and the General Staff military academy in 1979. He has commanded an armored platoon, an armored company, an armored battalion, an armored regiment, a motorized rifle division, an army corps, an army, and the Siberian Military District. Since 1991 he has been chief of the USSR Civil Defense and USSR deputy defense minister. Since 6 July 1992 he has been deputy commander in chief of the CIS joint armed forces. Since September 1993 he has been commander of the coalition peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. He is married with a son and a daughter. Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the CIS coalition peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, answers PRAVDA's questions. [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, today many people are naturally asking: Why was it necessary at all to create this armed formation on the territory of an independent state? [Pyankov] To answer your question objectively one must first of all assess the existing military-political situation in the world. A brief conclusion is that despite the fact that the world community has found the strength in itself to push back the threat of nuclear danger and to consign the Cold War to oblivion, today we have all been faced with a "new generation" of local conflicts and wars caused by national and religious intolerance. Today we must clearly note that the fact of aggression against sovereign Tajikistan is taking place. Literally every day armed gangs and groups from the Islamic State of Afghanistan try to penetrate its territory in various regions. This has required the CIS to adopt necessary relevant steps to render aid to Tajikistan and to safeguard its state integrity and security. All peoples of the former USSR are linked not only by firm economic ties. Their friendship, which has deep roots, has been preserved. A large number of citizens of other CIS countries, those whom quite recently we proudly called "the Soviet people," live on Tajikistan's territory. This naturally imposes obligations on the supreme powers of these states to protect human honor and dignity. There is one more aspect of the problem. If the political power, economic potential, and armed forces have been more or less divided up, dividing up joint security into the security of each individual states has been not only hard but virtually impossible. I must say that the creation of the collective peacekeeping forces was preceeded by lengthy, painstaking work. Favorable prospects for ensuring national and collective security were opened up by the treaty on collective security signed in Tashkent in May 1992 by six states of the CIS. In accordance with this treaty's articles, the 24 September 1993 session of the council of CIS heads in Moscow adopted a decision on the formation of collective peacekeeping forces and the start of their functioning and also an agreement on the coalition peacekeeping forces and joint measures for their material and technical backup. These documents meet all requirements of the UN Charter. [PRAVDA] Which CIS countries' military subunits belong directly to the coalition peacekeeping forces and what functions do they really perform? [Pyankov] The coalition peacekeeping forces include military units from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan with their arms, military vehicles, and property. Unfortunately, it must be noted that not all states have fulfilled the terms of the agreement in their entirety. Thus, for instance, the question of the allocation of the Kazakhstan armed forces' efforts and funds to the coalition peacekeeping forces remains open. The Kazakhstan border troops and internal troops units on Tajikistan's territory arrived here under the bilateral May 1993 agreement. The operational use of one subunit of the Kyrgyz contingent has been complicated. This has been caused by the fact that it is based on its own territory and is a long way from the main regions where the conflicting sides are deployed. A separate motorized rifle battalion with authorized means of reinforcement has been assigned from the Uzbekistan armed forces. With the arrival of this battalion's last company the tasks set it in its zone of responsibility will be fulfilled in their entirety. Thus, only Russia and Tajikistan have wholly fulfilled their duties to earmark the necessary number of forces and facilities. Russia has transferred to the coalition peacekeeping forces joint command the 201st motorized rifle division and several other units. We are helping the Republic of Tajikistan Defense Ministry in resolving organizational questions connected with the use of subunits and units of the republican armed forces assigned to the coalition peacekeeping forces. We are worried by one further problem: Financing the activity of the coalition peacekeeping forces joint command. Because of the lack of a mechanism for settling accounts between the states which have signed the agreement, money has still not been paid into the joint account by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. [PRAVDA] A few words about the coalition peacekeeping forces' tasks in Tajikistan. [Pyankov] They include an analysis of the military-political situation in the region, the submission of reports to the states involved, collaboration with the management organs of the states involved, participation in the negotiations process, the protection of the humanitarian aid convoys route and participation in the aid's distribution, and also the operational use of forces in combat in the event of dire necessity. [PRAVDA] Please cite examples of specific actions. [Pyankov] In late October and early November convoys with necessities and fuel was escorted to Gornyy Badakhshan with the aid of the coalition peacekeeping forces and from there the evacuation of refugees to central regions of the republic was organized. A group of generals and officers were at the same time holding talks with leaders of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast [GBAO] and commanders of field detachments operating on the oblast's territory, which helped to remove tension in this region and improve dialogue between the Gornyy Badakhshan leadership and the central authorities. Now, at the request of the republic's leadership the protection of enterprises producing bread articles and their delivery to the stores has been organized. I want to note that the joint command is doing everything to ensure that the coalition peacekeeping forces' role consists primarily in conducting preventive diplomatic actions and peacekeeping activity as a whole. This would be helped by granting our coalition forces the status of UN troops with all ensuing consequences. The implementation of this proposal would press the opposition leaders to sit down at the conference table with the central authorities in Dushanbe. [PRAVDA] As far as we know this question was examined at a CSCE session but the proposal did not get through. Those who voted against it included several representatives of republics of the former USSR, in particular Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltic states. They explained their position by fear that Russia's imperial ambitions would be strengthened. [Pyankov] In this case I must draw attention to several important factors. First, we must seriously consider the fact that if the coalition peacekeeping forces leave Tajikistan and open up the borders, the influx of weapons and drugs will be a scourge for many CIS countries. And they could include the above-mentioned countries. Second, because of the destabilization of the situation there will be a mortal danger to citizens of all nationalities living in this region. As for talk of Russia's imperial ambitions, that is the wrong way of putting the question. That becomes understandable if you study the agreement attentively. Yes, I am a citizen of Russia. But I was appointed to this post by the decision of the council of heads of state. In my activity I am subordinate to the heads and defense ministers of the states which signed the agreement. All planned peacekeeping operations are coordinated with the defense ministers of the signatory countries and are implemented only with their approval. And only in an emergency situation does the commander have the right to make decisions independently on conducting combat operations, subsequently reporting to the heads of state and defense ministers. For the practical organization of collaboration the joint command staff includes one defense ministry representative from each signatory state with the rights of deputy chief of staff of the coalition peacekeeping forces joint command. Highly professional officers of the republics involved work in all the main directorates and departments of the joint command. Thus our command is a fully coalition one. And one more detail of some importance: Article 13 of the agreement reads that it is open to any CIS country and also to other states which share the agreement's aims. Russia's interests? Yes, they do exist. Some of them I have already enumerated. In addition even a nonprofessional can understand that the transfer of Russian border troops from the Southern borders to the border with Kazakhstan, which at the same time includes the creation of a completely new system for guarding a border many thousands of kilometers long, will require a colossal investment of material assets. In today's economic situation such expenditure is beyond Russia's means. In addition, the activity of the Islamic fundamentalists will increase in dangerous proximity to Russian territory. It is no accident that a number of Islamic organizations have proclaimed their ultimate goal to be the creation of a single Islamic state including the former Central Asian republics of the USSR and even some regions of Russia! [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, do you believe that the introduction of the coalition peacekeeping forces contingent in Tajikistan has had any positive effect on the stabilization of the situation in the republic and on the Tajik-Afghan border? [Pyankov] Yes, without any doubt. For that you only have to go out onto the streets of Dushanbe and other cities and talk with the local citizens. The overwhelming majority of the republic's population welcomed our forces' arrival with great enthusiasm and hope. And we shall strive to justify this hope. As for the border, here the situation is far more complex. Yes, the number of overt armed conflicts has declined somewhat. But that is connected not only with the intensification of the guard on the border but also with factors like the change in the tactics of the opposition armed formations' actions, their transfer to guerrilla warfare methods using the experience of the Afghan mujahedin. That is also confirmed by recent events: The blowing up of the railroad bed on the Termez-Kurgan-Tyube sector, acts of sabotage on highways, and the murder of civilians. In Tajikistan there is one more distinguishing feature: In winter combat operations usually die down here. Forces are built up, strongholds and arms and food depots are prepared. But with the advent of spring the opposition forces will try to switch to active operation with a view to seizing power. We are particularly worried by the activity of the well known thug and drugs baron Rezvon, who has been declared by the so-called "government in exile" to be the commander of all the opposition armed forces. Naturally we are losing no time: We are reinforcing our borders, engaging in planned combat training activity, and taking preventive measures. The visit to Tajikistan by B. Rabbani, the head of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and the treaties and agreements concluded at interstate level instill some optimism. Unfortunately, the central authorities of that state do not control many of the border regions, which makes it impossible to pin all hopes on the stabilization of the situation in the very near future. We will use the temporary respite which has been formed to continue dialogue with the opposition and to find joint points of contact and mutual advantage. [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, the meeting of heads of state and defense ministers of the CIS countries ended in Ashgabat recently. Could you share your impression of its results regarding the position of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan? [Pyankov] The Ashgabat meeting paid great attention to questions of the consolidation of the Tajik-Afghan border. The heads of state decided on additional measures to stabilize the situation on Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan. In accordance with these decisions, the 22 January 1993 decision of the council of heads of state which we have already mentioned has been extended to the end of 1994. [PRAVDA] The New Year has arrived. What wishes do you send to the parents of the boys fulfilling their duty far from Russia? [Pyankov] To the mothers and families of the Russians whose sons and relations are serving on Tajikistan's territory I wish that the need for Russian military units to be here may disappear as soon as possible and that your relations and close ones, having honorably fulfilled their military duty, will return alive and well to the Motherland.
