The agreement, an ITAR-TASS correspondent reports from New York, envisages allowing Kazakhstan to export crude oil lifted from the Tengiz and Korolevskoye Fields. Moreover, given the very limited throughput of Russian pipelines, Kazakhstan considers it expedient to rapidly complete the construction of pipelines for the Caspian Oil Consortium. This decision was confirmed at meetings in London with representatives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], which, as expected, will be financing part of the project to build the Caspian oil pipeline. Kazakhstan and Russia are shareholders in the EBRD.
