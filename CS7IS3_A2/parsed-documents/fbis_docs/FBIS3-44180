In a statement issued on Wednesday Mr Buthelezi said: "I am not overly optimistic after the experience of the kind of games that the ANC, in tandem with the government and the National Party, has been playing with us in these so-called negotiations." However, "We must of course leave no stone unturned in our search for a consitutional settlement and we will have to make this last attempt on Thursday". Regarding the IFP's participation in the general election, Mr Buthelezi asked: "Why should the ANC want us in the election if we really are their true opposition and if we are the only party which could stop them taking control of the legislature in this region?" "We will have to face the facts now that we have to go to the conference to tell delegates about the failure of negotiations and face the conference with the need to finally put to bed the issue of whether or not we enter elections," he said. "I say this constitution is fatally flawed and that there is no future for kwazulu and for self-determination for the people of this region or any other region in it". Mr Buthelezi warned of civil war and said: "We will never have peace, stability and prosperity if we repeat the failure of Russia and East Europe to recognise that centrist constitutions imposed over a plural society, in which there are competing demands for self-determination, can only give rise to disruption, violence and finally civil war". The IFP is seeking a federal constitution with a division of power between the central and state governments. The IFP has also opposed the proposed deadlock-breaking mechanism which "inter alia enable a constitutional assembly to completely rewrite the constitution with only a 50 percent plus on majority". The IFP is also demanding two votes per person in the election.
