Shank, pers. comm., 1993. Population size has increased in these four areas, although the rate of increase has varied among areas. Long-term, historical data are not available from other areas within the breeding distribution of arctic peregrine falcons; however, similar trends have been observed in several other areas for which short-term data are available. The range-wide population size remains unknown because so few areas have been thoroughly sampled, but certainly the breeding population now numbers in the thousands. Only one local population was known to have been extirpated; this was a small population of about 15 nesting pairs on the north slope of the Yukon Territory (Mossop 1988). This area is apparently being gradually recolonized by individuals from adjacent populations (Dave Mossop, Dept. of Renewable Resources, Yukon Territory, pers. comm., 1992). Counts of the number of peregrine falcons seen passing fixed points during migration also provide evidence of the rapid increase in the number of arctic peregrine falcons since the late 1970's. Although some of the peregrine falcons seen during migration are American peregrine falcons, the majority seen on the east coast and near the Great Lakes are arctic peregrine falcons (Yates et al. 1988; William S. Clark, Cape May Bird Observatory, pers. comm., 1992; Mueller et al. 1988). The number of migrants seen during fall migration at two well-known concentration areas on the east coast, Assateague Island, Maryland, and Cape May, New Jersey, reflect the overall growth of the arctic peregrine falcon population. In the years 1970&hyph;1975, the average number seen per year at Assateague Island was about 100; by 1976&hyph;1979 the average number had increased to 310; and between 1990 and 1993 an average of 564 were counted (Seegar and Yates 1991; Seegar et al. 1993; William Seegar, U.S. Army, pers. comm., 1994). At Cape May, the average number seen in 1976&hyph;1979 was 136; by 1990&hyph;1993, the average number seen per year was 588 (Schultz et al. 1992; Paul Kerlinger, Cape May Bird Observatory, pers. comm., 1994). Counts conducted at Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, show a similar trend_the number seen decreased in the 1950's and 1960's, reached a low in the mid-1970's, increased rapidly in the 1980's, and may now equal the numbers seen in the 1930's (Mueller et al. 1988). Review of Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan Four regional recovery plans were produced by the Service for peregrine falcons. The Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan, Alaska Population (Alaska Recovery Plan), was the only plan that established recovery criteria for arctic peregrine falcons. The Alaska Recovery Plan, while including both arctic and American peregrine falcons nesting in Alaska, did not pertain to populations outside of Alaska; recovery objectives and criteria for arctic peregrine falcon populations in Canada and Greenland were never established. This rule applies only to arctic peregrine falcons so only those sections of the Alaska Recovery Plan that pertain to arctic peregrine falcons are mentioned in this discussion. The Alaska Recovery Plan was written in 1982 using the best information then available. It included a strategy for population monitoring, recovery objectives, and criteria for reclassification. The monitoring scheme proposed that breeding surveys be conducted regularly in the two areas in Alaska (Colville and Sagavanirktok Rivers) for which historical population data were available. The Alaska Recovery Plan listed four parameters to be measured in the study areas to assess recovery status of those populations, and established an objective for each of the parameters. The four parameters and objectives were: (1) Number of nesting territories occupied by pairs with an objective of 36 total pairs within the 2 specified study areas; (2) Average number of young per nesting attempt with an objective of 1.4 young per nesting attempt; (3) Average organochlorine concentration in eggs with an objective of less than 5 ppm DDE; and
