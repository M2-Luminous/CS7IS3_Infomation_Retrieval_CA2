Free Democratic Party Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel is firmly against plans by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe to reduce the strength of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 320,000. Kinkel told BILD: "The Bundeswehr finally needs planning security, and for the families as well. In the long run, the discussion cannot be such that one says: We have such and such an amount of money, and for that we can afford such and such a Bundeswehr. If I had my say, the decided strength of 370,000 should be maintained if at all possible. I do see the financial problems, but in this case one has to reexamine all other possibilities of saving money." Ruehe wants to present his concept for the Bundeswehr to the Bundestag this week.
