The chairman of the Task Force Relief Committee, Group Captain George Ayitey, who was briefing newsmen in Tamale today, did not disclose the amount. He, however, explained that the task force cannot do much with the donations from the nongovernmental source, hence, the government's intervention. The task force has, so far, registered 132,000 displaced persons in the region, the bulk of them, over 60,000 in Bimbila. These figures do not include Konkombas, because the task force has not been able to reach them in the bush. Group Captain Ayitey said the security agencies had been concentrating on the restoration of public confidence which has not been easy, especially because of two shooting incidents on the Tamale-Salaga road last week. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, reports reaching Tamale indicate that fighting is raging at Sakpe in the Yendi District and that the village has been burned down. [passage omitted]
