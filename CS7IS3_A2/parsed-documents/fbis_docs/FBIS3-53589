Diplomatic sources said Mr. 'Aziz, who arrived here Saturday, was seeking Jordanian intervention with Washington to end the international sanctions imposed against his country following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. No official comment was available on the al-Majali-'Aziz talks, which were attended by other ministers. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the meeting covered a broad review of Jordanian-Iraqi relations. But according to the diplomatic sources, Mr. 'Aziz wanted to request Jordan to raise the issue of the sanctions during the Jan. 21 meeting at the White House between His Majesty King Husayn and President Bill Clinton. "Iraq has met all the requirements of the U.N. resolutions" related to the Gulf war ceasefire in March and April 1991, and, "as such, Iraq believes that the sanctions should be removed as soon as possible," said a diplomatic sources. "It is a straight-forward move and Mr. 'Aziz's talks in Amman come in the context of the international efforts exerted by Iraq to end the sanctions," added the source. There was no immediate word on how Jordan was responding to the Iraqi request. Dr. al-Majali and Royal Court Chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir as well as several other members of the Cabinet are expected to leave for Washington Tuesday to join King Husayn in his meeting with President Clinton. Jordan has repeatedly invited international attention to the suffering of the Iraqi people, particularly children and the elderly, who are net victims of the sanctions, which have deprived the country of external revenues to pay for its people's needs. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold a periodic review of the sanctions on Tuesday, but it is not expected to lift the embargo for at least another six months--a period that U.N. sanctions enforcement officials say is needed to ensure that long-term monitoring of Iraqi weapon development programme is in place. Mr. 'Aziz was originally scheduled to be in New York for consultations with Security Council members this week, but the plans appeared to have been called off. Instead, Iraq is focusing on facilitating the mission of U.N. weapon experts' mission in its soil with a view to securing a clean certificate in February or early March to be presented to the Security Council with a request that the sanctions be lifted at the next round of the review of the embargo. Mr. 'Aziz's talks with Dr. al-Majali followed the renewal of an agreement under which Iraq supplies Jordan's oil needs. The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said Saturday that the agreement, signed by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Walid 'Asfur and Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad, covered a broad range of cooperation in the oil industry. No Jordanian confirmation of the INA report was available. Grid-link talks Dr. 'Asfur, who began a visit to Baghdad last week, is also attending a meeting with the energy ministers of Iraq, Egypt and Turkey on cooperation in electricity generation and supply. The meeting, which began in the Iraqi capital on Saturday, is expected to produce technical agreements that will pave the way for linking the power grids of the four countries at a cost of $450 million. The meeting is expected to produce technical agreements that will enable the four countries working in earnest on a $450 million project. [sentence as published] The five countries signed cooperation protocols in Amman last year to push ahead with the project, which will not violate U.N. sanctions as it is not expected to be implemented in Iraq until the end of the decade. Zaki 'Awdah, Syria's electricity chief, said funding was not a problem as Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank had pledged to finance the project. Hasan Mahmud Sa'id, Egypt's electricity under-secretary, said energy ministers of the five countries planned to meet in Egypt in April to put the last touches to the mutual agreements. He said Egypt and Jordan were already working on linking up their two countries' power networks. He said he hoped the agreements would be fully implemented by 1997. The project's economic viability is based on an estimated $2 to $3 billion savings in annual electricity generation costs after its expected inauguration in 1998.
