Six months before election day, does the mood of the Social Democrats seem to be good? [Scharping] Yes, the mood is very good. By its clear concentration on combating unemployment, and the reestablishment of social justice and internal peace in Germany, the Social Democratic Party [SPD] has distinguished itself and gained confidence and competence and I am sure we have a very good chance in the Bundestag election. [Zoellner] The present mood in the population, the voters, seems to be not so good. Never before has weariness with politics or even an election boycott been mentioned so often.... [Scharping] First of all, politicians have to act in the way they talk and politicians have to talk in they way they think. The basic political capital, that is, confidence, has been considerably damaged by the past few years and many untenable promises, particularly regarding German unity. Nevertheless, I think that many things in the public debate on weariness with politics are exaggerated and wrong. I know many older and younger men and women who are very interested in politics and are also committed. People are annoyed at the political behavior and political parties, too. The turnout in the Bundestag elections will be considerably higher than many believe. [Zoellner] Take the new laender. In the so-called reunification election campaign, the key points were focused there. Is this where the established parties should expect the greatest number of people who refuse to go the the polls, since it is precisely there that many promises have hardly been kept, and in many places there is decline instead of recovery? [Scharping] I hope not! Precisely regarding eastern Germany, one has to say: If people have lived under dictatorial conditions for many decades and then achieve freedom and democracy, one has to deal with the implied hope in a particularly careful and credible way. It was a bad mistake to promise because of the election campaign in 1990 that unity will be managed without tax increases and it was also a bad mistake to promise flourishing landscapes to the people in eastern Germany. Both things have to be corrected. However, this requires that politicians formulate objectives and that all work credibly on them, not only in politics, but also in the enterprises and the trade unions. The concentration of forces and new hope in Germany -- this seems to me a promising concept for the country and the people. [Zoellner] Take the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. In the new laender the PDS is increasingly accepted. How seriously do the Social Democrats take the New Left? [Scharping] None of the radical parties, neither the PDS nor the Republikaner, is a partner for the SPD. On the contrary, these parties are being combatted in a particularly resolute way and all people in eastern Germany have to know that social progress, internal stability, justice in Germany, the procurement of work, that all that is in the best hands with the Social Democrats. Those who want to vote for the PDS because they are angry and want to protest have to know that this is the wrong course. Those who want to take effective action for Germany's inner unity should turn to Social Democracy. Those who vote for the PDS throw their votes into the wastepaper basket because this party will not participate in the formation of will. [Zoellner] Have I understood you correctly that, in your opinion, the PDS is not a new leftist, democratic party, but a radical party? [Scharping] The PDS is the immediate successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the old forces are also increasingly gaining ground there. No, for us the PDS is a party with which we cannot and will not cooperate as a matter of principle. [Zoellner] A clear word. That is to say, the PDS is also no partner for a talk on the necessary majority in Bonn? [Scharping] No. We guarantee that we will never cooperate with the PDS or other radicals and we also guarantee that we will not conduct an election campaign for a coalition, but for the objective that the SPD will be able to take over the lead in politics and the government. [Zoellner] Finally a topical issue: nursing-care insurance. After it looked as if an agreement on this question were not possible, an agreement was suddenly achieved. Excuse me, but this smacks of election tactics.... [Scharping] No. Permit me a personal remark: Since the fall, I have made intensive efforts to bring about the nursing-care insurance, I invested much time and strength, and I am satisfied that a result has now finally been achieved. This would have been earlier possible in the interest of those affected and who need nursing care. For me this is a reasonable and justifiable result and it is a result achieved at the very last minute with a view to the parties' prestige. We from the SPD would not have been able to afford the to-and-fro over more weeks or even months.
