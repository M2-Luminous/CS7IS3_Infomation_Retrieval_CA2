For example, according to the original CBM's, the Greek Cypriots would have been able to enter and leave Maras [Varosha] through a road passing through and under the control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. After the change, the road will be under the control of the United Nations. This proposal is unacceptable both the TRNC and to Turkey, because it upsets the balance of equal interest in the package by removing entry and exit from Maras from the control of the TRNC. It is obvious that Turkey is not going to trust Mr. Butrus-Ghali in such a vital matter. [passage omitted] Another change involves the use of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport by Greek Cypriot planes. Originally, that airport was to be used only by the TRNC as an advantage to counter the handing over of Maras to the United Nations. By changing that clause, Mr. Butrus-Ghali will enable the Greek Cypriots to fly everywhere using Lefkosa Airport because they have air transportation agreements with numerous states. On the other hand, TRNC planes will be able to fly only to places the United Nations will allow them to. It is very doubtful that such permission will be given or that serious efforts will be made to give such permission. Under another change, the United Nations and not the TRNC will collect the customs taxes in the terminal to be opened on the Turkish Cypriot side of Lefkosa Airport. This change can only serve to push the TRNC toward not considering itself a "state." Finally, while the UN secretary general first proposed that the measures concerning Maras and Lefkosa Airport be implemented simultaneously, he now says that the measures regarding Maras be implemented immediately. Since it will take a year to repair Lefkosa Airport, this means the Greek Cypriots will start to benefit from the package a year earlier. It is impossible to accept such inequality. Apparently, Mr. Clinton wants us to make Denktas agree to these proposals! The same Mr. Clinton apparently also wants the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul to have the means to fulfill its true function! What is the true function of the Patriarchate according to Mr. Clinton? It is not very clear. If there is a legal truth that Mr. Clinton should learn by heart it is that under the Lausanne Treaty, Turkey clearly undertook to enable the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to fulfill its religious duties. Even without that particular clause of the Treaty, secular Turkey would have granted all the religious liberties and the liberty of conscience to that institution. Turkey does not have to and will not grant it anything more than that. Turkey is certainly not afraid to allow repairs to the broken down wall of the Patriarchate. Nor is it afraid to allow the reopening of the Heybeliada Clerical School. Will a few thousand Greeks revert Istanbul's conquest? Nor is Turkey intimidated by the merely protocol-affecting results of the fact that the Patriarchate is known as the theoretical "first among equals" -- even though it has no de facto power over the other Greek Orthodox churches. The patriarch's "ecumenical," that is, universal, aspect is thus merely religious and not valid in any other field. Turkey is not afraid of any of those things and it does not oppose the fulfillment of the Patriarchate's religious obligations. However, if Turkey gives up defending the balance of interest and rights set up by the Lausanne Treaty, that would mean giving up its own identity in the international field. While the rights of the Turkish minority are violated in Western Thrace in every field, and mainly in the religious field, it is inconceivable for Turkey to allow the wall of the Patriarchate to be repaired, let alone to let the Heybeliada Clerical School to reopen. If it did that, Turkey would be betraying its brothers in Western Thrace and denying its own identity. Mr. Clinton must be reminded of these things. Turkey cannot accept having Mr. Clinton stand before it like a Greek lawyer who ignores the Greek cruelty in Western Thrace. Furthermore, it is in the high interests of his own country for Mr. Clinton to give up this foolishness. The prime minister did the right thing when she agreed to sign a standby agreement with the IMF. Such an agreement will be an economic confidence-increasing measures both in Turkey and abroad. However, if Mr. Clinton thinks that Turkey's current difficulties make it absolutely dependent on the United States and on IMF, and that this situation can enable the United States to demand humiliating and unfair concessions from Turkey in any field, he is very wrong. The measures Turkey must take to end its economic crisis are the same as those the IMF will recommend. Anyway, after Turkey takes these measures, private international banks will consider aiding Turkey a profitable business. Given that situation, Turkey does not have to make concessions either to Mr. Clinton or to the Greeks for whom he seems to be acting like a lawyer. The person who must come to his senses is Mr. Clinton himself. In recent years, certain people occupying very high positions but unable to fulfill their promises to the United States created the impression in that country that Turkey can agree to anything, even to be turned into a federation. This impression is wrong. Turkey would not sell its identity. Turkey would not make undignified, unequal concessions. Nobody could do that on Turkey's behalf, because the crushing majority of the Turkish parliament and even more crushing majority of the Turkish nation would take that person down. Mr. Clinton should realize the following: One of the reasons for the ascent of the Prosperity Party is because Turkish diplomacy has forgotten its traditions and accepted mishandling by the West. Let Mr. Clinton come to his senses. The dogmatic policy conducted nowadays by the West can unexpectedly discard Turkey from the Western world. Then -- foremost in the Middle East -- the balances which will be disrupted will not be of the kind that can be repaired by the United States. First the Poised Hammer will be removed from Turkey. Like Bernard Lewis said, Turkey is not a country to be mishandled. Our advice to the government is for it to be aware of these realities. The concessions of today, made at the expense of equality, will not end concessions but rather open the way for more concession requests. It is imperative that Turkey prevent the desires of the West from turning into covetousness. Otherwise, the conditions that Turkey will face will make staying in the Western world impossible. This nation -- in spite of the economic crisis -- is not crushed nor destroyed, although millions of families in Turkey watch on TRT- 2 every Tuesday night -- with tears in their eyes -- the broken-down people of Anatolia enduring the "national proposals lovingly." Mr. Clinton serves us in one respect only: Reminding us the necessity to return to our dignity and essence.
