Ortega's `House Arrest' PA2203004794 Managua Radio Corporacion in Spanish 2300 GMT 21 Mar 94 PA2203004794 Managua Radio Corporacion Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Interview with Dr. Daniel Oliva, attorney for the family of Jean Paul Genie, by unidentified reporter; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] [Text] [Reporter] Dr. Oliva what is the status of the Genie case after General Humberto Ortega appeared before the military [word indistinct]? Go ahead, Doctor. [Oliva] Gen. Humberto Ortega arrived in the Judge Advocate's office today to testify [declaracion indagatoria], that is, he was considered to be a suspect [reo]. We expected Gen. Ortega to deny the charges or try to refute them with some kind of evidence. We never expected him to use this kind of sophistry. He claimed that he could not remember events or dates and that he knew nothing about other events because he had only learned that a young man named Jean Paul Genie had died during an attack by armed men at 2047 on 28 October. Gen. Ortega claimed that at 0800 on 29 October he had already organized a commission comprised of high-ranking Army officers to conduct an investigation. This commission was only created because someone had already said that the general's motorcade was the only one involved in the case. This commission did not allow any authority -- civilian or military, that is, the police -- to enter Complex 003 to conduct investigations. This commission acted as a retaining wall to prevent any data at Complex 003 from appearing on a police report. [words indistinct] when he was asked whether Colonel [name indistinct] informed him in the commission's report that the log book, which contain information on the arrivals and departures of Renegade jeeps at Complex 003 and that there was a time entry that left no doubt that the motorcade could not have been at the site of the events. That log book, however, was incinerated, and Gen. Ortega does not know that this book was incinerated even today. We did not expect this. This is unheard-of. Who could believe that they destroyed a book that contains the evidence, and that the parties that would have benefited from that evidence authorized its destruction. Obviously, all these negative aspects contribute to reinforcing the presumption that all the accused, that is, the members of the motorcade and Humberto Ortega, are guilty. After testifying, Gen. Ortega was obviously considered a suspect, and a provisional arrest warrant was issued for him. This warrant, however, was replaced with house arrest. In other words, Gen. Ortega is under arrest in his house for 10 days or until the sentence is handed down. [Reporter] Dr. Oliva, in view of this house arrest for Gen. Ortega, can he continue as Army chief? [Oliva] No, no, impossible. He has already said he would place himself at the disposal of the Attorney General's Office, which ordered his arrest. The Attorney General's Office has ordered Gen. Ortega to remain at his residence, with the limitations facing every arrested criminal. [Reporter] What is next in this process [proceso] against Ortega? [Oliva] Many witnesses have yet to testify. Many of them have not appeared in court or have not been located. Undoubtedly, we were unable to locate certain witnesses, because they are afraid, went into hiding. Others fear giving a deposition in which they will adversely affect such powerful a man. [Reporter] What is your opinion on the person who is handling this process at the military inspector's office? [Oliva] Hello? Hello? [Reporter] What is your opinion or view on the person who is working at the military inspector's office on this process which began today and lasted more than five hours? [Oliva] So far the prosecutors have simply handled the proceedings of the corresponding questions and answers. It cannot be said these officials have violated the law. The basic thing is to wait for the Attorney General's Office to write its final report and issue its judgment, to see whether the accused are sent to prison or the case against them is dismissed. [Reporter] Can this provisional arrest of Ortega be indefinite? What is the situation? [Oliva] No. This arrest cannot last for more than 10 days. If after 10 days the investigation has not been completed, Ortega will be ordered released on bail. If the report has been completed, a definite ruling will be issued. [Reporter] What is the situation of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in the Genie case? [Oliva] They are waiting to learn if legal provisions or human rights are being violated in this process; in case this is true, they will naturally sanction not only the Nicaraguan Government but will issue an opinion stating clearly the responsibility of the accused.
