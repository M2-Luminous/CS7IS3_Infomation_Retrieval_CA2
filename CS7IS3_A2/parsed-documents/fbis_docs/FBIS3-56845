Commenting on Kozyrev's remarks at a conference on the Russian policy towards the CIS member states the spokesman had not even troubled to verify the text of Kozyrev's statement. "What is strange is that a press secretary starts argument with a minister," Kozyrev said Wednesday in conclusion of the conference. Kozyrev also described the reaction of the Baltic states as strange. In his view, certain political figures there used his remarks out of the context of the entire speech which was not specifically about Latvia and had a fit of "hysterics." He explained that he wanted the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics to proceed on a civilized basis of bilateral agreements. Kozyrev emphasized that troops could not be withdrawn overnight. "Our Baltic partners know this very well. Russia will be firm about this. An orderly withdrawal in the framework of agreements will contribute to consolidation of the sovereignty of those countries," Kozyrev emphasized. The minister said that the Russian government was under pressure from extremists demanding that tanks be sent there and those who wanted Russia to withdraw completely from former Soviet republics. In his view, each of them would lead to a replay of the Yugoslav scenario in what used to be the USSR. He thinks that ignoring the special role played by Russia would also lead to a disaster. "If Russia gets out of Tajikistan, discontinues its peace mission in Karabakh, Ossetia and other trouble spots, where will the refugees move, some of them not Slavic at all? Where will the Tajiks, Georgians, Abkhazians and Ossetians go? They will go to Moscow. We cannot and will not allow this," Kozyrev said. The minister emphasized that appropriate agreements had to be signed on the stay of Russian troops in the republics that needed them. In his words, "our Western partners sometimes find it difficult to comprehend these simple truths.... They don't seem to understand the special role played by Russia and so panicky noises are made that Kozyrev calls for Russian military presence on foreign soil." This reminded him of the former USSR's diplomacy which created a bogey of an enemy and made continuous noise about U.S. bases. Kozyrev warned that Russia would not keep silent when the rights of the Russian-speaking population in former Soviet republics were infringed on. He said that negotiations on the Russian speaking population were underway with the leaders of all former Soviet republics and added that if the international law was ignored and the rights of the Russian speaking population were violated, Russia could "take a tough line.... We had been saying even before Zhirinovskiy that economic sanctions can be imposed on states that pursue this kind of policy." On the other hand, he warned against yielding to pro-fascist forces in Russia.
