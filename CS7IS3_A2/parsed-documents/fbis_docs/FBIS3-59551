But French suppliers must regroup and team up with other Europeans to be competitive on the international armament markets, especially in dealing with the Americans. The Western countries, including France, have been reducing their military expenditures ever since the end of the Cold War. But these rather melancholy cuts do not nip at all of the components of the defense budget in a uniform manner. Some weapon programs are being scaled back or even dropped; on the other hand, the data processing sector of the Defense Establishment seems to be going full speed ahead in the technical, operational, and logistic sense, it seems. "The enemy has vanished now that the Soviet Bloc has broken up. Now there is a big question mark dangling over weapons systems that were designed to counter that threat. On the other hand, the ability to master, process, and transmit information becomes vital for a modern army, based on mobility and efficiency, particularly in a tight budget context," noted Pierre Audoin, president and general manager of Pierre Audoin Conseil Consultants. In other words, it is better to have a few well-equipped ships that can respond to a missile attack in a matter of seconds with the help of highly-perfected data processing and command-control systems, rather than to have a big, but underequipped fleet. "The Falkland War and then the Gulf War took place in highly heterogeneous environments where it is sometimes a rather delicate matter to tell friend from foe. Besides, you have to know how to handle the logistics of an army that moves in distant theaters of operation, such as, for example, supplying them with spare parts for aircraft. That explains the tendency toward the development of big command and logistics systems," commented Francois Dufaux, director-general of the Sema Group, a French-British service company which has a strong presence in command-control systems, particularly for the navy. Software -- The Very Heart of Systems Software is from now on in the very heart of new weapons systems. Any organization of ground forces, naval forces, or air forces is based on it. The complete data processing system used in the Leclerc tank (data preparation and processing) accounted for between 10 and 15 percent of its total cost; in the old days, a tank had very little in the way of data processing equipment. A central command system accounts for between five and six percent of the price tag on a frigate. This, by the way, is the field where Sema Group in 1989 was able to get its hands on a Fr400 million contract with the Royal Navy; this was one of the biggest contracts ever awarded in Europe in the field of data processing engineering. The command systems used in the Royal Navy's frigates were based on more than 280 distributed processors and on a storage capacity of more than 1,500 megaoctets. Business deals like this one, spreading out over several years, make it possible to look far ahead quite calmly at a time when civilian contracts are shrinking in terms of number and duration. Still, the French data processing market for the Defense Establishment would not exceed Fr4-5 billion per year, excluding materiel. But it is difficult to identify it since it is rooted in the much more vast area of defense electronics. This market is mostly dominated by four companies: the Sema Group, whose Defense Establishment activities grew from 18 percent to 23.3 percent of its business volume between 1991 and 1992; Syseca, an affiliate of the Thomson Group, which makes 600 million in the defense data processing field out of a total business volume of Fr1.6 billion; Matra Cap Systemes, sprung from last February's merger of Cap Sesa Defense and Matra MS2i, which should do about Fr950 million worth of business this year; finally, there is Dassault Electronique. In the opinion of Michel Cochy de Moncan, who heads Defense and Aeronautical Activities at Syseca, with a business volume that has been growing between six and seven percent per year for the past three years, "the French data processing market for the Defense Department is certainly not tremendous, but it has some nice days ahead of it, because the complexity of weapons systems and the volume of data to be processed keep growing constantly." Yves Veret, president and general manager of Matra Cap Systemes, believes that "the French cruise missile program entails a rather considerable increase in the on-board data volume, especially as regards cartography." As to possible simulation of nuclear tests rather than physical shots on computers, that is a matter of great concern to suppliers such as the Sema Group. The lack of growth on certain civilian markets for service companies is thus not paralleled in military matters. "As a matter of fact, we diversified our systems integration markets, particularly in regard to the military sector; that enabled us to withstand the crisis much better," commented Francois Dufaux. Moreover, being a sensitive sector, the French market here benefits from protection against the American competition. But the Defense Establishment no longer is the manna from heaven, as it was six or seven years ago. "The military people are watching their expenditures very closely and they stir up competition to bring prices down," remarked Yves Veret. Fortunately, the drop in profit margins was partly made up by productivity gains resulting from the development of software (see box). Nationwide, competition is represented by certain data processing services and engineering companies that are attracted by the growth of data processing for the Defense Establishment. And the four leading companies, represented rather unevenly among the three services, are fighting among each other by tackling the markets on which they are weakest. European Cooperation Undertakings Multiplying "The policy of overspecialization and excessive compartmentalization of resources is dangerous for French industry while customers demand a broad assortment," notes Michel Cochy de Moncan. "Two or three operators would be plenty on the French market," suggested Yves Heret [sic]. An effort at concentration thus seems inevitable. As a matter of fact, it has already begun and it is now expressed by the fact that big "military system makers" -- such as Thomson or Matra, which needed know-how in systems integration -- are getting together with data processing services and engineering companies, such as Syseca and Cap Sesa Defense. Likewise, Sema Group created a joint venture with British Aerospace and recently teamed up with Thomson for a combined bidding effort in Korea. This strategy is designed to cope with rise in R&D costs but also to develop a capacity for responding to bidding invitations on the European level. "Like the future French-Italian-British frigate, the consortiums are going to multiply in Europe, either temporarily or permanently. Multinational programs are bound to grow in view of the cost of certain programs and the budget restrictions now in force in all countries of the European Union," predicts Francois Dufaux. This feeling is shared in Syseca, which is participating in the French-Italian program for the development of a missile of the Patriot type, side by side with trans-Alpine manufacturers. These European cooperation undertakings will also enable enterprises in the Old World to refrain from fighting like isolated units on the international markets against the redoubtable firms from the other side of the Atlantic. The latter, as a matter of fact, can come out with lower prices than their European counterparts on account of the size of their domestic market that allows them to spread the costs over large series, while the Europeans are restricted to their domestic markets. [Box] Multipurpose Hardware (or Almost So) To meet the competition, data processing services and engineering companies in the Defense Establishment are pursuing a policy of reusing software both in the military/civilian sense and in the civilian/military sense, because these two areas overlap increasingly. That makes it possible to capitalize on the knowledge that was acquired and to safe R&D funds. In the software engineering field, the Concerto Shop, developed jointly by CNET [National Center for Telecommunications Studies] and the Sema Group for technical and scientific data processing, was used for the purpose of developing the command-control system of the Royal Navy's frigates and was picked up by the French Navy for training simulators on the "Le Triomphant" nuclear submarine. Looking at satellite image processing, Matra Cap Systemes is reusing military developments for Spot, the civilian Earth observation satellite. Finally, for crisis management systems, it is possible to reuse the basic "military" building blocks in complex civilian systems employed for crisis management in areas tied to pollution and the environment.
