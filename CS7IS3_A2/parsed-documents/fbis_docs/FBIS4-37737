FBIS4-37737 "drnes122dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Husayni Defends Postponement of 'Arafat Arrival Al-Husayni Defends Postponement of 'Arafat Arrival TA2406063794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0405 GMT 24 Jun 94 TA2406063794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Faysal al-Husayni by Karmit Gay and Moti Amir; place not given -- live] [Text] [Gay] Mr. al-Husayni, Yasir 'Arafat is constantly raising new demands and conditions for his arrival. It looks as though he is in no hurry to arrive. [Al-Husayni] Look, the issue here is not new conditions. If we are talking about real peace; if Mr. Rabin has decided to make peace with the person who issued the orders to wage a struggle against Israel; if Yasir 'Arafat, in turn, is making peace with Rabin, who also issued orders of such a nature, then I believe those who carried out these orders must not remain in prison. We, too, must close all the cases against Israelis rather than say that Israelis who killed Palestinians must be dealt with. [Gay] That is a different issue. I want to ask you, however, why 'Arafat constantly postpones his arrival here? What does this have to do with other issues? After all, he can continue the negotiations from his office in Jericho. [Al-Husayni] Look, there is no point in 'Arafat coming here and acting as though real peace is on its way, while at the same time prisoners remain incarcerated for no reason. I do not understand why there are still prisoners and why no female prisoner has been released so far. We can see that whenever the Palestinians carry out a new move, the Israelis evince an inflexible attitude regarding the prisoners issue. The Israelis must tell us clearly whether they do not want to release the prisoners or how long it will take. We want to understand this. [Amir] Mr. al-Husayni, the negotiations over the release of prisoners will take several months. The issue of international observers will also take months to be resolved. This means that 'Arafat will in fact arrive only when the entire West Bank is under Palestinian self-rule. [Al-Husayni] Not exactly. I must tell you, however, that Yasir 'Arafat cannot come under the present conditions. When Nabil Sha'th came to Jericho, he was forced to wait for several hours near al-'Awja' and several more hours near the bridge. If such issues are not resolved, 'Arafat will not be able to come. When he comes, he will come as a generally recognized national leader. I do not know how the Israelis intend to deal with Yasir 'Arafat when he arrives. If these issues are not resolved, I do not believe he can come. [Amir] Is it true that Dr. Sha'th recommended that 'Arafat delay his arrival in Jericho because of what happened to Sha'th in Jericho or because his request to visit Jerusalem was refused? [Al-Husayni] No, no. What I am saying is that every day we see something new which proves to us that the Israelis are not honoring the spirit of the agreement. Nabil Sha'th said he wanted to make a private visit to Jerusalem to meet friends. Once he said this, everything was done to prevent the visit, and he was also harassed in Jericho. If 'Arafat comes to Jericho and says something some Israelis do not like, then he will be punished by not being allowed to travel to Gaza until he writes letters and waits several days. We do not understand and cannot accept such a situation. [Gay] This morning the prime minister is convening a meeting regarding the PLO's attempts to create political facts in Jerusalem. Apparently, the prime minister does not want to legislate laws regarding this issue but to deal with each attempt separately. What do you think about this? [Al-Husayni] Look, every day there are new Israeli buildings in Jerusalem; every day more Israelis come to live in East Jerusalem. In the past, the Palestinians constituted 100 percent of the residents of East Jerusalem; now they constitute less than 50 percent. We are not allowed to build houses. Houses built because of the housing shortage in East Jerusalem are being demolished. Now the Israelis come and say that it is the Palestinians who are trying to create new facts in Jerusalem. All we are asking for is to live normally in Jerusalem. [Gay] Do you not want to turn Orient House into the Palestinian government building? [Al-Husayni] Who said that Orient House has become the Palestinian government? From its inception, Orient House has been totally dedicated to the issue of peace. We have still not completed the peace process. Once it is completed, we will see what to do with Orient House, but until then, it will continue to fulfill its mission. You know very well that the issue of Jerusalem has still not been ironed out. The negotiations on this issue are supposed to start within the next two years. So why should you seek to determine the Jerusalem issue now? You should wait until the negotiations start. Perhaps Israel is in fact implying that there are no negotiations and that the agreement was only meant to hold the Palestinians back while Israel does whatever it must to finalize everything and leave nothing for the negotiations.
