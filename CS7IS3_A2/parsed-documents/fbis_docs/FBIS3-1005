At a news conference in Pretoria, de Klerk referred to right-wingers who regard the 31 March as so-called D-day. Linda van Tilburg reports: At the end of the weekly cabinet meeting de Klerk said tonight that the right-wing is apparently planning to declare a homeland in several parts of the country on the last day in March. He said there is talk of the occupation of towns and sabotage. De Klerk also said plans are being made by the government, the Independent Electoral Commission, and the Transitional Executive Council to ensure that the election does take place in kwaZulu-Natal. Referring to confusion among civil servants in places like Ciskei, concerning their jobs and pensions, De Klerk gave the assurance tonight that the interim constitution guarantees these rights.
