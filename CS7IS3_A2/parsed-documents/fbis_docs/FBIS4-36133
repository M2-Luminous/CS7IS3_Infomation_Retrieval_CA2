'Urayqat made these remarks in a conference of Palestinian and foreign journalists about Palestinian media and democracy in the new reality in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He added that the formulation of the Palestinian local government law would be completed by 15 July and that the establishment of municipality committees and village councils would be completed within less than a month, in time for the municipal elections. The Palestinian Authority will divide the territories into nine districts, he said, and the city of Gaza will be declared a district and will be split into four boroughs. The conference held at the al-Watani Hotel in East Jerusalem is scheduled to end today. It was organized by the Palestinian Journalists Association and the International Journalists Association. The security forces banned 22 journalists -- who were supposed to participate -- from leaving the Gaza Strip, and the organizers lodged a protest with the authorities. The issue of democratic structures under Palestinian self-rule was the key topic in the conference. Many participants expressed apprehension about the curtailment of the freedom of expression of Palestinian journalists in the territories and about government control of the media. A letter sent by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, in which he promised to uphold democratic values and the peace process, was read at the beginning of the conference. "The Palestinian National Authority, which will run the affairs of our people until clean and general elections are held, will respect individual liberties, the freedom of thought, and the freedom of the press," 'Arafat stated. Addressing the conference, Dr. 'Urayqat said that the Palestinian Authority does not plan to set up defense systems made up of aircraft, tanks, or missiles and that "the only way for the Palestinian people to survive the next 50 years is to embrace genuine democracy." Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian Broadcasting Authority [PBA], said the PBA's operations would be based on the principles of freedom of expression and political pluralism and that contrary to the situation in sister countries in the Arab world, it would not be "a partisan apparatus or a government mouthpiece." Abu-'Ayyash criticized the European Union for withholding the money it promised the PBA. He also accused Israel of holding up the release of technical equipment from customs and for holding up the allocation of broadcasting channels.
