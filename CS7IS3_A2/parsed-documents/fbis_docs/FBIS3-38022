Tension Increases Between Branches of Authority"] [Text] Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was on the platform for exactly 50 minutes, addressing the deputies of both chambers of the Federal Assembly. His report "On Strengthening the Russian State" was listened to in silence and the response to it was one of restraint. The various political forces represented in parliament had no illusions about the power of the president's message to bring about creative work and accord. They were still feeling the impact of the previous day's decision by the State Duma on an amnesty for those responsible for the August putsch and the October revolt. This was the sole topic of conversation in the Kremlin before the session of the two chambers opened. Here are some pronouncements on the topic. G. Zyuganov, leader of the communists' faction: "If the president's team and the government fail to see that the State Duma's amnesty decision points the way to national accord and reconciliation, too bad for them. We are on the brink of mass strikes. The economic crisis is assuming catastrophic proportions. Therefore the task now is to take steps toward reconciliation. The amnesty should be followed by a treaty with Belarus. We must make an approach to Ukraine and restore all links with Kazakhstan." Describing the president's message, G. Zyuganov said: "The president has now promulgated 15 programs, but none of them has been implemented. I do not expect any constructive actions from the president and government. Our approach is an immediate change of economic course and the formation of a government of national confidence on condition that Chubays and Kozyrev leave it. If confrontation on the part of the executive authority continues, those who signed the agreement in the Belovezhskaya Forest will be quitting the political arena this very year." Presidential Press Secretary V. Kostikov also returned to the Duma's amnesty decision. "No doubt there is now going to be a war of legal interpretations of the State Duma decision," he said, "since, under the Constitution, it can declare an amnesty but it cannot adopt a decision on it. No one will be leaving Lefortovo or Matrosskaya Tishina in the next few weeks or months. Moreover, this decision is immoral, since those in detention were directly involved in the bloodshed. It is clear that there is a bloc of communists and neofascists in the Duma with practically no difference between them." Journalists were particularly interested in the view of Russian Federation General Prosecutor A. Kazannik. He said that the organs of the prosecutor's office are not concerned with politics, and that "We are in the business of ensuring compliance with the law, and we are obliged to apply the decision of the competent state organs. When it is published we will study it and will familiarize each of the accused with the report. If they accept the State Duma's amnesty decision, I will rule that the criminal case against this or that individual be dropped." But despite this dramatic news, which the Duma served up precisely on the eve of the president's policy statement, there were nonetheless optimistic tones regarding the president's message: Interviewed by your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the well-known economist P. Bunich said: "The president faced a difficult task: He had to talk about everything in a 50-minute speech, missing out none of the problems that society regards as explosive. His tact is to be welcomed -- he did not react to the State Duma's decision. It is not the place to talk about it. As for the very important, economic section of the message, the president's confirmation of the continuation of the course of reforms begun in 1992 can be regarded as the key feature. The second thing of importance mentioned by the president is that he does not take his lead from those who advocate strong state authority, from the report of the `Soviet academics.' Proposals by the president on, for example, freezing prices, pay, the rouble rate, and so on might have signaled his support for the course propagandized by them." Former finance minister B. Fedorov told your IZVESTIYA correspondent: "Certainly, one must welcome the president's statement of the danger that the current Cabinet of Ministers might boost inflation. Nonetheless, everything will depend on the practical implementation of the measures indicated by the president."
