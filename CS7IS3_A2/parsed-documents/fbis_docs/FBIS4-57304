FBIS4-57304 "drlat096_t_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Venezuela MAS Internal Conflicts Analyzed MAS Internal Conflicts Analyzed Secretary General on Mistakes 94SM0339B Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p D10 94SM0339B Caracas EL NACIONAL Spanish CSO [Text] MAS Secretary General Freddy Munoz admits that his political organization has made mistakes and believes this was one factor preventing the party from winning the majority backing of Venezuelans dissatisfied with the policies of the most recent administrations. Nevertheless, Munoz expresses faith in the possibility of a profound change in MAS that will restore the party to its leading role in society. Despite his recognition that MAS did not win most of the votes cast by persons disillusioned with Democratic Action and Copei, he says it is absurd to claim that the party suffered a defeat in the elections held on 5 December 1993. "The most relevant result of the most recent elections was the victory of Rafael Caldera, and our party made a significant contribution to that success," Munoz argues. Nevertheless, he admits that the victory did not have any substantial carryover in terms of MAS's election results. Examining the reasons why progress of the Movement Toward Socialism was "modest," he concludes that this force "was not perceived as a distinct alternative to AD and Copei." Munoz generally attributes this fact to errors in the adoption of certain lines. He cites the case of 4 February 1992, when Socialist leaders "failed to tell the truth expressed by Caldera concerning the following points: the circumstances under which the coup occurred and the impact which Carlos Andres Perez's disastrous government had on all of this." Munoz believes that the line taken by MAS may possibly be explained by distortions occurring in the party in recent years. "These deviations were the result of influence exerted on our organization by certain ideas, values, and habits that are characteristic of the dominant political forces," Munoz says. He concludes that the eradication of such distortions is essential if the Movement Toward Socialism is to take its rightful place as a political alternative in Venezuela. All in all, he believes that a number of MAS leaders exaggerate when they claim that the party's flaws are its main feature or its common denominator. "I naturally bear unavoidable responsibility for mistakes made by the leadership over the past eight years," he says, "but what about the undeniable progress which MAS has made during my term as secretary general?" Munoz suggests launching a debate concerning the transformation of the party. "The overall record is positive, but it is not sufficient to meet the great challenges that we face." Munoz appealed for reform of the organization. Emphasizing "major limitations that have created a need for profound change," he recommends reviewing MAS's relationship to society and its capacity to make changes in its thought and internal life. With respect to the Movement Toward Socialism's position on the government of President Rafael Caldera, he stresses that it should be guided by the principles of solidarity and autonomy. "This means loyalty to commitments shared and making the people's interests the top priority."
