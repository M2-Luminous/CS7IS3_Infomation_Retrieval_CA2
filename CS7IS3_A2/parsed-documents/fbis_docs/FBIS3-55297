Over the past six years the volume of annual extraction has declined by over 210 million tonnes. In the past two years the steepness of the spiral of decline has been characterized by the following indicators: a decline of 60 million tonnes in 1992 and of a further 50 million tonnes last year. In brief, the sector is in a deep crisis. Why? The whole point is that there can be no talk of one single reason: Problems have mingled and settled one on top of another. It is scarcely possible to emerge swiftly and painlessly from beneath their heavy weight. First of all we must consider that the quality of the sector's raw material base has changed -- and not for the better. The highly productive stocks in local deposits have to a considerable extent already been worked out, and this is the primary reason for the intensive reduction in extraction. Virtually the entire array of oil boreholes has had to be transferred from the gusher method to mechanized methods of extraction. It is the turn of the mass commissioning of low-yielding deposits. The result is a drastic increase in demand for material and financial resources for the sector's development. These increased demands have, unfortunately, come up against an opposite trend -- a reduction in centralized capital investments in the development of oil extraction. The year of maximum extraction, 1988, has by an irony of fate become the last year in which sufficient funds were earmarked for drilling. Budget investments were a fair, albeit partial, compensation for the extremely low prices for oil. Through this policy the much-maligned administrative edict system nonetheless kept the sector afloat. The drastic cutting off of budget capital investments can only be described as a crime, with subsequent aggravating relapses. The shortage of finance has meant a reduction in the volume of investments in the development of deposits, which has led in particular to the curtailment of drilling work. Thus the volume of operational drilling for oil has declined from 36 million meters in 1988 to 20 million meters in 1992, that is it has nearly halved. The pace of commissioning new deposits and the provision of wellhead facilities have declined. Because of the lack of technical and financial assets over 30,000 boreholes are standing idle, and the necessary operating regimes are not being ensured at operating wells. There are also problems of a geopolitical nature, connected with the big economic and political upheavals in the economies of the former Union and Russia. Links have been disrupted between enterprises, and without them the sector's material resource provision is being disrupted. The breakdown of traditional contacts with Azerbaijan and Ukraine, on whose territory the majority of USSR plants producing oil industry equipment and oil pipes for the entire country were located, has been a disaster. When will Russia develop a similar industry of its own? Not all sources of problems should be sought in the past -- some are emerging now. The sector's plight is being aggravated by mistakes in the price and tax policies being pursued in the course of economic reforms. These have not allowed oil industry enterprises to obtain a sufficient volume of funds of their own to make up for the centralized budget investments which the sector used to use for its development. The shortage of financial resources is fatally compounded by the overall crisis of nonpayment in the economy, whereby our enterprises, because of the rapid pace of inflation, take a long time to obtain money for the output they dispatch. The scale of the nonpayment problem -- debts to the fuel and energy complex are building up in an avalanche and are already approaching 10 trillion rubles -- of course greatly exceeds all others. At any rate, were it not for nonpayment many financial difficulties would have been overcome independently by the sector. Now it is in an impasse. We should not pin hopes on the introduction of promissory notes. To whom should we present a promissory note? To the municipal services, to whom we are obliged to supply energy resources despite their inability to pay? Or to the industrial enterprises whose fixed capital is worth several times less than its debts? The process has gone so far that measures characteristic of an efficient market economy are no help here. As a result of the simultaneous operation of these and other adverse factors, the accumulation and mingling of problems continues. It is not only oil extraction which is in decline -- the entire oil industry is experiencing a slump and crisis is paralyzing the oil supply system. A paradoxical situation has taken shape: While we are grieving over the drastic decline in production we are unable to sell readily the oil we have already obtained. Export deliveries are being disrupted. For instance, as of 24 November we had failed to deliver over 2 million tonnes of oil on schedule. At Novorossiysk, where our main terminal is located, we have been hampered by stormy weather, but in Ukraine and Belarus it is not just the elements that call the tune. We have been obliged to restrict deliveries to them because of chronic nonpayment. Once they encounter a few frosts they sometimes take advantage of the fact that oil pipelines cross their territory and try to lay hands on oil that does not belong to them, that is, they are simply starting to steal it. Thus in Belarus, in the Mozyr region, 112,000 tonnes of oil were recently stolen in a few days. There are many problems connected with oil storage in Russia itself. Right now there is no room for nearly 3 million tonnes. A crisis has overtaken oil refining. Over the first 10 months of last year its volume declined by 31 million tonnes compared with the same period in 1992. The production of automobile gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil was respectively 84, 84.3, and 88.1 percent of the same period in 1992. Another result of nonpayment has been the overstocking of oil refineries. They are not taking new raw material. According to a situation report for one particular day (24 November) five oil refineries turned away over 45,000 tonnes of oil. For instance, the "Angarsknefteorgsintez" association (and that means a little over 30,000 tonnes) refused deliveries completely. The Saratov oil refinery refused Kazakhstan oil: It cannot even "digest" its own Russian crude: Since the start of the year it has turned away 181,000 tonnes. The nonpayment problem, while objectively destabilizing the operation of the finely tuned system of oil and oil refinery product supply, is also pernicious in that ordinary extravagance, inefficiency, and carelessness are hidden in its shadow. One way or another -- even under conditions of the constant reduction of extraction -- the transport pipeline network is constantly being overloaded. For instance, in the course of 24 hours we accepted 890,000 tonnes of oil but were able to distribute only about 850,000 tonnes, and the rest had to be left in the system. This counterwave ultimately surges back to the operating boreholes and may be said to lash them. That is why they have to be brought to a standstill. Will anyone see one of the most serious problems behind such chaos -- the extremely low yield of the oil reservoirs? And is now the time to worry about it? Despite everything, now is the time; because if we do not solve it, there is no future, there are no prospects. Can we really consent to leaving over half of the petroleum underground? This is impermissible now. After all, in the future we will have to bore deeper and deeper, overcoming the increasingly complex geological structure of the earth's interior. Developing such reserves requires the use of expensive new equipment, the creation of efficient methods of increasing the oil yield of productive strata. Raising the oil yield of the strata thus becomes a strategic sphere of scientific-technical progress in the sector and another very important condition of the stabilization and development of oil extraction. That is precisely why, as more and more new deposits with reserves which are difficult to extract are put into exploitation, the scale of testing and the industrial use of hydrodynamic, chemical, thermal, and gas methods of increasing the oil yield is growing. Russia has at its disposal practically all the technologies which are currently used extensively worldwide. Laboratory research and industrial testing of unconventional methods of bed stimulation are also being developed -- vibration-seismic, biotechnological, and intrastratal generation of working agents. Since the future of oil extraction is determined by the application and growth in efficiency of new methods and technologies, an analysis of the dynamics of this process is relevant. At present over 20 methods of increasing the oil yield and over 130 technologies for implementing them are being applied at experimental and industrial level. Work connected with them is being conducted at 333 facilities, and over 5 billion tonnes of initial reserves of oil are involved here. In 1992 an extra 33 million tonnes of oil were extracted as a result of the application of methods for increasing the oil yield of the strata, including: 24.3 million tonnes from hydrodynamic methods of stimulation, 6.7 million tonnes from physical-chemical methods, 1.5 million from thermal methods, and 0.5 million tonnes from gas methods. The speed at which oil extraction is increaased as a result of applying the aforementioned methods will depend on the relationship between the favorable and hindering factors. Experts are making the following predictions for additional extraction from applying the new methods: 10-20 million tonnes by the year 2000, and 20-40 million tonnes by 2010. So what is hindering us from making full use of the advantages of the new methods and technologies of raising the oil yield of the strata? Apart from the shortage of technical resources and chemical materials, the high proportionate exploitation costs and capital expense involved in utilizing them have raised serious obstacles. These are far higher than in traditional methods of oil extraction. Measures of a legislative and normative nature are needed, aimed at economic incentives for the application of efficient new methods of raising the oil yield of deposits. These measures would enable us to raise a whole stratum of problems, such as the financing of scientific-research and experimental-design work in the creation of new technologies and technical resources and the development of the material-technical base of institutes involved in the creation of the new methods. The main thing, however, is that prospects will be opened up for increasing the oil yield from deposits with reserves that are difficult of access.
