FBIS4-67904 "jptnd011___94027" JPRS-TND-94-011 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 27 February 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA INDIA Reportage on Successful Agni Missile Firing Reportage on Successful Agni Missile Firing Difficulties Expected 94WP0078C Madras THE HINDU in English 27 Feb 94 p 7 94WP0078C Madras THE HINDU English CSO [Text] New Delhi, March 2--The Government has decided not to induct Agni, the indigenously-developed intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), into the armed forces at this stage, though the missile was successfully test-fired on February 19 as a technology-demonstrator. Instead, the Government for the time being, wants efforts concentrated on refining certain parameters of Agni, it is learnt. When the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme was conceived in 1983 and the decision taken later to have three test-firings of the missile, it was not decided what to do after this was achieved. However, the issue was considered in some detail at the highest political level recently. India's decision to develop its own IRBM was frowned upon by the West, especially the United States, because a missile of Agni's capability can deliver a nuclear payload and leave the enemy with no response time. However, no foreign power has made any public pronouncement after India's capability was proved in the IRBM field last month. Nor did other Governments express themselves through official or diplomatic channels. It is to be seen if the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, broaches the subject when she comes here for discussion this month. Among the parameters of Agni that the decision-makers want refined is the guidance system of the missile so as to reduce the Circular Error Probable (CEP). The effort is to increase the accuracy of the IRBM.
