Brazil is striving to enlarge its submarine fleet and is building a nuclear submarine, while Russia badly needs nuclear plants to replace its old reactors that run the risk of causing a tragedy at any time. They do not need submarines, which they have in excess and which are expensive to maintain. We do not need the plant, which we bought without needing it and without having the money to install it.
