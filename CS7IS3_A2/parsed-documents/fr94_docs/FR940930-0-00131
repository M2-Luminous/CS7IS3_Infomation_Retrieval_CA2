ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments require the establishment of two clean-fuel vehicle programs: a Clean Fuel Fleet Program and a California Pilot Test Program. Under the Clean Fuel Fleet Program, a percentage of new vehicles acquired by certain fleet owners located in covered areas will be required to meet clean-fuel fleet vehicle emission standards. Fleet owners can comply with this requirement by purchasing new clean-fuel fleet vehicles, by converting conventional vehicles to clean-fuel fleet vehicles, or by acquiring ``credits'' pursuant to a credits program. Affected states are required to revise their State Implementation Plans to implement the fleet program, including provisions to implement a credit program and exempt clean-fuel fleet vehicles from certain transportation control measures. Regulations have already been promulgated for the credit program and transportation control measures exemptions. Also, definitions of terms used with the Clean Fuel Fleet program have recently been finalized. The other Clean Air Act clean-fuel vehicle program is the California Pilot Test program. This program requires manufacturers to sell light-duty clean-fuel vehicles in the state of California. EPA has established a credit program for the California Pilot Test Program in a separate rulemaking.
