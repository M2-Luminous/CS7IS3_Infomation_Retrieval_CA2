That is why the council has recommended to Premier and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus that he consider strict measures against Baudys up to and including his dismissal, ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach told journalists during a pause in the council's session today. Baudys acquainted journalists with his proposal to end the Bosnia conflict on Saturday [19 February], admitting that he had consulted neither the government nor parliament. Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to supervise the situation. The committee would comprise seven states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties -- Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, Italy and one other unspecified country. Vlach said that Baudys (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) had acted at variance with the Constitution and harmed the Czech Republic's credit as a partner seeking membership of NATO and being greatly interested in joining the Partnership for Peace plan. Vlach said it was not possible at the moment to say how many emergency sessions had been called to deal with Baudys's surprise move, but it was almost certain that the case would be addressed by the government on Wednesday [23 February]. On Czech Television tonight Klaus called unprecedented the fact that Baudys's proposal was conveyed first to foreign partners and that the heads of foreign states received Baudys's letter earlier than Czech "leaders." "We must deal with two things -- to what extent the offence was committed knowingly, and to what extent it was a badly thought-out move," Klaus said. ODS Spokeswoman Jana Petrova said that when Baudys presented his proposal as his own personal initiative, it would have been appropriate "if he had signed the letter containing the initiative simply 'Antonin Baudys' and sent it by ordinary mail to the representatives of other countries." But sending it via military attaches, as he did, is not a regular way for personal mail, Petrova added.
