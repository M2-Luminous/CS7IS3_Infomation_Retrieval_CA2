Fifty people working at Rio de Janeiro's international airport are being checked. Otto Gomes de Miranda is the man police have charged with leading the gang that sells arms to Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers. Otto might be the chief of detective (Luiz Eduardo Satto) and informer (Luiz Etienne), who last week was arrested carrying ammunition and 22 kg of cocaine, which was to have been delivered in Rio de Janeiro's hills. Otto, who is now calmly resting at the Tijuca resort in western Rio de Janeiro, served a 14-month prison term in the United States. He denies the arms smuggling charges: [Begin recording] That's a lie because everyone knows and it is public and noticeable that I was arrested in the United States with some arms. Those arms were all legal. [end recording] There is something police are sure of. The arms used by the traffickers in the hills come from Miami and Panama, and they enter Brazil through the Rio de Janeiro international airport. Rio de Janeiro Federal Police Superintendent Edson de Oliveira knows the arms are unloaded directly from the planes and then escorted by the gangs to ships hidden at Governador Island, where the airport is located. According to Federal Revenue Department officials, supervision is precarious because of a personnel shortage. In days with many flights, one supervisor has to check 124 passengers. For 18 months now, Federal Police have investigated the people who work at Rio de Janeiro international airport. Police arrived at a conclusion: There are several gangs engaged in arms smuggling at the airport. Some of them have members from the Federal Police. [Begin Edson de Oliveira recording] We are investigating approximately 50 people who probably are engaged in arms smuggling in that airport. [end recording]
