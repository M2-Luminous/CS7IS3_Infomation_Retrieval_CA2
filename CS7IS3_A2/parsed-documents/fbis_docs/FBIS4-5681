Both ruling and opposition parties have "indicated clearly" the direction the full tax reform should take, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting, brushing aside the notion that the current political uncertainty could retard the process. He was referring to a provision attached by legislators from the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party when enacting a single-year tax cut bill in March. It calls for inclusion of a permanent tax cut in a reform to be enacted by the end of the year. Saito also said he "hopes for some conclusion on funding" in reference to deficit-covering bonds to be issued to offset the income tax cut, limited to fiscal 1994. The Finance Ministry has been calling for a consumption tax hike to offset tax cuts. Concerning the impact of political uncertainty on the economy, Saito said the stock and currency exchange markets "held relatively steady despite my earlier concerns." Saying he would watch developments, Saito repeated his wish for Diet passage "as soon as possible" of the fiscal 1994 budget, and said Japanese officials are working "through diplomatic channels" to seek a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. framework trade talks.
