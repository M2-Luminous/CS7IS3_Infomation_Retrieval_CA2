We believe that what happened yesterday is a declaration of war, and not only a circumstantial, temporary, or objective aggression. What happened was a series of air raids by Israeli aircraft and helicopters, using all methods, including incendiary bombs, and the pursuit of civilians who escaped the region, by military helicopters. This action is absolutely unjustified and can only be within a process of war launched by Israel against Lebanon. We think the United Nations, which has recently not responded to several attacks that took place, is now facing a test. It either proves its credibility and its raison d'etre as a frame of reference for the nations that are attacked, or it proves once again that it is incapable of adopting positions that establish justice and right in this world. Therefore, Lebanon has filed a complaint with the Security Council asking for an immediate session to discuss the second Israeli attack within less than 10 days. I believe the climate that surrounds this issue -- and updating public opinion in Lebanon on this issue -- are part of the test of the Security Council's credibility and seriousness. [Badawi] Mr. Minister Buwayz, in case the Security Council does not immediately respond to Lebanon's request, what are the options and channels open to you? [Buwayz] I think I have already given the answer. We are facing exposed and unmistakable aggression of clear magnitude. This aggression martyred around 50 people and left more than 60 people wounded without any justification. We think that if the Security Council does not act, then we have already provided the answer to this. [Badawi] In concrete terms, what are you going to ask the Security Council to do to deter Israel from carrying out other operations? [Buwayz] First of all, a clear and unequivocal resolution by the Security Council to condemn the Israeli action. Second, we demand the implementation of the resolution by adopting all measures to implement Resolution 425. For, it is not acceptable to pile up resolutions in Security Council files and offices unless these resolutions have the power of implementation. We absolutely cannot understand how the Security Council acted and found all the capabilities regarding some of the issues worldwide, which especially seek to tame some Arab countries, but when these resolutions are meant against Israel, the Security Council is unable to do anything. [Badawi] Mr. Minister, my final question: What is your comment on the reports or analyses that these repeated Israeli operations against Lebanon are linked with the negotiating tracks, particularly with Syria, and that these operations are a kind of a message from Israel to Damascus? [Buwayz] Of course, I do not want to talk about the messages addressed by Israel, and to whom. There are messages addressed to the Israeli Army perhaps to boost its morale; there are messages addressed to Lebanon and Syria, etc. However, what is clear and certain is that Israel is trying to pressure Lebanon and Syria by what happened yesterday and is trying to eliminate the negotiating cards of Syria and Lebanon to embarrass them. [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Minister.
