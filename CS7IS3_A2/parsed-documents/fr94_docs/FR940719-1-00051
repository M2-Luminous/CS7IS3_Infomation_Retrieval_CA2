FR940719-1-00051 FR940719-1-00015 Another possible application is a back-up fan producing a lesser quantity than the main mine fan. In this case, unless the main mine fan can be restored to operation within 15 minutes, withdrawal would be required under §75.313. After withdrawal is complete, re-entry could be permitted and electrical circuits restored as provided through the approved ventilation plan. The Agency would expect operators to rely on engineering data or actual ventilation survey results when developing these ventilation plan provisions. During operation of the back-up fan, the approved ventilation plan would only permit activity which is related to maintaining the mine in safe condition. This work could include pumping, urgent roof support installation, or other safety-related work. The production of coal under these conditions would not be permitted unless the mine were adequately ventilated and a new ventilation plan has been approved. Some multiple-fan ventilation systems are configured such that if one fan fails, reduced air quantities continue to ventilate all portions of the mine with no potentially hazardous air reversals occurring. In such cases, ventilation plan provisions, if supported by data, could be developed which would allow re-entry for the purposes discussed in the previous paragraph. This activity would be limited to maintaining the mine in safe condition until the full ventilation system is restored to operation. Under existing §75.311(b)(1), when a main mine fan is stopped intentionally and the ventilating quantity of the main mine fan is not maintained by a back-up fan, only persons necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise be made while the fan is operating, are permitted underground. The maintenance or repair work which could not be made while the fan is operating is limited to work or repair which would endanger the safety of the worker if the fan were operating. Examples of the type of work that may not be possible while the fan is operating could include maintenance of the fan, repairs or adjustments to ventilation controls immediately inby the fan that are subject to high pressure differentials, and coating of mine surfaces immediately inby the fan. These examples are given for the purpose of facilitating understanding and are not considered all-inclusive. While the Agency is proposing to change only paragraph (d) of existing §75.311, comments are specifically solicited on the issues discussed. Section 75.312␣Main Mine Fan Examinations and Records The Agency would revise the existing standard in a number of respects. Except in certain situations, a daily examination of the main mine fans would be required each day that the mine operates. One exception would be the use of a fan monitoring system in accordance with §75.312. Requirements for training, recording of defects, review of fan monitoring data, certifying and countersigning of records would be added to the rule. Also, the standard would allow underground power to remain energized when a fan is shut down for testing of the automatic closing doors and fan signal device, provided that the fan is restarted within 15 minutes, and would permit an alternative means of testing that would not require stopping the fan. Proper operation of main mine fans is critical to mine ventilation. Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, like the existing standard, requires main mine fans and associated components, including devices used to measure and record pressure, to be examined at least once each day that the fan operates, unless a functioning fan monitoring system is used. However, it is proposed that on any day when no one goes underground that a fan examination would not be required. The Agency is proposing this approach along with the provision that an examination of the fan be completed prior to anyone's entering the mine, including certified persons. Such an examination would assure that the fan is operating properly. The Agency does not believe that any hazard can be associated with not examining a mine fan if no one goes into the mine, and solicits comments on this point. During the informational meetings and later discussions, the Agency was asked to clarify the qualifications of the person designated by the operator to make daily fan examinations or the weekly fan examination in the case of mines using fan monitoring systems. It continues to be the position of the Agency that persons assigned to make this or any other examination must be capable of making an adequate examination; that is, an examination in a manner that assures the protection sought by the standard. For this reason, and to address the concerns raised, the proposal would adopt the words of the regulation in effect prior to November 16, 1992, §75.300&hyph;4(a), and require in paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) that main mine fans be examined by trained persons designated by the operator. Since the purpose of the examination, as stated in the proposed standard, is to assure the electrical and mechanical reliability of the fan, the training that the examiner receives should be focused on the electrical and mechanical functioning of fans. The proposal, in paragraph (b)(1)(i), reflects comments received by the Agency that in order for fan monitoring systems to be effective, the data from these systems must be reviewed by mine management each day. This review is intended to parallel the daily fan examination and assure that responsible personnel are aware of the performance of the fan and the fan monitoring system. In paragraph (b)(1)(ii), the proposal would retain the requirement that at least once every 7 days the monitoring system be tested and the main mine fan be examined. Consistent with paragraph (a), as discussed previously, this examination would be required to be done by a trained person designated by the operator for the purpose of assuring the electrical and mechanical reliability of the fan.
