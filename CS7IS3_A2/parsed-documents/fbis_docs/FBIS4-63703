First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and the chief department for the military budget and financing of the Defense Ministry are assigned to control the implementation of this directive, informed sources from the Russian Defense Ministry told ITAR-TASS today. The document accentuates that under the conditions of the stiff budget it is necessary to maintain the most important components ensuring combat efficiency of the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, military experts note, these measures taken by the defense minister, will hardly save the situation if the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) does not agree to increase the military budget from 37.1 trillion roubles to at least 55.0 trillion roubles which was approved in principle by the duma Defense Committee. In the estimation of the chief department of the military budget and financing of the Defense Ministry, in the first four months of 1994 the Defense Ministry received about 4 trillion roubles which put the Armed Forces and enterprises carrying out military orders in an exceptionally complex condition. Military representatives do not agree that they are guided by narrow departmental interests. Speaking at a news conference on a military budget recently held at the State Duma, Andrey Kokoshin noted that he was taking measures to resolve the current crisis of mutual non-payments by enterprises and stimulate the output of high technology products for the civil use -- transport, communications, television and power grids -- with the aim of increasing the budget revenue item. He explained that in a bid to get a larger sum of allocations for the defense, experts meant not to increase it but maintain this sum of financing at the level of 1993 in comparable prices. No less than 60 per cent of these funds will be spent on social needs which have considerably grown in connection with the withdrawal of Russian troops from republics of the former Soviet Union and former socialist countries, and providing them with dwellings and amenities. The Russian president, the head of the government and the chairman of the Federation Council expressed their agreement in principle with the need to increase the defense budget, Andrey Kokoshin pointed out. "The 37.1 trillion roubles intended for the defense and approved by the State Duma at the first reading will be enough only to pay salaries and money allowances to the troops," the defense minister told journalists at a news conference on May 19. "If the Army splits the most awful thing may happen -- nobody will be able to stop hungry soldiers," Pavel Grachev emphasised.
