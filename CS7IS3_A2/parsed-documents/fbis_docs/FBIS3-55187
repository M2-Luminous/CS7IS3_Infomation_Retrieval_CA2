Speaking at a meeting with the deputies of the State Duma from autonomous entities in Moscow on Wednesday, Shakhray said that "there have been attempts by large election blocs to predetermine the fate of the State Duma behind the back of the majority of deputies." He stressed that the Party of Russian Unity and Accord is ready for forming a broad coalition in the Duma "at least on the basis of a common approach towards the principle of election of the duma chairman." This would ensure the equality of all deputies. Additionally, all Duma leaders should be elected individually by secret ballot, Shakhray said. He pointed out that a faction in the State Duma can include not less than 14 people which equals the number of seats each bloc has in the house if it has cleared the five per cent threshold. Shakhray added that a "faction begins to exist only after it has been registered by the Duma secretariat."
