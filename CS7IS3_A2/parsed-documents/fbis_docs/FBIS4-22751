Today, the board of the People's Accord Party, which had been led by Janis Jurkans, adopted a resolution on the creation of separate Saeima factions. Saturday, the other "Accord" group of deputies -- the Economists Union, led by Edvins Kide, will hold a founding meeting, which will likewise resolve to create its faction. Next week, J.Jurkans and his followers will sign a statement announcing the formation of the faction and present it to the Saeima Board of Officers. Accordingly, already next week, in place of the current faction Accord for Latvia, there will be two independent factions in the Saeima. The People's Accord Party (PAP) faction will have four deputies -- J. Jurkans (faction chairman), Ludmila Kuprijanova, Igors Bukovskis and Andris Ameriks. The founding document of the Economists Union (EU) faction was signed by seven deputies -- E. Kide (chairman of the former Accord faction and, apparently, of the new faction), Vilnis Bresis, Irene Folkmane, Juris Janeks, Janis Lucans, Leonards Stass, and Jevgenijs Zascerinskis. Two deputies -- Ernests Jurkans and Eriks Kaza, who, in their voting, have not infrequently shown their support for the ruling coalition, have not joined with any of the potential factions for now, but if they do join, it will probably be the PAP. The first signs of a split in the election union of Accord for Latvia -- Rebirth of the Economy, which shortened its name in the Saeima to Accord for Latvia (AL), were already evident in the fall of last year. Differences in the viewpoints of the factions did not permit the formation of a unified political party, although the AL deputies promised that they would remained united at least in the Saeima. Even though both sides are still keeping alive the idea of the formation of a united voting bloc, which would be permissible in accordance with the Saeima's rules of order, neither of the sides is exhibiting any particular enthusiasm. "We could create something similar to the National bloc, but we can already see that the effect of such a bloc is doubtful," admitted J. Jurkans in a conversation with DIENA. When the other leader -- E. Kide, was asked whether the formation of the bloc was a reality, he told DIENA: "We will take a look at the other side's position. At present, such a development is not out of the question". The main reasons for the split according to J. Jurkans were the other side's inconsistent policies, the realization of the pre-election program, and he was particularly embittered about E. Kide joining the ruling coalition in the projected citizenship law. E. Kide, in turn, is more at ease and feels that there are no main differences in opinion between PAP and EU, although their programs differ primarily in "nuances". He does admit, however, that these "nuances" do not permit the Accord unity to exist. Despite the split of the third largest faction in the Saeima, which is the first largest since the election, the overall political picture in the parliament will not change -- and both J. Jurkans and E. Kide are in agreement on this. Neither of the new factions sees any reason to change its present viewpoint and show more favor towards the ruling coalition.
