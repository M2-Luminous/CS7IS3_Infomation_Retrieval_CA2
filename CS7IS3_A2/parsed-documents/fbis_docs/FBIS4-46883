Chaplygin, candidate of economic sciences: "On the Way to a Unified Economic Space?"] [Text] The Moscow Meeting of the Leaders of the CIS States marked another frontier in the transformation of post-Soviet space. The frontier is more an economic one and marks the starting point for practical steps in compatible market transformations of the national economies and their integration in stages. Imbalance of Interests During the time of the USSR, the mutual ties of the present participants in the Commonwealth accounted for at least 20 percent of the aggregate gross national product. About three-quarters of the economic interests of the Union republics were oriented to Russia and roughly one-third of Russian needs for output of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemistry, machinebuilding, and light industry was in their hands. For certain types of raw materials, rare earth elements, and components, Russia even now is 70-100 percent dependent on supplies from the CIS. According to some estimates, the disintegration of economic ties in 1992-1993 accounted for from 30 to 60 percent of the lost gross national product of the Commonwealth countries. The awareness of objective interdependence is coming through the breakdown of the euphoria of sovereignty, the collapse of unrealizable hopes for the satisfying and warm embraces of the West and rich "spiritual-historical" relatives, and a sharper sense of the catastrophe of economic isolation. It is calculated that each percentage point of reduction or, in contrast, expansion of mutual deliveries impoverishes or enriches the partners in the CIS by between 4 percent (Russia) and 10 percent (Turkmenistan) of gross national product. But the complete disruption of economic ties in the Commonwealth threatens Russia with a one-third reduction in final consumption, and the other participants in it--with a decline to scarcely one-sixth the former level. On the other hand, the impossibility and in fact uselessness of at any price preserving economic ties in the form in which they developed under the all-Union distribution of labor and cooperation is recognized no less clearly. An approach consisting of at least three forces of influence has clearly taken shape. First, the attempt to identify those production-technological links which--if they are not mutually coordinated--make it impossible to overcome the economic crisis, achieve stabilization, and develop in the future. Second, the aspiration for the kind of structural reorganization of production which ensures economic security and independence (oil, electricity production, and food) by relying on one's own efforts. Third, with the support of the CIS countries to create favorable conditions for increasing export potential, for attracting investments preferably from the far abroad, and for making breakthroughs to contemporary technologies and to new sales markets. Under these approaches, national-state interests inevitably become paramount. Russia is attempting to overcome the donor attitude toward itself, establish equivalent exchange, and protect its current and long-term geopolitical and economic interests. This pertains especially to the effectiveness of deliveries to the Commonwealth countries of fuel and energy resources, preservation of traditional sales markets, and access to unique sources of strategic raw materials and the transport infrastructure. The Russian partners obviously are interested in cheap energy media, equipment, and consumer goods, sales markets for their output, and credit resources, and figuring on "fraternal aid." Achieving parity of interests and balancing them is for now difficult to do. A more down-to-earth calculation predominates: who wins and who loses, and how much, based on prices, customs tariffs, conditions of settlement of accounts, and volumes of interrelated deliveries. A "double standard" seems to arise: easy and complete accord at the higher levels in terms of general conceptual approaches and for multilateral reintegration understandings, and difficult, exhausting bargaining on specific bilateral agreements. The former remain on paper and the latter are as a rule not fully executed. Trade-economic cooperation is being cut back. Last year the total volume of commodity turnover between Russia and other Commonwealth countries was almost 44 percent less than in 1991, while this year the volume of mutual deliveries of the major commodities will decline by another 30-40 percent. Of course, critical drops in production, lower effective demand, and nonpayments because of uncoordinated breakthroughs to world prices for the basic raw material and fuel-energy resources have an effect. The increasing imbalance of interests, mutual economic distancing, and the search for more profitable alternatives on world markets play no less a role. But as a result, integration processes are impeded, their effect is reduced, and the new values of a unified economic space cannot be fully manifested. Toward a Market System of Coordinates Today the logic of the integration movements in the Commonwealth dictates a different unifying formula--a common market space. Here there is no longer the need for structural correlation of the production-technological chains, strict cooperation relationships, or national-state economic complexes. Even if the system of specialization and coordination of production is preserved, the interdependence of technologies, supply lines, standards, and markets gives economic relations among the elements of this system a different market mobility and adaptability. The integration paradigms adopted by all the Commonwealth countries are more easily and intelligibly organized; those paradigms are equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation without violating the status quo in the political sphere and nonintervention in national-state development and without flagrant impact on national economic interests. The change to a system of coordinates of a common market space is facilitated by a factor which is fundamentally new to the former socialist republics and perhaps in world practice--the emergence of insolvent demand and artificial overproduction... in conditions of a commodity shortage. The collapse of the unified currency space, the introduction of national currencies which are not interrelated, and the one-sided monetaristic policy destroyed the old mechanisms of mutual settlement of accounts and sharply constricted the already weak effective demand of enterprises and the population. Commodity producers and commodity consumers proved to be equally insolvent and bankrupt. The resource shortage overlapped with the money shortage. The avalanche of nonpayments also paralyzed what was left of the unified economic complex and destroyed the unified economic space for good. The spontaneous jumps to world prices for raw materials and fuel and energy resources played a special role. The inconceivable burst of cost inflation put the producers of final output in a most foolish position: prices for their items was on the world level while quality was on the local level. Naturally, the consumer turned to markets of third countries where there is at least some selection and where they can buy things that are a little better and a little less expensive. Pragmatism: A Cautious Gamble One certainly cannot say that these processes are not followed, noted, or comprehended in the management structures of the Commonwealth countries. On the contrary, they are perceived very acutely and conclusions which are at times decisive, rigid, and unequivocal are drawn. The first and most apparent is that the search for market forms of cooperation which are fundamentally new to everyone is being stepped up. Above all for those which reduce or compensate for inflationary growth in production costs and help restore production and set up clarified payment-account settlement channels and more realistic mechanisms of mutual coordination. Actions in these directions are marked by their apparent restraint from abrupt, "shock" movements and cavalier ways, by their practicality, and by coordinated transition from the simple to the complex which carries real integration meaning. On this level, the Moscow Meeting of Leaders of the Commonwealth States can be classified among the most productive. And the point is not only the 20 agreements and protocols on economic topics signed. The very fact of the translation of general talks into the pragmatic language of legal formulas which particular economic actions should now be subjected to is important. How realistic is this? In terms of the schedule of realization, the closest is the start of work by the Interstate Bank for Economic Cooperation. Four months have passed since the day the agreement was concluded, but there have been no energetic actions--the bank cannot act until the founders make their contributions to the capital stock. And its main task is to organize interstate settlement of accounts within the CIS and be the center of the Payments Union and its specialized banking institution. The causes of this situation are by no means the traditional disorganization or miserliness. They are deeper--the vagueness of mechanisms of currency-monetary settlement of accounts and mutual convertibility of the national currencies. For now there are more questions than answers. Only general provisions are fixed in the concept of the Payments Union: - the right of participants in trade transactions to independently choose the forms of accounts settlements, the currency of the contract price, and the currency of the payment; - mutual recognition of national currencies and the unrestricted right to use them as a means of payment; - the possibility of introducing a collective use currency for interstate settlement of accounts; - the sovereignty of the participating states in defining the system of convertibility of national currencies into foreign currencies for transactions involving the movement of goods and services; - setting of exchange rates of national currencies on the basis of supply and demand on the currency exchanges or according to the interbank currency market and the obligation to be restricted to a single currency rate for all types of foreign economic operations. It seems that the Commonwealth has a chance to successfully survive the consequences of the collapse of the unified currency-monetary system of the USSR, the failure of the "new type of ruble zone" to materialize, and the introduction of weak and essentially surrogate national currencies. Even a general conceptual approach to bringing order here, if not the "light at the end of the tunnel," is at least a flicker in the present currency absurdities of normalization of trade relations in which the old donor-distributor customs and the new economic interests tinged with national colors have become intricately intertwined. There is almost nothing to compare it with: the trade "divorce" was not realized and life together continues, although now in different apartments. Russia's new foreign economic partners require more of Russia than they are prepared and able to share themselves. For example, everyone amicably desires that customs duties and restrictions on exporting Russian goods be abolished right now; however, they do not want to make counter movements but augment the barriers against their exports to Russia and in every way possible facilitate those exports' way to third countries. And that includes by unsanctioned reexport of Russian goods. The mechanism of interests is a simple one: take a few more goods in Russia, for the most part energy media, at domestic prices which are still lower than world prices, and deliver slightly fewer of their own goods and at the level of world prices or even higher. Incidentally, that is how it was in CEMA. But all we had to do, at Czechoslovakia's initiative, was change over to world prices and settlement of accounts in freely convertible currency and the production-economic ties which had developed over the decades and with them all trade crashed down in one hour. Something like that is happening among the Commonwealth participants too. Last year under Goskontrakt [State Contract] alone, Russian exports exceeded imports by more than 400 million dollars. According to the contracts, the opposite balance was expected--imports should have exceeded exports by 500 million dollars. In a normal economy, a positive trade balance is an achievement. But for us it is nothing but losses: deliveries of batches at near world prices were paid for largely through Russian state credits. The debts on them by the start of 1994 exceeded 3 trillion rubles [R], although a year before they were just R1.3 billion. If in addition Russia unilaterally abolished export duties, there would be roughly 4 billion dollars less in the federal budget. Without parity in trade-customs policy, there is no free trade and there cannot be. Converting to it means in a coordinated way and in stages bringing customs regimes closer, narrowing nontariff restrictions, and ensuring strict discipline in executing contracts. But for now, without reciprocity Russia has again magnanimously and recklessly moved along the path of improper liberalization of foreign trade. The number of goods under quota this year declined from 108 to 38 items. The overall quota of deliveries to the Commonwealth states is dropping substantially. Export duties on goods whose domestic prices have approached world prices are to be lowered. And enterprises and regions and private trade and intermediary firms receive priority in foreign trade. There is unlikely to be an equivalent response from partners to these measures. This year Russia will receive fewer ferrous and nonferrous metals, steel pipe, cotton fiber, synthetic threads, and food, while its partners in the CIS Economic Union will receive fewer energy media and chemical and petroleum-chemical output. It seems that the sphere of mutual trade is narrowing like pebbled leather. Everyone sees the fundamental solutions to trade-economic problems, both old and newly acquired ones, in creating civilized conditions for free trade realistic for a market and based on the Customs Union. Of course, the way to this is long and difficult--through a free trade zone, by-stage agreements, and complete development of customs rules and tariff and nontariff restrictions. The participants in the Economic Union decided to join this path on 15 April 1994. Of course, a free trade zone is not yet integration, but all the same it is a half-open door to the passage to a common market space regulated not by the will of the strong but on an equal basis with due regard for mutual interests. Center-phobia: Remembrance of the Past, Fear for the Future Overall the problem of regulating integration processes and managing them still sounds incomprehensible, if not to say foolish. And the reasons for this are the persistent allergy to the supranational organs of the Economic Union. A plan for an Interstate Economic Committee with very broad functions was prepared for the Moscow Meeting at Kazakhstan's initiative. Essentially this meant the formation of a supranational administrative core with the authority to make decisions mandatory for fulfillment. But centrifugal force, remembrance of the past, and fears for the future won out, and it was confined to a commission of professional experts under the CIS Coordinating-Consultative Committee. A decisive integration step was postponed for later. Nonetheless, the creation of an Economic Union commission must be classified as yet another achievement of the sincere advocates of economic integration. Regardless of where, fairly powerful intellectual potential can be concentrated in one place. The important thing is that not occasionally but on a regular basis there is the possibility--on a sensible and balanced basis--to formulate recommendations on production specialization and cooperation, coordinated measures in the most important interstate spheres (transport, communications, energy supply, ecology, and elimination of the consequences of emergency situations), and joint scientific-technical research. Perhaps the most promising function of the commission is to formulate proposals on coordinating interstate organs of sectorial cooperation and economic structures of the future common market--transnational corporations, financial-industrial groups, banking consortiums, and joint ventures. If the new commission does not fall into routine work on preparing draft agreements of every type but holds out as the "brain center," the general problems of economic integration will be untangled and its mechanisms worked up, and they will be interlinked more rapidly and systematically. Only then can the Economic Union be given concrete meaning and be turned into reality. New Turns Toward Integration But for now internal moves are maturing in the Commonwealth; their sources are in the area of political ambitions and business calculations, distrust of the need for and possibility of reintegration of the CIS participants, and mutual dissatisfaction and suspicion. The undiplomatic injection of fear of Russia's "special role and responsibility" in post-Soviet space is feeding all this. One example of these moves that put one on guard is the emergence of a trend toward regional political-economic integration. Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus awakened the impulse. Last summer they declared a Slavic Union. There was in truth little of a union or common ground behind this announcement, as life showed. It was rather a political declaration, but it stimulated processes which were not fully envisioned when its participants formed the CIS and the Economic Union. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were the first to respond and announced the creation of a "unified economic space," but essentially began to put together a Central Asian free trade association along with Kirghizia, which joined them. The specifics of this step were for the time being confined to eliminating customs borders. But we must expect more radical actions along the lines of N. Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian Economic Union. In any case, these three Central Asian states, it seems, are politically prepared to move toward one another, possibly even to the point of forming a regional "common market" and even a confederation. On 12 April, after tough, mercenary disputes, Russia and Belarus finally announced the actual creation of a Russian-Belarusian "common market" with their monetary systems unified. But the entire procedure was planned as an action in stages, with an eye to its political consequences and economic results. It was difficult, but a model of post-Union economic integration close to reality in fact emerged. Even though it is inferior, politicized, and controversial with a hypertrophied role of Russian economic departments. And if it comes about, with the exception of aspects which create a "Moscow center" syndrome, it will be perfectly acceptable to the rest. Even to those for whom unification is not yet a synonym for unity. In any case, a political testing ground has appeared for breaking in the idea of a Eurasian Confederation, which practical politicians repeat with unceasing persistence.
