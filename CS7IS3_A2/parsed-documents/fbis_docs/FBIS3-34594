Their task is to encircle the Mosul [Ninawa] Governorate and set up checkpoints on important roads and inside the governorate's towns and villages. Our sources view this as an attempt to block all access roads into the governorate and prevent infiltration by opposition groups. In the past few months, the city of Mosul and the surrounding countryside were the scenes of many revolutionary operations and armed assaults against ruling party offices, security centers, and intelligence departments. The operations escalated such that they became almost daily occurrences. Our sources say that the checkpoints deployed by the criminal Qusayy search all citizens and vehicles entering the governorate and the city of Mosul in particular. Elsewhere, the criminal Khalid [no surname as heard], an officer in Saddam's security apparatus, was killed and two of his escorts were wounded when they were attacked by an Islamic Resistance hero on the road to Suq al-Shuyukh District in al-Nasiriyah [Dhi Qar] Governorate in the middle of January. Our sources in southern Iraq said a security detail that the officer was commanding tried to arrest the struggler, who belonged to the Al-Ghumays clan. The struggler pulled an 8.5-mm pistol and shot and killed the security officer. He then opened fire on the remaining members of the detail, killing [as heard] two and wounding another before being martyred himself when he ran out of ammunition. The Islamic Resistance forces evacuated the body of the heroic martyr to their positions to the rear.
