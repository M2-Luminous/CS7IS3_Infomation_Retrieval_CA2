The government has instructed that all state budgets this year should be cut by 4 percent to recover election costs, BEELD discovered yesterday. The total election costs that have to be recovered, including the expenses of the Independent Electoral Commission and DEBI [Democratic Electoral Broadcasting Initiative], amount to about 2 billion rands. As part of the state cutbacks, which affect all the regions and state departments in the country, state subsidies to all universities and technikons have been trimmed for the current financial year. State and provincial budgets for among others education, health services and roads have also been trimmed down. Government orders for these cutbacks come in the wake of announcements by the government that a thousand additional posts for civil servants are to be created as soon as possible. These cutbacks also occur at a time when cutbacks in the Cape health services are unavoidable and educational services countrywide are experiencing lean times. These cutbacks are unique and are the sacrifices which have to be made for South Africa's first democratic election, Western Cape MEC [Member of the Executive Council] for finance, Mr. Kobus Meiring, confirmed. By virtue of the fact that these cutbacks are unique, mainly capital expenditures and maintenance costs will have to be trimmed dramatically. The Western Cape provincial authority will, like other provincial and central authorities, do everything in its power not to trim any personnel posts due to the cutbacks, Mr. Meiring said. The country's total education budget has been cut back by about 200 million rands, Western Cape MEC for education Martha Olckers said in response to a question. Most of the money is being deducted from mainly white education. However, 41 million rands also has to be taken from schools in colored residential areas. Although everything possible is being done countrywide to cut the budget for black education as little as possible, the cutback will affect the building of about 156 new schools in black townships. The building of these new schools has been postponed from last year to this year due to a budgetary shortfall. There are indications that renovation and extension work to schools and classrooms of most schools will have to be put on hold.
