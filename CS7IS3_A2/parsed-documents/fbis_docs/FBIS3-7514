In a prepared statement at a press conference held at the Foreign Correspondents Club here in Bangkok, North Korean Ambassador to Thailand Yi To-son said the only method of peaceful settlement of the nuclear question is for North Korea and the United States to adopt a "package deal." On the possibility of North Korea's acceptance of re-inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yi said, "this, too, depends on the outcome of our negotiations with the United States because the nuclear question lies not in technical matters but in political ones." The North Korean envoy stressed that North Korea will under no circumstance be the first to unleash an armed provocation over the nuclear question. He said if South Korea and the United States invade North Korea, "our country would be destroyed." Asked what would become of the North Korean economy if the UN Security Council adopts a sanction against North Korea, Yi said that even if a sanction were applied, North Korea would fully stand it because "we have run our economy on our own with our technology, resources, work forces and facilities over a long period of time." He added that his understanding is that Japan and the United States have already begun to apply economic sanctions against North Korea. Yi also charged the United States with taking the lead in efforts to invoke a sanction against North Korea through the U.N. Security Council by pushing ahead with the deployment of Patriot missiles in Korea and staging of the Team Spirit military exercise as planned. "All pressures against us would only delay the settlement of the nuclear issues and make the problem more complicated, leading North Korea to withdraw competely from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," he said. Regarding the issue of exchanging special envoys between South and North Korea, Yi asserted that "South Korea distorted the significance of the proposed exchange of special envoys by making it appear as if the exchange is designed merely to discuss the nuclear issue." "South Korea has thus applied a brake to the dialogue between North Korea and the United States," he said.
