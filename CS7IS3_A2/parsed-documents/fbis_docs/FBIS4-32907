This occurred between last night and early today at that northeastern Antioquia mining site. Department and Segovia authorities, who fear that the official has been kidnapped, have reported that he was last seen early Saturday night. Today his apartment was found empty. The authorities added that around that same time, members of the outlawed National Army of Liberation raided the police post in the Fraguas community where they stole documents assigned to the two voting tables. Given these events, the department's Registry Office appointed two of its officials in Medellin, who were immediately transferred by a National Police helicopter. The two registrars, one of them [name indistinct], were granted special powers, while being supplied with additional documentation to replace what was stolen in Fraguas. Department Registrar Hector Arango Morales told Caracol that, despite the difficulties, the elections will be closed at 1600. To speed up the process the designated officials were given instructions to increase the 27 tables originally provided for in the urban areas and, if necessary, those of the rural areas. Ruben Dario Jaramillo, Antioquia's ombudsman, joined the protests against what had occurred in Segovia, while urging those who have knowledge of Mr. Vasquez [name as heard] Cerna's whereabouts to respect the official's life and release him.
