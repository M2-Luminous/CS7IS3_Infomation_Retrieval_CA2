The members were discussing a special committee report on President Husni Mubarak's statement to a joint People's Assembly and Consultative Council session on 12 November when the new parliamentary term began. Independent deputy Muhammad 'Abd-al-Shafi voiced opposition to the committee's report and to the restoration of the system of appointing village heads and mukhtars. He urged the government to permit the rotation of power. Dr. Muhammad Zaki Abu-'Amir, minister of state for People's Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs, commented on this by saying: No one could have imagined that a parliamentarian would speak of the rotation of power without also noting that this is done via the ballot box, not by a government decision. He explained that political party activity does not only mean congresses held in public squares. He added that certain public and security circumstances might bar holding such congresses, even in the case of the majority party [ruling Democratic National Party]. On the appointment of village heads and mukhtars, Dr. Abu-'Amir said the pertinent bill will be submitted to the People's Assembly which will then decide whether these officials will be elected or appointed. Regarding a comment by Consultative Council Deputy Speaker Tharwat Abazah about the rising price of printing material because of higher tariffs, Dr. Abu-'Amir said that this decision will be studied again in light of recommendations made by the People's Assembly's Industry and Culture Committees. Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi commented on the point raised by deputy 'Abd-al-Shafi, saying: You describe our democracy as marginal. Now President Mubarak never said we have reached the apex of democracy. He said we are seeking to entrench democracy. Dr. Hilmi urged the members to be fair and just, pointing out that during President Mubarak's term opposition newspapers could say no to his reelection without feeling insecure. The president accepted this broadmindedly and has met with those who said yes and those who said no.
