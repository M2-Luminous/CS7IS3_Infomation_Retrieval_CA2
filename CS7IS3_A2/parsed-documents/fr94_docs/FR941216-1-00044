FR941216-1-00044 FR941216-1-00010 Example 3. Contingent payment substantially similar to a combination of rights_ (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 of this paragraph (b)(4)(vi), except that the debt instrument also provides for a cap and a floor on the contingent payment at maturity, so that the payment may not exceed $1,300,000 and may not be less than $700,000. (ii) Projected payment schedule. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of ten annual payments of $60,000 and a projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a right to a payment of $1,000,000 combined with a forward contract for the purchase of 1,000 units of the commodity for $350,000 on December 31, 2005, and two options on 1,000 units of the commodity that are exercisable only on December 31, 2005: one a long put option with an exercise price of $50,000, and the other a short call option with an exercise price of $650,000. The projected amount of the contingent payment is determined by combining the forward prices of these property rights. Example 4. Nonquotable contingent payments _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, Y issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 1999. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000,000, payable at maturity, and provides for payments on December 31 of each year of $20,000 plus 5 percent of Y's gross receipts, if any, for the year. Assume that a reasonable rate for the debt instrument (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) is 7.5 percent, compounded annually. (ii) Projected yield. The debt instrument provides for nonquotable contingent payments. Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the projected yield is 7.5 percent, compounded annually. (iii) Projected payment schedule. Assume that Y anticipates that it will have no gross receipts in 1996, but that it will have gross receipts in later years, and those gross receipts will grow each year for the next three years. Based on its business projections, Y believes that it is not unreasonable to expect that its gross receipts in 1998 and each year thereafter will grow by between 6 percent and 13 percent over the prior year. Thus, Y must take these expectations into account in establishing a projected payment schedule for the debt instrument that results in a yield of 7.5 percent, compounded annually. Accordingly, Y could reasonably set the following projected payment schedule for the debt instrument: ␣ 1Date 1Noncontingent payment 1Contingent payment 12/31/1996 $20,000 $0 12/31/1997 20,000 70,000 12/31/1998 20,000 75,600 12/31/1999 1,020,000 83,850 Example 5. Debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest and a single quotable contingent payment at maturity_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument also provides for semiannual payments of interest and a payment at maturity equal to $5,000 times the increase, if any, in the value of a nationally known composite index of stocks from January 1, 1996, to the maturity date. The rate of interest on the debt instrument is the value of 6-month LIBOR on the payment date. On the issue date, the value of 6-month LIBOR is 4 percent, compounded semiannually. Assume that the payment at maturity based on the index is a quotable contingent payment. (ii) Projected payment schedule. Because the debt instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under §1.1275&hyph;5 except that it provides for a single quotable contingent payment at maturity, paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section applies to the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the projected payment schedule is determined by first constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the debt instrument. Under §1.1275&hyph;5(e), the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that provides for semiannual payments of interest at 4 percent, compounded semiannually. Next, the projected amount of the contingent payment is determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The right to the contingent payment based on the stock index is substantially similar to a long call option on the index that is exercisable only on December 31, 2000. Thus, the projected amount of the contingent payment is the forward price of the option, assuming quotes for the forward price of the option are readily available. Finally, the projected payment schedule is determined, consisting of 10 semiannual payments of interest at 4 percent and a payment at maturity equal to $1,000,000 plus the forward price of the option on the index.
