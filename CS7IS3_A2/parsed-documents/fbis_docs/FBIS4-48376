One hundred and fifty UN monitors will be sent to Rwanda immediately and 500 Ghanaian troops, who had been withdrawn from Rwanda, will be sent back. No country so far has confirmed readiness for contribution to the troops to be sent to Rwanda. [passage omitted] Concerning the resolution of sending 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has given a statement saying that it would not be bound by the resolution, if the government in Rwanda participated in passing the resolution. The RPF has also called for the withdrawal of the UN special representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, before the RPF can approve the deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda. Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has been closely associated with the dictatorship in Rwanda, to the extent that he has helped to install the current illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF has accepted the principle of deploying a UN force to Rwanda with a humanitarian mission, with a reasonable number of troops, about 2,500 troops.
