FR940314-2-00010 FR940314-2-00004 Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and Allotments The TFP is a plan for the consumption of foods of different types (food groups) that households might use to provide nutritious meals and snacks for household members. The plan suggests amounts of food for men, women, and children of different ages, and it meets dietary standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the costs of the food groups. The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. Nationally, food stamp allotment levels are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2012(o)(11)), provides for an adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11. In June 1993, the cost of the TFP was $364.90 in the 48 States and D.C. To obtain the maximum food stamp benefit for each household size, June 1993 TFP costs for the four-person household (of $364.90) were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the appropriate household size and economy of scale factor, and the final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar. The maximum benefit, or allotment, is paid to households which have no net income. For households which have some income, the individual household's allotment is determined by reducing the maximum allotment for the household's size by 30 percent of the individual household's net income. The following tables show the new allotments for the 48 States and DC.

Minimum Benefit. Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Food Stamp Act, the $10 minimum monthly benefit provided to all one- and two-person households must be adjusted on each October 1 to reflect the percentage change in the TFP for the 12-month period ending the preceding June, with the result rounded to the nearest $5. In order to implement this provision of the law, the minimum benefit is adjusted each year as follows: (1) The percentage change in the TFP from June of the previous year to June of the current year (prior to rounding) is calculated; (2) this percentage change is multiplied by the previous ``unrounded'' minimum benefit to obtain a new unrounded benefit amount; and (3) the new unrounded minimum benefit is then rounded to the nearest $5 in accordance with the statutory provisions.
