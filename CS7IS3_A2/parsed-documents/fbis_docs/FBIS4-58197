['Abd-al-Shafi] Quite certainly not. The people here are tired, frustrated, and disappointed. In addition, because of the latest cordoning off of the occupied territories, they are ruined economically. We are looking into the future with anxious expectation. [DER SPIEGEL] Where does this pessimism come from? After all, the Palestinians now have the opportunity to shape their lives themselves. ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is no reason for euphoria. Since the conclusion of the Oslo agreement, the PLO, Israel, and also the United States, the main sponsor of the peace process, have succumbed to a collective self-deception. We must shake them awake: Open your eyes; this agreement will not make peace, because the most basic Palestinian demands remain unfulfilled -- putting an end to Israel's illegal claim to the occupied territories. [DER SPIEGEL] Instead of a lasting peace you see the agreement only as a short-lived cease-fire? ['Abd-al-Shafi] I am afraid we will see a repetition of the past: a bloody confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians. [DER SPIEGEL] Even though the leader of the Palestinians, Yasir 'Arafat, supports the agreement? ['Abd-al-Shafi] This makes it even worse. With his signature under the new agreement he only legitimizes the so-far illegal claim of the Israeli occupation power. [DER SPIEGEL] But 'Arafat is praising the autonomy agreement as the first step toward a new Palestine. ['Abd-al-Shafi] Pure delusion. Already with the skeleton agreement the PLO leadership tacitly accepted the more than 140 Jewish settlements in Gaza and in the West Bank within the occupied territories as independent legal and administrative units -- answerable only to the Israeli authorities. This is practically an annexation. There will be two kinds of law, just as during the colonial time -- and this means specifically: An Israeli who steals a car in Gaza is put on trial in Tel Aviv. [DER SPIEGEL] The agreement applies to only the five-year transition period for the time being, not to the final status of the occupied territories. ['Abd-al-Shafi] Nevertheless, the transition agreement is fateful, because, in the meantime, the Israelis continue building their settlements and establish new facts with that. Even the withdrawal of the Israeli Army is, in reality, only a transfer of the armed forces behind the fences of the settlements, where Israelis live like in territorial military villages. [DER SPIEGEL] Not even 5,000 Israelis among almost 1 million Palestinians: In particular in Gaza it is already foreseeable that the settlers will not stay forever. ['Abd-al-Shafi] It may be that they will withdraw from Gaza and that they want to use the settlements there only as a point of negotiations in the discussions about contentious issues -- such as the status of Jerusalem. [DER SPIEGEL] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has already announced that he also wants to tear down settlements in return for peace. ['Abd-al-Shafi] Perhaps he will close one settlement or the other, because the financial expenditures is out of proportion to the military and strategic benefit. However, this does not mean any basic readiness to abolish the Jewish enclaves. [DER SPIEGEL] However, time is working against the Palestinians. Can you afford at all to refuse the current offer of peace? ['Abd-al-Shafi] In view of the quarrels and infighting among us Palestinians, we will be the losers given if the Israelis present us with an independent state on a silver platter. [DER SPIEGEL] You think that internal reforms of the PLO are more urgent than the peace package? ['Abd-al-Shafi] Regardless of the question of whether we are for or against the agreement, we must finally put the Palestinian house in order. We want to build a better future here. [DER SPIEGEL] This is precisely what 'Arafat is saying. ['Abd-al-Shafi] But he is not doing anything for it. So far, at least, he has not committed himself to democratic rules. [DER SPIEGEL] And this is how he will rule in Gaza and Jericho? ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that in the personnel decisions 'Arafat will not sacrifice the necessary competence to the various cliques or his personal preference. We will not permit such nepotism, the people wil rebel against him. [DER SPIEGEL] Within months after the return of the PLO, the Palestinians are to vote on their leadership in free elections. Will you run against 'Arafat on your own ticket? ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is too early to say that, but I do not want to rule out that I will be a candidate -- either as an individual or on a ticket together with other independent politicians.
