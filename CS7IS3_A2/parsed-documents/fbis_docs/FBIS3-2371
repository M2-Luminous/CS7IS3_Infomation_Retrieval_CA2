He is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit China since the visit to Beijing by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker in November 1992, and also the most important of U.S. official to visit China in recent years. As reported by the U.S. media, Christopher's visit is aimed exclusively at China's most-favored nation [MFN] trading status. Two months from the 3 June deadline by which U.S. President Clinton is to make a decision on renewing China's MFN trading status, the U.S. side wants to make a final sprint and do its best to force China to make more concessions on the human rights issue. If China does make major concessions, the U.S. secretary of state may suggest to President Clinton before the end of May that China's MFN status be renewed. However, if China refuses to make major concessions, the Clinton administration probably will stop granting MFN trading status to China. China Has Done a Great Deal on the Human Rights Issue According to the U.S. Presidential Executive Order signed by Clinton last year when renewing China's MFN trading status, China must attain major and comprehensive headway in improving its human rights record in a number of fields, otherwise the United States will not be so easy on China this year. In its human rights report issued on 1 February, the U.S. State Department reaffirmed the fact that China has made some headway on the human rights issue, but the U.S. side still insists that the concessions China has made are insufficient, and it continues making constant threats to end China's MFN trading status. China and the United States have different cultural traditions and values, and the economic development levels of the two countries also are widely different. Therefore, it is only natural that China and the United States should have different understandings and perceptions of human rights standards. Even so, China has done a great deal on the human rights issue. For example, China used to consider the human rights issue an internal affair and refuse to discuss the issue with the United States, but now it is willing to discuss the human rights issue in detail with the United States, which only minds other countries' business without giving proper care to things at home. China also has held talks with the International Red Cross concerning visits to Chinese prisons, and it has released a number of "pro-democracy" activists before the completion of their terms of imprisonment. Knowing that the United States itself also exports prison products to foreign countries, China has reiterated its strict implementation of the Agreement on Banning Exports of Prison Products; moreover, it also has agreed to allow officials from the U.S. Embassy in China to conduct shock inspections of Chinese factories under suspicion. The Chinese Government's great efforts on the human rights issue last year are obvious to all. It would have been impossible for China to achieve all these breakthroughs before reform and opening up. However, one cannot build up his constitution on one mouthful. The higher the requirements and expectations the United States has unduly set on China's human rights issue with a view to forcing China to accept all its demands regardless of China's national conditions, the greater is the disappointment to which United States is doomed. The U.S. Presidential Executive Order is sacred and solemn on the territory of the United States, but forcing this Order on China is inappropriate. It is just as the diplomat of an Asian country has put it: As a large country, China has national dignity, as well as its own Constitution and laws. China will not allow itself to be led by the nose by the U.S. Presidential Executive Order. China Will Not Kowtow to the United States During Christopher's visit to China, both sides will reach a consensus on a number of international issues, and China may make some gestures on the human rights issue, perhaps promising that China will do more, in accordance with its Constitution and laws, to abide by the World Declaration of Human Rights; or continuing to release jailed dissidents for their satisfactory performance in prison; or reiterating its willingness to hold talks with the exiled Dalai Lama. However, China will not kowtow to the United States, neither will it promise not to arrest law-breaking dissidents who attempt to stir up turmoil inside the country. Moreover, China will not sacrifice its principles on holding talks with the Dalai Lama, unless the latter agrees to give up his stance on Tibetan independence. People tracking the development of Sino-U.S. relations all share the opinion that no matter how hard China tries on the human rights issue, dialogue and fights between China and the United States over the human rights issue are going to be protracted. This year's pressure will last until the end of the coming May. Will the United States really abolish China's MFN trading status this year? The Clinton administration will not do so if it is sober-minded and has foresight. The undue stubbornness of the United States on the issue of China's human rights will lead only to the effect that "haste makes waste," which is contrary to its original wish. In China, no one dies because of insufficient food and clothing, no one loses his leg or hand for his violations of the law, no one obsequiously begs for economic aid from the West, and no woman is deprived of her right to participate in political affairs. The human rights situation in many other countries is even worse than that in China, so why does the United States not go and condemn them? The reason the U.S. Government always adopts a tough attitude toward China on the human rights issue is that the government is faced with pressure imposed by a number of U.S. senators and human rights organizations. Although many senators have urged efforts to increase pressure on China on the human rights issue, and even have called for abolishing China's MFN status, not one of them really wants, deep in his heart, to stop granting the MFN trading status to China. Human rights are just a tool used by the United States to impose pressure on China. If China's MFN status is canceled this year owing to its poor human rights record, those U.S. senators will be unable to find any other excuse in the future for their criticism of China, and their public exposure will come to an end following the cancellation of China's MFN status. A China undergoing reform and opening up is beneficial, not only to the interests of the Chinese people, but also to the interests of the United States. If it really wants to improve Sino-U.S. relations, the United States must not cancel China's MFN trading status.
