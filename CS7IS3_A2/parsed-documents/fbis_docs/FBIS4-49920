The decision will be an important part of China's legal system to protect intellectual property, and be conducive to promoting the country's public awareness of the legal control of intellectual property. The lawmakers were speaking at the eight-day seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) which will end Thursday [12 May], where they have deliberated the draft decision on punishing criminals who violate copyrights. The NPC Standing Committee members have also aired their opinions on the draft decision in view of passing it at the earliest possible time. Yang Jingheng, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said today that the prevailing piracy of books and audio and video tapes in the country has generated an adverse influence upon China's cooperation with the outside world. "Promulgation of such a decision will be good for China's image in the international community," he said. Yang said the protection of copyrights of computer software has been more critical at a time when computers are widely used. He said the relevant items should be specific and easy to operate. Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said production lines are purchased from abroad to duplicate compact discs illegally. Many local governments even protect such activities. He proposed that the draft decision stipulate that local protectionists involved in copyright violations be punished. Member of the NPC Standing Committee Fu Tieshan, who is also a bishop, said the draft decision so far lacks items to deal with foreigners' infringement upon Chinese authors' rights and should include such provisions. Wang Liping, a noted music composer and member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that copyright violators have been seeking exorbitant profits and have destroyed the normal order of the cultural market and economic activities. The penalties for them in the decision should be harsh and fines should be heavy to curb such crimes, he said.
