With his participation in the Russian Embassy, representatives of Croatia and the self-declared Serb Krajina have agreed that as of 0900, 5 April they will stop killing each other. Vitaliy Ivanovich, the agreement between Serb Krajina and Croatia was signed when yiu were recently in Zagreb. We saw your happy face on our TV sets. But was this happiness not premature? The truce is not the peace as yet, you know. [Churkin] Well, I really was very happy because two rounds, which lasted for 30 hours -- and the last round of negotiations lasted for 17 hours, ending at 0300 on 30 March -- led to the signing of one of the most important agreements, I believe. This is the agreement on a cease-fire between Serbs and Croats. It is very important that this is not only a declaration that they do not want to fight each other, but this is also a complex military and technical document which includes, for example, 35 maps with a detailed picture along the whole length of the line of contact between Serbs and Croats. It could be around 1,000 kilometers. That is to say that the implementation of this agreement will ensure that even if the sides want to shoot each other they will not be able to do so. There is a serious control procedure over this agreement on the part of the UN troops. That is to say that we are really talking, at last, about a line being drawn under the war between Serbs and Croats which has lasted for over two years. There have been constant fighting and shelling, the peaceful population has been killed -- both Serbs and Croats -- and one of the most volatile areas of conflict threatened to erupt. And if this happened it would for sure bury any hopes of resolving the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. So, this is a very serious step. [Kozhukhov] But at the moment, the embers are still burning because, as far as I know, Serb Krajina will not agree to the status of even a large autonomy within Croatia. [Churkin] Yes, you are right. But in conditions when it is impossible to start a war we believe that we can move to the second stage -- to arrange economic relations between Serbs and Croats in this region. The sides will meet again in two weeks on our initiative and under our mediation to discuss the economic issues. Then we will move to the third stage, and there is wide understanding between the main members of the world community as far as this question is concern. This stage will be the most difficult, as you mentioned -- to determine the political status of the regions where Serbs are living now under the protection of the United Nations. [Kozhukhov] Diplomats would rather not make wild guesses. Nevertheless, what will happen to Bosnia? [Churkin] We expect to resume the negotiating process in Bosnia in the next few weeks. Strictly speaking, it has never died away completely. An exchange of opinions continues, in particular, between the Americans and us. It is we and the Americans who are going to play the leading role now in the settlement efforts. I think the sides will have to get in touch again and try to resolve, above all, the most difficult territorial issue, how to separate territorially the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina between the three peoples who form the state -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- and to finally define the position regarding the state structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whether it will be the union of Bosnia- Herzegovina, a federation, or something else. A lot has been done already in this respect. One thing is necessary though. It is necessary for the sides finally to decide that it is time to stop the war and switch to peace. Without such resoluteness of the sides, certainly, no efforts by international mediators can be successful. [Kozhukhov] You know, I was in Belgrade at the end of last year and it seemed to me that, as far as the situation as a whole on the territory of former Yugoslavia is concerned, there could be no good solutions. The sides hate each other so much and they are so unprepared for a compromise that the incredible -- Yugoslavia's return within its former borders -- might be the best solution. [Churkin] You were absolutely correct to mention this moral dilemma which the peoples of former Yugoslavia have to face. After the war which has taken place, especially on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, any solutions which might be evolving now will be morally detrimental. But unfortunately, the clocks cannot be turned back and one cannot return everything to a state of affairs as it was at the beginning of 1991. [Kozhukhov] Many people in Russia think that Russia does not in reality have interests in Serbia, and that this topic is only a card in a domestic political game. What do you think about that? [Churkin] I think that we do have interests in the Balkans, and we do have interests in former Yugoslavia -- political, economic and others; and just as important, is the fact that it is impossible to settle this conflict without us. We all became convinced of this fact in recent months when we were not participating so actively, and a settlement was constantly slipping out of reach. But again, you rightly perceive that sometimes this question does become the subject of a certain domestic political game, and passions are artificially whipped up over it. In addition, it seems to me that some of our Serbian partners who have sensed this are trying artificially to inflate the question of Russian-Serbian brotherhood in order to push us into positions which would contravene Russia's own interests, and which, in the final analysis, would mean unconditional support for Serbian extremism. We have never allowed this in our position in our diplomatic and political work, and we will never allow it. We will implement a balanced and objective policy. We will have contact with all three sides, and only in this way can we promote a Yugoslav settlement. [Kozhukhov] Do you think personally that the Ames affair was indeed revenge for the breakthrough in the Balkans? [Churkin] No, I do not think everything is that simple. This is my personal view: I do not deal directly with Russian-American relations. But I think there has of course been some dissatisfaction among the opposition in the United States with the energetic way in which the Clinton administration has acted in developing relations with Russia; with the fact that the United States has established such good relations with the Russian Federation; and with the fact that the development of relations with Russia occupies such a major place in the policy of the Clinton administration. Maybe Yugoslavia and Bosnia played a certain part here as well, but that is probably only one feature in the general picture of Russo-American relations.
