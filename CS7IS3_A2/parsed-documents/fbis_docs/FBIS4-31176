Thus, the forecast of many delegates -- that the basic party document would be adopted without any problems -- has been proven wrong. According to our correspondents at the congress, the delegates have only adopted only one-third of the charter's articles so far. However, according to circles in the BSP Supreme Council, the basic work is still to come because the disputed articles related to the BSP Supreme Council's rights and prerogatives, its relations with the parliamentary factions, and the elections of the DUMA chief editor have not yet been discussed. Our correspondents have predicted that because of the prolonged discussion on the charter, the 41st BSP Congress will begin the procedure to elect the new BSP leading organs and party leader late tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning. Different names of possible candidates for the post of party leader are mentioned in the corridors -- among them Zhan Videnov, Aleksandur Marinov, Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, and Georgi Pirinski.
