The announcement came in response to calls from environmentalists Greenpeace to ``lift the secrecy'' surrounding the number of French tests. Greenpeace had said it was astonished that official and parliamentary figures on the exact number had varied. But the CEA admitted that the figure of 161 it had published in a report had been a ``material error'' and that the correct figure was 192 as stated in April by CEA director general Philippe Rouvillois. It said late Thursday that the number of French tests up to a moratorium imposed in April 1992 ``was indeed 192.'' The United States this week reported that it had not revealed some 204 tests.
