One Thai who was released from the prison last week, Anonglak Khambunruang, 23, told reporters that Thais jailed there face cruelty and misery. They have lost contact with their families for a long time. "It's hell. Some people have been crippled in their hands and legs. The Laotian officers treat us as if we were animals. We are waiting for the help of the Thai Government." About one hundred Thais from Si Sa Ket, Bangkok, Ubon Ratchathani, and Chumphon are allegedly being held in Pak Se prison. The prison is a one-storey building with four rooms, each holding up to 60 Thai prisoners, he said, adding that many of them have been held for at least eight months without knowing when they will be released. The only way they will be discharged is if relatives file a guarantee and post bail with Laotian authorities. Some will never get out unless the Government helps them because they have lost contact with their families. Mr Anonglak accused the Laotians of chaining Thai prisoners by their feet to a rack two feet above the floor. They are also not allowed to talk. Those who violate rules are handcuffed by their hands and feet to a beam for three days he claimed. Mr Anonglak said they were fed twice a day with sticky rice, salt, seasoning powder and chili, which is left over from the meals of Laotian prisoners. Thai prisoners are held in contempt, he said. When one dies, their bodies are left in chains. Sometimes, Laotian officers put four bodies of Thai prisoners in a sack and trample on it, he claimed. He and four friends from Ban Woen Buk, Ubon Ratchathani Province, were arrested on January 2 while they were celebrating New Year's at the house of friends in Ban Don Ko, Tambon Sa Pai in Laos, which is opposite their village. He said he went to Laos at his friends' invitation. For the trip to the police station in Ban Sa Pai, he and his friends were shackled by their hands and feet and had weapons pointed at their heads, he said. After being transferred to Se Labam, they were starved for three days and forced to lie on the backs with their hands and feet chained to the bars of a cell. They were moved to Pak Se prison where more than 100 Thai prisoners were earlier detained, he said. Mr Anonglak was released from prison after his relatives posted bail with Laotian officials on January 21.
