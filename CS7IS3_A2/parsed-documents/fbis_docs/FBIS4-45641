According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities (observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin (the so-called priority list), it increased considerably between 1988 and 1992. Pollution by certain ingredients increased somewhat in 15 cities. Only in 18 cities has it practically not changed or declined slightly because of the drop in production. For instance, in Irkutsk, Krasnodar, and Saratov the average concentration of formaldehyde increased severalfold and exceeded the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] by a factor of six to seven. In Kemerovo the average concentration of carbon bisulfide reached six MAC (a sixfold increase); in Krasnodar the concentration of phenol in the air increased from two to three MAC. The nitrogen oxide, dust, and phenol concentration increased in Lipetsk (to 1.5-2.9 MAC); nitrogen dioxide and ammonia concentration in Saratov--to 2.0-2.9 MAC; and in Cherepovets the concentration of carbon bisulfide increased from 3.2 to five MAC in Bratsk and from 2.4 to 3.8 MAC. The degree of air pollution in the capital remains very high; the concentration of phenol did decrease, but at the same time there was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (mainly because of increased automotive traffic). The hygienic state of air basins over the cities on the priority list has changed to a different extent over the past five years. For instance, the concentration of ammonia, formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides increased in St. Petersburg; of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Barnaul; of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Orenburg; of phenol and nitrogen oxides--in Ryazan; and of phenol, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides--in Kazan. The air quality has not changed perceptibly in Perm, Kaliningrad, Groznyy. Samara, Ivanovo, and Vyatka. Water reservoirs. Observations of dry land surface water pollution are conducted at 1,341 reservoirs in 2,624 ranges. At 851 of these ranges (32 percent) the average annual concentration of at least one pollutant exceeds the MAC by a factor of 10 or more. This ratio has not changed perceptibly over the past few years. According to official data, in 1992 as compared to the preceding year in water reservoirs with a high degree of pollution the quality of water improved at 35 ranges, deteriorated at 99 ranges, and remained basically unchanged at 717 ranges. Overall, the level of pollution of water reservoirs on the territory of Russia remains high. There has been a serious deterioration in the water quality in the largest Siberian rivers--the Ob, Irtysh, Vakh, Taz, and their numerous tributaries, where the concentration of petroleum products increased from five-10 MAC in the early 1980's to 10-60 MAC in the early 1990's, and of phenols--from three-eight to 10-45 MAC, respectively. This is a result of the low efficiency of environmental protection measures of oil- and gas-producing enterprises and river transport. The level of pollution of Volga water reservoirs remains high--the content of many pollutants in them, including petroleum products, phenol, copper, and nitrogen nitrite measures five-15 MAC. The eutrophication process there continues to progress at a faster rate. There has been a substantial deterioration in the condition of rivers in Tula Oblast, where in the upper reaches of the Don, Shatskiy reservoir, and Ula river the concentration of phenol and nitrogen compounds increased from two-eight to 20-35 MAC--a result of operations of Novomoskovsk industrial complex chemical enterprises; the situation also deteriorated in Stavropol Kray rivers. Here, because of the unsatisfactory work of city purification systems the concentration of petroleum products increased from four-five to 20-50 MAC; of suspended particles--from 150 to 950 mg per liter, and of organic substances--from 50 to 100-300 mgO2 per liter. Over the past four years the Moscow river has unfailingly made it to the priority list of the most polluted water reservoirs in the country; the average annual content of phenol and nitrogen compounds in it measures 10-15 MAC, with a trend toward an increasing level of pollution. Monitoring data on dry land surface waters for 1992 showed practically no change in the trends of pollution levels at water reservoirs in Russia: the Kola Peninsula rivers, the Oka and Ob basins, and rivers in the Urals industrial region remain the most polluted water reservoirs. The results of the 1993 monitoring are currently being processed; the work will be finished in February.
