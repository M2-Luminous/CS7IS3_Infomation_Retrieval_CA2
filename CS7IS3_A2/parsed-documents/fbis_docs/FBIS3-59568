Optoelectronic Devices Can Become Smaller and Less Expensive/Resolution of 0.3 Nanometer"] [Text] Frankfurt--Holographic gratings are optical microstructures that can be used in numerous ways in optical measuring systems and in laser equipment. The Berlin Institute for Optics GmbH [Limited Liability Company] (Rudower Chaussee 5, 12484 Berlin) has developed new kinds of holographic gratings that can be used in spectrometers for environmental analysis and for optimization of the application of high-power lasers. As Dr. Christel Budzinski reports, optical microstructures like holographic gratings can be fabricated by processes that come from microelectronics. They include photolithography and dry etching. Holographic gratings can help to reduce the size of optoelectronic devices. The cost of these devices can also be lowered by the use of gratings. Spectrometers in the field of environmental analysis are an application possibility. Incident light is split up spectrally and analyzed in spectrometers. These instruments have to be especially lightweight and compact if they are used in satellites for remote sensing, for determination of the state of terrestrial vegetation, for example. A grating from Berlin specially developed for this purpose can help here. The spectrometer required operates in the spectral region of 650 to 800 nanometers. An image of a strip of the earth's surface (swath) is formed by means of a lens in the entrance slit and is then directed to the grating, where the spectrum is split into individual colors. The spectrum is then picked up by a photodetector array (CCD) and can be analyzed. Atmospheric gases and changes in them as well as the state of vegetation can be detected in this way by estimating the red shift of chlorophyll margins. The holographic grating is the chief component. It defines the precision of the measurements. The spectral resolution, that is, the precision with which individual wavelengths can be differentiated, is especially decisive. The resolution comes to 0.3 nanometer for the grating developed for the remote-sensing spectrometer. This also enables the spatial resolution of measured values in a modified spectrometer. Thus, the values for a swath can be associated with individual elements of the earth's surface, and this enhances the strength of the evidence of environmental analysis. Laser technology is an additional application possibility for holographic gratings. CO<inf> 2</inf> lasers above all have recently taken on importance in medicine and in the working of materials. This type of laser is very efficient and can be handled with precision. This precision is closely associated with the diameter of the laser spot. The smaller the diameter of the beam, the higher the energy density and the more finely detailed the work that can be done. Now holographic gratings can help to reduce the laser spot's size. However, conventional gratings fabricated by photolithography do not have especially high stress tolerance. The gratings are ruined even at lower laser outputs. That is why the scientists in Berlin have fabricated holographic gratings by means of a molding process and with copper as the substrate. These gratings have substantially higher stress tolerance and thus can contribute to higher precision when working with high-power lasers.
