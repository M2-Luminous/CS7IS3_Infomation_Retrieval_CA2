FBIS3-11191 "drlat053_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-053 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 Peru Police Report Large Drug Shipment Seized PY1703235194 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 p A13 PY1703235194 Lima EL COMERCIO Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Three Colombian and one Peruvian drug trafficking rings (involving the Cachique Rivera brothers) were using the landing strip in "El Diamante" native community in the town of Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios Department, when a large consignment of drugs was seized on 26 February. The three Colombian "firms" are headed by Colombians known as "Pablo" or "Pablito," "Caballo," and "Duro." The Peruvian organization is headed by the Cachique Rivera brothers. The shipment of 3,653 kg of washed cocaine paste, wrapped in 75 bags, was seized in the aforementioned location. The drug had been stockpiled in underground "caches" in the jungle near the 1,800-meter landing strip of "El Diamante," ready to be loaded into small planes bound for Colombia. The route currently used by the Colombian "narcopilots" includes Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Brazilian airspace and the city of Cruzeiro, near Ucayali, are used by Colombian mafia organizations to ship the drugs to Colombia. The "traffickers" take this route to elude the Yurimaguas radar and the possibility of being pursued by the Peruvian Air Force T-27 planes that patrol Peruvian airspace in Upper Huallaga. Intelligence sources have shown that traffickers have moved to areas like Apurimac Department and the jungle edges in Ayacucho, Pasco, Cusco, and Madre de Dios Departments because of the interdiction activities by the Peruvian forces of order. Traffickers take the drug, which is stockpiled in the production areas in Upper Huallaga, Aguaytia, Ucayali, Pozuzo, Pichis Palcazu, Oxapampa (Pasco Department) and Palmapampa (Ayacucho Department), to shipment areas where it is worth more. Air, land, and river transportation are used to reach the shipment "points." From the shipment areas -- one of which was "El Diamante," Boca del Manu, in Madre de Dios Department -- the drugs are taken to Colombia aboard small Colombian planes. The 13 traffickers detained on 26 February during a combined operation were interrogated yesterday by the Counternarcotic Division (Dinandro) of the Peruvian National Police.
