There were no representatives of the command at the meeting; it was organized and conducted by the leaders of the fleet's Council of Officers' Meetings. The officers discussed the situation connected with the events in Odessa. The meeting passed a resolution expressing no-confidence in the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and in Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy. The meeting again called the attention of the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to the need to speed up the adoption of a decision on the Black Sea Fleet. The resolution called on the newly-elected Crimean Supreme Soviet to examine whether it is expedient to have the many military formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the territory of the republic. The resolution also appealed to the deputies of the town soviets of Odessa, Sevastopol, Ochakov, Izmail, and Nikolayev to discuss the Odessa events and give their assessment of them. The officers' meeting was very stormy and showed that the officers by no means believe that they should refrain from interfering in political processes.
