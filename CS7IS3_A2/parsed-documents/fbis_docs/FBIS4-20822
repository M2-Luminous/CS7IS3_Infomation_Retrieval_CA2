During the discussion they intend to work out Russia's political course in the quest for economically advantageous and ecologically acceptable ways of disarmament, Professor Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry, who took part in the discussion, told ITAR-TASS. According to Dr. Kholstov, "the chemical disarmament process has a ten-year history. Russia is honestly living up to its commitments." He believes, however, that now there is rivalry between supporters of two entirely different ways of the implementation of the disarmament programme. Some experts believe that toxic agents should be destroyed according to Western technologies, while others insist on the use of domestic technologies, which, by the way, bring in substantial profits and ensure ecological safety. According to specialists, major countries of the world have become a scene of competition in the sphere of the production and sale of super-pure chemical substances, specifically arsenic, which is the only chemical element that could be used in heleo- installations, capable of replacing all other energy sources in the 21st century. American scientists are also working hard in this promising field. Fearful of competition, Western business people are trying to bar Russian arsenic, obtained in the process of the destruction of the toxic agent of lewisite, from the world market. According to Russian scientists, chemicals produced in Russia, which have a high level of purity, can oust products of competitors on the world market.
