Thus, the domain of domestic policy is being subjected to international scrutiny because of which conflicts may arise between our socio-economic and political objectives and international commitments. A conflict may also arise in exercise of jurisdiction by our judicial bodies and panels and authorities being set up under the Dunkel text where domestic policy issues are involved. The provisions of the Dunkel text regarding subsidies are an important area of possible conflict. While developing countries with per capita income of less than $1,000 are not required to phase out export subsidies, there is no relaxation in their favour as regards nullification or serious prejudice. In any event, in considering the legal aspect, we should consider also the situation when the threshold income has been reached. Now, while both in the case of manufactures and agricultural products subsidies for disadvantaged regions are allowed, they have to be given to all enterprises located there. No exemption is allowed for assistance given to a section of the people. Article 46 of the Indian Constitution enjoins upon the State the duty of promoting the economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, particularly of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. In our programmes of economic assistance, there is a special dispensation in favour of backward classes, scheduled castes and tribes with respect to interest rates, margins, grant elements, etc. We also know that in certain industries mostly persons of these categories participate. In fact, some castes are known by their profession or industry affiliation such as julaha (weaver). It will be possible for another country to argue that goods exported by such industries (handlooms, carpets) or from such enterprises (National Textile Corporation) carry more than 5 per cent subsidy, causing `serious prejudice' to its interests and are actionable. Thus, there could be a conflict between the objectives of Article 46 and these provisions of the Dunkel text. In the same vein, supply of agricultural inputs such as fertiliser, at subsidised prices to farmers other than poorer ones defined in income terms, will attract the provisions of the Dunkel text regarding commitment for reduction of domestic support. While regional development programmes are permissible under the text, insistence upon inclusion of criteria mentioned in Section 1, Article 8(b)(iii) would exclude some of the regions, possibly North-East, which are covered by special programmes such as freight subsidy. Similarly, our public distribution system and distribution of essential goods at subsidised prices is partly designed to reduce inequalities in income and various facilities (c.f. Article 38 of the Constitution). But these are frowned upon by the Dunkel text. The second area for focusing attention is Article 48 of the Constitution. "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the breeds...of cows and calves and other cattle." There may be hindrance in the achievement of this objective by the State due to proposed provisions regarding patents. (Article 27 of Annex III to Final Act on IPRS). Since no exception is being made for pesticides and agricultural inputs and, even for plant varieties and animals, a regime of patents of sui generis system is to be established, there can be problems in making available the genetic material and propagation of improved breeds for general distribution to farmers. Prices of agricultural inputs are very likely to rise due to the introduction of product patents in these areas (the argument is only about its extent) and their use of consumption which is strongly correlated to prices, will be adversely affected and in turn this will affect agricultural production unless farmers are compensated by corresponding adjustment in output prices. Difficulty may also arise in multiplying and supplying new breeds of plants and animals which would negate Article 48. The Multilateral Trade Organisation (Annex IV to Final Act) will be something of a supranational body. It would adjudicate, enforce and punish. Since the text brings within the ambit of various agreements domestic policies also, there is potential for conflict of jurisdiction. Our courts testing the actions under our laws and Constitution may hold them valid (e.g., in the case of foreign providers of services) while MTO may consider them actionable and authorise retaliation. It should be noted that so far "national treatment" concept was applicable to goods only (Article 3, GATT). The concept is now being extended to entities and persons of another country in one's territory. Thus the Agreement on Trade in Services (Annex II to Final Act--Articles VI, XVII, etc.) extends to aliens, a right available to citizens, since many services can be provided only by establishment in the territory of host country. Restriction on extent of equity holding, aggregate foreign investment, limitation on number of natural persons of country providing services, etc., may not be possible in scheduled sectors (Art. XVI ibid). The jobs for citizens and national control would thus be affected. It will not be permissible to restrict transmission of data to the country of providers of service and their being processed there. Measures which restrict or require specific types of legal entity through which a service provider may provide a service, shall not be maintained. What happens to areas restricted to cooperative sector or small-scale sector under our Industrial Policy Resolutions? Lastly, many of the policies covered by various agreements are within the jurisdiction of states or are concurrent subjects. No doubt Article 253 of the Constitution allows Parliament to legislate in such areas also to give effect to an international treaty. However, since many basic policies of state governments are involved they must be consulted before any commitment is made with respect to such areas. A ratification by Parliament of the emerging agreement and consultation with states should be necessary, contrary to past practice, as no such wide-ranging international agreement affecting national and sub-national policies and of concern to many sections of the people has been concluded before. After all, it will be possible to give effect to many of the provisions of the Dunkel text through legislation only.
