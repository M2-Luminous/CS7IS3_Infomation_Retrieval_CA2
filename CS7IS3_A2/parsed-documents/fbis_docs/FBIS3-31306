It is fully in the spirit of the documents signed so far on friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece; it is fully in the spirit of the military agreement signed by the Bulgarian and Greek defense ministers in 1993, which is a very important document embodying additional confidence- and security-building measures further to the 1992 Vienna document, and fully in the spirit of the Partnership for Peace Initiative.
