Purchasers are mainly Albanians from outside, offering enormously high prices in hard currency. The tax department in Tetovo has received 1,700 applications for house, business locals and real estates sales, only in the period from last January until this month. The sales are especially frequent in the city centre. The basic reasons for this is the present chaotic and lawless situation, expelling the official Macedonian language from use and the uncontrolled processes of Albanisation of Tetovo and surrounding villages.
