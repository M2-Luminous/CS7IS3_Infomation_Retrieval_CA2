FR940819-2-00141 FR940819-2-00083 Schedule of FY 1994 Certification Reviews The following schedule is subject to revision. Changes will be announced in the Federal Register . Parties interested in providing comments on the metropolitan transportation planning processes in the identified areas should submit them directly to the Docket 94&hyph;19 identified above, clearly identifying the metropolitan area that the comments address. Except where the certification review was completed prior to this Federal Register Notice, comments on metropolitan planning processes under review must be received within 30 days of the scheduled review in order to be considered during the certification review process. Where the review was completed prior to publication of this notice, interested parties wishing to make comments on a particular certification, must contact Sheldon Edner within two weeks of the date of this notice to assure that their comments will be considered. Where dates for a planned certification review have not been established, please contact Sheldon Edner for the dates. The site visits are intended to provide an opportunity for the FHWA and FTA review team to solicit information from the MPO, State DOT and transit agency regarding the implementation of the planning process. In addition, the team will be experimenting with alternative mechanisms for soliciting public and local official input. The relevant MPO is being asked to provide public notice, through its regular public notice processes, of the review and the opportunity to provide public input to the review team. Public officials should contact the MPO to identify processes set up to solicit local government input. The results of the certification reviews will be made public through the regular MPO public information process at a time to be set by the MPO policy board. ‚ê£ 1Region 1Pilot reviews 1Second review 1/2 Albany, NY: August 9&hyph;12, 1994.
