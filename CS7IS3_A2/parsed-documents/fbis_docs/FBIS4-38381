The program was to be aired from at 3:55 to 4:25 PM, but shortly before the airing, Ostankino said the program was cancelled because of "an unexpected condition." Ostankino gave no further explanation, only adding that it will later announce the airing time of the program, but informed sources here said the program is likely not to be aired. At the first part of the program aired on May 21, Gen. Dmitriy Volkogonov, a Russian authority on the Korean war and former military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, clearly showed that the Korean war broke out by North Korea's invasion of the South. Sources in the Russian press said that North Korea seemed to have appealed strongly to the Russian Government, legislature and Ostankino on airing of the program and called on them to stop airing the second part of the documentary.
