In a meeting with Hosokawa, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi urged the premier to revoke his reshuffle plan, the officials said. Hosokawa told the two that he may consider a reshuffle after the Diet passes both the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and an amendment to a political reform package, they said. The Diet passed the extra budget Wednesday, while the amendment is expected to be approved in early March. From the coalition's seven parties, the SDP, DSP and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the reshaping plan while Shinseito (Japan renewal party) and Komeito [Clean Government Party] support it. Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's future politics. Hosokawa has reportedly considered seeking a two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito, but Takemura has voiced objections. Takemura also attended the meeting and suggested he has not changed his position opposing his removal, the sources said. He has reportedly rejected Hosokawa's request to go to another ministerial post. Murayama told Hosokawa that an immediate reshuffle will give "an impression of a power struggle" within the coalition. Ouchi asked the premier not to cause a crack in the coalition by a shakeup, they said. Hosokawa was quoted as saying he does not have a concrete idea on a reshuffle and will decide on the matter after hearing opinions of ruling party leaders. On Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters he asked his top aides to look into the possibility of uniting seven ruling parties against the Liberal Democratic Party in the next general election for the House of Representatives. The prime minister told leaders of the SDP, DSP and Sakigake that the idea of alliance has nothing to do with the merger of ruling parties nor with a two-party system.
