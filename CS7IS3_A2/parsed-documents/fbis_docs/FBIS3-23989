It turns out to be 89 years. At the end of last week, toward evening, journalists of PRAVDA urgently called together their colleagues for a desperate press conference, whose subject was the general meeting of the collective that had just taken place, where, in the absence of a quorum, the newspaper's editor in chief, Viktor Linnik, had been deposed. A schism in the collective was announced. As has been the case in all such instances, this division has a hidden economic aspect. In the words of the Pravdites, the knot was tied up by the former editor in chief, Gennadiy Seleznev, who, for next to no money and without consultation with the collective, sold the controlling share of stock (55 percent) to the Greek entrepreneur Gianis Giannikos. The authorized capital of the joint-stock company is laughable--1 million rubles [R]. And thus, on the cheap, for R550,000, the Greek obtained the greater half of PRAVDA and the right to the deciding vote in all questions. The rest belongs to the editorial staff, but its vote does not carry any force. Having given away the "right of primogeniture" to Giannikos, the Pravdites expected assistance in publishing the newspaper. High salaries, vacations on Greek islands, and so forth, were promised. However, nothing fell from the "Greek apple tree" onto the heads of the journalists but a rotten apple core. From the entire editorial staff, only one person traveled to the Greek islands, today's Duma boyar Gennadiy Seleznev. At the press conference, the Pravdites said that, being communists, they had crossed out the Communist Party at the December elections because third on its list was their former boss Gennadiy Seleznev. Although it was still the Greeks who vexed them more. They (the management of the joint-stock company Pravda International includes two very close relatives of the boss) did not pay for medical care or child care, and withheld payment on the pathetically small compensations for children; since October they have not paid publication fees, and, worst of all, have halted financing of publication and distribution of the newspaper. For three weeks before the beginning of elections to the Duma, PRAVDA stopped coming out. The financing of correspondents' offices and payment for the printing of the newspaper in the localities has been halted. Because of the economy, a multitude of telephone, teletype, and fax lines has been shut down. At the same time, the Greek side has engaged in assault and battery, has interfered in the publication of the newspaper (a journalist who wrote something negative about a personal acquaintance of the owner was promptly fired), and posted an order reprimanding the editor in chief, who is neither subordinate nor accountable to the Greeks in any case, since he is an elected official. PRAVDA had its own small cafeteria, which cost slightly less; the Greeks eliminated it. Putting the staff on a hunger ration, the bosses returned to its pristine form the "chief editor's dining room," which had been closed during democratic times, and now they themselves take their meals there. After the transformation of the editorial office into a joint-stock company, the remaining 45 percent of the shares that were left to the collective were not distributed among the workers, so each one individually could hardly be considered a proprietor. The only thing that still belongs to the journalist collective are the founder's rights, including the patented trademark. The Greeks, naturally, also encroached upon the final thing remaining to the Pravdites, who had been cheaply sold by Gennadiy Seleznev. Not everyone agreed to give up this final thing. The owners compiled a blacklist of 13 journalists upon whose firing they insist. Among them, for instance, are last year's Russian professional prize laureates Stanislav Pastukhov (he runs the Moscow publication of PRAVDA) and Yuriy Glukhov. Not a single point of the contract have they violated, but the businessmen do not like them. It is simpler to consider the objectionable ones as departments: the information department, the international department, the photography department.... The bosses also want to curtail the activity of the journalistic organization of the editorial office. As a separate issue, they want to drive out Viktor Linnik. In exchange, they promise to resume financing, raise salaries, pay the fees they owe, and, possibly, to send the subjugated to vacation on the shores of the Aegean Sea. In violation of the joint-stock company's charter, the fate of the collective was entrusted not to an assembly of journalists, but to a general assembly of workers. The workers, whose ranks include, besides journalists, drivers, proofreaders, translators, and secretaries from the Greeks' office, in an open vote threw out the editor in chief, whom they themselves had elected to that post three months before. Aleksandr Ilin was elected acting editor-in-chief; he had already been named to that post by Minister Shumeyko after the October events. Eighty-seven (of a staff of 216 persons) spoke against confidence in Linnik and against confirmation of his commission (when he was elected as chief editor, he received 40 votes). Ninety were for entrusting these duties to Aleksandr Ilin. These same workers, by a majority of votes, resolved to continue the cooperation with the Greek company. In the words of the new acting editor, the Greeks need the founder's rights for greater surety: They bear the expenses and must be insured against a situation where their ouster suddenly seemed desirable. No professional claims were made either of Viktor Linnik or of the persons figuring on the blacklist, but at the meeting, the Greeks snitched to the collective that they had paid the current editor in chief extra in foreign currency (about Gennadiy Seleznev they said nothing). Viktor Linnik, however, expecting such a turn of events, opened a safe and rendered an accounting to the last drachma: He had released the money for the publication of PRAVDA. At this newspaper, many people work literally for kopeks. PRAVDA journalists today have a salary of R25,000: That is how much satirist Valentin Prokhorov makes. And he would be happy to be getting even that much, but since January the Greeks have not paid salaries at all. One of PRAVDA's most highly paid journalists, Aleksandr Ilin, named the acting chief editor, receives R130,000. In the words of Stanislav Pastukhov, one of the senior employees at PRAVDA, it was not the best portion of the collective who supported the Greeks; it was basically people who had worked for a year or a year and a half, "those because of whom communists are referred to as Red-browns." At the press conference, Viktor Linnik announced that he was not planning to leave the post of editor-in-chief and that he did not acknowledge the decision of the illegal assembly. However, he is not now in a position to dismiss the "mutineers," because of the dual power that formed long ago at the newspaper, where the Greeks interfere in the operational management. It is also hard for him to imagine how he is going to manage to break off relations with the Greeks and with what money he will support the flickering life of PRAVDA. After all, even the R200 million received from subscribers is controlled by the Giannikos family. In January, 15 issues were published instead of 22. Money for publication, reported Viktor Linnik, was given by the entrepreneur Konstantin Zatulin and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. On the one hand, of course, the market is the market. However, the attempts of Pravdites to clarify the financial condition of the joint-stock company, of which a part of the authorized capital still belongs to them, have come to nothing--the Greeks have not shown them a single paper.
