FBIS4-30979 "dreeu106_m_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Border Violations Ascribed to Use of Old Maps Border Violations Ascribed to Use of Old Maps AU0206153294 Skopje MILS-NEWS in English 2 June 94 AU0206153294 Skopje MILS-NEWS English BFN [Text] In regard to recently frequented violations of the Macedonian-Serbian border, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representative for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Elizabeth Baldwin stated for the independent A1 television "there is no immediate war threat, but there is an increased activity of the Yugoslav Army in the border area and cases of violations of the border are frequented." As for the 24 May incident near the November 40 observing post, she informed a 21-men patrol of the Yugoslav Army halted the regular UNPROFOR patrol (the Nordic battalion) and an argument broke out. The Yugoslav troops informed the road on which the UNPROFOR patrol was going was to be closed, thus, practically disconnecting the two observing posts (November 40 and November 41) within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The road is to be closed in two weeks and this is a in fact a warning to UNPROFOR to withdraw from that part of the Macedonian territory. According to Mrs. Baldwin, UNPROFOR disagreed with the Yugoslav Army patrol and stated this clearly to them. UNPROFOR expects no essential changes in their observing and informing activities in this part of Macedonia in the future. Meantime the paper VECER, citing several official sources, reports the incidents on the Macedonian-Serbian border are not calling for panics as such incidents happen on nearly most borders. The reason for these incidents is formally explained with no internationally verified agreement on the border, which can be signed only after the two states mutually recognize each other. Serbia still considers the border to be more of an administrative than a border between two states. Serbian authorities still use maps made on basis of measurements done back in 1935, i.e., when the then existing Vardar regional unit. [sentence as published] The same measurements were also used to mark the territory of the Republic of Macedonia after the liberation in 1945.
