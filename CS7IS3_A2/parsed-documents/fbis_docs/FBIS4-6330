Kim labeled the student uprising a "revolution" once he became president last year and began work to make the cemetery holy precincts. Noting the spirit of April 19 had been newly enhanced since the birth of his civilian government last year, Kim called for further efforts to develop the uprising's legacy. He ordered the commemorative service and events be held in the cemetery from next year once the refurbishment is finished. He spoke with representatives of the bereaved families and then leaders of the student movement while walking around the grounds. Kim became the first incumbent president to visit the cemetery last year. Other government and political leaders, together with students and bereaved families, lined up to pay homage to those who died during clashes with the police. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, government leaders and nearly 500 representatives of the uprising held a commemorative ceremony, sponsored by the Patriots and Veterans Affairs Ministry, at the Sejong Cultural Center in downtown Seoul. "The basic idea behind the April 19 (Revolution) is to create a constitutional nation where people's rights are guaranteed and individual freedom is allowed," Yi said in a keynote speech. "We should not forget that we were able to open up a real democratic era today because of the firm faith in democracy implanted through the April 19 (event)," he said. He declared that the government was hastening to carry out legal revisions to reappraise the democratic revolution. Similiar ceremonies were held in other cities and provinces. The uprising, designated as a revolution from this year, was marked not only by dissident parties and students but by political leaders from both the ruling and opposition camps. Opposition Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek and 200 party members visited the cemetery early in the morning, followed immediately by ruling Democratic Liberal Party members led by Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil. Cemetery managers expect more than 10,000 visitors during the day. Nearly 7,000 university students in Seoul gathered for ceremonies at their respective campuses to hold various events including a marathon, street march and cycling games. An opera on the subject will be performed in the evening at the Seoul Opera Theater.
