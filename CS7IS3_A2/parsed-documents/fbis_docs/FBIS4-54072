Recalling that as much as 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium had been concealed for five years at a factory of Japan where agency's groups of inspectors are said to have been stationed for inspection, the letter said: "The international community expresses deep concern over the fact that the IAEA invented a 'nuclear suspicion' with regard to the DPRK's fledgling peaceful nuclear activities and thereby created complexity, while failing to call in question the concealment of plutonium in Japan and its dangerous nuclear activities, which is obviously a double-standard policy". "This case cannot be overlooked today when Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger line in actuality poses a threat to peace and security in Asia, in the Korean peninsula in particular," the letter said, expressing the hope that the IAEA will discharge its original mission in compliance with its statute and with the requirements of the safeguards agreement it signed with the relevant country.
