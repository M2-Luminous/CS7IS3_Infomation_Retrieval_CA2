President Radovan Karadzic said Wednesday that partial solutions, such as the signing of ceasefire accord for one month, pushed towards war and did not represent a basis for peace in Bosnia- herzegovina. He told reporters that the Serb side was once again not treated equally. The accord -- signed Wednesday by U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi and Vice-Presidents of the Moslem-Croatian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina Ejup Ganic and the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) Nikola Kolrevic -- envisage the two sides refrain from engaging for a period of one month in any military activity beginning June 10 at noon local time. The signed document, as set out in Geneva, in no way (?completed a platform) with which, under Akashi's proposal, the conference opened and according to which an accord was to have been signed for four-month ceasefire period, as the basic pre-condition in finding a comprehensive political solution to the Bosnia crisis. The Serbs have from the outset of the conference requested a lasting ceasefire, while the Moslem Croatian delegation first boycotted for four days the talks, under the pretext that armed Serbs did not leave the three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, as set out in the U.N. Resolution No.913. When the Moslem observers and U.N. members on the spot confirmed that armed Serbs have left the said area, Ganic said he would accept only talks on a four-week ceasefire. The signed accord, clearly designed to suit the Moslem side, was taken in Geneva as the first step towards a comprehensive cessation of hostilities, something, as set out, about which the warring parties would continue discussions over the next few days. All this, of course, on condition the Moslems indeed intended ever to join in earnest talks on peace and adhere to the signed documents, including this one signed Wednesday in Geneva. The accord envisaged the warring sides carry out an exchange of prisoners and release all captured persons on their respective territories as well as submit to the Red Cross lists of missing persons. This process is to be scrupulously supervised [word indistinct].
