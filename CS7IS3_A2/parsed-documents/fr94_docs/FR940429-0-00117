FR940429-0-00117 FR940429-0-00012 The commenter also stated that annual audits would ensure that SPRE funds supplement, not supplant, existing licensing or review functions conducted by the State. The commenter further argued that SPREs should have annual audits because the HEA now requires institutions and others to have audits performed annually. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees. The Secretary believes that more frequent audits are not necessary to monitor adequately the activities of a SPRE. The Secretary believes that requiring a SPRE to have an annual audit would divert funds away from performing reviews or referred institutions. Also, in the case of States that receive the minimum allotment, the cost of an audit would represent a significant portion of the allotment. Changes: None. Section 667.16␣Supplement, Not Supplant, Requirement Comments: A few commenters recommended that the Secretary review compliance with this requirement on a case-by-case basis. Several commenters suggested that a State document its activities and functions that are in place prior to the implementation of the program and be able to demonstrate to the Secretary that SPRE activities did not replace those activities or functions. A few commenters recommended that the Secretary monitor the allocation of general State funds to ensure that those funds either matched or exceeded the State's expenditure levels before the establishment of the SPRE. Discussion: The Secretary believes that a State should maintain adequate documentation to show, on audit, that the funds spent for SPRE activities supplemented, but did not supplant, existing State licensing or review functions. Changes: None. Section 667.21␣State Review Standards The Secretary received many comments regarding the framework, proposed in §667.21(b), under which a State develops review standards. In proposing the framework, the Secretary intended to achieve the following objectives: (1) To recognize and account for the diversity of institutions that would be subject to the standards by allowing States to establish different standards for those institutions; (2) To facilitate effective enforcement of State standards by requiring States to quantify certain standards, and by requiring States to specify the records and information an institution would need to maintain for those standards; (3) To limit the scope of the quantitative standards by allowing a State to apply those standards only to regular students, i.e., students enrolled at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized credential offered by the institution; and (4) To introduce a level of rigor in the standards by requiring a State to determine whether a comparable title IV, HEA program standard would be an acceptable State standard. Quantified Standards Comments: Many commenters writing on behalf of institutions and several accrediting bodies objected to the requirement proposed in the NPRM that a State quantify certain review standards by establishing ``acceptable percentages'' for those standards. Many of these commenters believed strongly that this requirement constitutes an ``enforcement mechanism'' and thus violates section 494C(k) of the HEA. A number of commenters acknowledged that the statute allows a State to establish quantitative standards but did not believe that the Secretary has the authority under the statute to require a State to develop quantitative standards. A number of commenters believed that quantitative standards were too restrictive and feared that States would develop such standards without regard to the mission of institutions. Several commenters believed that enforcement of quantified standards would impinge on institutional autonomy and force institutions to shift their missions away from serving high-risk students. A number of commenters believed that standards reduced to ``acceptable percentages'' would either by arbitrary, and probably without legal defense, or statistical, and would, be definition, place a number of institutions below the acceptable levels, regardless of whether the performance of those institutions is otherwise outstanding. Still other commenters argued that standards based on minimum ``acceptable percentages'' would create a safe harbor for institutions that might otherwise be judged to be substandard. By achieving the numerical minimum, such institutions would be able to tie the SPREs' hands and escape adverse action that might otherwise be warranted because, under the NPRM, the SPRE must consider those institutions to be in compliance with the review standard. Commenters writing on behalf of States and student legal services organizations agreed with the proposal. These commenters believed strongly that objective, quantified standards are essential for meaningful enforcement and regulatory review. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees strongly with the commenters who contend that the proposed requirement that a State quantify certain review standards by establishing acceptable percentages for those standards, constitutes an ``enforcement mechanism'' in violation of section 494C(k) of the HEA. That section of the HEA states, ``Nothing in this subpart shall restrict the authority of the States to establish mechanisms to enforce the standards established under subsection (d) or require the States to establish specific mechanisms recommended by the Secretary.'' The restriction on the enforcement of standards in section 494C(k) is based upon the establishment of standards under section 494C(d). Therefore, the restriction on the enforcement of standards has no bearing on the establishment of those standards. The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who indicated that the Secretary is without authority to require States to develop quantitative standards. The nature of the standards imposed by statute is such that without quantifiable measures, the standards would be meaningless.
