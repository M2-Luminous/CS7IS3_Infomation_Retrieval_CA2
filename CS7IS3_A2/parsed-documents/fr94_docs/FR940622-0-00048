FR940622-0-00048 FR940622-0-00011 Response: If an individual is to be transferred, section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires that the hospital obtain agreement from the receiving hospital before a transfer is made. The changes made to title XVIII of the Act by COBRA did not require hospitals to accept all transfers, even when the transfer would be in the individual's best interest. However, under the nondiscrimination provision of section 1867(g) of the Act, as added by section 6211(f) of OBRA 89, hospitals with specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma units, neonatal intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral centers as defined in ยง412.96), cannot refuse to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. Accordingly, we have added the nondiscrimination provision to ยง489.24 as new paragraph (e). In determining whether new ยง489.24(e) applies, we will assess whether the individual required the recipient hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities and if the hospital had the capacity to treat the individual. The recipient hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities has an obligation under section 1867(g) of the Act to accept a transfer if the individual has an unstabilized emergency medical condition and if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. If a hospital desires to transfer an individual to another hospital and the individual does not require any treatment beyond the capabilities or facilities available at the transferring hospital, the intended receiving hospital may refuse to accept the transfer of the individual in accordance with section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent hospitals with emergency departments from automatically transferring patients before screening simply because the hospital does not offer a particular service. For example, a hospital with an obstetrical department is not required to accept a transfer of a woman in labor just because the transferring hospital does not have an obstetrical department. If the woman in labor is having a normal, uncomplicated delivery, and the first hospital has the capacity to handle a normal, uncomplicated delivery, despite the fact that it does not have an obstetrical department, the first hospital is required under section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary stabilizing treatment, that is to deliver the baby and the placenta, or to effect an appropriate transfer to another hospital willing to accept the patient. Similarly, for an individual with a simple, closed fractured arm, a hospital with an orthopedic department and orthopedic physicians on call would not be required to accept a transfer of the individual just because the transferring hospital does not have an orthopedic service. The first hospital is required under section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary stabilizing treatment or to effect an appropriate transfer to another hospital willing to accept the patient. If a transferring hospital does not have the specialized capabilities necessary to stabilize the patient's condition, the intended receiving hospital with the specialized capabilities and facilities must accept the patient under 1867(g) of the Act if it has the capacity to treat the individual. The number of patients that may be occupying a specialized unit, the number of staff on duty, or the amount of equipment on the hospital's premises do not in and of themselves reflect the capacity of the hospital to care for additional patients. If a hospital generally has accommodated additional patients by whatever means (for example, moving patients to other units, calling in additional staff, borrowing equipment from other facilities) it has demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its occupancy limit. For example, a hospital may be able to care for one or more severe burn patients (a common example of specialized service) without opening up a ``burn unit.'' In this example, if the hospital has the capacity, the hospital would have a duty to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual requiring the hospital's capabilities, provided the transferring hospital lacked the specialized services required to stabilize the individual. Situations may arise where a hospital in another country desires to transfer an individual to a United States hospital because of the United States hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities. However, we note that the provisions of section 1867 of the Act are applicable only when the transferring hospital is located within the boundaries of the United States. Accordingly, Medicare participating hospitals are not obligated to accept transfers from hospitals located outside of the boundaries of the United States. This does not change the requirement that a Medicare participating hospital that offers emergency services, must provide, upon request and within its capabilities, an appropriate medical screening examination, stabilizing treatment, and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility to any individual with an emergency medical condition, even if the individual is not a United States citizen. Concerning community plans, the use of cooperative agreements to facilitate appropriate transfers would be a positive step, and we recognize that a suggestion for using the JCAHO approach is constructive; however, we do not believe that this regulation is an appropriate vehicle to mandate community-based plans for the delivery of emergency services. Comment: One commenter suggested that after a patient is stabilized we require hospitals to undertake either medically indicated treatment or transfer the patient, rather than discharge him or her. The commenter stated that a person in stable condition could be seriously ill and, if discharged, the condition could worsen. Response: Section 1867 of the Act does not impose any requirements on hospitals with respect to the treatment or transfer of individuals whose emergency condition has been stabilized. Comment: One commenter suggested that we revise the definition of ``appropriate transfer'' to state that the receiving hospital ``has indicated that it has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the patient.'' This would clarify the responsibility for determining the capability of the receiving hospital. Response: We do not believe it is necessary to add any further specificity to this requirement because, as indicated above, it is understood that the records will have to verify that the receiving hospital has indicated to the transferring hospital that it has agreed to treat the individual, which implies that it had the available space and qualified personnel to treat that individual.
