The president said he is already drafting a decree to confiscate illegally acquired property [words indistinct] in an expedited and noncomplicated manner. Castro said the government will not rest for a single moment in applying the measures, which the Cuban parliament decided to implement today following a two-day debate and an extensive consultation of the people during the first three months of the year. He said all the decisions cannot be implemented together because they need to be put in order. The fight against those who become rich illegally here, called "profiteers," was one of the primary demands in more than 80,000 consultations convened by labor unions, in which approximately 3 million workers participated. The purpose of this process, dubbed here "workers parliaments," was to learn about the people's opinions on needed measures to face the country's current crisis caused by the U.S. blockade and the loss of traditional trade relations following the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc.
