I. Background A. Clean Air Act Requirements The primary purpose of the federal reformulated gasoline program is to improve air quality by reducing motor vehicle emissions of toxic and tropospheric ozone-forming compounds, as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act as amended (CAA or the Act). The Act mandates certain requirements for the reformulated gasoline program. Section 211(k)(2) requires a minimum content of 2.0 weight percent oxygen and maximum content of 1.0 volume percent benzene, and section 211(k)(3) sets minimum performance standards for emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and air toxics. To meet the oxygen content requirement, oxygenates must be added to gasoline. The two most common oxygenates used today are methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol. MTBE is an ether derived primarily from isobutylene, a product typically produced from natural gas or petroleum, and methanol, which in turn is also produced primarily from natural gas. Ethanol is an alcohol produced primarily from corn, though it can be produced from other feedstocks as well. A third oxygenate, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), is an ether derived from ethanol and isobutylene. A number of other oxygenates such as tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) and tertiary amly ethyl ether (TAEE) are currently under consideration by the industry as well. Their ultimate use will depend on their relative economics compared to those oxygenates currently in use. Section 211(k)(1) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate regulations establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline. It also provides that such regulations require the greatest reductions in VOC and toxics emissions, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, non-air-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. B. Historical Background There is considerable history behind EPA's decision to promulgate a renewable oxygenate requirement. Congress and both the past and the present Administrations have long supported the development and use of renewable fuels for a variety of reasons, including a desire to reduce oil imports, save fossil energy, reduce global warming emissions, and develop domestic sources of fuel. This support has taken the form of a number of legislative and policy initiatives. For example, since 1978 renewable fuels have been eligible for an excise tax credit which today is set at 54Â¢/gallon. The Departments of Energy and Agriculture have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development related to the production and commercialization of renewable fuels. As a result of these programs, the ethanol industry developed into a significant industry which by 1990 represented roughly one percent of the nation's gasoline consumption. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act provided ethanol blends with a limited waiver from vapor pressure limits placed on the volatility of conventional gasolines, in order to maintain the ease with which ethanol could be blended with gasoline. Furthermore, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act included several provisions which many expected to further stimulate demand for renewable oxygenates such as ethanol. These provisions included the wintertime oxygenated fuels program which began in 1992 and has already considerably increased the demand for ethanol, and the year-round reformulated gasoline program which is to begin in December of 1994. EPA promulgated final regulations for RFG on December 15, 1993 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994). In the process of developing the regulations for the RFG program, EPA entered into a regulatory negotiation with interested parties shortly after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Included in the negotiations were representatives of the States, oxygenate producers, farm interests, environmental groups, the oil industry, the automobile industry, the driving public, the EPA, and the Department of Energy. (See 56 FR 31176, July 9, 1991, for an explanation of the members of the negotiating committee and a discussion of the process for selecting them.) After extensive discussions, an Agreement in Principle was signed by all members of the advisory committee in August of 1991. The 1991 regulatory negotiation agreement formed the basis for EPA's April 1992 Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) (57 FR 13416, April 16, 1992) for reformulated gasoline. In order to ensure compliance with the minimum reductions in ozone forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) required by Congress for the RFG program, this proposal did not extend the volatility waiver for ethanol-blended conventional gasoline to RFG. In response, members of the ethanol industry submitted comments to EPA which expressed their concern that the proposed reformulated gasoline rules would effectively exclude ethanol from the reformulated gasoline market. Ethanol, when added to gasoline in the amount needed to satisfy the oxygen content requirement of the Act, raises the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of the resulting blend by about 1 psi, making it more difficult for ethanol blends to meet the mass VOC performance standards than blends using other oxygenates. For ethanol to be used in summertime RFG, a gasoline blendstock with an RVP low enough to offset the increase resulting from adding ethanol would have to be obtained. The contention was that obtaining such blendstocks would be both difficult and expensive, because ``sub-RVP'' blendstocks would be more costly to refine and distribute and because blendstock production would be controlled by petroleum refiners. The ethanol industry representatives believed that the oil industry would have a tendency to rely almost exclusively on MTBE over ethanol because MTBE does not boost a fuel's RVP and is readily blended at the refinery and distributed through the existing gasoline infrastructure, since, unlike ethanol, it does not raise materials compatibility or water adsorption concerns with the existing gasoline distribution infrastructure. Thus, there would be little incentive to make the sub-RVP blendstock necessary for ethanol blending into summertime RFG. The ethanol industry representatives also contended that refiners would not want to switch oxygenates during the course of the year and would therefore utilize MTBE year-round, thereby eliminating any RFG market for ethanol. For this reason, ethanol and farm interests sought a summer volatility waiver for ethanol-based reformulated gasolines. Other signatories to the regulatory negotiation agreement, such as the oil industry, methanol and ether producers, states, and environmental groups, opposed such a waiver because it could eliminate most or all of the VOC benefits of the RFG program if ethanol was used in large volumes. At the request of ethanol and farm interests, the Agency held a public hearing to receive testimony on this and other issues in June of 1992 in Chicago.
