"We consider the matter as more or less settled," a Japanese official said after a team of Japanese officials outlined Japan's decision during two days of trade talks in Washington. The talks, which focused on intellectual property rights issues, were part of the so-called "framework" trade negotiations the two countries reopened last week after a three-month deadlock. The U.S. lodged a formal complaint to Tokyo last year after the Japanese Government launched a study on whether Japanese software engineers should be allowed to tinker with rival computer software technologies in the process of developing their own. The Japanese Government effectively shelved the "reverse engineering" initiative on May 30 when an advisory panel to the Cultural Affairs Agency concluded that it is premature for Japan to act without international consensus. U.S. officials "raised no objections" when the Japanese team outlined Tokyo's position on the reverse engineering issue, a Japanese official said. "Reverse engineering" has emerged a highly contentious trade issue over patents and copyrights as computer software firms try to ensure compatibility of their own products by "decompiling" and looking into the language of commands written into a software product. Japanese officials contend that the issue of "reverse engineering" in computer software remains unresolved even in the U.S. as lower courts have made conflicting rulings on what is permissible under U.S. copyright law.
