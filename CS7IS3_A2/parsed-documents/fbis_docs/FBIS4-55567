Knazko, following the party's Republican Council session on 7 May. He explained that DU has representatives throughout Slovakia, apart from in four districts. "I am convinced that we will not struggle to enter the parliament," he added in connection with the prognosis for electoral preferences. He rejected the possibility of discussing open lists of candidates in the case of DU; nevertheless, he did admit to negotiations on a preelection coalition, but not until after the publication of the June public opinion poll. The DU Republican Council endorsed J. Kosta as the head of its election team. He is a sociologist and an external adviser to the prime minister. In their resolution, the members of the Republican Council expressed their distaste at the attempts by the current opposition to discredit the parliament by vulgarizing their parliamentary appearances. The attempts to scandalize government members are nothing other than a well-thought-out tactic aimed at deliberately detracting attention from the parliament's routine work and, subsequently, at destabilizing the situation in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, states the resolution. DU Deputy Chairman V. Vaskovic said that, at the moment, there is no specific view about the amount of property that should be included in the second wave of privatization. According to him, it is important to reach an agreement on the philosophy of the privatization process; however, in no way should the volume of coupon privatization decline below one-third of the overall volume of privatized property. In connection with the withdrawal of the trade unionists from the General Agreement, DU Deputy Chairman R. Kovac described as crucial the fact that social conciliation has not been endangered. He discounted the possibility that the trade unionists will increase the pressure on the government, for example, by strike action because they realize that such a course would not resolve the issue. The DU Republican Council approved a change in the party's logo from the original DEUS to the new DU. Kovac justified the change by revealing the reservations expressed by linguists and heraldists.
