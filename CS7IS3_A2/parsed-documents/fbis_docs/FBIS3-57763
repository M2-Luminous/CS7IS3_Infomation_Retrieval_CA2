Bulgaria and Macedonia became Thursday the latest in a host of former communist states pressing to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which is due to hold a two-day summit starting January 10 when the enlargement issue will be raised. NATO heads of state and government are expected to endorse a plan to step up cooperation with the states of East Europe at their annual summit without granting them membership in the alliance. Among those knocking on NATO's door are Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Russia, which fears being "locked out" of Europe, and its military leadership oppose their former Warsaw Pact allies joining NATO in the near future, and Western leaders are anxious to avoid fanning nationalist passions in Russia's newly-elected hung parliament. [passage omitted] Bulgarian President Zhelio Zhelev said Thursday he had informed Russian leader Boris Yeltsin that Sofia wanted to join NATO in the wake of Zhirinovsky's visit. [passage omitted] Kiro Gligorov, president of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, told parliament Thursday his country would ask to join the Western defence alliance, saying "it is very important for the security of the region that we join the NATO council, and NATO itself, as soon as possible."
