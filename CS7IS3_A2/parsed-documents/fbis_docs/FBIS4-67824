Each morning they pass through the gate of their strict-regime enterprise and head along winding, echoing corridors to the shops and departments. It is hard to believe, looking at the shrouded instruments and the immobile bulks of machine tools, that quite recently everything here was humming, blinking, and vibrating -- in short, life was in full swing. People were working in three shifts, as though possessed, not requiring a rest. There was something fantastic in the hush-hush Science-and-Production Association of Automation and Instrument Building, commonly known as the ``Pilyugin firm.'' [passage omitted] ``My shop manufactured 42 instruments for Buran,'' Boris Kurochkin, leader of precision mechanics, said. ``They control the craft from lift-off to landing. We take a month to `lick into shape' a single component. Whereas it is possible to train a fitter in a year or two, it takes 10-15 years to `perfect' an assembler-fitter in precision mechanics. The shop is unique. It produces unique instruments. For comparison: In the past there was one Faberge, but we have several. An attempt was made to adapt our Faberges to flow production. The result was lamentable: They all skedaddled. One is in roofing, another guards a warehouse, yet another serves in a store. The explanation for all this is simple -- no wages. In the capitalist world a specialist of such caliber has earnings at the level of a banker. Here he makes less than a cleaning woman. How is it possible to keep an ace of precision mechanics on 40,000 rubles? Talk with the workers yourself....'' The shop where gyrostabilizer platforms are assembled and regulated. Here the need for cleanliness is as in an operating theater -- specks of dust are counted per liter of air. Assemblers have to wear special cambric clothes. Even the cloths that are technically necessary to wipe surfaces are made of the same very fine fabric. But this was in the past. This is how it was. Today there are no components on the work table of team leader Zinaida Bakhtina -- just a ball of wool and knitting needles. ``Have you taken up knitting to while away the time?'' ``Yes, unfortunately. There are no orders. Out of 22 work days we are employed for three or four, God willing. Specialists have gone into commerce. I am not suited for it. My soul does not accept what is going on in the country. A complete breakdown....'' Valentin Bykov, chief of the testing and diagnosis department, is still harsher in his views: ``The democrats are lying when they say we squander money. Russian technology is exceptionally economical -- it bears no comparison with U.S. technology in terms of expenditure. Our engineer is more qualified and competent. He lets only a perfected article take off. In retrospect, we have had considerably fewer failures than the United States. But what are we forced to engage in now? Some businessmen came to us with their problem: They said they had bought equipment to counterfeit fashionable jeans but were afraid to install it on the second floor of a dry-cleaning establishment. Were the machine tools too heavy, and would the building suddenly collapse? We carried out their instructions and received money. But this is hack work! I am ashamed.'' There is a lot of argument in the firm about conversion. In principle, the science-and-production association has never avoided tackling national economic tasks. It has been making medical equipment for more than a year. Designers are drawing up a system for the control of nuclear stations. They are racking their brains over a ground-effect machine, a huge transport craft capable of flying over the sea at low altitudes. Or take an instrument to predict earthquakes. Using complex algorithms and taking 21 indicators into account, the apparatus ``paints'' a portrait of the elements and predicts shocks long before they happen. But there has never been a demand for the method. The country is not creditworthy. It cannot afford the latest technologies. There can be no question of scientific developments for the long term. No, it will not be a joyous festival for the creators of automatic space equipment. Rendered lifeless by poverty-stricken funding, the sector is withering day by day. But it is not even the beggarly existence that oppresses its creators but the lack of demand for their very lofty intellect. The country is losing its priorities in the world. The beautiful Buran has already been set up in Gorkiy Park to amuse the crowd. What will it be turned into -- a sideshow or maybe a bar? A bird that was born to fly has had its wings clipped. Is not the same fate being prepared for Russia?
