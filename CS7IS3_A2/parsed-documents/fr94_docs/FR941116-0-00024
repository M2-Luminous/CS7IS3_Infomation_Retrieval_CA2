FR941116-0-00024 FR941116-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;01; Amendment 39&hyph;9067; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; AlliedSignal Inc. TFE731&hyph;3A and &hyph;3AR Model Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to AlliedSignal Inc. (formerly Garrett Engine Division) TFE731&hyph;3A&hyph;200G and &hyph;3AR&hyph;200G model turbofan engines. This action requires removing from service certain low-pressure turbine (LPT) disks, imposing an hourly life limit on the first stage and second stage LPT disks, performing a dimensional inspection of second stage LPT disks at repetitive intervals, and incorporating honeycomb material in the second stage LPT nozzle air seal. This amendment is prompted by reports of LPT disk web separations. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent LPT disk web separations, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective December 1, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 1, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 17, 1995.
