FR940706-2-00093 FR940706-2-00053 Among the questions to be addressed are: How adequate are the income and assets of individuals with disabilities just after benefit receipt and 10 years later? To what extent do disabled individuals maintain their economic status over this period of time? What factors are associated with changes in economic status over the period? How do family members affect the economic status of disabled workers? Analyses should include background factors (such as demographic characteristics, previous occupational characteristics and earnings, living arrangements, family characteristics, and health conditions), major changes in life circumstances (such as widowhood or divorce, changes in living arrangements, or a spouse changing hours of work or retiring), sources of income, changes in the health status, and health-care costs and how these factors relate to various economic outcomes. Proposals should identify the expected methods of analysis, the possible variables to be considered, and the logic for inclusion. Application may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for the initial 12-month budget period under this priority area. E. Documenting and Explaining SIPP-CPS Differences in Aged Poverty Rates_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;005 The official poverty measure and its three derivative statistics (poverty counts, poverty rates and poverty gaps) are important and frequently used criteria employed in the formulation of policy and the evaluation of program outcomes for the aged and disabled populations served by SSA. Twelve-month poverty rates based on the SIPP are somewhat lower for many population subgroups than the poverty rates estimated from the CPS. Much of the comparison of poverty rates from the two surveys has been based on the first operational SIPP panel (the 1984 panel) which pertained to the 1983&hyph;85 time period. In the 1984 panel context, SIPP-CPS poverty rate differences for the aged, were, if anything, less marked than for younger age groups. Based on a review of published poverty rate estimates based on SIPP panels for 1985&hyph;1990 and comparison to corresponding estimates based on the CPS, it appears that a significant change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates appeared with the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. Key features of the change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates include: 1) a modest decline in the poverty rate for all ages in the SIPP relative to the CPS; 2) a much more marked SIPP-CPS difference in poverty rates for the aged than the nonaged (with SIPP rates for the aged ranging between 28 and 34 percent below those based on the CPS); 3) a marked attenuation of the tendency for poverty rates to increase strongly with age among those age 65 and older in the SIPP context as compared with the CPS. Furthermore, preliminary research conducted at SSA indicates that SIPP_CPS poverty rate differences among the aged appear to vary significantly by sex, age, marital status, race and ethnicity; differences appear to be particularly marked for persons who are married, white, or age 85 or older.
