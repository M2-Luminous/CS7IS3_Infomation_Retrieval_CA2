At the same session Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa referred to the government's preparatory work for emergency legislation to join possible sanctions against North Korea. Kakizawa said: "Each section concerned is studying all possibilities, including legislative measures." The two senior government members made their remarks in reply to questions by Representative Nobutaka Machimura (of the Liberal Democratic Party). Responding to a question asking what Japan would do if multinational forces were organized over the North Korean issue in addition to any UN actions, Kakizawa said the government's policy would be to offer all possible cooperation. "It would be difficult for Japan in various ways, but Japan must do everything it can," he said. When Hata was asked about future direction of Japan's defense buildup policy, he said: "While some positive signs have been seen since the end of the Cold War, Japan is still surrounded by regional tensions. We must map out future policies taking these into account." Hata said he would make a careful decision on a revision of the "National Defense Program Outline" in view of the debates at the advisory Defense Issues Council. He said: "We are not presupposing troop reduction [of the Self- Defense Forces]. Rather, we must determine our future course of action by paying sufficient attention to present circumstances."
