And all parties, from the Greens through the Reds, discussed not what the year had been like but plans for the future and set their sights on the elections. All their platforms cannot be described (except for a separate fee, perhaps). But we do not have the right to pass over the forum of the Socialist Party. For if a week ago we presented an account of the Fifth Rukh Congress, God himself has ordained for balance a description of the Third Socialist Party of Ukraine Congress. I was at all its previous congresses and have the chance to make comparisons. Whereas previously they passed off imperceptibly somehow, semi-clandestinely almost, now.... Diplomats' Volvos at the main entrance, almost a hundred journalists from many countries of the world, numerous guests, greetings in various languages. To save time not all of them were read out but A. Moroz, chairman of the Socialist Party, acquainted the delegates with one of them as he opened the congress. This was a message of congratulations from G. Zyuganov--leader of Russia's communists.... The delegates heard two reports: one, very brief, on the organizing and political work in the year since the last congress, and the second--lengthy, discursive--on the platform of the Socialist Party at the future elections. It was discussed tumultuously, but without an overstepping of the mark, and the majority of observations was to the point and opportune, as they say. It was clear from the tone of the speeches that the times when a presidential candidate laid his hands on supreme power with the aid of five "D's are gone. There is no getting by merely with letters today, and for this reason the election platforms (with the Rukh people also, incidentally) vie in terms of length with the platforms of the suburban-line commuter trains almost. The election program of the Socialist Party of Ukraine is fully accommodated in its title: "Toward Socialism--Via the Power of the People, Prosperity, and Security." It emphasizes that the main, urgent method of averting economic catastrophe and starvation is control, accounting and regulation on the part of the state and the working people of the development of production and the distribution of food and the preservation of the plant outfits. Liberal, national-democratic, and pro-bourgeois parties advocating liberalization and privatization are up in arms against this. The socialists are opposed to the plunder of the working people beneath verbiage about a socially oriented economy. "The moment of truth is at hand. We are beginning each individually and all together to recover our sight, recognizing how much in our life has been lost and what a difficult future awaits us and our children, our Ukraine," the appeal to the people of Ukraine adopted at the congress says. Its participants emphasized once again that, as distinct from other parties, the socialists are not aiming at their party's unfailing assumption of office. They will support at the elections any honest competent candidate, a nonparty candidate included, who agrees with them on what is most important: the basis of the good fortune of each individual may only be conscientious and productive labor. There must be neither master nor serf in Ukraine. In conversation with journalists A. Moroz, who was unanimously reelected leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, said that, in his opinion, the forces of the left would obtain more than half the vote at the elections. About 20 percent will vote for the Socialist Party, he believes. The special issue of TOVARISHCH put out for the congress also published the platform of the Communist Party of Ukraine. It is entitled "For Social Justice and the Salvation of Spirituality, for the True Power of the People and a Life Worthy of Man." The Central Electoral Commission the same day registered to participate in the elections as entry No. 1 the Ukrainian Republican Party, as No. 2, the Communist Party of Ukraine.
