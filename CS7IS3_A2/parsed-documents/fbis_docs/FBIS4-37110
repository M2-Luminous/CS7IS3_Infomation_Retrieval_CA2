Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik has learned from sources in the PLO that this remark was made in a personal letter Rabin sent to 'Arafat yesterday morning. The letter was taken to Tunis by Jamil al-Tarifi. The letter is warmly worded and in it, Rabin expresses his commitment to the peace process and to cooperation with 'Arafat. In the letter, Mr. Rabin also expresses a commitment to help the autonomy settle in, but it does not contain any financial commitment.
