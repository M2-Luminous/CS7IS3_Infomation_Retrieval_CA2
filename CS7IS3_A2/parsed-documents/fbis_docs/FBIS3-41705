It has already been half a year since the 3-year statute of limitations on the criminal AIDS case. The former director of the city health department advanced in his career as far as deputy head of the oblast administration, and even mothers, left alone with their grief, no longer haunt the thresholds of the Volgograd mayor's office and city health department asking for help for their children in food, money and medicine, so as to make it until the world invents a medicine against the frightening ailment. Some of them write letters and describe their misfortune only to a certain woman who is not invested with power and who lives in Tyumen-- Tatyana Khrustik. In her own life she experienced what it means to live and know that your child may die at any minute. Now Tatyana Petrovna, who doesn't trust the local authorities and the oblast health department, goes from one commercial firm to another in her search for assistance. Strange as it may seem, sponsors are still to be found. The Tyumen Avantash Bank, the Trigon firm, an airline company, the Volgograd Transportation Administration, and Norwegian trade unions. The director of Moscow's Astra Company, Mikhail Semenovich Tsivin, explained his assistance--paying for medicine for AIDS patients--with just a single phrase: I am a human being, and I want children to live. But in the last half year four youngsters died in Volgograd--all boys. And other boys who are older and quite healthy are beating on the windows of the AIDS center. Of 42 infected children, 34 remain among the living. And this is just in Volgograd Oblast. They are hidden from everyone. Trying to remain incognito, the parents sometime even refuse benefits to which they are entitled. A 5-year-old girl almost succumbed to AIDS while mother frantically raced through the rayon in search of a telephone to call an ambulance. You couldn't go to your neighbors, after all, and you're not going to utter the diagnosis aloud. But many families with sick children still don't have telephones. Volgograd authorities promised to help, but they haven't supported their decision with money. Today most mothers who as a rule have two dependent children, one sick with AIDS, are living on a disability pension and assistance. The only place in Donetsk where there are no lines is the anonymous AIDS testing office. And for no good reason, believes N. P. Grazhdanov, director of the oblast center fighting the frightening disease. From the moment when it became clear that immunodeficiency virus knows no boundaries, 36 infected persons were revealed in Donetsk Oblast, three of whom have already died. Twenty-five out of these 36 turned out to be foreigners, and were deported. However, there are no grounds for reassurance. In N. P. Grazhdanov's opinion there are around 150 AIDS virus carriers in Donetsk Oblast, of whom both the authorities and doctors are unaware. People at the bottom of the ladder are a special headache to medical workers. It doesn't appear that they enter into any kind of relations with foreigners, they prefer drinking perfume to taking drugs, but they still manage to catch the fatal disease somehow. The example offered by the most recently revealed virus carriers is traditionally instructive in this aspect: A fitter working for a certain enterprise in Makeyevka lived in a dormitory and was not distinguished by an especially sober view on life; a young lady who had a dozen sex partners was able to communicate only their first names, and nothing more.
