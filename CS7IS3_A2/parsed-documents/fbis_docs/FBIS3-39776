Demirel said: This is a last chance for international organizations. If they do not keep to their word, they will be ruined and no one will ever believe them again. Demirel replied to reporters' questions at Cankaya Mansion today. Recalling Democracy Party leader Hatip Dicle's statements in connection with the terrorist incident in Tuzla, a reporter asked Demirel whether this will threaten elections in the southeast. Demirel replied that there are no problems with regard to election security. Noting that five innocent youths were killed in Tuzla, Demirel remarked that no one can qualify this as normal. He said: Those who encourage bloodshed will drown in blood. The bloodshed must stop. If that statement is correct, I would greatly regret it.
