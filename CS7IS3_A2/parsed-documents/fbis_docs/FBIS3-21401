That agreement is supported by the American administration, which has put its weight behind it, considering it a "first step" toward a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Since the middle of last month, reports have circulated about the possibility of these organizations moving from Damascus to countries like Sudan or Iraq after the cordon nations are closer to agreement with Israel. Analysts see a connection between Syrian-Israeli progress, and those factions' effectiveness against the agreement and the peace process, in light of President Clinton's announcement that the summit talks had touched on the matter of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, and the rest of the opposition forces located in Syria, such as the PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], led by George Habash and Nayif Hawatimah. High-level PFLP sources report its firm intention to move gradually from Damascus into the occupied territories, and that it strongly rejects any possibility of moving to any other Arab or regional capital, such as Baghdad or Tehran. These sources added that leaders in the Front see factors that will require moving the command decision from abroad into the territories. "That is because the Gaza-Jericho Agreement will be applied in the occupied territories and our opposition to it will be there. What is meant by gradual steps is that we need some time to establish this. All the Front's weight and the decision-making center will be in the territories by the Sixth Conference in 1998. However, now, we are still balancing matters between the two areas, so that we can ensure participation abroad with those who are in fact located at home." These high-placed sources see a connection between implementing the Oslo Agreement and a mechanism for the Front's action at home, which could lead to "radical changes in methods, since we are working in two directions. In any event, the work will remain directed against the Israelis." In the first direction, the Front's mission is to escalate military action and "violence" against the Israeli forces remaining in the occupied territories, because what will happen is re-deployment and not withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. At the same time, PFLP cadres will oppose the self-governing-administrative authority, "by democratic, non-violent means." They will take part in all self-governing organizations except "the one that will have a political, leadership role, so that we will not be responsible--legally and politically--for implementing the agreement in the eyes of the people." They will pursue all avenues of action, except for "military action." The sources denied any link between the changes that are ongoing in the Front's mechanism for action and the development of the Arab-Israeli negotiation processes. They said that "the Fifth Conference, which decided the question of shifting the weight to the occupied territories, was held before the appearance of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, or rather, came in a stage of stumbling in the peace process." They pointed out the lack of any uneasiness among PFLP members located in Damascus after the Geneva summit. "We are allies of Syria, but we do not agree 100 percent on political positions. It will be a long time before we feel direct repercussions from the peace process." While predictions continue about PFLP offices moving to another place in light of visits made by Front officials to several regional countries, these same sources stress that there is no plan to stay away from the occupied territories geographically. "Our decision is always to move closer to the battlefield and not away from it."
