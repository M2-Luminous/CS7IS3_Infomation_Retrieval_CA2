Yeltsin -- 14 V. Zhirinovskiy -- 5 G. Yavlinskiy -- 5 Ye. Gaydar -- 4 A. Sobchak -- 3 A. Rutskoy -- 3 M. Gorbachev -- 3 V. Chernomyrdin -- 1 Other -- 17 Not sure -- 45 B. Yeltsin as Russia's president is more often the choice of people in the arts, pensioners and women in general, persons over 55 with incomplete higher and higher education, and those who were active in the 12 December 1993 elections and voted on party slates for Russia's Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. V. Zhirinovskiy as president is relatively more often the choice of the military and police, managers at various levels, workers in commercial structures, men in general (twice more often than women), persons under 40 with secondary education, and those who were very active in the elections and voted predominantly for Zhirinovskiy's and Travkin's parties. G. Yavlinskiy as president is more often the preference of the military and police and people between age 25 and 40 in general, with higher education, who took part in the elections at the average Moscow level and voted for Yabloko. Ye. Gaydar as president would be preferred more often by students, employees in commercial structures, arts and non-arts specialists, persons under age 55 with incomplete or complete higher education who were active in the elections and cast the most votes against the political associations offered in party slates and for Russia's Choice. The other "presidential candidates" had an insignificant number of supporters in this poll, which does not allow analysis of their socio-demographic makeup.
