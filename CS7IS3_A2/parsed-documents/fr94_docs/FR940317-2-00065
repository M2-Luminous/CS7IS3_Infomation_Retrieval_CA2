FR940317-2-00065 FR940317-2-00042 Addendum V_Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (For the reader's convenience, new material and changes to previously published material are in italics. If any part of a sentence in the manual instruction has changed, the entire line is shown in italics. The transmittal includes material unrelated to revised sections. We are not reprinting the unrelated material.) Transmittal No. 65; section 65&hyph;15, Artificial Hearts and Related Devices_Not Covered. CHANGED IMPLEMENTING INSTRUCTIONS_EFFECTIVE DATE; Services Furnished on or After 10/18/93. Section 65&hyph;15, Artificial Hearts and Related Devices, is revised to provide coverage of the FDA-approved ventricular assist device (known as the BVS 5000) when used only in patients suffering from postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction. The device is intended for short term use and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. 65&hyph;15 ARTIFICIAL HEARTS AND RELATED DEVICES_NOT COVERED There are several devices either in use or under development which replace all or part of the human heart or assist the heart in performing its pumping function. Artificial hearts are considered investigational and not covered under Medicare either when used as a permanent replacement for a human heart or when used as temporary life-support systems (i.e., until a human heart becomes available for transplant). The FDA-approved ventricular assist device (known as the BVS 5000) is covered when it is used in accordance with its FDA-approved labeled uses for postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction. The device is intended for short term use and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Other ventricular assist devices used as temporary life-support systems are still considered investigational and not covered under the Medicare program. Transmittal No. 66; section 60&hyph;4.B, Medical Documentation. CHANGED PROCEDURES_EFFECTIVE DATE: Services furnished on or after 01/01/9. Section 60&hyph;4.B, Medical Documentation, is revised to reflect changes mandated by ยง4152 of OBRA 1990, effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 1991. Implementing changes were published in the Medicare Carriers Manual in July 1991 (transmittal 1399). Transmittal No. 66; section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence. CHANGED PROCEDURES_EFFECTIVE DATE: 10/27/93. Section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence, is revised to indicate that in situations where the arterial blood gas and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting, the arterial blood gas study is the preferred service of documenting medical need because the results of such studies are considered the best evidence of hypoxemia. In addition, these instructions also clarify that the prohibition against the use of results of tests performed by a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier to qualify patients for home oxygen service does not extend to the results of an arterial blood gas text by a hospital certified to conduct such tests. 60&hyph;4 HOME USE OF OXYGEN B. Medical Documentation._Initial claims for oxygen services must include a completed Form HCFA&hyph;484 (Attending Physician's Certification of Medical Necessity for Home Oxygen Therapy) to establish whether coverage criteria are met and to ensure that the oxygen services provided are consistent with the physician's prescription or other medical documentation. The attending physician's prescription or other medical documentation must indicate that the other forms of treatment (e.g., medical and physical therapy directed at secretions, bronchospasm and infection) have been tried, have not been sufficiently successful, and oxygen therapy is still required. While there is no substitute for oxygen therapy, each patient must receive optimum therapy before long-term home oxygen therapy is ordered. Use Form HCFA&hyph;484 for recertifications. (See Medicare Carriers Manual ยง3312 for completion of Form HCFA&hyph;484.) The medical and prescription information on Form HCFA&hyph;484 can be completed only by the attending physician or entered on the form from information in the patient's records by an employee of the physician for the physician's review and signature. Although hospital discharge coordinators, nurses, and medical social workers may assist in arranging for physician-prescribed home oxygen, they have no authority to prescribe the services or to enter medical or prescription information in items 1 through 6 of Form HCFA&hyph;484. Suppliers may not enter this information either. Unlike other types of DME, a physician's certification of medical necessity for oxygen equipment must include the results of specific testing before coverage can be determined.
