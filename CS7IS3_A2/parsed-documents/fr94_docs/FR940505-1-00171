FR940505-1-00171 FR940505-1-00012 A final advantage to this kind of emission control program is that the fees collected could be used to help ship owners and operators reduce their ships' emissions, thus advancing additional emission benefits. For example, the fees could be used to help ship owners and operators purchase and install emission reduction equipment, through loans or grants or other financial assistance programs. It should be noted, however, that the Miscellaneous Receipts Act requires EPA to submit any fees paid pursuant to this program to the U. S. Treasury. Therefore, in order to use the fees collected under such a program for emissions control, it is necessary for California or the South Coast to develop a replacement program that would supersede this proposed EPA program. Then, the fees would be paid to the State of California or the South Coast Air Quality Management District instead of to EPA, and those organizations could use the funds for such purposes. By adopting a replacement program, California or the South Coast could take steps to decrease any adverse economic impacts resulting from the program. EPA is proposing to begin instituting the port fee schedule described below in 2001. This date is beneficial for two reasons. First, EPA hopes that in the intervening seven years, the California and IMO efforts to regulate ship emissions and the Coast Guard effort to move the shipping channel will have all borne fruit. Thus, 2001 allows enough time to respond to these changes and work out details about the form of this program in light of them. Second, by beginning to develop this program nine years before the attainment date, EPA allows time to adjust the fees and discounts to achieve the necessary emissions reductions at the least cost, as described below. EPA anticipates that the ships and ports fees program described in this preamble will achieve an approximately 30 percent NO X emission reduction in the South Coast. This estimate is based on the assumption that the 10 percent of the ships which create 50 percent of the emissions due to frequent visits will have on average 30 percent lower emissions after implementation of the program. This reduction will likely be achieved by ship operators and owners using newer ships for their California trips, by using better fuels, and by using timing retard technology, at least in the short run. A further 7.5 percent NO X reduction should be achieved through increased cold ironing. The remaining 7.5 percent NO X reduction will come from isolated use of available low emitting engines, such as turbines and SCR equipped ships, by the remaining 90 percent of the ships visiting the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. In response to these fees and to ongoing actions by the Coast Guard to protect the Monterrey Bay Sanctuary, EPA expects most ship owners or operators will choose shipping routes that will take them away from Ventura's coast. This will have the effect of reducing the transfer of marine emissions to the coast in that area. The user fees will have this effect because the vast majority of ships that currently use the shipping channel that takes them along the shoreline close to Ventura will stop or have stopped at the Ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles. Under the proposed emission reduction strategy, these ship owners and operators can reduce the user fees they will be charged at these ports by using a relocated shipping channel that takes them away from the coastline. EPA believes that the discounts associated with using the relocated channel will be sufficient to eliminate most of that traffic. In addition, the Coast Guard has undertaken a study to evaluate the impact of relocating California shipping channels. 92 Such relocation may be necessary to reduce environmental damage to the Monterrey Bay Sanctuary due to ship traffic. As part of that study, the Coast Guard has requested comments regarding relocation of the channel near Ventura. EPA has recommended to the Coast Guard that the channel near Ventura should be moved as far as feasible from the coast. Such a decision by the Coast Guard will also reduce airborne marine emissions in Ventura. 92 See 58 FR 44634, August 24, 1993, for the Coast Guard notice announcing this study. These emission reduction estimates were made without sufficient knowledge of the effects of a fee on the behavior of shippers. Shippers may find it easy to reschedule their ships so that only the lowest emitting ones are used in the South Coast. On the other hand, shippers may have difficulty reducing their emissions if equipment and/or installation services are insufficient to meet demand. EPA intends to monitor the fee's effects and adjust the fees and discounts as necessary to achieve a NO X emission reduction approximately similar to that required under the stationary source cap. The following sections describe in greater detail the components of this fee-based control strategy. As described in Section III.D.4.e (5), this program does not apply to military vessels. EPA requests comments on all features and calculations associated with this proposed program, as well as the proper application. As described above, EPA is proposing to apply the program to the two major South Coast ports for ocean going ships: the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. EPA requests comment on applying the program to all basin ports, all California ports, or only as proposed. (b) Control Strategies_Fee System Based on Emission Levels. ( 1 ) Fee Categories. The goal of this proposal is to encourage the use of cleaner marine engines. A number of emission control technologies for reducing NO X from marine diesel engines are described in the following section. Although the emission reduction strategies described in the following section each contain a range of reduction potential, there appears to be a number of technologies that offer the potential to achieve reductions of 30 percent or greater. Also, reductions of greater than 80 percent are possible through three options: Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), steam turbine engines and gas turbine engines. Other technologies, such as natural gas engines, may also achieve reductions in excess of 80 percent.
