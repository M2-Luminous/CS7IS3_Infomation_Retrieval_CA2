The Government is increasingly willing to commit more manpower to the region in response to the urgent United Nations plea for 10,650 more soldiers. But Ministers are awaiting a firm commitment from other countries before agreeing to the UN request. The UN commander in Bosnia, Britain's Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, said it would be "a disappointment" if the UN did not get the extra troops. Initial responses to the UN plea indicated that a lot of background diplomatic work will be needed to put together a substantial international force. The Clinton Administration said its decision not to deploy U.S. ground troops in Bosnia remained unchanged. And reports from the UN in New York said France, which already has 6,000 troops in the former Yugoslavia, was also refusing to send more. However, there are a total of 24 countries with soldiers on the ground in the region and Britain is expected to put pressure on these. There is also expected to be a move to allow Italy, which has so far kept out of the region for historical reasons, to send troops. "One can expect significant behind-the-scenes work to persuade other countries to commit more troops," said a Whitehall source. "This would then clear the way for Britain to increase the number of troops it has in the region." France has indicated it may bring forward the deployment of its replacement forces to create an overlap of several weeks, thus providing thousands more men for a short period. Cabinet Ministers have decided against withdrawing the 2,500- strong UK humanitarian force, and will go ahead with the replacement of the Coldstream Guards by the 2nd Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment in May. However, the Army says it would be difficult to mirror the French move as the battalion is equipped with Warrior armoured vehicles and the extra necessary logistics would be substantial. In addition, Lt. Gen. Rose is looking for lightly armoured mobile infantry to police the cease-fire. The Army has two infantry battalions equipped with Saxon armoured cars already painted in UN white colours, which would be ideal for peacekeeping operations. Either the Green Howards or the Duke of Wellington's Regiment could be sent quickly to Bosnia with their 64 Saxons and logistics back-up by sea and air. Lt. Gen. Rose said the reaction of the international community so far was a disappointment. "If we are not going to get the troops we need we will have to go on as we are, which is to `misuse' troops from other tasks and bring them over to help with the process of developing the ceasefire plan in central Bosnia and around Sarajevo," he said. "We have been a bit slow in getting to the situation because we do not have the troops in sufficient strength around the 70-kilometre confrontation line." It was too strong to suggest the cease-fire was in "jeopardy" because of the shortage of troops but the process was "very fragile." Shadow defence secretary Dr. David Clark called on the Prime Minister to "stop messing around" and send in more troops. He said. "I want to stop the slaughter. The peace will only hold if we get extra troops out there. It is about time the Prime Minister stopped messing around and sent them out." He added that the Americans "ought to put their money where their mouth is and send troops." Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said: "The failure of the United States to offer any more troops for Bosnia could rupture the NATO alliance. All the good work achieved at the recent summit will be thrown away."
