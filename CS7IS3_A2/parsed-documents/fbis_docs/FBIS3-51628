[as received] The Royal Gazette said on Thursday that her shock departure followed a cabinet row over independence. She will remain as an mp. Premier Sir John Swan, already hit by Tuesday's resignation of Technology Minister Michael Winfield because of business and family reasons, said he was stunned by Mrs Decouto's decision. In a letter released to the media Wednesday night, Sir John held back from accepting her resignation. In her resignation letter to the premier, Mrs Decouto said she did not agree with the government holding a referendum on the question of independence for this British colony at the present time. Bermuda is still trying to get to grips with the implications of the closure of three foreign military bases in the island. The Canadians closed their base at the end of last year and the United States and United Kingdom bases are to follow suit late next year. "Bermuda has too much on its plate at this time (with the bases closing). "I attempted to make my views clear at cabinet," said Mrs Decouto. Sir John called an emergency cabinet meeting for Thursday to control what could mushroom into a crisis of confidence. Sources said there was no connection between the two resignations. The departure of Mrs Decouto, a lawyer and former deputy premier, ends a controversial ministerial career in which she become known as Bermuda's iron lady. As minister of social services in the mid-1980s, she oversaw Bermuda's first responses to the AIDS crisis as well as commissioning of the new prison. But it was her appointment as environment minister that solidified her reputation as a bold, no-nonsense politician. In a bid to halt the island's dwindling stocks, she stood up to the island's fishermen and imposed a fish pot ban.
