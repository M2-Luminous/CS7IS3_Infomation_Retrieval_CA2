This has been announced by Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to him, Russia will retain 3,500 highly efficient nuclear warheads capable of defending it from any form of aggression. As to nuclear weapons cuts, Moscow spends up to 1,000 billion rubles a year for these purposes. An agreement with the United States on processing weapon-grade uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations only partially compensates for the losses incurred by Russia due to the destruction of the nuclear weapons of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.
