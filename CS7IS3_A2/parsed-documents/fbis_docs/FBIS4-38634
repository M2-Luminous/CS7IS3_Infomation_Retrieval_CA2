The masses are very dissatisfied. Some rural regions even experienced serious difficulties in maintaining public order. The meeting discussed the growing problem of maintaining public order in China's rural areas. Ren Jianxin, a senior cadre of China, emphasized that the impact that rural areas' public security problems will have on the situation nationwide must never be underestimated. A system of rural cadres assuming personal responsibility for maintaining public order is being formulated in accordance with his proposal. Of late, China's leaders are deeply worried about the situation in rural areas. For this reason, the State Council promulgated a poverty alleviation plan not long ago. According to official statistics, 80 million peasants in China are living below the poverty line. Their annual income is under U.S.$100. In other words, they do not have enough to eat and wear. The goal of the government plan is to eliminate, by and large, poverty in China by the year 2000. This and the new measures the authorities have taken to improve public order in rural areas are two sides of a policy that is designed to prevent massive peasant unrest, which could lead to social and political instability and chaos. Foreign wire services such as AFP and REUTERS noted in their comments that local party committees and administrative organs in some rural areas of China have become paralyzed or semi-paralyzed. This is exactly the situation foreign observers love to cite in interpreting why the Chinese central authorities are implementing the system of rural cadres assuming responsibility for maintaining public order in their respective localities. Reform, development, and stability -- these are the main goals of the domestic policy offensive of the Chinese leadership. The task facing Chinese leadership is to contain, dilute, and eventually eliminate the destabilizing factors in rural areas. It is particular true of poverty-stricken areas where increases in peasant income are lagging behind the inflation rate, and of areas with wide gaps between rich and poor, where rich farmers sharply contrast with poor ones. This is the kind of situation that could lead to deadly consequences. Taking note of this danger in good time, the Chinese authorities have implemented comprehensive measures to ensure public order and security in the unsteady rural areas.
