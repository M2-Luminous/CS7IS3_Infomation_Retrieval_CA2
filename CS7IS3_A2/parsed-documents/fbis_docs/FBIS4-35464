Barzani said that Talabani's forces occupied the Parliament building on 3 May as coupists usually do as the first step. Barzani denied reports that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are fighting on the side of his forces. He also denied that he has asked for Iran's mediation. He said that it was Talabani who asked Tehran to host a meeting of the leaders of the warring Iraqi Kurdish parties. Mas'ud Barzani also stressed that no one in Iraqi Kurdistan has prevented Talabani, who is in Damascus, from returning to his headquarters, and that on his request the allied forces military coordination office placed a helicopter at his disposal to bring him to Kurdistan. However, Talabani changed his mind. Barzani accused the PUK forces of killing all civilian and military prisoners who belong to the DPK. In his interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Mas'ud Barzani admitted that the fighting has weakened the democratic process in Kurdistan and has not enhanced the status of Iraqi Kurds in the eyes of the western countries. On the contrary, the fighting has embarrassed some of these countries. He emphasized the need to stop the fighting.
