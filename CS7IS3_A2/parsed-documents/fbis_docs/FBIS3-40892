National defense as a field of activity and organizing and building the armed forces also have their own laws. These laws are (relatively) independent from one another, but they are closely interrelated--production always being closely linked with protection of the production of different installations and localities, as well as of the country as a whole. "Building the country is closely linked with defending the country" and "building socialism must be closely linked with protecting socialism." These are the necessary laws. The militia and self-defense forces (MSF) are the armed forces of the masses and are closely linked with production, social life, and political movement at the basic level. At present, the new production mechanism directly and regularly acts on the MSF in many ways: -- The laws on value, competition, and regulation of production act on them. During the time when state subsidies still existed, Military Region 5, like other localities, had organized its MSF mainly on the basis of the collective state-operated production. The implementation of Resolution 10 of the Political Bureau in agriculture and Decree 217 of the Council of Ministers calling for abolishing state subsidies, granting autonomy to production installations, practicing profit-and-loss accounting, and working with an adjusted market mechanism had created a fierce challenge for two-thirds of state enterprises, namely, 90-95 percent of enterprises at district and city levels being forced to dissolve, the scope and authorities of agricultural cooperatives being reduced, and production units no longer exerting any influence. From 90 to 95 percent of fishery cooperatives had gone bankrupt and had been dissolved. Private production, in the meantime, had been developing in many forms: Private enterprises put their capital together through the sales of shares; joint enterprises, through cooperation with the outside world, attracted most of the work force. The common tendency in production organization today is to lighten the administrative management machinery and to reduce the number of nonproductive intermediary layers. In state-operated enterprises, contracts are signed with shops, shifts, and groups, and on the basis of various means of production. In agriculture, contracts are signed on the basis of unit prices and with individual workers, with households being considered autonomous economic units in production. The common form is to organize appropriately small and flexible enterprises in accordance with the market mechanism, with the fact that workers have no job security due to their contractual status, and so on. This is a great difficulty in the organization and management of the MSF. Many illogical aspects and irreparable discrepancies between the interests and obligation of citizens and production units have appeared in the system of procedures and policies applicable to the MSF and reserve troops that was adopted to guarantee their training and activities. There are policies and regulations that are no longer effectively usable. Sectors and echelons, both central and local, and production installations, production units, and citizens have not yet properly resolved the relationships between the two strategic tasks of the party. The situation still exists in which to do economic work and to develop production fails to be closely linked with the national defense and security task; in many localities, production installations have neglected their national defense and military task, which occupies no place in their activities. This is one of the reasons that directly create great difficulties for the efforts to organize and build the MSF, particularly in the case of the state-bloc self-defense force. It is due to this problem that, in many developed production installations, workers earn high incomes but have no budget to cover expenses for training and other activities. In the last two years, in Military Region 5, training and other activities took place each year at only 10-15 percent of its production installations. MSF organization existed in name only or in some localities, was reduced to a minimum level, that is, in each village (subward), local production installations had only five to 10 people forming their professional protection force. This is a situation that conforms wrongly to the characteristics, function, and task of the MSF. As we face the above-mentioned situation, do we organize the MSF in the various economic sectors? What are the policies that guarantee them? And so on. In our opinion, this is a difficult and rather complicated problem, but first of all we must assert the following: Since production is multisectoral, the organization of the MSF cannot limit itself within just a few of the economic sectors. This is an objective necessity and also a part of the renovation in connection with the organization and building of the MSF in the new situation. This originates from the line on renovation as it is recommended in the resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses for the period of transition to socialism and for continuing to build the multisectoral commodity economy, with socialist regulation and preset direction. At the same time, this is an urgent need in connection with the protection of production and the fight against the enemy's strategy of peace development, rioting and overthrow, and destruction that each and every locality and production installation is required to satisfy. If we invest in production without investing in protection of production, our efforts and assets will soon vanish. Or if we avoid the task, adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and rely on others to provide us with protection, we will be acting against the instinct for self-preservation and the view of our party and nation on independence, self-rule, and self-sufficiency. To build the MSF in the various economic sectors also is based on the view on the people being considered the roots, on the nation's traditions, and on the real needs of production today. In the war of resistance against the French, we were building our forces by going from zero and from small to large scale. The armed forces that had come from the people had shown revolutionary understanding, hatred for the enemy, and the voluntary desire to hold arms to fight the enemy and to wage a great people's war to score victory. At that time we had not yet organized any state-operated and collective production. In the course of changing our direction and reorganizing our forces, we need to thoroughly understand these needs: -- Organizing the MSF must conform to the party leadership system; ensure all aspects of direct leadership by the party committee echelons and chapters in production installations; remain closely linked with administrative units; and reorganize production units, shifts, sectors, and occupations in all economic sectors so as to facilitate activities and management. -- On what scale to organize the MSF depends on how advanced our management and command capabilities are and our efforts to avoid being formal and imposing our will. -- On the basis of the task to remain combat-ready, to fight, and to maintain political security, let us fight the enemy's strategy of peace development, rioting, and overthrow in different regions and develop our ability to ensure such a task so as to have the right scale for organizing appropriate forces. By adopting the three above-mentioned needs as the point of departure, Military Region 5 has been organizing its forces in all areas and in economic sectors as follows: 1. For Rural Areas and Streets To organize the MSF on the basis of such administrative units as hamlets, villages, wards, and population centers and to consider them the basic MSF units, being linked with the party chapter (or party cell) leadership, with the hamlet system of administration, and with association chapters of political organizations in production installations. To set up hamlet military unit commands to replace the former local platoon and company commands. In 1991, throughout Military Region 5 more than 3,600 hamlet military unit cadres were organized. Some favorable aspects of the organization of hamlet military unit commands include the fact that they are closely linked with procedural operations at a level lower than that of production installations, thus being closer to the masses and to the MSF themselves. As these military commands are based on territorial division, their authorities are greater than those of platoon and company commands; they serve both as the staffs for party committee echelons and the administration and as the local MSF commanders and managers, and in addition, they also manage the reserve forces and fulfill other military functions in the localities. The scale for organizing the local forces is as follows: to organize them from squads and several squads, instead of organizing companies and platoons. 2. Organizing MSF on the Sea The MSF on the sea are organized around the state-operated and collective sectors as their hard core; at the same time, they are organized in the private economic sector, provided favorable conditions prevail there and the work is done in steady steps. As an immediate task, let us consolidate anew the state-operated enterprises and collective production units. As for the private economic sector, it is necessary to select those people who satisfy the following requirements: -- They must be people with permanent household registration in the localities and with permits to work on the sea. -- Their employment is stable; first of all, the people being selected are those who work on boats and junks and who are both workers and partners having contributed their shares of capital.[.sup]1[/] -- Politically speaking, they are reliable people. As an immediate task, let us select the boats and junks having 100 percent of laborers considered politically qualified, or at least 50 percent of the crews, including their captains and stokers, being politically qualified, to organize the force. Formula and scale of organization: They must be crews of the same boats and junks, be in the same fishing units, have the same occupation, fish in the same fishing grounds, share the same fishing lanes (open-sea fishing, inshore fishing, and onshore fishing), and be in the same administrative units in order to make sure that they are organized on the right scale and in the right form. The above-mentioned "same" requirements are aimed at achieving the goal of making things more convenient for management, command, daily activities, training, and combat action. As we carried out the above-mentioned guidelines in our military region, in the last two years there were changes in the MSF operating on the sea, namely, after the period of 1990-1991, the private economic sector accounted for 68.5 percent of the MSF and the state-operated and collective enterprises accounted for only 31.5 percent of the MSF, as compared to the cooperatives accounting for 80 percent and the state-operated enterprises, 20 percent, as in the past. 3. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Private and Jointly Operated Foreign Enterprises -- Self-defense forces are organized only in localities where party organizations exist. In localities where there are no party organizations, self-defense forces are organized where there are private enterprises. These forces are placed under the leadership of the party committee echelons in the local administration and receive direct military command from the areas, villages, and subwards concerned. -- Organizing self-defense forces in jointly operated and jointly associated enterprises: Only Vietnamese workers with permanent household registration in the localities are to be selected, as mentioned in Article 23 of the MSF Statutes. 4. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Organs, Enterprises, Work Sites, State Farms, and State Forests First we need to organize the MSF among official workers and workers with long-term contracts. We must to rely on fixed work units like shifts, shops, and production units to organize appropriate forces in terms of their scale and form. We organize these forces only where we have enough squads. The largest scale is company and multicompany; there must be limits and it is unnecessary to organize battalions. To ensure participation of the MSF in training and regular activities, all echelons must loosen procedures and policies and ensure fairness and rationality in terms of interests and obligation, in accordance with today's market mechanism. Financing comes from these sources: -- Money taken from the spending and budget of the localities and production installations--including provincial, district (city), village (subward), and production installation levels. -- The people's contributions in the form of fixed amounts set for each production and farming unit; production installations being encouraged to set up MSF support funds, on the basis of the motto, "the people discuss, the people appoint, the people support," and the people control and supervise. -- Money earned by the MSF from land and forests being assigned to them for doing productive work and providing services. -- Shares of bonuses earned as the result of good activities. Of the four above-mentioned sources the one that results from security activities aimed at protecting the lives and properties of the people and collectives and maintaining political security in production installations is the most effective source, which must be used to promote other sources. To organize and manage the MSF under the conditions of the multisectoral production of commodities and to act in accordance with the present market mechanism is a new multifaceted ever-changing complicated issue that requires military workers in production installations and people having to deal with these installations to change the ways they think and do things in order to seek the right formula for organizing MSF management. To revise the procedures and policies having to do with the MSF in order to keep pace with the present mechanism is a task of realistic significance that will help to fight and defeat the enemy's peace development strategy in production installations. Footnote 1. In Military Region 5 there are three forms of being capital-contributing partners: a) Families invest capital in buying the means of fishing and do the work themselves, or hire a few laborers. b) Many household families contribute to the capital used to buy the means, or to bid successfully for the means put on sale by a cooperative at the time of its dissolution. c) Owners buy the means and hire laborers to do the work. Of the three forms, the first and second ones involve stable labor.
