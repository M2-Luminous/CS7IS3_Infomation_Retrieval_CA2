On Wednesday, Toepfer said in Wiesbaden that this issue was discussed in the Franco-German consultations. The concrete coat, which was built around the reactor after the disaster in Ukraine, now has to be overhauled due to erosion processes. According to Toepfer, several pending questions (such as that of financing) still have to be clarified before a concrete decision is taken. In an event organized by the Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation, which is close to the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Toepfer predicted that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] would change its policy and support an energy consensus with the inclusion of nuclear energy after the Bundestag election.
