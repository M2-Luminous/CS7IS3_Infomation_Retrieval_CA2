Mr. Tekere called on all able-bodied Zimbabweans, irrespective of their political affiliation, to form what he called an Angels With Swords army to retaliate to any attacks by President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. He suggested that members should be armed with axes, spears, arrows, and firearms, but not bombs. Mr. Tekere's call came only days after two other opposition parties had told their supporters to arm themselves with spears and arrows in case of attacks by ZANU-PF youths. President Mugabe has already sounded a warning that his supporters have more and even better weapons that their rivals.
