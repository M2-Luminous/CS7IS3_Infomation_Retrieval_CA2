'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the hardline Muslim fundamentalist group, said in a statement that it would give "protection and weapons" for "any repentant who kills his employer in the Israeli (secret) services." Hamas claimed a former collaborator worked with militants to ambush and kill a member of the Shin Bet internal intelligence service and wound two others on the West Bank on Sunday. Last November the fundamentalists, who have taken up arms to drive out Jews, announced that Palestinians who collaborate with the Israelis had two months to repent. After the deadline the almost daily murders of alleged collaborators resumed in the occupied territories. 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam said on Tuesday that the fasting month of Ramadan now underway would be marked by the murder of Israelis to avenge fallen Palestinian militants. Thirteen Palestinians have been killed for suspected collaboration with Israel since the start of this month alone, and Hamas has claimed responsibility for most of them. According to the army, about 1,000 Palestinians -- including many drug dealers, addicts, prostitutes and personal vendetta victims -- have been killed by fellow Palestinians since the intifadah or uprising began in December 1987.
