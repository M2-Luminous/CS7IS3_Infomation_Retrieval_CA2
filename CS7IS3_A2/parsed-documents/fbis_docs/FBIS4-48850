[passage omitted] The registration of voters and candidates for the Constituent Assembly has been carried out, and candidates are already in the process of campaigning, with the help of the government media. The necessary documents, ballot boxes, and the process for transporting them is successfully underway. It is expected that the elections will be carried out fairly, freely, and in a democratic manner, in the presence of local and international observers. 16 million people have already been registered as voters, out of the 22 million who are eligible to vote, so around 72 percent of our eligible voters have registered. [passage omitted] What remains now is the process by which the people will elect those who will represent them in the Constituent Assembly. A Constitution will be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, and a new democratic government, based on this Constitution, will be set up. this process is expected to be finalized by the middle of next year. [passage omitted] The government has taken steps to improve production in the trade and industrial sectors. Those obstacles which had been hindering the development of the economy's industrial sector have been removed, and government institutions have been encouraged to operate at a profit through improved management. Our factories were saved from closure by being supplied with adequate foreign currency from the government for the purchase of raw materials. [passage omitted] In this year's budget, the industrial sector has shown 9.9 percent growth: trade and transportion have grown by 3.7 percent, and the social services' sector has grown by 10.3 percent. Although the amount of land under cultivation has increased by 11 percent, agricultural production has gone down by 5.2 percent, due to inadequate rainfall. Since the country's economy is dependent on agriculture, which in turn relies on long rains, if there is inadequate rainfall in one year it will not only affect the agricultural sector, but the entire national economy. [passage omitted] Moreover, more than 6.7 million citizens are faced with famine, and thousands of animals have been affected. [passage omitted] I would like to extend my deepest gratitude, and that of the Ethiopian people, to various donor countries and nongovernmental organizations, for their relentless life-saving missions. [passage omitted]
