Saito told a regular press conference that the climbs were recent developments and did not reflect long-term trends. Concerning the interest rates, Saito said rates were rising from a very low point and remain at "sufficiently low levels." He said that "at one time" the yen was said to be on another uptrend but those expectations did not come about. Saito said more time is needed to watch interest rate and currency market trends. Japanese benchmark 10-year government bond yields jumped Monday to 3.94 percent, their highest level since just before the Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate to a record low 1.75 percent a year in September. Banks are moving to raise their long-term prime lending rates, which would put upward pressure on housing loan rates. Market players have cited a halt in the decline of business confidence signaled by a key survey released Monday, and concerns of oversupply in the wake of the government's stepped-up bond issuance. The yen also climbed Monday as reports circulated that the United States would revive a retaliatory trade law, rekindling bilateral trade friction and heightening expectations of U.S. backing of a higher yen to curb Japan's huge trade surplus. On the economy, Saito said there had been worries in some quarters of further setbacks but they have dissipated. On the other hand, he said, there is still no confirmation that the economy is bottoming out. It is still too early to judge the economy based on recent statistics showing some hope that the worst is over, he said. But he repeated that the effects of last month's 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be felt and expressed hope that the measures will get the economy on track for a strong recovery in the fiscal year starting next month and stable growth starting in the following fiscal year. Saito declined comment on reports that President Bill Clinton will revive the super 301 retaliatory trade provision, saying nothing official has been decided. He said Japan's policy remains not to draft numerical targets to gauge progress in opening markets.
