The document, which was treated as confidential and was put together by prominent Christian Democratic economists and financial experts, clearly states in its recommendation that "the KDNP should announce officially that it protests the fact that Lajos Csepi has been named director of the AV Rt. [State Property Management Corporation] and attempts to merge the AVU [State Property Agency] with the AV Rt., and it should demand that the organizational system remain unchanged until the election. It should also protest the planned firing of personnel at the AV Rt. and, finally, carrying out any privatization that goes beyond what was originally planned." [passage omitted] The KDNP economic committee's announcement, which was expressed in 17 points, clearly states: "We can say unequivocally that the privatization question has been handled badly by the coalition and that this will be one of its greatest burdens in the election. This burden is made even greater by the personnel changes that have taken place recently: the firing of Szabolcs Szekeres and the naming of Lajos Csepi to take his place." [passage omitted] According the the Christian Democrats, a drive led by the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] lurks in the background of the government's move. [passage omitted] Analyzing the "activities" of Lajos Csepi, the Christian Democrats emphasize that he immediately set about making personnel changes that reflected his own taste; he started firing AV Rt. workers and merging the entire AV Rt. into the AVU. "In the last months of the coalition's power, therefore, all the state enterprise assets and the entire privatization process ended up in the hand of those who follow a liberal ideology and of the former system's apparatchiks. This situation is catastrophic from the points of view of the country's economy and future, as well as from the point of view of the coalition's election prospects." [passage omitted]
