During the interview, the Dalai Lama -- stressing a realistic line -- said that complete independence for Tibet has become quite impossible, and the future of Tibet lies in the federation of a Tibetan autonomous government with the PRC Government. It will be interesting to see how the Chinese government will react to the Dalai Lama's proposal for an autonomous Tibetan government and federation. The Dalai Lama stated, "The autonomous government delegates its powers in relation to foreign policy and defense to China." He disclosed that China has already been unofficially informed of this plan. He also indicated that officials of the Tibetan government in exile have been making behind-the-scenes contacts with the Chinese leadership, and certain developments can be expected in the near future. However, regarding the frequent anti-China demonstrations in the Tibet Autonomous Region presently under PRC rule, the Dalai Lama said this is "a reflection of serious violations of human rights." He urged Western nations to continue to pay serious attention to the violations of human rights occurring in Tibet. Furthermore, the Dalai Lama expressed serious concern about the environmental problem in Tibet, claiming that due to the Chinese government's program for rapid economic development in the Tibet Autonomous Region, there has been serious erosion of top soil, and large scale destruction of the natural environment. Linpoche [name as published], vice chairman of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, who was also present at the interview, criticized the PRC Government's deforestation. He said the total area of forest in Tibet, which was 220,000 square km in 1949, had diminished to 130,000 square km in 1985, and this continues to decrease. The Dalai Lama also strongly protested China's "cultural genocide," claiming Tibetan culture, which has a history of its own centering on Buddhism, is deteriorating gradually owing to the PRC Government's uniform school education in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
