FBIS4-52595 "dreas092_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Thailand Reports on U.S. Drug Probe on MP Thanong Continue Reports on U.S. Drug Probe on MP Thanong Continue Comment by Legal Experts BK1205065194 Bangkok THE NATION in English 12 May 94 pp A1, A4 BK1205065194 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Ophat Bunlom] [Text] The Thai government should honor its extradition treaty with the United States and send Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong Siriprichaphong to stand trial in that country where he is accused of having smuggled in 45 tones of marijuana between 1973 and 1987, according to a legal expert. Phanat Thatsaniyanon, a member of the government's mutual legal assistance committee which handles the legal aspects of extraditions, said the Thai government should comply with a request by a U.S. court to have Thanong extradited to answer to drug smuggling charges although under the Thai-U.S. treaty, the Thai government can use its discretion. "If the Thai government decides not to extradite Thanong to stand trial in the United States, it must be able to explain why. The Thai government cannot just cite 'national pride' for not honoring the treaty," Phanat said. "The international community has come a long way toward a borderless world, with increasing cooperation among countries, and Thailand should not hold back by stubbornly adhering to false national pride," he said. Phanat said the U.S. government had complied with requests by Thailand for the extradition of Thai citizens, including the case of So Thanawisut, who fled to the United States after being charged with masterminding a murder in Thailand several years ago. He said the U.S. government had consistently honored the extradition treaty because it attached great importance to bilateral cooperation in this area. Phanat said in a Thai-U.S. extradition treaty ratified some 60 years ago, Thailand had made it a point not to send its own citizens to stand trial in the United States under any circumstance because of national pride. The agreement has since been replaced by the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty of 1990, which allows the Thai government to use its discretion on a case-by-case basis. Under normal procedures, the U.S. government will send an extradition request to the Thai Foreign Ministry which in turn will pass it on to the Police Department. The Police Department will ask the Office of the Attorney General to seek a court order for the extradition if it decides that the request should be complied with. "The whole business depends on the Thai government. If the Thai government decides not to comply with the request, then there will be no extradition," Phanat said. Retired Supreme Court judge Sansoen Kraichitti, also a member of the mutual legal assistance committee, said a person extradited under the treaty would be punished only after standing trial in the other country and being found guilty of the alleged crime. Sansoen also said the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty did not make it compulsory for the Thai government to comply with all extradition requests made by the U.S. government. He said those charged with drug trafficking and extradited under the treaty must have allegedly committed the crime after 1991 because a provision in the Thai anti-drug law that allows alleged offenders to be tried in foreign courts was introduced in that year. Chaikasem Nitisiri, deputy special prosecutor in charge of international legal assistance on criminal matters, said Thailand's Office of the Attorney General had not received a formal request from U.S. law enforcement officials regarding Thanong's extradition. He ruled out the possibility of Thanong, a Chat Thai MP, being extradited to the United States while Parliament is in session. "Even if we received an extradition request now, we would not be able to send Khun Thanong to the U.S. at this time, while Parliament is in session," Chaikasem said. MPs have immunity from legal prosecution while Parliament is in session.
