The opposition, on the other hand, accuses the government of hindering an upturn through omissions and implementing inappropriate measures. That was the tenor of a five-hour debate in the Bundestag on economic policy and the government's action program for more growth and employment. The debate was heavily influenced by election campaigning. Despite skeptical statements from economic associations and institutes, Economics Minister Rexrodt stressed that the government expected the economy to grow by 1.5 percent this year. He pointed to the increasing number of orders from abroad and "an astounding level of demand in the construction sector." In view of the high level of unemployment, the economics minister appealed to the parties to collective agreements to display restraint in discussing their differences. A strike "is the last thing that we need now." The Social Democratic Party of Germany's [SPD] main speaker, Saarland's Minister-President Oskar Lafontaine, said that wage cuts and wage freezes were completely inappropriate in the current economic climate. The result would be a further reduction in consumption and higher unemployment. In addition, recipients of low incomes would find themselves in an even more difficult situation. Pensions will also have to be reduced next year. Lafontaine accused the government of failure. In view of the weakness of consumption and the low level of investment, the Federal Government should not have raised any excise taxes and it should support medium-sized business in particular. Instead of that, the government canceled the equity capital assistance fund in 1991, and now, shortly before the elections, it wants to reintroduce it. It has canceled further training for budding master craftsmen. By contrast, the SPD wants to reduce ancillary wage costs and do more for medium-sized business. Lafontaine, like SPD Bundestag Group economics spokesman Jens, called on the Bundesbank to further reduce interest rates despite the substantial increase in the money supply that was recently reported. Jens went on to say that a strike is indeed not desirable, but if it does come to that, then it is Rexrodt's fault, because he has completely aroused vain hopes. The deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, Faltlhauser, accused Lafontaine of playing "a dishonest game." Speaking in the Bundestag, he said that the minister-president of Saarland was only opposed to a wage freeze for election campaign reasons, while in negotiations on a public sector collective agreement, Saarland was supporting employers demands for a wage freeze. The CDU/CSU Group's economics spokesman, Haungs, was confident that several hundred thousand jobs would be created over the next few years. Companies have begun to enter new markets with new products. The Federal Government's action program, which Haungs described as optimistic, would aid the formation of companies and the creation of new jobs, including part-time jobs. The SPD, on the other hand, wants to waste billions. Haungs recalled the planned "Ecological Modernization" future investment program, under which the Social Democrats wanted to spend 10 billion German marks within 10 years. In addition, there would be additional subsidies for the steel industry, modernization loans, and assistance to promote exports. "What the SPD is planning is redistribution, not growth," concluded Haungs. Free Democratic Party [FDP] economics spokesman Count Lambsdorff took the same line and in addition attacked SPD chairman Scharping. Scharping is a "master at not having a clear political profile," who says one thing today and something different tomorrow. Thus, he promised coal subsidies in Dortmund and the abolition of the coal pfennig in Hannover in one weekend. "He is like master juggler Rastelli," said Lambsdorff: "We are longing to see how many more balls Mr. Scharping will produce." The SPD is promising every citizen his own assistance program. They extend from research and technology, through the restructuring of east German companies and reducing the burden on reinvested taxable profits, to a uniform child allowance. However, Lambsdorff also criticized the CDU/CSU. It makes one think that at its Hamburg convention, the CDU sacrificed the "social market economy" trade mark to the mood of the times. Referring to Chancellor Kohl, Lambsdorff said that whoever maintains that coal, agriculture, and shipbuilding "cannot be judged according to free market criteria and even speaks of future development in this context is very far away from Ludwig Erhard." He criticized CDU/CSU demands for nursing assistance insurance paid for by contributions from employers and employees, taxes on people without children as well an industry policy involving supervision, protectionism, and the formation of cartels through a technology council. Lambsdorff also rejected Haungs demand that the money currently used for coal subsidies should be used for the creation of new jobs. One should not set some kind of new subsidy carousel in motion. Despite his criticism, Lambsdorff said that the FDP would continue to support the CDU/CSU. While Alliance 90/Greens Deputy Schulz called the latest government annual economic report "a report produced by the blind, deaf, and dumb," the chairman of the Economics Committee, Ost (CDU), said he considered the government's assessment to be correct. Ost accused the SPD of "having misgivings" about everything that is new. He recalled the Social Democrats opposition to nuclear energy and the Transrapid train project. Ost and Jens then argued about the level of state debt. Ost praised the coalition for ensuring that the federal debt had only doubled since 1982, while when the SPD was in government, the level of federal debt increased -- albeit from a very low level -- five-fold.
