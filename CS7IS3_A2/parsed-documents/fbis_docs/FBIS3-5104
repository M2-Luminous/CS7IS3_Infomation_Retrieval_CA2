The premier delievered a major policy speech to the legislature "in a very mechanical way," LDP President Yohei Kono told reporters. He said he got the impression that the speech was "time-consuming but did not reveal what is important to us." Improvement of strained bilateral relations with the United States is the issue of most concern now, Kono said, accusing Hosokawa of treating it as though it were a trivial matter. The premier should have pointed in his Diet address to specific measures to jolt the nation out of the worst economic slump since World War II, he said. Kono, the first LDP chief in nearly 40 years to be opposition leader rather than prime minister, also complained that Hosokawa failed to explain the muddle over his abortive plan to reshuffle his seven-month-old cabinet. Hosokawa merely read a speech prepared by bureacrats without modifications, he added. Asked what he will focus on when he questions the premier in the Diet next week, Kono said he will raise the question of what achievement the Hosokawa administration has made in the past seven months. Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the LDP from power last August for the first time in 38 years.
