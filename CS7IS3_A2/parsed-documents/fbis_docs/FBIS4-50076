In the meeting, the Chinese president and the Malaysian prime minister said they were delighted at seeing each other again. Jiang Zemin said: "Your Excellency's second visit to China coincides with the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Malaysian diplomatic relations. Bilateral ties have gained overall expansion in the past two decades, with fruitful cooperation in the political, economic, science and technology, and cultural fields. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Malaysian peoples continues to expand, while vast potential exists for bilateral cooperation." He added: "Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote common prosperity of the two countries, but will also serve to enhance regional economic cooperation." The Chinese president said: "Your Excellency remarked during the visit to China last year that political stability is an important factor for economic development. This makes a lot of sense and we have good knowledge about that. China needs stability, and so does Asia and the world in general. This is a crucially important issue. Looking in retrospect at the political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989, if resolute measures were not taken then, China would not enjoy today's stability. A bad thing has been turned into a good thing, and as a result, our reform and opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better, and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller play." History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good. In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development, social stability, and the improved livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent efforts to take stability as an overriding priority. Facts prove this is absolutely correct. Jiang Zemin emphasized: Stability forms a prerequisite and reform serves as a driving force, while development represents the goal. The three factors interact to promote each other. The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has become a common understanding of all the Chinese people. The stability of China is not only needed for China's own development, but will also benefit the stability and prosperity of Asia and the world in general. That is because the stability of China, a big country with a close to 1.2 billion population, is of international significance. In the past decade and more, the stability and development of China has not only brought benefits to its own people, but contributed to world peace and development as well. On the regional situation, Jiang Zemin noted: The current situation in Asia is generally good, with relative political stability, sustained economic development, and constantly improving regional security. Further efforts to safeguard and promote regional peace and development reflect an issue that has won attention from leaders of Asian nations. He said: "We are ready to work with Malaysia and other Asian countries towards peace and development in Asia." Mahathir said: Since the visit to China last year, he has been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand trade with China. Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth of economic and trade ties with China. The Malaysian prime minister also told Jiang Zemin that during his meeting with U.S. President Clinton shortly before he came to China, he stressed his opposition to imposing one's own views upon others and to using the issue of Most-Favored-Nation trading status to exert pressure on China. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the meeting proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, assistant to the minister Wang Yinggan, and Malaysian Ambassador to China Adenan [name as received] were present at the meeting. After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of Mahathir and his party.
