Therefore, the three Baltic countries' joining the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program could not fail to affect Russia to some or other extent. This would all not be so bad had we been dealing with ensuring European (and hence world) security within the framework of CSCE structures, which already have been functioning rather successfully for almost two decades. When, however, certain forces promote the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with its well-known military might and quite well-defined interests as a guarantor of stability on the continent; when the Baltic countries themselves see their joining the "Partnership" program as a step in the direction of full integration into the NATO structures; when their aspirations find their realization in a complete distancing from Russia--this may not only have a negative effect on our political interests, but may also have an adverse effect on our economy. And indeed, large ports on the Baltic Sea, oil terminals, transit oil and gas pipelines, huge electrotechnical and transport-building production facilities, which in most instances were built through the efforts of both Russia and the former Union republics, may be placed overnight out of Russia's reach by a nod from a NATO "conductor." The evidence that this is not entirely contrived are the voices sounding even from the State Department of the largest NATO member--the United States. This is what the influential WASHINGTON POST recently wrote, quoting the revelation of an official of the aforementioned organization: "The fight in the economic sphere of Russia will be protracted and difficult. We are resolutely against a Russian sphere of influence; neither do Russia's neighbors want it." And keeping in mind that the Russian leadership has not yet made a decision on whether to participate in the "Partnership," it is easy to understand why Russia reacted with such keen sensitivity to the Baltic countries' joining this program. Political Euphoria and Real Difficulties Without doubt, for the purpose of realizing their "strategic goals," the Baltics states intend widely to use the potential of international organizations and alliances. That is why joining the "Partnership," seen in this context, did cause a certain surge of political euphoria among the leadership and radically minded population strata of these countries. Nevertheless, one can easily forecast that emotional elation will subside as soon as it encounters economic realities. First, participation in the program is a rather costly idea. If competent persons in the Baltics do not dare to provide even the most approximate figures, one may come up with an estimate on the example of Poland, for which its membership in the "Partnership for Peace" will cost $22 million annually. But this is, so to say, an "external" difficulty. There are also purely internal ones. The fact that the three republics of the region were for decades a part of the integrated economic system of the former Union; that their production ties had been locked onto partners in other republics (to a considerable extent in the Russian Federation); that their products had been designed for the all-Union market--these and other factors are unlikely to allow for a sufficiently rapid structural restructuring of industry in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in order to redirect it toward Western markets. (And this market, actually, is quite crowded to allow one to quickly find his "niche" in it.) Lithuania's example is indicative in this respect: According to the data of the Lithuanian department of statistics, last year Russia was the destination for 41 percent of its exports, and provided 75.1 percent of its imports. For comparison: Exports to the West accounted to 25.9 percent, and imports--12.7 percent. It is not accidental that the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow noted that "economic relations and trade involve mainly Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union." Another difficulty is the Baltic states' dependence on deliveries of fuels and energy from Russia and some CIS countries. In an attempt to overcome this "difficulty," the Baltic countries undertake various steps and are searching for alternative solutions. The most prominent example of this is the proposed construction of new export-import oil terminals in Lithuanian Butinga and Latvian Liepaja. Besides a purely economic factor (considerable financial expenditures on the actual construction in Butinga or deepening the navigating channel in Liepaja), there are political and ecological factors that may play a negative role. The point is that a terminal in Butinga, which will have better capabilities than the port of Liepaja to service high-tonnage tankers, has the prospect of becoming completely Lithuanian in the future and presenting serious competition to Liepaja. This must worry the Latvian side, while for Lithuania, according to specialists, "the issue of the terminal is the issue of the survival of its industry." Environmentalists also may take an active stand against the construction of a new terminal in Butinga (practically on the border with Latvia), who believe--and not without good reason--that in the event of any accident at the terminal, the Latvian natural environment will sustain serious damage. In short, there are more than enough problems. And anyway, it is very difficult to foresee all the difficulties arising along the thorny road of independence. It is much more important, in my opinion, to attempt to understand what Russia will lose in the event of such a decisive turn of the Baltics toward NATO and what needs to be done in order to.... ....Ensure the Russian Interests in the Region In the opinion, for instance, of specialists from the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Scientific Research Institute, keeping in mind the difficult financial situation, Russia will not be able to build new ports in the near future. In other words, we will be forced to seek some sort of compromise to ensure for ourselves a gate to the Baltic Sea. There also exist certain concerns in the matter of using oil pipelines. Russia already is paying considerable money for each tonne of Russian oil being exported through transit pipelines. It is easy to imagine how dearly a hypothetical increase in the cost of transit will cost Russia. The question of Kaliningrad Oblast--a "Russian enclave" surrounded at all sides by "abroad"--may flare up in a way painful for Russia. The ink was not dry yet on A. Brazauskas' signature under the agreement of Lithuania joining the "Partnership" when Lithuanian radicals, led by high-ranking members of parliament, began openly to demand seizing Kaliningrad Oblast from Russia and creating on its territory a new state integrated into the structures of Northern Europe. Of course, to avoid these and many other difficulties in relations with the Baltics, we should have thought of Russian interests considerably earlier. By now many political statements of the Russian leadership are seen, in particular by the press, as attempts to board a train that has already left the station. There is a certain amount of truth to it. Strictly speaking, however, the "train" has just "started off," and Russia still can make it there. In order to accomplish this, we probably should, while holding a firm political position with respect to vitally important interests of Russia in this region, to more actively use first and foremost economic levers. I do not mean threats to "turn off oil or gas faucets"--for this will only provide a short-term benefit but to a large extent deprive us of a prospect to develop normal relations between Russia and the Baltics. Normal economic relations, however, unrestricted development of business and trade not only on a state level but also on the level of concrete companies and individual producers, will enable us to ensure Russian interests in the Baltics. In the opinion of specialists from the Russian Federation Ministry of the Economy, the most realistic road is through more active involvement of Russia's business circles in the Baltics; striking root there by creating joint enterprises, buying blocks of stock of large enterprises--in short, using the broadest complex of measures with the aim of developing business and trade-economic ties with Russia. But this cannot be a one-way road. It is necessary to create a system of certain preferences for Baltic business as well. In this respect, the signing and the soonest possible ratification of already existing agreements--for instance, on most-favored trade status--would help a great deal. Most importantly, Russia needs a clear, centralized policy with respect to its next-door neighbors. People responsible for the conduct of foreign policy and entrepreneurs must walk hand in hand. This two lines should be brought together not in the ministerial sense, but on a much more broad political and practical scale.
