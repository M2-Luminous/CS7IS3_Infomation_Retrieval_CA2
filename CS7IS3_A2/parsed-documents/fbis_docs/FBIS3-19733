Correspondent Lazaros Mavros revealed this when he spoke for the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan at a news conference yesterday. Mavros added that the Greek security authorities have been notified regarding the issue. Party leaders or representatives attended the news conference organized by the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan to denounce Yeoryiadhis' horrible murder and condemn the crime. They also said that a parliamentary delegation would visit the UN secretary general to denounce the continuing genocide of the Kurdish people and Yeoryiadhis' murder. Dhimitrios Sillouris, secretary general of the DISI [Democratic Rally], said that with Yeoryiadhis' murder, the Turks were promoting their beliefs, which do not allow them to pursue the role of a peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia. He also mentioned that the state must improve its security structure, adding that the murder will constitute the beginning of a more intense struggle by those who deal with human rights. Stathis Kittis, secretary general of the DIKO [Democratic Party], stressed that Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder is undoubtedly the work of Turkish agents who showed in this way that the Turkish machine will stop at nothing. He added that this must concern those who deal with our national policy. Kittis said DIKO believes that we must all support everyone who fights for their freedom. In his short address, Andreas Khristou, AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] spokesman, described Yeoryiadhis as responsible, a fighter, and an ideologist. He added that Yeoryiadhis gave his life when nationalism is growing and said we must do much, as a people and as a parliament. Vasos Lissaridhis, EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] chairman, described the murder as a classic example of terrorism and an insult to dignity, freedom, and democracy. He said: Theofilos will go down in history as a man who realized the connection among people who share a common source of danger--the Turkish regime. Yado Roz, European Kurdistan Movement representative, called upon the international common view to resist and condemn the murders of Kurdish figures and the Turkish regime. Theofilos' murder and the murders of other members of Kurdish organizations worldwide clearly show that Turkey insists on taking its dirty war abroad. Lakis Pingouras, representing the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan, mentioned that the immediate goal is to try to get the Kurdish state recognized and to establish the committee's office here as the official voice of the Kurds in Cyprus.
