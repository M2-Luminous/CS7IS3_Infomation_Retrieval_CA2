This law adopted at the fourth session of the Sixth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK in April 1980, codifies the brilliant achievements made in the health care in the country and gives a theoretical systematization of the principles and requirements for developing it to a new, higher stage. This day is significantly commemorated as day of public health every year in the country. The DPRK enforced a free medical care system 40 odd years ago in the thick of the fatherland liberation war. This complete and universal free medical care system grants to all people equal medical benefits. All the costs in health care such as diagnosis, treatment, surgical operation, hospitalization and recuperation are free. In the DPRK where the advanced section doctor system is in force and preventive medicine is the key point, people are given enormous benefits through regular check-up, vaccination and other medical assistance. Modern people's hospitals have been built in cities and rural villages and at industrial establishments and maternity hospitals, dental preventive hospitals and other specialized medical care bases are available everywhere. Several dozen central pharmaceutical factories and thousands of local pharmaceutical factories in Sunchon, Nanam, Sinuiju and other parts of the country satisfactorily meet the demand for medicines. The state ensures that mineral water resources abundant in the country are used effectively for the promotion of the working people's health. Now hundreds of mineral springs are available in 150 odd areas. Public health workers have written many valuable scientific papers while engaging themselves in preventive and curative services, resulting in marked improvement of medical care. Thanks to the popular policy of the party and the state and devoted efforts of the health workers, the average life expectancy at birth of the population has reached 74.5 years. The number of the old folks above 90 is on the increase. Last year it was five times the 1980 figure.
