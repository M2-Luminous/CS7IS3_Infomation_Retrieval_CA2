FR940325-1-00021 FR940325-1-00007 23. Proposed §120.440 would set the requirements for testing and maintenance of security equipment. Unless security equipment is appropriately maintained, failure is likelier; unless it is periodically tested or checked, failure is likelier to go undetected for a long time. 24. Proposed §120.450 would require records of checks and maintenance of security equipment. Records are necessary for the Coast Guard to verify that equipment is being cared for properly. 25. Proposed §128.100 would limit the applicability of the rules for passenger terminals. Only those waterfront facilities that serve passenger vessels subject to part 120 need satisfy these requirements. 26. Proposed §§128.110 through 128.430 are analogous to proposed §§120.110 through 120.430 because the subjects are analogous. Section 128.210 excludes the boarding area for passengers from the requirement of an intrusion detection system because the extent of the typical area makes such a system impracticable. Signs for restricted areas on passenger terminals are only required in English. Comments are sought on the need to require signs in other languages for restricted areas on U.S. passenger terminals. 27. Proposed §128.435 would specify security barriers. The ease of access to passenger terminals from surrounding areas makes barriers necessary to deter unauthorized entry into terminals. General practices from industry helped form the standards for the construction of security fences and walls. 28. Proposed §§128.440 through 128.450 are analogous to proposed §§120.440 through 120.450 because the subjects are analogous. Incorporation by Reference The following material would be incorporated by reference: ASTM F792&hyph;82, Design and Use of Ionizing Radiation Equipment for the Detection of Items Prohibited in Controlled Access Areas, 1982. Copies of the material are available for inspection where indicated under ADDRESSES . Copies of the material are available at the addresses in §§120.120 and 128.120. Before publishing final rules, the Coast Guard will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for approval of the incorporation by reference. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not major under Executive Order 12291 but is considered significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)] because it is a high priority project within the Coast Guard and involves important Departmental policy. A draft Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . The Coast Guard anticipates that approximately 100 passenger vessels and 53 passenger terminals would be affected. Of the passenger vessels, approximately 97 are cruise vessels carrying in excess of 100 passengers operating out of U.S. ports. All of the terminals service these cruise vessels. There may be up to 40 vessels and 20 terminals that would be subject to these rules only on an occasional basis. Initial implementing costs are estimated to be $14 million, of which approximately $12 million would be for security equipment. Annual operating costs are estimated to be $10 million. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ], the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under §3 of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 632]. This rulemaking could have more than a minimal impact on a few small entities, but most passenger vessels making voyages on the high seas of 24 hours or more, and most terminals associated with them, are neither owned nor operated by small entities. Security requirements for small vessels and terminals will be less complex and less expensive to implement than for large vessels and terminals. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect your business.
