It Must Be Reinforced by the Legislative Capabilities of the Components of the Russian Federation"] [Text] Point of View Russian federalism represents a rather motley and in many places a still poorly painted picture that is too early to remove from the easel to show at prestigious exhibitions. We are fully in agreement with statements (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 5 March 1994) about the three pillars that will enable a new Russia to sail out of the current political and economic storm: a socially oriented market economy, local self-government, and federalism, but we cannot fail to note that such statements are still not being reinforced by real assistance to the regions in the sphere of an independent legal structure. The last is exactly the most fundamental question of a real and not feigned attitude toward the rights of the regions. In accordance with the new Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal state property and its management, the establishment of legal principles of a single market, the federal banks, and civic legislation fall within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation (Article 71). Administrative, labor, family, housing, land, water, and forestry legislation, and legislation on mineral resources, on the legal profession, and on the notary system are within the joint jurisdiction of the Federation and its components (Article 72). Components of the Federation possess absolute state authority (Article 73) outside the bounds of jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and the powers of the Russian Federation on subjects of joint jurisdiction. It is apparent from the aforementioned that the Constitution leaves to the components of the Federation extensive opportunities to legislate in the sphere of commercial legal relations that were previously regulated by the officially recognized branch of economic law, and also by branches of entrepreneurial and trade law that were previously unknown to the socialist legal system; moreover, all of them relate to the competence of the regions. The treaty between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan showed that a whole series of powers relating to the exclusive or joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, but specifically questions of ownership, the use and disposition of lands, mineral resources, forests and other natural resources, state enterprises, other personal property and real estate, the legal profession, the notary system, the legal regulation of administrative, family and housing relations, wildlife management, and others--all of these are transferred to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Tatarstan. It is superfluous to mention that the right to legislate independently in the aforementioned sphere of competence of components of the Federation is extremely important for those regions that are endeavoring to create a legal regime that is favorable for domestic and foreign investors and to ensure the acceleration of their movement to a civilized market with the help of modern methods of legal regulation. The need for the regions to legislate legal relations assigned to them by the Constitution in the sphere of property is especially important against the background of the weak activity of the center in the sphere of economic legislation. Up to the present time, basic laws on joint-stock companies and associations, securities, trade turnover, and rent have not been passed yet. A full draft of the Civil Code has not been submitted to date, and there are only unfounded rumors about work on the Trade Code. The federal laws in force in the sphere of property relations are weakly developed, or outdated and contain numerous unclear points and contradictions. Under such conditions, federalism throughout the world ensures filling in the gaps with the help of legislation of the components of the Federation. As practical jurists, we especially note the need for energetic law-drafting work at the regional level. At the same time, we must note with alarm that an attempt is being made to subject the constitutional rights of the components of the Federation to revision with the adoption of other federal legislation. Thus, in Articles 2 and 3 of the widely advertised draft of the general part of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the concepts of "civil law" and "civil legislation" are used in such a broad sense that the possibility is legally and actually closed to the components of the Federation to legislate in the economic sphere even within the framework of its constitutional competence. Similar claims are confirmed by statements of the developers of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code that the sphere of action of civil law has been substantially broadened, absorbing, for example, land legal relations that now, they say, can be regulated only by the Civil Code and federal laws. These authors of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code categorically deny the republics that are in the Russian Federation structure the right to adopt such complex normative acts like codes, declaring this to be an "obvious unconstitutionality and elementary ignorance." If it were a question of a purely academic discussion, we who are responsible for practical questions of the application of the law would simply not have the time to take part in it. But here we run into a different situation. After all, a Forest Code was adopted in Altay, a Trade Turnover Code in Kalmykia, and intensive work is proceeding in other regions on the development of their own legal bases. Therefore, we would perceive an obvious unconstitutionality and elementary indiscretion in statements like those cited above, but we are faced with more practical tasks. Therefore, we would like to advise the authors of the draft Civil Code to submit it as a matter of priority to the legal community in its entirety; that is, not just the general but also the special part, so that the quality of the work will be more evident to everyone, and also to include in the draft Civil Code appropriate limitations on the sphere of the civil legislation defined by the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the federal treaty between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan as a precedent for similar treaties with other components of the Federation. If this is not done, the Federal Assembly will have to carefully examine with a similar independent effort the review of a still delicate balance of constitutional mutual relations between the center and the regions in the sphere of legislation. The heads of regions and their legislative organs should also pay attention to the unfolding situation. It is simply difficult for us, for example, to imagine what a young progressive lawyer could do in the post of president of Chuvashia on the advice of a well-known progressive economist in that limited leeway that is outlined for the components of the Federation in the draft of the general part of the Civil Code. Everyone in the regions is ready to act within the framework of the general rules of a single market, but they are not ready, and will never be ready, for petty regulating from Moscow of our very different conditions of economic life.
