On 12 November the presidents of the Lander of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bade Wurtemberg met in Munich with Edzard Reuter, president of the Daimler Benz group, and Jurgen Schrempp, president of Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], to plead for abandonment or at least postponement of DASA's restructuring plan, which is designed to restore the company to financial health by 1995, in part by eliminating 16,000 jobs and closing six factories. After four hours of debate, the DASA executives convinced them that the plan, which will lower the group's overhead by 1.5 billion German marks [DM] per year, is unavoidable and represents the minimum downsizing needed to save the enterprise. Edmund Schoiber (CSU), president of Bavaria, where the Neuaubing plant will have to be closed -- and who offered to reject the purchase of 8.58 percent of DASA stock held by the Land of Bavaria -- was told by the DASA executives that financing is not the problem: They have to resolve an overhead problem whose solution lies outside the political domain. Gerhard Schroder (SPD), president of Lower Saxony, opined that state intervention is justified when necessary to save the jobs of highly skilled workers. He went so far as to propose taking over the Lemwerder plant from DASA. He is going to urge the SPD and the IG Metall syndicate to reconsider their opposition to the Eurofighter program. Jurgen Schrempp said in essence that if the program is dropped he will have to eliminate 11,000 more jobs and close nine factories, perhaps as many as 14. He added that Germany is going to have to decide whether it wants an aerospace industry. Without subventions for research and exports comparable to those provided by the United States and Japan to their aerospace industries, the German industry will founder. Schrempp asked the Lander presidents to lobby the political parties to get Bonn to prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the aerospace sector. Gerhard Schroder promised to lobby for the disbursement of an additional DM300-400 million for civil aeronautics construction. Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, for his part promised to review German aerospace policy, and in particular to study how the industry could be given indirect assistance and how the reduction in space program appropriations might be suspended. DASA employees are very militant, especially at the Lemwerder plant, which according to DASA executives is losing DM35 million per year. But Hans-Joachim Beckmann, spokesman for the plant council, said that closing it will cost DM168 million (transferral to Hamburg and Manching of plant equipment needed for the alteration of Transall and Airbus aircraft). Employees say DASA management may have decided to close the plant in the hope of obtaining state aid. But workers also seem to have realized that disorderly agitation of the kind seen in recent weeks does not advance their cause; henceforth, they say, they will act resolutely but with cooler heads.
