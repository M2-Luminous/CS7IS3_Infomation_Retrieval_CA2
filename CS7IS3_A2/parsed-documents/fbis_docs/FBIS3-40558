According to informed sources, the Central Asian countries have formed a policy of control for issuing visas to foreigners. This policy has several aspects. Some of these steps were taken to prevent the Central Asian republics from influence of foreign political ideologies and political instability. In addition, because of fear of the spread of epidemics such as cholera, the visas are being issued following strict criteria. The sources revealed that because of the strict rules about issuing visas, the number of tourists visiting Central Asian republics has decreased significantly. The number of passengers on the two weekly PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] flights from Islamabad has decreased considerably. PIA sources have expressed concerns that if Uzbekistan does not adopt liberal policies for issuing visas, then there is the possibility of reduction of the present two flights to one flight a week. The sources said that at present, PIA officials are trying to get support for issuing visas to Tashkent for their passengers, so that Islamabad-Tashkent traffic is maintained. The sources revealed that PIA is starting a new route from Islamabad to Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan's capital, via Tashkent on 20 November. The necessary arrangements are being made.
