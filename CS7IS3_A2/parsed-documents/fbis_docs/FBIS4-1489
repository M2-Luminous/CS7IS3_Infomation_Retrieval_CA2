I would like to start out not by dealing with the specific issue of the extension of voting time for certain areas, I will come to that. But I would firstly like to thank all the voters who have already voted, all those who have taken the rough with the smooth which went with this election, those who stood patiently in long queues, those who in some instances went away because of a failure in the system at certain points, and then came back again. Thank you for your support, for my party, to all those who voted for me, and to those who voted for other parties, thank you for your participation. South Africa needs an election which is legitimate. South Africa needs an election which gives a result which will prove that the Government of National Unity which will come into being as a result of that election will be a government representing the overwhelming majority of all South Africans. This election is an historic occasion, maybe the most important ever in our history now and in the future. We are launching our country into a new era. We must ensure that it succeeds. It is this consideration which motivated the government to in principle acceed to the request of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] that in certain areas the opportunity to vote be extended for another day. I would like to say that the Independent Electoral Commission, on information available that in some parts of our country there are places where people haven't been able to vote as yet, and in other parts of our country, the same areas, the opportunity has only been opened really because of the delivery of ballot papers at a very, very late stage. It is, on the basis of their information, that they recommended that in the following areas there will tomorrow also be the opportunity for voters to vote. In the northern Transvaal it will be Venda, Gazankulu and Lebowa. In the eastern province it will be Ciskei and Transkei, and in Natal/KwaZulu it will be the area hitherto under administration of the KwaZulu government known as KwaZulu. In some instances the information of the National Party is somewhat in conflict with the finding of the IEC, that they cannot at this point in time take a decision if we were to close the voting tonight, that the election in those parts will be free and fair. However, the law gives the authority to the IEC to make that finding and we are committed to have a result which will be and can be declared free and fair. We accept therefore their authority in this regard, their finding, and we will cooperate as a party to ensure that also in these areas which I have mentioned, the further opportunity to voters will be given. There are, however, two provisos which have been agreed upon which are important provisos. Firstly, international monitors which monitored in the rest of the country where the election will come to an end tonight, will be added to the monitoring teams throughout these six areas, and therefore, the level of monitoring will be substantially increased and there will be more objective monitoring. Secondly, we have insisted and it has been agreed, that all the votes cast tomorrow will and should be kept separate so that in the event of disputes arising it will not become integrated with the votes cast during the actual period of the election which was envisaged right from the beginning. In the event of disputes, therefore, there will be the possibility to evaluate what happens tomorrow in these areas on a proper and a scientific basis. I would also like to dispel a rumor which I hear is still going about and that is that there will be another public holiday tomorrow. [laughter] I, with great reluctance, because I knew of the disruption it would have because of the short notice, acceded to the request of the IEC to declare today a public holiday. The President's Council, a few years back, already calculated that a public holiday costs the country 400 million rand. We need to get back to work as a nation. We cannot lose another day of productivity. We need to create new wealth to address the problems of our people and we cannot pour 400 million, or whatever, if you take inflation into account since that calculation was made, down the drain, and therefore, tomorrow will be a working day. I haven't received any formal request with regard to it being declared a public holiday, and I want to be very firm, I'm not prepared to consider -- should I receive such a request, a declaration of tomorrow as a public holiday. I know that this decision, that the election doesn't fully come to an end at the prescribed time, will come as a shock to many. I know it is coming as a shock to the organizers and the workers of many, many parties which have geared themselves, which have planned all their programs on the basis that the election would end tonight. I would like to call upon them to accept this, to be calm, because what is of the greatest importance is that in the final analysis we must be able to say that all South Africans who wished to vote and who were prepared to take trouble to vote, were given the opportunity to vote. If we don't achieve that, the election result will right from the beginning be in total jeopardy. The election result will not be the beginning of real reconciliation. It will be the beginning of conflict and strife. However, the National Party is deeply concerned. In many cases we have received substantiated complaints of malpractices, of irregularities inside specifically many polling booths, of the polling boxes not being sealed off properly when they are full, of ink not being applied properly, on voter's assistance being rendered not on an impartial basis, but almost in an intimidatory, in a way in which it amounted to intimidation, or to partisanship. We have lodged a number of complaints. All the complaints that we have received at our head office. And I have just spoken to Judge Kriegler on the telephone and he assured me that where complaints have been lodged with regard to irregularities at specific polling booths, the votes at those polling booths will be kept separate, also during the process of balancing all the ballot papers until a decision has been taken whether the complaints are justified or not. This must be done because the IEC has the authority to declare where irregularities occurred of a serious nature at a particular polling booth, to make a decision that that polling booth's votes won't be part of the final result. That was inserted in the original legislation to ensure that the whole electoral process, which has gone so well in most of the places, won't be put in jeopardy because of irregularities just at, relatively speaking, a few places. And I have the assurance that this procedure will be applied so that where complaints have been lodged, the IEC will be in a position to exercise its right in that regard, and so that those who made themselves guilty of irregularities will be punished. There were also the other negative aspects of administrative failure, of logistic problems. We even heard of, at lower levels, IEC appointed representatives showing clear bias. That is part of the complaints that we received. But the National Party is not approaching this in a negative sense. Let's deal with those negative aspects within the framework of the law. The law provides for certain procedures, we will follow the procedures, but we want the election to succeed. We want the overall legitimacy of the election to be established, and we have constantly, in the days before the election, during the election, and we will do the same tomorrow, we have constantly taken a stand of being cooperative, of being constructive in ensuring that the election succeeds, and that we remain committed to it. That is what South Africa now needs, and I call upon all South Africans who feel somewhat disillusioned, because what they believed to be, or what in actual fact is irregularities which occurred here and there, to not withstanding also support me in this stance. We've got to make this election work for all the people. If we don't get a 100 percent perfect election, let us strive to achieve a 95 percent one, and let us live with it, because South Africa needs this election to bring us to the point where we can start working together in a Government of National Unity in the best interest of all the people. Already the election itself has brought a few very positive trends to the fore. Violence has abated. We almost had no violence. We had, outside polling booths, no overt intimidation, whatsoever. I've been to many polling stations, and everywhere there was an atmosphere so much different from the atmosphere even a week before, when rallies were still broken up by opposing parties, when there was a lot of intimidation, a lot of aggression. It is almost as if, at all the places I've been, the election breathed an air of reconciliation and that is what the country needs. Now, everybody had the right and will continue to have the right to participate in a full multiparty democracy. Nobody is denied that right in any way whatsoever, and on that basis, on that basis that there is no longer a basis for continued conflict, for continued tension, for keeping alive old hatreds and old conflicts -- let us unite as a nation, irrespective of our political differences, around this new transitional constitution which holds so much security for the individual, which offers full participation, which is a balanced constitution. Let us make it work for our people, for our youth, and for future generations. Thank you very much. [Unidentified official] Thank you Mr. President. We would also like to recognize Mrs. Marike de Klerk here tonight. Welcome here. Questions, ladies and gentlemen. Questions? Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT. Can you just use the microphone please? [Rijnaardt] Many fingers are pointing at the Independent Electoral Commission, over the handling of the election thus far. What is your comment as party leader? [De Klerk] I am very critical on many aspects. I think we must differentiate between the commission itself, and how some of their decisions were carried out. I think the commission itself also took certain decisions which they could have handled differently. I think they could have depended more on the good experience in the Department of Home affairs. I think too many inexperienced people were placed in positions where they had to make decisions without guidance. I have a lot of criticism for that, but I sympathize also with these people. I think that the lessons we have learned, now that the legitimacy of the system has been taken out of the arena and is no more in dispute, that we take the tasks which should be undertaken by a government, to be handled by a government. Independent agents do not have the foundation, the ability, or the experience, and have a tendency to neglect certain things. Another example, and I say this without aggression, if we look at independent agencies, is the new tendency at the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. I am deeply concerned where a public broadcaster, a public broadcaster actually has ... the chief source of income is through license fees and where there is a political dispute almost, or a political struggle, concerning the political role of the SABC -- in which there is so lightly veered away from constitutional principles as it were, in respect of, for example, languages. I am concerned and I think we should guard against situations where people who are not fully accountable, receive too much public power, if I can put it that way, which makes an impact on the entire public. [Official] Second question, yes sir? [Unidentified correspondent] Won't you [words indistinct] president if the ANC [words indistinct] first part of the election and National Party the second [words indistinct] accept the position of second vice president of your country? [De Klerk] Well, I'm perfectly willing, and I've said it so regularly. It is a constitution which I worked for, and I'm perfectly willing to accept a free and fair election result and accept whatever position that election result places me in. If it is to be president, yes. If it is to be executive deputy president, yes. [Official] A third question at the back there? [Correspondent Francis Ndlonga] Yes, Mr. President, I'm sorry, I'm just [words indistinct]. My name is Francis Ndlonga from REUTERS News Agency. I just wanted to check with you whether you have given the approval for extension by one day of voting in the former homelands? [De Klerk] I've been consulted but the legislation yet has to be submitted to me, because we have to change the law by proclamation. The legislation I'm still awaiting, the principle I have accepted with regard to the specific former homelands that I've mentioned. It does not include all the former homelands, because in others it went better. It is interesting, if you analyze, that it is in the homelands where we have the biggest breakdown of their civil service in the past month and two, that the problem now is the greatest. But in principle I have said yes, and I will approve the legislation if I'm happy with the way in which it is formulated. If I'm not happy I will go back and we will talk about how it should be formulated. But you can accept the fact that there will be voting in those six areas tomorrow as a fact. [Official] The next question finishes the [words indistinct]. [Correspondent Michael Penbritten] Now that the election is virtually over, two questions: One, do you feel a sense of relief at passing the baton to another politician; two, how well has the National Party done, do you think? [De Klerk] I think I must answer the last question first. Passing the baton for the National Party would mean that we have, we would have to get less than five percent of the vote, if you start from that end, which means that we would just be a party in parliament without representation in the government of national unity. I'm definitely sure we won't get less than five percent. To have our leader serve as executive deputy president, I'm absolutely sure that also that will not be the case. We will either be the biggest party or the second biggest party.
