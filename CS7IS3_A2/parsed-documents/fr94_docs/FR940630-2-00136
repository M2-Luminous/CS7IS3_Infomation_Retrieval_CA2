A multiemployer plan amendment adopting alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC in response to a plan sponsor's request. The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request and solicit public comment on this collection of information. ADDRESSES: All written comments (at least three copies) should be addressed to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0040), Washington, DC 20503.

(These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ). Part 2647 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2647), Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, implements the requirements of ERISA section 4207 (29 U.S.C. 1387). Since April 1, 1994, Part 2647 has included, in §2647.9, a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability ( i.e., rules for abatement under conditions other than those specified in §§2647.4 and 2647.8 (c) and (d)) (59 FR 9926, March 2, 1994). Under §2647.9, Plan rules for abatement, a plan amendment adopting such alternative rules (and any subsequent modification thereof) may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC in response to a request by the plan sponsor. Paragraph (d) of §2647.9 requires the submission of information that the PBGC needs to identify a plan and to determine whether to approve the amendment. (The PBGC will approve an amendment if it determines that the rules rules therein are consistent with the purposes of ERISA (paragraph (f)).) The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of the collection of information (OMB control number 1212&hyph;0044; expires September 30, 1994) for another three years. The agency estimates that it will receive not more than 10 requests annually and that each request will take about 1/4 hour to prepare, for a total annual burden of not more than 21/2 hours. Issued in Washington, DC this 27th day of June 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
