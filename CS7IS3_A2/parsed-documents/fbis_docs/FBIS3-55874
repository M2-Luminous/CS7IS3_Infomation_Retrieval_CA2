Minasov, Ye. Skukin, and ITAR-TASS under the general heading "We Wish You Success, Russian Parliament!"] [Excerpts] Following his address at the opening of the Federation Council's first sitting, Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin proposed that, until a chamber chairman is elected, the "reins" be handed over to the oldest deputy. This proved to be Peasants Party Chairman Yuriy Chernichenko, elected from Moscow City District. The chamber members voted that he take the chairman's seat. In his turn, Yuriy Chernichenko proposed an expansion of the structure of elders and invited Yuriy Matochkin and Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov, heads of administration of Kaliningrad and Sakhalin Oblasts, respectively, to take their seats behind the presidium table, "thus encompassing all of Russia, from coast to coast." Having elected, in accordance with the agenda, the sitting's first working organ, the deputies heard a report from Nikolay Ryabov, chairman of the Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission. Having emphasized that "the elections to the Federal Assembly were for the first time ever free from ideological fetters," he briefed deputies on the course of the election campaign which "disproved the prevailing opinion about the Russians' passiveness and lack of interest in politics." The Central Electoral Commission chairman presented a statistical sketch of the composition of the corps of deputies. It includes people of 29 nationalities, 76 percent of whom are Russians. The age of one-half of the chamber's members ranges between 25 and 50 years. There is a total of nine women. All have higher education, except two whose higher education has not been completed. Some 80 percent of deputies have described themselves as nonparty members. More than 50 percent are representatives of organs of executive power. The new chamber contains 49 former Russian Federation people's deputies. A Credentials Commission was elected to verify the deputies' mandates. Our new parliament resembles a large ship, only just launched from the stocks to face the gales and storms. The next few days will tell whether its cruise will be propitious and successful, whether it will manage to safely navigate the reefs and shoals. For the time being, however, everything appeared more than propitious on the surface at the first sitting of the State Duma, which was held at the former City Hall building on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment yesterday, 11 January: Deputies wore generous smiles and warmly greeted one another. Even though it is an open secret that the seeds of confrontation were already sown long before the start of the State Duma's work, especially as regards the distribution of leadership positions in the lower chamber and its committees, as well as its standing orders. God grant that these seeds do not produce luxuriant and poisonous shoots! After all, what we need is not a shooting and maliciously growling parliament, but a lawmaking and sensible one. Will the State Duma, disbanded on four occasions in the course of its history, this time manage to at long last adapt to conditions in the Russian political field? We addressed this question to Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's Choice): "The Duma will survive because, in accordance with the new Constitution, its functions and powers are clearly defined. It has two powerful levers to influence the executive branch: lawmaking and the budget." Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, deputy chairman of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]: "We will be a constructive force. Our party is in opposition to the government, but we intend to become a constructive opposition. We intend to act autonomously, without joining any blocs." Vasiliy Lipitskiy (independent): "There are grounds to assume that the State Duma will survive. There will be a problem as regards the way relations will develop between lawmakers, the president, and the executive branch. I would very much like to see them being proper from the very first day." Let us look around us in the few minutes remaining until the opening of the first sitting. As always, the journalistic fraternity's attention is focused on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. He is surrounded by a solid crowd of photographers, television reporters, and correspondents with their tape recorders, making it impossible to get close to him. One of our colleagues sadly remarked: "We are creating his own image." LDPR member Georgiy Lukava opened the sitting on behalf of the State Duma elders. He congratulated the deputies on the start of their work and expressed the hope that it will be fruitful and coordinated. Georgiy Lukava then gave the floor to Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage omitted covered by referent item] Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, delivered a report on the results of the December elections to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on the Constitution. He announced that 439 deputies of the 444 elected to the State Duma have been registered as present. Let us return to the topic raised earlier in this reportage. Despite the diversity of political views, most deputies assume that the State Duma will actually prove capable of functioning. This is what the well-known economist Pavel Bunich said: "I think that the technological market laws, which are most important for the country, will 'gallop through,' as the saying goes. The ideal and, in my view, attainable result in politics is to achieve neutrality." Independent Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, field ataman of Labinskiy Cossack Okrug, also advocates consolidation: "The main point is to change course from the destructive tendencies in reform implementation to constructive politics. We cossacks uphold the Russian people's interests and support firm presidential rule. We would like to work the land, not to fight as Zhirinovskiy would have it. "We have spent so long fighting, that it is time to start rebuilding that which has been destroyed." The agenda of the first sittings includes questions concerning the ratification of the provisions of the State Duma's Standing Orders on factions and deputies' groups and the formation of factions and deputies' groups, the election of State Duma chairman and deputy chairmen, the formation of committees and the election of their leaders, the adoption of the State Duma Standing Orders, and the ratification of the list of urgent questions for the State Duma's first session. The evening sitting was adjourned indefinitely due to the chairman's total incapacity and incompetence. Deputies proposed that Chairman Georgiy Lukava be replaced and that the future chairmanship of sittings be assigned to the State Duma Secretariat.
