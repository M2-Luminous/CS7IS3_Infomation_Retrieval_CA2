The comparative design concentration based on cup burner values is approximately 8.8%. Users must observe the limitations on PFC acceptability by making reasonable efforts to undertake the following measures: (i) conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use; Documentation of such measures must be available for review upon request. The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have high GWPs and long atmospheric lifetimes. Actual contributions to global warming depend upon the quantities of PFCs emitted. For additional guidance regarding applications in which PFCs may be appropriate, users should consult the description of potential uses which is included in the March 18, 1994 Final Rulemaking (58 FR 13043). ‚ê£ Sulfurhexafluoride (SF 6 ) Proposed acceptable as a discharge test agent in military uses only This agent has an atmospheric lifetime greater than 1,000 years, with an estimated 100-year, 500-year, and 1,000-year GWP of 16,100, 26,110, and 32,803 respectively. Users should limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements. This agent is only used to test new Halon 1301 systems.
