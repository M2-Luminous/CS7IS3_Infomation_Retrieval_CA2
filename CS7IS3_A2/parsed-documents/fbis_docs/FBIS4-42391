Turjan mentioned electronics as a possible field of cooperation, which would facilitate communication and the adjustment of Hungarian military technology to NATO standards. The deputy state secretary signed a new complementary agreement on a list of German military equipment to be delivered to Hungary by late September from the arsenal of the former East German Army. This year Germany will deliver 400 wagonloads of components, worth 150 million German marks, to Hungary -- free of charge. Germany handed over the same amount to Hungary last year. In February of this year, Budapest and Bonn signed an agreement on the delivery of German parts for Hungarian combat helicopters.
