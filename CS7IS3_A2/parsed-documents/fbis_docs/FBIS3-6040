On the course of Japan's economy, 19 percent forecast a recovery in six months, up from 15 percent, while 9 percent expect it to worsen, a change from the previous 24 percent. Of those polled, 95 percent replied their business conditions will not recover until the second half of 1994, while 98 percent said the domestic economy will not pick up until after the second half. The survey found 17 percent optimistic about the likelihood of a rise in shipments in the coming six months, up from 14 percent in the previous poll.

Of 98 firms polled, 59 percent cited the Japanese currency's appreciation against the dollar as a factor eroding their earnings. The yen surged by a combined 6 yen-plus to the dollar on February 14 and 15, when the survey was conducted.
