In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to certain member states. The Minister said the types of assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and medical aid. While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it would inevitably become involved in such operations in future crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia. "That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have expert negotiators in our country who could very well be deployed to assist in negotiations." Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. "Unita [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could produce an unfortunate result ...that would be counter-productive." On the question of changing the nature and title of the Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline states would be structured to deal primarily with regional co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the grouping should still be confined to southern African countries, it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and Lesotho. He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government on membership of or relations with the existing regional economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the Southern African Development Community and the Preferential Tariff Agreement grouping. Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa inevitably dominating its neighbours. "There must be relations of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to have relations based on trust, on total friendship." Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his previous Moroccan visit.
