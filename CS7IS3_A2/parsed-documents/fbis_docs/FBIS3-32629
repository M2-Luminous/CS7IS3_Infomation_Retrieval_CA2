A U.S. State Department spokesperson, who spoke with EFE on the condition that he remain anonymous, said that between 50 and 75 Cubans tried to reach the U.S. Interests Section, but were turned back by Cuban policemen who cordoned off the area. "In the past few days a false rumor has been spread in Havana. The people have been told that the United States will issue visas to anyone who requests it without checking on the person's qualifications," the spokesperson said to explain the sudden rush. The spokesperson did not wish to comment on the way the Cuban security forces kept back the group that wanted to reach the U.S. Interests Section. "The office will resume its normal operations on Monday, but the United States wishes to make it clear that it has not changed its policy regarding the issuance of visas to Cubans who wish to leave the island," the spokesperson stressed. The Cuban-U.S. National Foundation, the largest organization of Cuban exiles in the United States, has told EFE that the security forces "immediately" detained the Cubans who went to the U.S. Interests Section. The organization added that according to reports received from Havana, following the incident, as well as throughout the night, several shots were heard in the Vedado neighborhood and that the Cuban police have been arresting people throughout the city. The organization added that "people in Miami who are listening to the radio confirm that Cuban State Security has been placed on alert while confrontations are being reported in at least three areas of the city." The areas where confrontations are being reported are: seashore drive [Malecon] and L Street, between 17 and L Streets, and between El Cerro Road and Primelles. "Likewise, our sources have confirmed that the special forces have been ordered to stop and check all vehicles in the city in search of weapons and explosives, as well as to protect tourists." The foundation condemned "the brutal acts of violence and arbitrary arrests by Castro's security forces against the Cuban people. [passage omitted]
