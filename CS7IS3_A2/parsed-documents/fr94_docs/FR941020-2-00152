FR941020-2-00152 FR941020-2-00086 Federal Aviation Administration Notice That Applications for Registration Containing Only a Post Office Box or Mail Drop Will no Longer be Accepted AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice_Aircraft Registration Applications, AC Form 8050&hyph;1. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharon Ashford, Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Registration Branch, AVN&hyph;450, Post Office Box 25504, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125, Telephone: 405&hyph;954&hyph;3284. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Incident to the Federal Aviation Drug Enforcement Assistance Act, Section 501(h) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 App. U.S.C. 1301, et seq.) directs the Administrator to address certain deficiencies in the aircraft registration system relating to fictitious addresses. Subsection 3 of ยง501(h) determines that the use of a post office box or ``mail drop'' as a return address is a deficiency in the system. Accordingly, the Administrator will address this deficiency by no longer accepting Aircraft Registration Applications, AC Form 8050&hyph;1, unless a physical location or physical address is shown in the address portion of the Application. This does not preclude listing a post office box or mail drop as a secondary address for mailing purposes. In the alternative, if the applicant receives mail at a post office box or ``mail drop,'' the physical location or physical address may be shown directly underneath the name of the applicant (above the required telephone number) and the post office box or ``mail drop'' shown in the address portion of the Application. Requests to furnish a physical location or physical address will be mailed to all current registered owners of aircraft whose Certificates of Registration bear only a post office box or ``mail drop'' address. Geoffrey W. McLellen, Manager, Civil Aviation Registry. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25898 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
