Yi told the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee the government will convey such position at Seoul-Washington working-level meetings to be held in the U.S. capital soon in preparation for a third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea. Yi said, "substituting the armistice agreement with a peace accord cannot be an issue to be discussed between the United States and North Korea, and this point will be reiterated to the U.S. Government by Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, who is currently visiting Washington." Yi, also the national unification minister, made the remarks while replying to lawmakers' questions on the possibility that North Korea may demand a peace accord. The South Korean Government has devised its policy based on an analysis of North Korea's strategy in demanding a U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea. Government officials said the issue of a peace accord should be addressed by the South and North Koreans in accordance with the basic South-North agreement signed in 1992. Until that time, the present armistice accord should be strictly observed, they stressed.
