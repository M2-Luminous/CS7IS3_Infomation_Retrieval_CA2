Suddenly the earth began to tremble. The inhabitants panicked. There was a landslide. The toll was 13 dead, 60 injured. A little over a month after the catastrophe, confusion still reigns.... More than a hundred families are living in tents virtually in the shadow of the cave-in site. "Several years ago a wadi used to run through here," one young inhabitant told us. Those who lost their homes were the hardest hit by the January rains. Flood waters almost carried away the tents--and the occupants along with them. "Old people have fallen sick. Children are spitting up blood. People cannot sleep at night because of the cold," laments another youth, who says he had to quit his job to take care of his family. Several meters from this place, which local authorities call a "transit camp," passes the road leading from Sidi El Houari to Planteurs, a populous quarter nestled at the base of Mt. Murdjadjo. Medical emergencies can occur at any moment. As a preventive measure, municipal health authorities have put an ambulance at the victims' disposal. "We treat about 15 patients a day on-site. Recently we had a virtual epidemic of diarrhea," we were told by the doctor on duty. According to one camp resident, the malady was caused by nonpotable water from a tank truck. For four weeks now, the inhabitants have been waiting for a running water hook-up. "The ambulance you see down there departs at 1700. Several times we urgently needed to evacuate sick people. Without a vehicle, it was very difficult to do. Even the taxi drivers refused to come into our quarter," says a man with graying hair. Another informs us that for lack of room, young people in some families have to find someplace on their own to sleep at nights. A brief tour of the camp brought to light scenes worthy of a favelas. Cooking utensils, mattresses, and linens were strewn pell-mell beside each tent. The two footpaths that separate the tents (and are still unusable) are known to the inhabitants as "Sandala and Anana boulevards." People here try constantly to make light of the appallingly wretched conditions. But at one point, a women hidden behind a curtain asks our escorts the purpose of our visit. "Tell them to help us. We cannot go on like this any longer," she says in a choked voice. In a desperate effort to shelter themselves from the winter rains, families have covered their temporary refuges with nylon provided by "a charitable soul." With a measure of pride, the father of a family shows off the abode he built on a small hillock out of stones and sheet metal. He could no longer stand to live with his many children under a tent. But for all of them, mere survival has been a struggle. Some residents are already getting suspicious, especially since workers sent by the Oran executive delegation have started digging a trench in preparation for building a wall. The families are concerned about their "temporary" housing. "If they have decided to build a wall, it is because they want to keep us here a long time," one adolescent protests. The waste water from toilets hastily built by the commune is carried away in an open drainage ditch. Household garbage is dumped haphazardly a few tenths of a mile from the camp. Nauseous odors attack the nose. To the victims, the site (nicknamed "Hay Geyouni") is a constant reminder of the terrifying landslide. They all want to get away from it. The ruins of houses destroyed by the cave-in are still visible. Thirtyish Houari Yahia sighs painfully whenever he looks at them. When the catastrophe struck, the young man lost both his father and his mother. Frightening Memory It is no use telling him the habitations that collapsed were built above a tunnel used for growing mushrooms. He does not want to know. His only concern is to find decent housing for his two sisters (one of whom is mentally ill) and his young brother. He was chosen by the other victims to head a committee that is working to plead their cause with the local authorities. "We were received by all the officials, including the DEC [expansion not given] and the head of the daira. Lots of promises..." we were told. In mid-January the DEC announced that plots of land in the Quatre Chemins quarter would be distributed to Ras El Ain victims so they could build their own new homes. But as soon as heads of families got to the site, they ran into immense problems with a state-owned enterprise that claimed ownership of the land. Still, financial aid totaling 40,000 Algerian dinars was promised. "What is the Red Cross doing? None of its officials deigned to pay us a visit. What happens to all the donations they get?" asks one committee member. The DEC has acknowledged the existence of about fifty abodes in the Sidi El Houari quarter still facing the threat of collapse. According to official statistics, 326 sites providing shelter for 3,400 families in Oran's old town could fall in at any moment. Ras El Ain, perched on a hillside, is one of those forgotten housing projects--along with Planteurs, Sidi El Houari, and Bel Horizon--that surround the city of El Bahia. Planteurs is a quarter that extends for 3 km along the flank of Murdjadjo. It is separated from the rest of Oran by the Ras El Ain ravine. The latter is boxed in between the steep, rocky edge of the Oran plateau and the sloping mountainside of Murdjadjo. Longtime Oran residents recall that El Bahia's first inhabitants were attracted there by the abundance of water and fertile soil. Some inhabitants continue willy-nilly to cultivate a few plots along the banks of a wadi, although the stream bed has become a veritable refuse dump. Emerging from Freres Benkhedda square on the lower side of Sidi El Houari, the Ras El Ain development presents an appalling spectacle. Whole blocks of houses are crammed together in chaotic disorder. What we think of as streets do not really exist here--just small walkways of packed earth. No Disinfectant A topographical study several years ago revealed serious surface instability at several locations, which puts houses with stone foundations at permanent risk of collapse. As early as 1977, plans were made to rid Ras El Ain ravine of the "unhealthy and precarious" structures "already standing." "Relocation of Ras El Ain's inhabitants to undeveloped zones is an urgent priority," one reads in this study. But nothing was ever done. Built of sun-dried bricks or a mixture of rock and clay, the habitations constitute a constant source of danger. Other abodes built of sheet metal or wood are on the verge of collapse. Local authorities had plans under the auspices of various development schemes to raze some 1,400 (potentially hazardous) structures housing more than 2,400 families. For reasons unknown, this operation was never carried out. Planteurs, as part of the slum eradication campaign, got special treatment. Not only has the quarter become a gigantic cesspool, but the unkept promises of officials are doing more damage than one could imagine. "People here are living in a sham development. The inhabitants are crushed beneath the weight of all sorts of problems, but no one tries to understand the causes of their suffering," fumes a nurse at a huge medical center originally designed to specialize in pediatrics and gynecology. According to our interlocutor, the place is now almost totally abandoned. She says, for example, that occupancy never exceeds 30 percent. Entire floors are empty. Patients, seeing the lack of funds, medicine, and equipment, have opted for other hospital centers. "How can we care for patients when we do not even have so much as a jar of disinfectant?" she asks. The facility is in a poor location...it stands opposite an unauthorized public dump. The number of inhabitants has grown tenfold in the last 13 years. Moreover, at least according to a goodly number of sociologists, the populations of Ras El Ain, Planteurs, and Sidi El Houari are suffering from marginalization: "In the view of many, Ras El Ain's inhabitants simply do not exist. We are treated almost as if we were outlaws. Taxi drivers refuse to pick us up at night. As they see it, the people here are vulgar `beznassa' if not actually thieves," we were told by one anguished young victim. An urban planner has observed, in another academic study, that local authorities have long refused to treat Ras El Ain and Planteurs "as an integral part of the city of Oran. In addition, the authorities have always rejected the idea that these quarters have any legal existence." And that, in a word, is the whole tragedy of Ras El Ain....
