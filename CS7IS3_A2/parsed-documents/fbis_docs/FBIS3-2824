Zhou Nan pointed out in his speech: The current dispute over issues on Hong Kong's consitutional system [zheng zhi 2398 0455] is not one on whether or not we want democracy, but on whether or not we should act in good faith. In a more profound sense, it boils down to a dispute over Hong Kong's sovereignty. In the final analysis, the British side's scheme is that, by using its administrative powers over Hong Kong in the remaining few years and the pretext of so-called "accelerating the democratic process," it will attempt to impose the leading group it forms onto the SAR government in an effort to continually manipulate Hong Kong's political affairs after 1997. The British side has even vainly attempted to transform Hong Kong into an independent or semi- independent political entity. However, it has forgotten the Chinese people will never give in to any foreign pressure on a matter of important principle concerning national sovereignty. Zhou Nan noted: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee has been performing substantive work. In the future, PWC membership will be further expanded. We have appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs and one batch of advisers on regional affairs. We will appoint more representatives from the Hong Kong region to be advisers on Hong Kong and regional affairs to hear more views and suggestions from the broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots; and to lay a broad and firm foundation for realizing the principles of "one country, two systems," and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong." Zhou Nan also said: The broad masses of Hong Kong government functionaries have made important contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability for many years. We welcome them to continue to be devoted to their duties after 1997 and to make fresh contributions to Hong Kong's future development. We also pay very close attention to issues concerning Hong Kong people's livelihood, and will try our utmost to prevent the British side from passing heavy financial burdens on to the future SAR government and broad masses of Hong Kong residents. Zhou Nan also briefed participants about the "mutually benefitting and common prosperity-enhancing" relations between Hong Kong and the mainland in the fields of trade, investments, and finance in the past year. According to statistics, the value of bilateral entrepot trade between Hong Kong and the mainland accounted for nearly 90 percent of Hong Kong's total entrepot trade value. The mainland has become the largest market for Hong Kong's export products. In 1993, Hong Kong businessmen actually made use of $13 billion of their direct investments in the mainland, topping any other outside investors in China. As of the end of 1993, the number of red-chip stocks of Chinese companies [zhong zi hong chou gu 0022 6327 4767 4693 5140] listed on the Hong Kong stock market was 37, previously the number was zero. Their market value accounted for about 10 percent of Hong Kong's total stock market value. Zhou Nan said: These facts fully show that the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland have integrated into a single entity, and the "China factor" is gradually having a greater and greater impact on Hong Kong's economic development. Strengthening cooperation with the mainland in various fields is an important condition for sustaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Most Hong Kong people have reached a common understanding that Hong Kong wants to closely cooperate with the mainland and opposes the initiation of confrontation.
