The parties have not yet finished discussing the national police formation dossier. Joao Ligio reports: Point one in the working agenda of the second round of peace talks has not yet been surpassed. Sources close to the peace talks feel the national police dossier could this week still become part of the documents signed by the parties during the first round of peace talks begun during the last days of last year. After the amendments made yesterday to the proposal presented by the Black Cockerel's negotiators on the specific principles of Point One, dealing with the percentages of each party in the composition of the riot police, the mediator is expected to present his counterproposal. The joint reaction of the mediator and the troika, entitled the master document, should be presented to the parties tomorrow, taking into account the intense movement for exchanging correspondence registered today. We saw hotel doors opening and closing, with Alioune Blondin Beye's messengers going in and coming out.
