[Juppe] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] response has been in proportion to the threat. I should note in passing that the UN procedures have been improved, as France requested, since the time between the request for intervention and the final decision has been reduced to less than half an hour, rather than over four hours as was the case in Bihac. [Colomes] What action would we take if the Serbs do not yield on the ground and continued their offensive? Are you certain that these air strikes will be effective? [Juppe] That is an old dispute. We have been told alternatively that these strikes are completely ineffective and that they are a miracle cure. I do not believe them to be either. They are necessary to clearly illustrate the resolve of the international community, but they are not a durable solution. It is a way of reacting. The only stable solution is a political and diplomatic one. What worries me, in the current situation, is the risk of escalation and the delays caused to negotiations. [Colomes] Why was no ultimatum issued, as in Sarajevo? [Juppe] Because the conditions were already in place for NATO intervention. The decision was undoubtedly made because of the urgency of the situation. Now we must, I repeat, return to diplomacy. The method of bilateral contacts used for the last month and a half, first by the Americans and then by the Russians, has proved useful. It has made it possible to arrive at an agreement between Croats and Muslims, and to establish a cease fire between them that has been respected. However, we are starting to see the limits of this method. Today it is clear: You cannot make peace between two sides when three sides are involved in the conflict. What France is asking for now is that we get everyone, including the Serbs, around the negotiating table: the three protagonists plus the major powers, without whom there will be no solution. [Colomes] So you want to reconcile the American diplomatic process and the European one? [Juppe] Absolutely. The only overall proposal that currently exists is the European action plan. [Colomes] Are the two plans -- the American plan and the European plan -- compatible? [Juppe] That is a question I have asked Warren Christopher a number of times, and I have been assured that they are compatible. If you read the two texts you can see for yourself: The Muslim-Croat agreement does not contradict the European plan. We must therefore view the various initiatives in an overall perspective. Specifically, France wants to include the Americans and the Russians in the London conference, in addition to the European Union and the United Nations. The recent Owen-Stoltenberg-Redman-Churkin meeting was a first step in this direction. I think that this is the only way to say to the three parties on the ground: This is the joint position of the major powers, and here is what we are asking, starting with a cease fire between Serbs and Muslims to avoid an escalation of the Gorazde conflict. [Colomes] The Muslims refuse a cease fire because they think they are in a difficult military position, and would rather continue fighting.... [Juppe] We cannot accept that. If we did, we would get caught up in a downward spiral where the United Nations and the Atlantic Alliance would be supporting the Sarajevo government's attempts to regain lost ground. President Clinton himself recently said much the same thing. We prefer discussion to confrontation. We know that, in Gorazde, the first attack came from the Muslim side, and the Serbs then responded wholly disproportionately, as is their custom. We cannot be held hostage to that game. We must say so now, and all four of us (Europeans, Americans, Russians, and the United Nations) must say it with one voice. [Colomes] To bring the Serbs back around the negotiating table, should we not try to alter the terms of the embargo? [Juppe] That is the second argument in favor of a return to the European action plan, since this plan links the process of finding a political solution with, first, the suspension and, second, the lifting of sanctions against Serbia. We need a big stick -- the ultimatum put to Serbia was an example of this -- but we also need a carrot. [Colomes] On the subject of air strikes in Gorazde, why did you not inform the Russians? [Juppe] The Russians voted for resolution 836 on safe areas. They have contingents on the ground under UNPROFOR command, and it was in this context that the decision was made. There does not seem to me to be anything there that could offend them. On the other hand, I do think we should involve the Russians more in the peace process. That is why France proposes placing everyone -- belligerents and major powers -- around the one table. China [Colomes] You have just accompanied the prime minister on a delicate trip to China, in the course of which the Chinese authorities seemed to take pleasure in strewing your path with obstacles -- increasing the number of arrests, taking people into custody, detentions, and placing dissidents in guarded accommodation. Since the American secretary of state had already fallen pray to a similar series of events, could you not have foreseen this risk and taken preventive measures? [Juppe] The only way to prevent it would have been by not going. That would have meant remaining in the same position as before, with China and France not talking to each other. When I became foreign minister, one year ago, relations had virtually been broken off. Let me just give you one example: Our ambassador at the time, one of our best diplomats and a fluent Chinese-speaker, no longer had any contact with the Chinese ministries. We had reached an advanced state of sulking. Can you imagine France having no dialogue with a power such as China? Maybe some people were resigned to that fact, but I was not. As a result, we did everything we could -- and it was a long process -- to restore dialogue. In China, I felt that the authorities wanted to reestablish contacts and I did not at all have the feeling that they were making things more difficult. As a result, the trip was successful. Quite possibly, it was not to the liking of all the Chinese factions or the people observing China's relations with the rest of the world. It is quite possible, too, that there were struggles for influence which led to the measures you described. However, I would like to add two things. First, we did not hide what we felt. We told the Chinese very clearly what we thought of the human rights situation in their country. We did not do it publicly at the microphone, but our message did get across. Second, with regard to the arrests, it is hard to see clearly what is was all about. When we arrived in Shanghai, press agency dispatches spoke of "arrests." We immediately asked the Chinese authorities for explanations. I myself summoned the Chinese ambassador to France and told him: "I want an answer within a few hours." The answer duly came, in the form of a clear commitment from the Chinese minister accompanying Mr. Balladur: no dissidents had been imprisoned since our arrival. [Colomes] They were playing word games. They had not imprisoned them, they had simply detained them in police stations and released them the day after you left.... [Juppe] XINHUA itself confirmed, on the day we left, that no 0one had been arrested and that everyone taken in for questioning had been released. I think it is quite interesting that so much attention is being paid to human rights in China. When we go to the Arab countries which apply the Shariah, does anyone ask questions about women's rights? When we go to Vietnam, is anyone quite as interested in human rights there? I could list all the countries in the world where the human rights situation is not what it should be. France speaks out when this is the case, and we told China. Everything else is an exaggeration or manipulation. [Colomes] Was it not a kind of confession of weakness on our part to go to Beijing after having done a kind of about-turn by abandoning Taiwan? Did we not have a stronger position in the past, when we balanced relations between China and Taiwan? [Juppe] Who says we have abandoned Taiwan? That is not true. Our cooperation, especially in the civil domain, remains promising. However, we have to reestablish political dialogue with Beijing, especially where North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, and regional security issues are concerned. These are very important issues. We cannot cut ourselves off from a country like China because of them. Let me explain about Taiwan: We simply said that we would observe the required restraint in arms deliveries and that we would stop supplying Taiwan with weapons that could endanger China. It is the least we can do! Rwanda [Colomes] Now that we have completed, and succeeded, evacuating French nationals from Rwanda, are we going to let the inhabitants of that country continue killing each other? [Juppe] Is France the policeman for the whole universe? Does France have the means and the responsibility for preventing people from killing each other all over the planet? [Colomes] Perhaps not France alone, but the United Nations? [Juppe] The United Nations has tried, and so has France. For years, we have been working for the reconciliation of the various factions. We supported the Arusha agreement and had a military contingent in the country for months. We only pulled our troops out last year when the UN forces arrived. We thought that the peace process was working. Then there was the attack on the aircraft carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi which led to the current conflagration. Clearly, our duty was to evacuate French nationals, and we did that, coolly and quickly. Now we have to rebuild the conditions for dialogue and give the United Nations back its role. We will work toward this. Algeria [Colomes] In Algeria, which is sinking into civil war, a new government team has taken office.... [Juppe] Yes, but it is still too early to talk about it because it is difficult to interpret the significance of General Zeroual's latest cabinet reshuffle. What line will the new government take? We will see when we know the composition of this government, especially for two important posts: the interior (will the hard line be maintained?) and finance (will discussions continue with the International Monetary Fund?). [Colomes] What will we do if the situation in Algeria gets worse? Are we ready to welcome anyone who wants to enter France? [Juppe] Of course, we will welcome French nationals. We have already repatriated some two-thirds of our nationals in Algeria. Then there are those people with dual nationality who hold a French passport. Beyond that, we have to examine the question clearly: Can and must French society today open its doors to tens of thousands -- and the figure could run into hundreds of thousands -- of Algerians who potentially have dual nationality but who do not currently hold a French passport, or even to refugees? Generosity and fine sentiments are one thing, but the reality of the social balance in France also counts for a lot. I do not think that France could today open its doors to thousands of immigrants from North Africa. There are other countries we could call on to show their solidarity, such as Algeria's neighbors or other Mediterranean countries. France cannot do everything on its own. [Colomes] Faced with this crisis, does France feel that it has been abandoned somewhat by its traditional allies? [Juppe] France feels it is alone. It is true, it feels it is in the front line. We are trying to do two things: First, convince certain of our partners that, even if political dialogue is necessary, the arrival of an extremist, anti-French, anti-European, anti-Western regime in Algeria would threaten the balance of the whole region. There would inevitably be a contagious effect on the other countries of the Maghreb and maybe beyond. Second, we are trying to encourage the Algerian people to restructure their economy and we are looking to mobilize international aid to help them do this. As soon as the dinar has been devalued and the IMF agreement signed, Algeria's debt must be rescheduled and the European countries, and others, too, if possible -- I have called on Japan, Algeria's second largest creditor -- must do everything they can to lessen Algeria's debt burden, which is completely stifling the economy. Russia [Colomes] Can you see a hardening in Russian foreign policy since the election of the new Duma? [Juppe] Yes, but without doubt these hesitations or contradictions are related to the complexity of the Russian political landscape. Just think about what happened in the former Yugoslavia: One day people were shooting their mouths off, the next day they were calming things down. Thus, there is certainly the need for President Yeltsin and his government to take account of the rise in nationalist feeling, including in the Duma, but, at the same time, they want to continue their cooperation and partnership with the West. [Colomes] Should we alter our attitude to cater for their new position? [Juppe] I am one of those people who think that we should help Russia, not isolate it. We have to tell them a few home truths, however. First, about human rights and democracy. People are talking about them in China, so let us also talk about them in Russia. The state of law has made progess with the December legislative elections and referendum, but there is still more to be done. Second, we must tell them: "We will help you, but on certain conditions." We are not prepared to throw our money down the drain, and aid can only be effective if economic reforms are implemented in Russia. Third, we are not ready to give Russia the right to veto what is happening in Central and East Europe. For what the Russians call the "near abroad," we will readily recognize a certain responsibility that falls to Russia, but on condition that this responsibility is met within the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE. We will not be writing them any blank checks. I think that these three truths should be expressed in a context of political openness and free cooperation. That is what I intend to say when I go to Russia in May.
