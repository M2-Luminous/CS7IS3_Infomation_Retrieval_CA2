Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced the steps on Wednesday [16 February], saying that Macedonia "insists on its claims to Greek land." The measures include closing the northern Greek port of Salonica to Macedonia, and closing the Greek Consulate in the Macedonian capital of Skopje. French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said Thursday that the Greek decision "departs from the dialogue between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which France has sincerely encouraged." He stressed that in the present context "the easing of tensions should be a common concern." Macedonia, a former Yugoslav Republic contiguous to Greece, declared independence in 1991 and was admitted to the United Nations General Assembly last April. Greece has been trying to block international recognition of Macedonia, arguing that it has designs on a northern Greek province that is also called Macedonia. But Macedonia's government says it has no claims on northern Greece. France established diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav Republic last December. It has been reported that Greece did not inform its partners in the European Union before Wednesday's announcement.
