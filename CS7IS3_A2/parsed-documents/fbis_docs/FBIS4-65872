Yesterday, your Free Democratic Party [FDP] made sure that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] candidate was elected president. Was it only a question of Herzog, or were Kohl and the coalition in Bonn also at stake. [Kinkel] The presidential election is a political decision, and, having this in mind, we made our decision yesterday. After the second ballot, I recommended that my group vote for Roman Herzog. First, because we think he is the appropriate candidate, and, second -- and I said that clearly before -- we made a coalition statement for the CDU/CSU that is to be confirmed at the party congress in Rostock. We must pursue a straightforward, reliable course, which is why our decision was right. [passage omitted] [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, the FDP seems to be envisaging a completely different republic. Let me quote some keywords from your election program: social benefits should be further cut; those who employ unemployed people should be permitted to pay lower wages in the future; at the same time, high-income earners should pay less tax and the highest tax rate should be cut to below 45 percent. Is yours not a different society than our current social market economy; would your plans not create a society in which the poorer will get poorer still and the rich even richer? [Kinkel] We do not want the poor to get poorer. The FDP has demonstrated that is has the necessary social sensitivity, and I have done so personally in the past in my time as justice minister and even before that. Still, as an economics party, if I may put it this way, we must first make sure that the baskets are full. After all, we can distribute things from this basket only when they are full. Sometimes one gets the impression in this country that people do not always see it that way and that they would like to hand out what they have not yet earned. [passage omitted] [Bresser] Let us assume that you again manage to get into the Bundestag with your elitist program. Nevertheless, you are no longer the third most important force in the Bundestag, and thus no longer the party that could create the majority or tip the scales. [Kinkel] Who has said that? [Bresser] All recent opinion polls say that a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP will not achieve a majority in the next Bundestag election? [Kinkel] Just wait and see. [Bresser] Anyway, do you not sometimes think that you might be in opposition as of October? [Kinkel] First of all, in the upcoming elections, and the Bundestag election in particular, we are campaigning for ourselves. We want to achieve good results for ourselves, for the FDP, because we think that we have a right to exist as a party, regardless of considerations concerning our function. Let me seize the opportunity and say something. A small though fine party, since 1949 this FDP has proved at the local, laender, and federal level that it can make practical policy. At the federal level, in particular, the FDP has made a decisive contribution to the reconstruction of the country after 1945 and 1949, and, most notably, it has also made its contribution to unification. Contrary to others that are now proclaiming all kinds of vision, such as the Instead Party or other short-lived groups, we have proved our ability in practical policies. The functional element, which some people recently claimed we no longer had, has not disappeared. On the contrary, it looks as if the CDU/CSU were anxious to continue the coalition with us, thus hoping and thinking that we will succeed. As far as Mr. Scharping is concerned, I am also waiting for coalition statements. He has said that he cannot imagine cooperation with the Greens because of their program, which calls for resigning from NATO, giving up the Bundeswehr, etc. [Bresser] Would you enter into a coalition with the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] if Scharping were to be ahead of the CDU/CSU after the Bundestag election and a coalition between the SPD and the FDP had a majority? [Kinkel] Mr. Bresser, I have just made a coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU, and we had a difficult poll yesterday in the federal convention. You cannot expect me to answer the question you have just asked me on your television show. [Siegloch] Still, the fact is that according to all recent surveys you only come in fourth place. You simply have to acknowledge that you can no longer play the crucial role the FDP has in the past 30 or 40 years as you have just described, because you are only the fourth strongest party. [Kinkel] Of course [pauses]...what do you mean place four? This is where we are at the moment. I am not denying that the Greens -- of whom you are thinking when you speak of place number three -- have made considerable gains, and that they have benefited significantly from the fact that they do not bear any responsibility at the federal level. In some of the laender they do, and there the governments that were set up together with the Greens are not that fantastic in practice. Regarding the federal level, I can see how the republic is waiting for an SPD/Greens government. I have noticed that in Mr. Scharping, how much he would be looking forward to that. But, just wait. Mr. Scharping has said that he would like to have the choice after the Bundestag election. Fine. As far as I am concerned, I do not worry too much about my FDP and I repeat what I said before -- namely, that support for us is growing. I bet that we will do well in the Bundestag election. [passage omitted] [Bresser] After the UN debacle in Somalia, you were once again prepared to send German soldiers to Africa, this time to Rwanda. Did the Defense Ministry have to stop you from doing this? [Kinkel] You have been misinformed. There was a telephone conversation between Volker Ruehe and me on the subject of possible deployment in Rwanda. There was talk of two UN tasks -- namely, setting up field hospitals and making aerial deliveries of supplies from Nairobi to Kigali. [Bresser] Is that what you were in favor of? [Kinkel] We both supported the latter task, but on two conditions. First, the security situation in Kigali had to be in order, and the warring parties had to agree. [Bresser] But Mr. Ruehe had a different opinion. He said the military situation was confusing. According to him, the military situation was dangerous, so one should not go to Rwanda at all, regardless of with whom one goes. [Kinkel] That is incorrect. Either Mr. Ruehe or you have misunderstood something. Just as I had in my telephone conversation with Mr. Ruehe, the cabinet discussed this issue at length, and Mr. Ruehe of course subscribed to the decision that we should fly to Rwanda subject to these conditions. [Bresser] He said German interests are not recognizable. [Kinkel] I do not know to whom he told this. In any case, he never said it in the cabinet. [Siegloch] Bosnia is much closer than Africa. What can the Germans do for war-ravaged Bosnia? How can they help the Bosnians? And in one of the "What Now, Mr...?" series of programs, Chancellor Kohl announced that the Germans want to go to the limits of their abilities. Are you in favor of the deployment of German medical personnel in Bosnia? [Kinkel] First of all, I would not accept what you have just said about Rwanda. I must protest. What is happening in Rwanda is the worst kind of genocide; 500,000 people have probably been killed there in a brutal fashion. If the world is to apply equal standards, it cannot and must not sit and watch. We cannot send any soldiers there on account of our constitutional situation, but the cabinet agreed that we can extend our help in the humanitarian sphere. As for Bosnia, we also cannot perform specific missions there on account of our constitutional situation. But even if we could, the situation is different because for historical reasons we would never reach a Bundestag majority decision in favor of such a mission. [Siegloch] Sooner Rwanda than Bosnia. Is that right? [Kinkel] It would probably be easier for the Bundestag to reach a decision concerning a mission to Rwanda because we bear no historical burden in that country. As I said, constitutional reasons prevent us from acting in both countries, but I hope the Constitutional Court will help us in June-July. [Siegloch] Do you favor the deployment of German troops within the UN framework, because only in that way could you fulfill -- or at least come close to -- your ambition of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council in New York? [Kinkel] That is what people suspect. There is no direct connection with such an ambition, but I must of course consider how we should shape our future relations with the United Nations. As for my wish to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, I happen to have the support of 75-80 percent of the population. I would like to make it clear that this idea did not originate with me, but with the SPD, something that is also interesting to know. [Bresser] But on the other hand, we are dealing with joint activity on a European level. Is it therefore necessary for us to be represented in New York as a nation? [Kinkel] If it were possible for the European Union [EU] to be represented in New York, I have always said that we would agree. But this will not be possible; this is a utopian idea. France and Great Britain will, of course, wish to remain permanent members of the Security Council. I checked this beforehand. We would of course immediately agree to a Security Council seat for the EU, but this is out of the question. [Siegloch] What do you tell your foreign interlocutors about Germany's image in the world and about Solingen, Luebeck, and Magdeburg? Are these merely regrettable individual incidents, or do you think something is once again brewing in Germany? [Kinkel] In any case, I find it difficult to discuss these things with my foreign colleagues, because this topic plays a much stronger role than people in Germany think. On the one hand, I try to explain that these are regrettable individual incidents, at least in my opinion, and that we are trying to resolve these issues and this terrible problem at the initial stage and in terms of sanctions, and of course I also say that I am ashamed that these things are happening. But, on the other hand, I also say: Please be fair in judging the FRG on these issues. We have learned a lesson from what has happened; we have provided an enormous amount of humanitarian aid and effort to make good the damage; we have taken 400,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, more than double the number that the other European countries have taken; and we have exceptionally liberal legislation, including Article 16 of the Basic Law. Please be fair in judging Germany, I tell my colleagues. Above all, I tell them that it is one thing when the state condones or tolerates violations of human rights, and quite another thing when a liberal law-governed country like ours is not in a position to prevent individual occurrences of such an evil nature. We are doing all that we can to overcome the problem, but unfortunately we have not succeeded, I say. [Siegloch] Another two questions before our surprise guest. What is your greatest foreign policy concern? That the situation in Russia becomes uncontrollable? [Kinkel] I will reply from a somewhat broader angle. I think the central task of German foreign policy in the coming years will be to lead the transforming countries of Central and East Europe to our Europe on a political, economic, and security level. [Bresser] That will isolate Russia even more. [Kinkel] Naturally, in this context, the Russian question plays quite a decisive role. We must not dig new trenches. This enormous area, 50 times the size of Germany, with a population of 150 million, and still the second largest nuclear power, must not be neglected. It must be included in all the new structural planning. That is the great task facing German foreign policy since unification and since the end of the East-West confrontation. [passage omitted] [Bresser] The last quarter hour of our program is dedicated to the surprise guest. Mr. Kinkel does not know who is going to come, but he knows him very well. Both men were proteges of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, but the man who is now joining us left the FDP in 1982, subsequently joined the SPD, and has meanwhile even become federal party manager, thus being Rudolf Scharping's first campaign manager. Welcome, Mr. Guenther Verheugen. You were in the FDP for 22 years, and have now been a member of the SPD for 12 years. Please ask questions of your former colleague, who is now a political opponent of yours. [passage omitted] [Verheugen] After the attacks in Luebeck [against the synagogue] and what happened afterward, you pointed to the effects this spreading violent radicalism was having abroad. I think you used the word devastating. [Kinkel] Yes. [Verheugen] I share your view, and I think it was right of you to have said that. I think you were criticized for it by others. The question now is whether you think there is something the democratic parties could do together to stop these radical right-wing activities from spreading. You probably know I proposed that the democratic parties should take joint action against rallies of right-wing radicals. I have not yet received an answer from you and, unfortunately, received a negative one from the CDU/CSU. [Kinkel] Wait a second. I fully agree with you. When we discussed the issue in the Executive Committee -- I am surprised that you did not get our answer -- I immediately said that I fully support your proposal. Absolutely and fully. [Verheugen] This is an important point for me. I would like to explain to our viewers what we are talking about. We are talking about the fact that, whenever the Republikaner stage a major rally, the FDP, the Greens, and the SPD are ready to hold democratic rallies at the same time but in a different place to prevent violent scenes at the location of the Republikaner rallies, scenes that are familiar to us and that led to your judgment that such outrages had a devastating effect abroad. [Kinkel] The FDP is ready to support your proposal without reservation. [Siegloch] Gentlemen, you have now found one issue on which you agree. Still, this was not yet the beginning of coalition talks. It was a conversation with a moderate tone, not exactly a dispute, but I think the exchange of arguments has been informative. Thank you very much, and good night.
