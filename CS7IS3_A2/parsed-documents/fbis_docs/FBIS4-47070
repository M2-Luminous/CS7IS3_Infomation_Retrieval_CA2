Panov, deputy minister of transportation and director of the Department of Railways of the Republic of Kazakhstan, by T. Shirshova, time and place not given] [Text] Last summer was a hard one for Kazakhstan railroad workers. Crowds of passengers literally assaulted first the cashiers offices--standing in line overnight--and then the cars, where double booking was not unusual. And this was not just at the two terminals in the capital, but also at the terminals of the republic's oblast centers. What awaits us today? This is the subject of our reporter's conversation with Yu. Panov, deputy minister of transportation and director of the Department of Railways of the Republic of Kazakhstan. [Shirshova] Yuriy Vladimirovich, won't the latest increase in the price of train tickets cause passengers to abandon railroad transportation? [Panov] Let's compare: to fly from Alma-Ata [Almaty] to Moscow a passenger has to put out 2,000 tenge (120,000 rubles [R]), while passage in a railroad car with compartments will cost one-tenth as much. Motor vehicle workers are completely out of the competition: the vehicle fleet has one foot in the grave, as they say, and they are not receiving any replacements. Furthermore there is the fuel problem, and the cost of motor vehicle travel is not much different from air travel. So railroad workers will again have to bear the main burden of conveying passengers on both short and long trips. Suburban trains have begun to be organized very actively recently, especially on the Virgin Lands Railroad. Whereas people there used to make their trips by bus, now they are trying to get onto the train. So just like last year, railroad workers will be forced to put in use cars which sometimes do not even meet the requirements of esthetics--so long as safe travel is ensured. People are asking us, "We don't care if it's a steam engine, just get us there." The suburban, or more accurately interoblast, trains are already running overloaded. And passengers understand that it is difficult for the railroad workers to ensure comfortable travel. [Shirshova] All the same, I hope that things will not come to steam travel? [Panov] There are 2,200 passenger cars in our fleet. Over the winter 300 cars were given factory overhauling, and 700 were serviced at depots. That is a total of 1,000, but for the large-scale summer passenger traffic we should have 1,500. Or even more. So our technical capabilities are limited; they cannot meet the demand for conveyance. Last year Kazakhstan bought 114 railroad cars in Germany and 70 in Tver. This year we are buying another 100 cars in Germany, but it is a question how many we will buy in Tver. Russia too needs to update its fleet. So it is a very complex situation. The German cars we bought will not go to organize new routes, but rather to supply existing ones. [Shirshova] Many people are concerned about the fate of the trains to Moscow and St. Petersburg. Rumors are going around that the Petersburg train will be canceled. [Panov] Yes, there were such intentions. But we decided to run it three times a week. The reasons were, first, that we are short of cars and, second, we are uneasy that the trains travel half-empty in Russian territory. [Shirshova] People think that the Russian cashiers are unenthusiastic about selling tickets to Kazakhstan trains so that they can fill up their own Russian ones. [Panov] Not exactly. Our conductors often would conceal vacant seats, in order to take people without tickets along. And there are indications that information on vacant seats is not being given out from Kazakhstan trains. But I think this will be straightened out soon. At the last conference in Voronezh representatives of the railroad administrations of the Commonwealth countries signed documents to introduce penalties for carrying passengers without tickets and concealing vacant seats. So if Russian inspectors, for example, inspecting a Kazakhstan train in Russian territory, find 10 persons without tickets, they will issue a penalty against the car depot that made up the train for the cost of 10 tickets. Similar penalties are envisioned for concealing vacant seats. [Shirshova] Last year problems arose in Kazakhstan with travel document forms. How are things now? [Panov] We placed an order for production of the forms in Russia. As you know, Kazakhstan does not have the facilities. We have already received the forms. Incidentally, as of 10 May a new system for preparing tickets has been introduced. The number of kilometers that the train travels in Commonwealth territory is now marked on the ticket stub. And income from passenger conveyance will always go to the state on whose territory the train was traveling. [Shirshova] Those are problems which were solved earlier, and have reappeared. [Panov] The Volga Railroad has canceled the Volgograd-Beyneu route, which served the Chevroil petroleum-gas complex. The pretext for the cancellation was supposedly that a danger of crime had developed in the territory across which the train was traveling. But they could not cite any specific examples of excesses or attacks. Only a very few Russian trains remain in Kazakhstan. I can name just one, the Novosibirsk--Alma-Ata train. The rest are organized by Kazakhstan. This fact greatly complicates the situation with passenger conveyance. In order to get out of the situation somehow we are restoring 40 cars that belong to the Baikonur cosmodrome. They are in neglected condition and, of course, need repair. The problems with bed accessories have increased; there is a kind of boom in disappearing bed linen these days. I am not implicating passengers; they can hardly slip out of the car with an armload of clean sheets. This means that we have to look for the offenders elsewhere. Another concern is that the bed accessories do not meet requirements at all. Especially on the West Kazakhstan Railroad, which makes up the Aktyubinsk--Alma-Ata train. One often wants to detain it in the capital for their sloppy attitude toward cleanliness. It looks like the bed linen is never washed, and the supply runs out as soon as the train passes the exit signals of Aktyubinsk station. K. Tazhibekov, first deputy director of the West Kazakhstan Railroad, has received reprimands for this irresponsible approach. He is supposed to keep his finger on the pulse of passenger traffic, but what we hear from him is excuses about poor work by the laundry. But I myself know that a laundry with a capacity of 15 tonnes a days was built in Aktyubinsk the year before last. All the linen in the city can be cleaned there. Now they have a new argument, the shortage of detergent. But this is no excuse either, for the Alma-Ata reserve conductors buy detergent in Guryev, that is, in the territory of the West Kazakhstan Railroad. In general, the train does not have a caring owner. The door to a car is hanging on one hinge--they make excuses about the lack of factory repair facilities. But pardon me, you do not have to have a factory to fix a door. A carpenter with minimal materials can hang it in 2 hours. All the locks to the compartment cars are broken. But the Aktyubinsk farm machinery plant could fill an order for locks. At one time they did that. [Shirshova] Yuriy Vladimirovich, summer is vacation time. What do you think, will people travel to the sea on vacation? You know, we once had a line from Alma-Ata to Adler. It was made up on the Alma-Ata Railroad. Is there a desire to restore it? [Panov] Because of the unstable situation in the Black Sea region people from Kazakhstan, as far as I know, are not wanting to go there. They prefer to spend their vacation closer to home. We have places for vacationing, for our own people and for guests, although we do not have a second Black Sea. In principle, however, a train could be organized. But there would have to be a full guarantee of the safety of the passengers and service personnel.
