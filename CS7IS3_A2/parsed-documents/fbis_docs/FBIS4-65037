Switzerland is also considering taking this step. At the same time, the Western European Union (defense alliance of the European Union) offered cooperation agreements to the East European states. Austria might turn into a blank space on the security-political map of Europe. These issues were mainly discussed during the official visit to the United States by General Troop Inspector Karl Majcen last week. The Austrian Government has decided in favor of a "pragmatic path," which is being understood in the United States, Majcen pointed out. In spite of a "generally benevolent and positive assessment of the Partnership for Peace concept," Austria "does not want to join it officially" for the time being. Instead, cooperation "will be expanded in the spheres where we possess expert knowledge" -- that is, in peacekeeping missions and disaster control, the general announced. A common basis for that exists already: At the NATO Coordination Council, a planning group deals exclusively with such activities; Austria is a participant, despite its international status as a neutral country. In addition, contacts with neighboring countries like Hungary in the sphere of military training are to be intensified. The question as to who organizes the peacekeeping operations is of secondary importance, Majcen stated. Austria will participate "without looking under whose auspices they are taking place." Majcen made it clear that there can be no security guarantee without any specific return service. The NATO states would not tolerate efforts by a country to "obtain a security guarantee as it were via membership in the European Union without offering anything in return. Entry into NATO through the back door" is not possible. Asked whether it would have been better to join the Partnership for Peace scheme together with Finland and Sweden, Majcen declined to reply: He is only implementing government decisions. However, if the referendum on 12 June should yield a positive result, a certain "speed is required." Austria must "decide quickly what kind of security policy is useful. Also, it must regulate its relationship with the Western European Union."
