FR940505-1-00072 FR940505-1-00012 C. Stationary and Area Source Rules 1. Introduction a. Source Category Description and Significance_ Stationary sources of air pollution are traditionally divided into ``point'' and ``area'' categories. Point sources include refineries, electric utilities, manufacturing plants, and other large industrial facilities, and have received considerable regulatory attention under the Act. Most, for example, are visited annually by District inspectors and are restricted to activities described in District air permits. As a result, belching smokestacks have largely disappeared as industrial facilities have installed scrubbers, incinerators, carbon adsorbers, and other expensive equipment to reduce air pollution. Nevertheless, EPA believes these sources can reduce NO X and VOC emissions even further. Area sources consist of widely dispersed commercial and residential equipment and activities. While some are not currently subject to air pollution regulations (e.g., pesticide application and some consumer products), most have been controlled in California for many years (e.g., gasoline pumps, dry cleaners, architectural coatings, degreasers, etc.). Despite regulation, these small sources are so numerous that they now emit more in the FIP areas than do point sources. Among the largest contributors are livestock waste in Sacramento, pesticides in Sacramento and Ventura, and coatings, solvents, consumer products, and petroleum extraction in all three areas. As discussed in sections II.A, III.G.2 and elsewhere in this NPRM, overall stationary source contributions to the total anthropogenic emission inventories range from roughly 5 percent NO X and 45 percent VOC in Sacramento to 35 percent NO X and 65 percent VOC in Ventura. Even with the relatively favorable emission reduction targets and stationary source contributions to NO X in Sacramento, EPA has aggressively sought stationary source emission reductions to help achieve attainment. For VOC in Sacramento and both pollutants in Ventura and South Coast, dramatic emission reductions from stationary sources are essential for attainment. b. Selection of Control Strategies_ EPA faces several large obstacles to obtaining the needed emission reductions from stationary sources. First, primary control of these sources has historically fallen to State and local agencies. Particularly in California, these agencies have developed an excellent understanding of the control technologies available to the specific sources in their jurisdiction, and have cooperated together to determine the best available retrofit control technology (BARCT) standards for major point sources, as required under the California Clean Air Act. Second, there are literally hundreds of different stationary activities that emit NO X and VOCs in the FIP areas. Even if EPA had the expertise, it would not have the time nor resources to scrutinize each source and determine the costs and technical details of control strategies to achieve the tremendous emission reductions needed for the South Coast, or even the lesser reductions needed for Sacramento and Ventura. Within these and other constraints, EPA has attempted to propose a set of stationary source control strategies which best fulfill the goals described in section I.B of this NPRM. A brief summary and explanation of the strategies is presented below. (1) Source-Specific RACT Rules. As a first step, EPA developed source-specific RACT rules for major point sources in the FIP areas not already subject to a RACT rule. These are described in section III.C.2 of this NPRM. In addition to contributing emission reductions towards the overall attainment targets, these rules are an appropriate first stage of the stationary source rule package because (1) RACT is already required for these sources under sections 181 and 182 of the Act, and (2) promulgation of RACT for these sources establishes greater equity with regard to other major sources. (2) Traditional Stationary Source Category Rules. As discussed in section III.C.1 of this NPRM, EPA cannot evaluate every source category in the FIP areas for availability and cost of emission reductions needed to meet the tremendous FIP reduction targets. Nevertheless, this type of source-by-source evaluation and rulemaking is exactly how State and local agencies have traditionally regulated VOC and NO X . Therefore, in order to create a State/federal partnership, minimize federal intrusion into State affairs, and achieve the other goals described in section I, EPA believes it is important to propose traditional stationary source rules by source category wherever possible. Sections III.C.3 and III.C.4 of this NPRM describe the regulations that EPA is proposing under this effort. Categories were generally selected because: (1) A State or local agency had already published a regulation that could be adapted for implementation in the FIP, or (2) a currently unregulated category contributed substantial emissions. While many of these rules will not achieve all the needed reductions, all provide reductions in the near-term and contribute progress towards attainment. In addition, many of these regulations were recommended by State or local agencies. EPA believes these agencies should and will follow the FIP proposal by promulgating equivalent rules, further supporting the FIP goals. (3) Cap Regulations. Section III.C.4 of this NPRM describes a set of emission cap regulations designed to achieve additional stationary source reductions. These rules impose substantial requirements on a wide range of sources, but they leave the sources a great deal of flexibility in how the reduction requirements are to be met. The requirements in the cap rules are designed to achieve the stationary sources' share of the emission reductions needed for attainment in Sacramento and Ventura. While these reductions are substantial and challenging to the regulated community, EPA believes that the reductions are achievable on the schedule reflected in the cap rules. EPA believes that this level of reduction is achievable by sources in the South Coast, in the same time frame. EPA does not know, however, whether current technologies and control techniques are adequate to achieve the additional reductions necessary in the South Coast. As a result, EPA is proposing that the South Coast reduction requirements under the cap rules be similar to those proposed for Ventura. (4) New Technology Measures under section 182(e)(5). The additional stationary source reductions needed for attainment in the South Coast are discussed in Section III.G. Section 182(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act allows States and EPA, acting in place of the State, to postpone promulgation of regulations in the South Coast (the only ``Extreme'' ozone nonattainment area) in order to provide for technology advancements. EPA is proposing to include in this category all stationary, area, and mobile source emission reductions needed in the South Coast beyond those proposed for Ventura. As discussed above, EPA lacks evidence at this time that either accelerating the reduction schedule or increasing the reduction requirements of the proposed cap rules would be achievable, in light of feasible existing control options. EPA solicits information from industry and the public on demonstrated and commercially available technologies that could reliably achieve a greater level of reduction than required in the cap rules. As soon as new or improved technologies and control techniques are foreseeable, EPA will consider amendments to the FIP to mandate further reduction requirements, even in advance of the schedule for rule development set forth in the proposed section 182(e)(5) commitments. EPA also urges the State and SCAQMD to pursue aggressively the development and application of low-emission technologies, clean fuels, and pollution prevention approaches capable of advancing and sustaining the pace of air quality progress in the South Coast. c. Future Evolution of Rules_ EPA intends to reevaluate these stationary source requirements as air pollution control technology continues to improve. All four of the general strategies discussed in paragraph III.C.1.b are subject to ongoing efforts to develop cost-effective emission reductions. This includes industry- sponsored environmental audits, CARB's RACT/BARCT development, EPA's continuing research and development initiatives and CTG and MACT efforts, and SCAQMD's RECLAIM and Tier 1, 2, and 3 programs, including projects of the SCAQMD's Technology Advancement Office. Where appropriate, the final promulgated FIP rules will reflect modifications to the proposed regulations based on information received from these and other efforts during the public comment period. However, EPA fully intends to continue modifying the FIP rules through subsequent separate actions, even after final promulgation. As discussed elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA hopes that the final modification to most FIP rules will be delegation to a State or local agency or recision of the FIP rules in deference to an approvable State or local program.
