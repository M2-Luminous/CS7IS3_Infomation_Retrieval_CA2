['Abbas] What took place in Cairo was an important initial step toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. It also solved the most important problems which had been left to the negotiators to find solutions for. I believe that the Cairo agreement has opened and paved the way for the practical implementation (of the Declaration of Principles agreement), for [Palestinian] entry into Gaza and Jericho, and for the immediate and direct assumption of authority in these two regions, plus the immediate and direct assumption of responsibility for five authorities in the rest of the West Bank cities. (The five authorities are: education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism.) [Khayrallah] How do you interpret the text of the new agreement? ['Abbas] Everyone knows the issues negotiated. They are: The security issues, the area of the settlements in Gaza, the crossings, and the size of the Jericho area. The agreement covered most of these points although some minor points were left to be resolved later. There are very many details we need to immediately begin to confirm on paper but they are not crucial or serious issues requiring the kind of negotiations held in Cairo or before. We can say that the Cairo agreement covered 80 percent of the fundamental issues and only 10 percent of the paper issues which will be discussed by the Taba and Paris committees. [Khayrallah] Could the new agreement be regarded as a completion of what took place in Cairo, Granada, and Davos earlier? ['Abbas] What has now taken place in Cairo is a continuation of what we started in the second Oslo meeting, Davos, Cairo, and Granada. The same issues were discussed within the same framework and in the same spirit. The reason we achieved what we did in Cairo was that there was closer common understanding of the agreement. That facilitated the result achieved. [Khayrallah] What will be the formal position at the crossings? ['Abbas] There will be a special situation at the crossings for the people of the Gaza and Jericho areas in that the Israeli control will be invisible. What the agreement tries to guarantee is preservation of Palestinian dignity at entry and exit points, speedy procedures, and elimination of many formalities and obstacles people used to face at the crossing points where they had to wait hours or even days sometimes. [Khayrallah] Why was Shim'on Peres reluctant to answer a question about the area of Jericho? ['Abbas] A confirmed area of Jericho has not yet been finally agreed upon. Efforts are being made to increase that area and fulfill the Palestinian and Israeli concepts of that area in a way that would ensure distancing it from the settlements. I believe that the issue of the area of Jericho will not be a problem in the future. [Khayrallah] Are you optimistic about this being a step toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles? ['Abbas] I believe that what took place in Cairo was an important step toward the implementation of the agreement. I am very hopeful that the implementation will begin and end before 13 April so that we would be able to fulfill the sequence of the other dates which were stipulated in the agreement and which should be honored.
