FR940927-2-00090 FR940927-2-00065 [CGD 94&hyph;077] Differential Global Positioning System, Gulf Intercoastal Region; Environmental Assessment AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard has prepared a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for implementing a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Service in the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor Region of the United States. The EA concluded that there will be no significant impact on the environment and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement will not be necessary. This notice announces the availability of the EA and FONSI and solicits comments on them. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. Copies of the EA and FONSI may be obtained by contacting LCDR George Privon at (202) 267&hyph;0297 or faxing a request at (202) 267&hyph;4427. A copy of the EA (less enclosures) is also available on the Electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS) at the GPS Information Center (GPSIC) in Alexandria, VA, (703) 313&hyph;5910. For information on the BBS, call the GPSIC watchstander at (703) 313&hyph;5900. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR George Privon, Radionavigation Division, (202) 267&hyph;0297. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Copies of the Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) are available as described under ADDRESSES. The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to comment on these documents. The Coast Guard may revise these documents in view of the comments. If revisions are warranted, availability of the revised documents will be announced by a later notice in the Federal Register . Background As required by Congress, the Coast Guard is preparing to install the equipment necessary to implement a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) services in the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor area of the United States. DGPS is a new radionavigation service that improves upon the 100 meter accuracy of the existing Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide an accuracy of better than 10 meters. For vessels, this degree of accuracy is critical for precise electronic navigation in harbors and harbor approaches and will reduce the number of vessel grounding, collisions, personal injuries, fatalities, and potential hazardous cargo spills resulting from such incidents. After extensive study, the Coast Guard has selected five sites along the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor coastline for the DGPS equipment. The sites are in the vicinity of Aransas Pass, TX; Galveston, TX; English Turn, LA; Mobile Point, AL; and Egmont Key, FL. The sites are already used for related purposes and were chosen, in part, because their proposed use is consistent with their past and present use, thus minimizing further impact on the environment. DGPS signal transmissions will be broadcast in the marine radiobeacon frequency band (283.5 to 325 KHz) using less than 50 watts (effective radiated power). Signal transmissions at these low frequency and power levels have not been found to be harmful to the surrounding environment. Proposed Installations at Each Site (a) Radiobeacon Antenna_The Coast Guard proposes to use either an 80 foot whip antenna or install a 90 foot guyed antenna with an accompanying ground plane. A ground plane for these antenna's consists of approximately 120 copper radials (6 gauge copper wire) installed 6 inches (or less) beneath the soil and projecting outward from the antenna base. The optimum radial length is between 200&hyph;300 feet, but this length may be shortened to fit within property boundaries. Wherever possible, a cable plow method will be used in the radial installation to minimize soil disturbance. Installation of the ground plane may require some clearing of trees and bushes on the site. (b) DGPS Antennas_Each site will require two 10 foot masts to support four small (4 inches by 18 inches diameter) receiving antennas. The masts will be installed on a concrete foundation measuring approximately 3 feet by 3 feet by 15 inches. These masts are needed to support the primary and backup reference receivers and integrity monitors. The location of the two masts will be in the vicinity of the electronic equipment building or hut, but at least 50 feet to 100 feet from existing structures. (At Mobile Point, AL, mast height must be increased from 10 feet to approximately 20 feet to ensure the visibility of satellites is not blocked by existing structures. The mast foundations will be 5 feet 3 inches by 5 feet 3 inches by 4 feet and will be mounted right next to the transmitter building to minimize disturbance to the area.) (c) Equipment shelter_Existing radiobeacon equipment shelters will be used at each site to house the DGPS equipment. (d) Utilities_The Coast Guard proposes to use available commercial power as the primary source for the electronic equipment. However, existing diesel generators are available and may be utilized if backup power is needed. Telephone service is required at each site for remote monitoring and operation.
