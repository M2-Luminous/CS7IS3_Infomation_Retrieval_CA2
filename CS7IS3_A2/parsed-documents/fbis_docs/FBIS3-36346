In particular, the premier said, immediately after signing the treaty on most favored trading status with Russia a few months ago the Lithuanian side sent a note to Moscow. However, the Russian side has not yet responded, so the treaty cannot come into force. Referring to unofficial reports, the premier said that the Russian side is trying to link these issues with other problems, in particular with "some aspects of relations between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad region of Russia."
