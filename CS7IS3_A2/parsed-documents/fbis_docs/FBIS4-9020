The LUNSZ favors the peaceful settlement and ending of hostilities in Yugoslavia without external interference, says the statement. "NATO has no right whatsoever to interfere in the former Yugoslavia and through its military actions there has again confirmed its aggressive nature," it adds. "The experience with NATO's illegal actions in ex-Yugoslavia confirms the truth of all citizens and organizations which oppose the Czech Republic's joining NATO which could draw it into fratricidal wars for foreign interests," LUNSZ members assert. The statement says that the LUNSZ supports the position of Russia which demands that the war conflict in Bosnia be solved by Yugoslav nations themselves and primarily in a peaceful manner. The LUNSZ demands that NATO activity be ended "as it has been promised by NATO when the former Warsaw Pact ceased to exist."
