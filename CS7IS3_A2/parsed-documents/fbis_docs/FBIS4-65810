This was announced by FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union). Additional wishes by individual ministries must be financed through redistribution. The generally lower revenues of 1994 will "certainly" recur next year, the minister promised. The large auditorium of the university in Cologne did not prove to be hostile territory for the minister. Invited by the Economics Policy Institute of Cologne University, Waigel's description of the problems of a finance minister was received with sympathy by the students. Even when he asked for understanding for the fact that the students' subsidies were not raised because of declining real wages and cutbacks of unemployment benefits and assistance and that he doubts that "their reexamination in 1995 will yield positive results," there were only a few protests. Speaking to the students, Waigel primarily defended the state debts: "Anyone who today pretends that we incurred debts just for the fun of it, ignores reality." Referring to former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (Social Democratic Party), Waigel said that the latter's criticism does not take the historical conditions of the past years into account and is thus directed "against reunification and German solidarity." Even though in 1995 the debt level will "temporarily brush against the 60-percent marker," which the Maastricht Treaty has defied as the upper limit in relation to GDP, in 1996 a decline to a value "just below this limit" is expected. Thus, Germany is clearly below the average in Europe. Even Japan and the United States reach 64 to 68 percent. Regarding the overall state deficit, in 1993 the FRG almost reached the Maastricht mark of 3 percent with its 3.3 percent. In 1995 the limit will be undercut. The current DM70-billion deficit in the federal budget is hardly due to unification but to "special burdens caused by the economic development." More important than stimulating overall economic demand is to preserve trust in financial and monetary policy. The level of long-term interests, which are about 2 percent below the longstanding average, is evidence of the trust in financial markets. Even though the economic research institutes warned in their spring reports against "consolidation as an end in itself," "we have not endangered the trust through insufficient efforts for consolidation," Waigel said. Regarding the privatization of Lufthansa, the Bundespost, and railroads, the finance minister rejected the accusation that he is "selling off the last treasures from the federal coffers out of financial need." After deducting the pension insurance payments for the employees, the revenues of the Federal Government are "relatively small." The privatization of the roads is not a "source of financing," either, Waigel stressed. He said that reports about the fees and potential compensation are "wild speculation." The point is to achieve better traffic conditions at appropriate prices -- "in the end companies and private drivers will not be worse off," the Christian Social Union politician promised. Asked whether he seriously believes that tax on interest rates can be harmonized in Europe, Waigel said: "Neither Switzerland nor Austria will refuse a basic solution," and "Luxembourg will not stand alone in the end." He thinks that the fear of the British chancellor of the exchequer that capital will emigrate to the Bahamas if harmonization is implemented in Europe is unfounded.
