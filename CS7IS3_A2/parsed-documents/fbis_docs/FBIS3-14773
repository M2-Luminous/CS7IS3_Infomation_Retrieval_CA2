"If Lithuania had troubles to get electricity from other sources, the reactor would not be stopped", he said. A little amount of steam can leak because of bad sealed measurers of flow in the technological channel. It does not hinder safe exploitation of the reactor at all, Vaisnys said. Anyway, the reactor is to be stopped on Friday, 9.00 p.m. Vaisnys said there was a need to know the reasons even of such a little radioactive leak. He mentioned one more reason of the stoppage - the first reactor is due to be stopped next month for routine repairs and "we need to be sure the second reactor operates without problems".
