The Commissioner also announced that he would begin intensive study of the future of relations with the countries of Central and East Europe in the field of agriculture. He also presented the farmers with a "much better assessment and prospects than some of us had thought some months ago, even weeks ago." The implementation of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] allowed for the withdrawal of 4.7 million hectares (more than the forecasts for this year), which largely contributed in maintaining cereal production at a level which "is not excessive," 165 million hectares. The set-aside regime will, moreover, become more attractive as premiums are increased, its applications widened and the administrative procedures simplified. Finally, the agreement on the Uruguay Round allows for protection to be increased and to enlarge the Community's market shares "in third solvent countries" while substantially lightening its budget thanks to the lifting of export refunds. But, to take full advantage, the agricultural sectors and the food industry will, in his opinion, have to try to "export less raw material and more processed products making sure that the labor used and added value remain here in Europe."
