The demonstrators emerged from five mosques in the Palestinian refugee camp, shouting "Death to Israel" and pledging to continue the armed struggle against the Jewish state, an AFP correspondent said. Banners read "Move Over 'Arafat" and "Down, Down 'Arafat." They carried green flags, a colour which symbolises Islam, and chanted Koranic verses, including: "There is no God but God." Some of the demonstrators tore up pictures of 'Arafat, whose support has fallen dramatically in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp since the signing of the September 13 PLO-Israel autonomy accord. Abu Ayyub, an official of the local al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, urged 'Arafat to give up the "treacherous accord" and urged all concerned parties to put an end to the Arab-Israeli negotiations. Around 200 demonstrators also protested in the Bass camp in the southern port of Tyre following a call by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), correspondent there said. Palestinian and fundamentalist groups, including factions of 'Arafat's Fatah organisation, vowed to avenge the killings on the West Bank. In a statement released in 'Ayn al-Hulwah they also called for an end to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the "reinforcement of the intifadah in the occupied territories." They urged the international community "to slap economic sanctions" on Israel and declared three days of mourning in 'Ayn al-Hulwah, home to around 75,000 people. Schools shut down in 'Ayn al-Hulwah as news of the massacre broke out here and shops were shuttered when the demonstration got underway. The PLO representative in Lebanon, Shafiq al-Hut, meanwhile called for an urgent meeting of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile which he said should be attended by non- PLO members as well. Al-Hut also said the peace talks should be called off. Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said the massacre "is the result of the encouragements given by the Israeli Government to extremists opposed to the peace process." "We can say that the Israeli Government is the accomplice of radical and extremist movements in Israel," Buwayz said. Palestinian dissident leader Munir Maqdah blamed 'Arafat's policies for the massacre and said that the PLO leader "has no other choice to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide." "Our response against the Israeli Army and the settlers will be strong," Maqdah said, adding that Palestinians opposed to the peace talks will use all the arms at their disposal in coordination with Hamas and the radical Islamic Jihad. At least 58 Palestinians were killed and dozens more were wounded when one or more settlers shot worshippers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and troops subsequently clashed with demonstrators.
