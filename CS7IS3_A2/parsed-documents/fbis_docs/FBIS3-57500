According to him, the replacement of individual members of the Cabinet of Ministers does not in any way signify a replacement of government policy, because it is determined personally by President Boris Yeltsin. Replying to a question from journalists on whether the present composition of the government was a coalition one, the deputy prime minister confirmed this. At the same time, he pointed out that previously, too, there were differing points of view on topical problems among members of the government, but nevertheless they succeeded in working out a common line. Aleksandr Zaveryukha gave it to be understood that the government reshuffle had been necessary after the recent Federal Assembly elections at which a considerable proportion of the electorate had come out against the shock therapy methods and had voted for representatives of the opposition.
