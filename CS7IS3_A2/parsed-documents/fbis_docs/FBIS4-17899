He attended a session of the Russo-Indian commission on aviation among a widely-representative delegation of the Russian aircraft industry and a number of leading design bureaus. "A specific example of such cooperation has been provided by the initialing of an agreement in Delhi on the establishment of a joint venture for the maintenance of MiG aircraft that are in service with the Indian Air Force and for the manufacture of spare parts for them," Belyakov said. "Along with our design bureau, the agreement was initialed by representatives from the `Moscow Aircraft Industry Amalgametion' and the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) company. "The realisation of the agreement will began immediately after it is approved by the governments of the two countries. This is expected to be done during the forthcoming visit of Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Moscow in summer," Belyakov said. The two sides discussed the technical aspects modernising MiG-21- Bis aircraft, which are to be fitted out with Russian-, Indian- and Western-made equipment, at HAL enterprises. The aircraft will be provided with new weapons and systems to control them and on-board instrumentation. This will increase the aircraft's combat potential several-fold, including its target spotting capability, Belyakov said. Touching upon prospects for the purchase of an additional batch of Russian aircraft by India, Belyakov said it showed interest in buying ten MiG-29 aircraft. The Russian delegation officially offered a MiG-at training aircraft which the Air Force of the republic acutely needs, and suggested that the Indian side not only purchase these aircraft, which by their performance excel the British Hawk and the French Alpha jet aircraft which compete for the local market, but also co-develop and produce them.
