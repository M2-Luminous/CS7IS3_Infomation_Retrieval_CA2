Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23FEB94-CHINA-INDIA Border Talks Achieve Limited Progress Chinese media coverage of the first meeting of Chinese and Indian diplomatic and military experts on Sino-Indian border issues suggests that while some progress was made, problems remain over how to proceed with the reduction of troops on the Sino-Indian border. The meeting, held in New Delhi from 2-4 February, took place as a followup to the border accord signed by the two countries last September that created a team of experts to help the Sino-Indian Joint Working Group implement the border agreement. Xinhua on 4 February reported that the two sides "basically reached consensus on certain issues" and that the border experts agreed to hold another meeting in Beijing within the "next few months." Although there was no further elaboration on the areas of agreement, Chinese media comment suggests that the two sides continue to differ over the issue of troop reductions along the border. The 4 February Xinhua report alluded to the problem when it noted that the two sides "exchanged views" on "solving as early as possible" the question of "close-range military confrontation in certain territorial sectors" on the border. Similarly, Xinhua noted on 14 January that the Indian Army chief of staff, in an interview that day, had "apparently made reference to" the "large number of force levels that would become available" for other uses once the border agreement was implemented. Despite remaining differences over the troop reduction issue, Beijing has indirectly signaled that it continues to see China- Indian relations as steadily improving. An article appearing in the 4 February edition of the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po quoted PRC Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng as saying that the "tense situation" between China and India is "now history," that the two countries are "working hard to regain lost time," and that relations are "improving step by step."
