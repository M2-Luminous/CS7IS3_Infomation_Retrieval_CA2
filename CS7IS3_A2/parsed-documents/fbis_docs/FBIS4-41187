He said that economic restructuring was unthinkable without foreign loans and that a preparatory period of about 15 months was needed to secure them. The government is proposing a three-stage program, said Tereshchenko. In June to December 1995, the main accent will be put on domestic resources, the rate of inflation will be lowered to about 10 percent and relative stabilization of the national currency will be attained. From January to September 1995, the government intends to secure a medium-term credit, accelerate integration with Russia and the CIS countries, and receive loans from the G7. The third stage will mark the beginning of a new economic course, he said. Foundations for enhancing the population's living standards and promoting industrial production will be laid. The government will continue to pursue a tough anti-inflation policy, lower taxes, carry out a banking reform and accelerate privatization. Tereshchenko said that "one could no longer implement reform without financing the social sphere." "Otherwise, reforms will be resisted," he said. He also said that the national funds must be spent with care and urged the parliament to support the government-proposed budget. "If we manage to implement a tough budget, the task of securing foreign loans will be much easier," he said.
