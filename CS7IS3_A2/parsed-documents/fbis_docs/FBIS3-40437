He sustains that I, in this ministry that "keeps watch over" the Italian Space Agency (ASI), should have held a more balanced position on the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] project, that was more in keeping with my important responsibility. Saying this, he ignores the fact that the minister is not only vigilant, but also exercises guiding functions for scientific and technological programs and for programs applied to these subjects, and gives directives as far as the participation of the ASI in national and international programs is concerned. It was therefore my duty to examine the main aspects of the SAX program, which is the subject of a specific agreement between the ASI and the Dutch space agency. I have tried to clarify two key points: 1. Is it true that the cost of the SAX project has continued to increase, generating continual waste, and that it is out of control? 2. Is the project valid from a scientific point of view? There is ample official documentation regarding the first point, from which it results that the total cost for the project foreseen today is the same as that calculated in 1988 (this was the time when the ASI was set up), and indicated in the national space plan for 1990-94 that was approved by the CIPE [Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning] in July 1991. All increases in the cost of the program took place before 1988 and Ruffini knows well that the most important component of this increase in cost was the change in the program that took place following the accident of the United States Challenger in 1987, that brought about the decision of NASA to refuse the availability of the Shuttle for the SAX mission. Therefore to speak of irregularities and unlawful administrative acts totaling 641 billion lire is misleading, and does not in fact correspond with the communications sent to the ASI by the Italian audit department. On the second point, I would like first of all to recall that Ruffini himself (who at the time was president of the scientific committee of the ASI), in his official report to the board of directors, presented on 13 and 26 November 1991, stated: "The national scientific project in which the agency is placing the greatest technological and economic commitment is without doubt that of the SAX satellite, called for by the scientific community and needed by the national space plan to allow national industry to become qualified at the level of prime contractor for a scientific satellite." So, a little more than two years ago, when the current cost had been known for some time and had been stressed, Ruffini was a convinced supporter of the validity of the SAX program. Evidently he has changed his mind since then. This would be completely legitimate, if his current opinion were accompanied by an indication of the new facts, on a scientific level, that in these two years have made the validity of the SAX project fade. I myself, before being nominated minister, was on a commission that was coordinated by the president of the National Academy of the Lincei, Giorgio Salvini, and that comprised including myself, the president of the Papal Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, European Space Agency Council President Francesco Carassa, and State Advisor Filippo Patroni Griffi. In reply to a precise question put to us by the minister, we concluded that the SAX project should be largely attributed -- precisely because of the goals that it had been given -- to the program for basic research. In the same report we expressed deep concern about the time of execution, indicating, on the basis of the information available to us, that a delay beyond December 1994 would have been damaging to the program. In July 1993, soon after I had taken over the responsibility for the ministry, I learnt that the date for the launching of SAX had been moved to December 1995. I therefore had to ascertain whether this further delay would have reduced the scientific value of the project to such a level that it was advisable to end it, even if the expenditure that had already been sustained, and the expenditure that was contractually pledged irreversibly had in any case made it necessary to spend between 75 and 80 percent of the 614 billion lire that made up the total cost of the undertaking. I was informed, during a meeting that I had with the International Scientific Committee on the SAX project, that other ESA and NASA missions for X-ray astronomy had been subjected to a parallel delay and that therefore the space of time for the full scientific validity of the project had been put forward. A panel, nominated at my request, by the president of the European Space Science Committee of the European Space Science Foundation, Heinrich Volk of the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, came to an analogous result. This panel comprised Professor J. Bleeker of Utrecht, a scientist responsible for SAX in the Netherlands, Professor T. Courvoisier of Geneva, Professor J.L. Culhane of London and Professor H.W. Schnopper of Lyngby, Sweden. The panel formulated the following recommendation: "Having considered the composition of the scientific component of the SAX program and the work that is planned for this mission, and having compared these with those of the missions that are currently operative and planned for the near future, we recommend that this program goes ahead dynamically to ensure a launch in 1995." Ruffini thinks that entrusting commissions that are nominated ad hoc to give advisory opinions about the individual problems is an attempt to force preconstituted solutions. This presupposes the intellectual dishonesty of who nominates the commissions and who accepts to be part of them, and I would like to know what leads him to believe that people that are esteemed by everybody for their moral integrity should behave in a way that is less than correct. In particular Ruffini builds up a hypothesis of trickery based on the fact that I, being at that time the president of the European Science Foundation (the most important organization with head office in Strasbourg that coordinates programs and networks of basic research in Europe and that is systematically consulted by the European Union Commission and by the European Space Agency), have in some way influenced the opinion of its space committee. By thinking this, he ignores the fact that whoever behaved in such a way would immediately be disqualified by the international scientific community. The discourteous behavior of Ruffini penetrates to the point of trying to intimidate gentlemen like Giampietro Puppi, one of the most eminent Italian physicists, who is effecting with competence and absolute dedication the difficult role of commissioner of the ASI, and dealing with Sergio Ristuccia, former judiciary and secretary general of the Italian audit department, in vulgar terms. The seditious accusations of Ruffini tend to give credit to, and to amplify, the hypotheses of irregularity and unlawful acts for which proceedings are in course, opened by the regional attorney of the Italian audit department, and I hope, that in the interest of the national space program, these can rapidly be brought to a conclusion, thereby bringing a situation of uncertainty, that leaves space for slanderers to do their far from noble work, to an end.
