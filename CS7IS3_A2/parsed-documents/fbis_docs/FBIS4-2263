With bowls and chopsticks in their hands, provincial CPC Secretary Li Changchun, and Deputy Secretary Song Zhaosu entered the student dining hall to have supper with the students. Inside the Zhengzhou University Student Dining Hall, Li Changchun, and Song Zhaosu lined up with students to buy rice and dishes using coupons they had brought themselves. While eating their supper, they made small talk with students from the literature, history, and philosophy departments, asking them about their monthly board expenses. They also asked them whether they were satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by the dining hall. A male student eating his supper at the same table as Li Changchun said: Our monthly board expenses are about 100 yuan and monthly board expenses for female students are about 70 yuan. Other students said that they were basically satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by the dining hall. After taking their supper, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu visited the cooks and management staff of the dining hall, asking questions about managing the dining hall and passing on the students' opinions and suggestions. Li Changchun said: I have learned that students are basically satisfied with the quality and price of food supplied by the dining hall. I hope that you will continue to make efforts to handle messing arrangements for students in an even better way. He encouraged the cooks and management staff to do everything possible to reduce costs of rice and dishes under the existing conditions to ensure a balance between receipts and payments. He stressed that surplus was unnecessary and that they must publish their accounts regularly. Through their hard work, they would send the warmth of the party and government to students. When the students learned that the provincial CPC Committee leaders were having supper with them, many crowded round and reported of their own accord their study and life style to the two leaders, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu, and also about the situation in their native places. The two leaders cordially encouraged them to study hard and fully improve themselves in terms of political thinking and studies, so that they could make their due contributions to the modernizations in their native places after their graduation. When it was getting dark, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu went to the offices of the university leaders to study with them ways to further strengthen management and properly handle the messing arrangements for students. Li Changchun urged university leaders to do this from the high plane of training qualified personnel for modernizations to ensure students' vigorous health and vim and vigor, so that they can study well. They put forward several specific demands. In the end they told the university leaders to go to student dining hall very often to observe and learn from real life. In doing so, they could have heart-to-heart talks with the students, discover the real situation, and heed their opinions in handling messing arrangements for students in an even better way.
