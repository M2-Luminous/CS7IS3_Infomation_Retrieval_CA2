SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program was authorized by section 6001 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914. The program is expected to enhance the educational level of the transportation work force in the United States. The program will contribute to the talent pool in transportation because it encourages students from their senior year through the post doctorate level to pursue careers in fields related to transportation. The Eisenhower Program is a DOT-wide fellowship program and is managed by the National Highway Institute. The program was developed in the Summer of 1992. The first fellowships were awarded in the Spring of 1993. FY 1994 funding for the program was $2 million and served 125 fellows; FY 1995 funding for the program is also $2 million. All fellows must be in a field of study which is directly related to transportation. For students pursuing degrees, the fellow's degree program must contain a major, minor, or emphasis in transportation. In addition, each fellowship has specific requirements unique to that fellowship. The six fellowships are: Eisenhower Graduate Fellowships, to enable students to pursue Masters Degrees or Doctorates in transportation-related fields at the school of their choice; Eisenhower Grants for Research Fellowships (GRF), to acquaint students with transportation research, development, and technology transfer activities at the U.S. Department of Transportation; Eisenhower Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Fellowships, to provide HBCU students with additional opportunities to enter careers in transportation (announcements are issued by recipient HBCU's); Eisenhower Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Fellowships, to provide HSI students with additional opportunities to enter careers in transportation; (announcements are issued by recipient HSIs); Eisenhower Post Doctorate Fellowships, to enable GRF students to continue research initiated during a GRF assignment; and Eisenhower Faculty Fellowships, to provide talented faculty in transportation fields with opportunities to improve their transportation knowledge, including attendance at conferences, courses, seminars, and workshops. Applications must be submitted by February 17, 1995, and will be evaluated by review panels. All applicants will be notified of the results of the panel evaluation.
