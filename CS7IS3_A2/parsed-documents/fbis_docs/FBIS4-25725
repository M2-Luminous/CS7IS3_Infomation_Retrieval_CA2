The automation system for headquarters command of field operations produced by the ground forces staff academy was put into use for teaching in early May. The six vocational skills of reading, taking notes, calculation, writing, drawing, and transmission done by hand by staff officers of headquarters for many years have become the "bottleneck" affecting and restricting headquarters' command efficiency due to the low speed and efficiency. Organizing personnel to tackle key difficulties for more than two years, the ground forces staff academy produced an automation system for headquarters' command of field operations, thus realizing automatic handling of staff work. Applying this system, staff officers, merely by pressing keys, can analyze roads, river systems, bridges, and many other essential elements of topography without maps, compasses, measuring rules, and other tools. The system can display the three-dimensional pictures of the topography of battlefields from various angles and altitudes, automatically measure and judge the distance, area, and the general view, and, in line with the tactical background, automatically produce special pictures of parachute landing, cross-country, and other operations. Its data base stores accurate and reliable materials on several hundred thousand characters and symbols, several hundred sets of pictures and figures, and more than a hundred thousand data, which can be consulted at will and classified for display. This system is able not only to "calculate" the mobility, command, and battle capacity of troops through the computer but also to incorporate the latest achievements of foreign army to replace the traditional and simple comparisons of persons and weapons with a more scientific comparison of combat capacity. Based on the quantity and quality of the military strength and weapons of the enemies and ourselves, this system may take into consideration the environment, operations, behaviors, and other factors in an all-around manner to predict who is to win and advance, who is to lose and retreat, thus making command and policy making more scientific. Through the system, man can talk to machines to have various combat orders, instructions, and plans automatically worked out. What is more significant, the system has bravely reformed the traditional command process and made it possible to have combat orders worked out at the moment when the commander is making a decision and have orders issued immediately after the decision is made. Applying this system, a military mark can be made in one minute and is easy to use and revise. This system also makes automatic adding of cipher and instantaneous transmission of words and pictures possible and can be connected with the current telecommunications equipment of the Army. It is convenient to carry and convenient for field operations.
