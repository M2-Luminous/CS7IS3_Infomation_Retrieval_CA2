Fedotova report over video, including interview with Ye.N. Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee for Sanitation and Epidemiological Supervision (Sanepidnadzor); from the "Utro" program -- place and date not given; recorded] [Text] Fedotova: Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, even last year the number of cases of diphtheria infection increased to such an extent in the country that medical officials repeatedly said that an epidemic is at hand. Is this true? Belyayev: Yes, it is. In fact, as of today we have registered more than 15,000 cases of diphtheria -- 4,500 of them are children, and 388 people have already died, including 79 children. So we must talk about the threat of an epidemic. [video cuts to show hospital, children being immunized] Fedotova: Yevgeniy Belyayev considers that science has provided a reliable substance to combat diphtheria. The disease can be reduced to just a few odd cases while the threat of an epidemic can be completely eliminated if 95 percent of children and 80 percent of the entire population of the country undergo a proper series of vaccinations. However, only about 72.6 percent of children are being vaccinated during their first year, and 81.9 percent by the age of three. What is the reason for these low figures? Yevgeniy Belyayev thinks there are several. Here are some of them: An unjustifiably broad spectrum of conditions counterposing medical evidence in the country's present treatment facilities. In fact there are eight of them. In the United States there are only two -- a high fever or some immune deficiency. These are the only grounds excusing American children from compulsory inoculation. Another problem is that the annual schedules for vaccinations of the population have been altered four times in the past 12 years and this has given rise to shortcomings in the organization and implementation of the vaccination campaign. [video again shows Fedotova talking to Belyayev] And what about those strange parents who prevent their children from being vaccinated for various reasons. It seems that this is the way people are -- they wait until it is too late. As a matter of fact, Yevgeniy Belyayev unequivocally challenged one of the claims made by recalcitrant parents that domestic vaccines are of poor quality. He said our preparations correspond to the requirements of world standards; they have been tested and recognized and will help stop the epidemic. Belyayev: Together with scientists and officials of the Ministry of Health and other interested departments we developed a federal program of preventive vaccinations last year. It was approved by the government and it envisages considerable allocations of funds. We adopted a decision to inoculate the entire population during 1994-95. The state recognizes its responsibility to defend you from diphtheria. You too should accept the responsibility for immunizing your children. Have them vaccinated this year. This will prevent you from getting ill. Without detailed, conscientious, precise, and well-organized work in every polyclinic, every school, and every adult outpatients clinic we will not solve the problem. All children's immunization charts and health records need to be checked. I would also like to appeal to the producers. We have two enterprises turning out the vaccines. Do everything to ensure that we have a sufficient quantity of vaccine this year. You can do this. I must also appeal to workers of the State Sanitation and Epidemiological Service. Do not limit yourselves to helping in organizing this work. To help is your sacred task. But you, epidemiological physicians, have been invested with extensive rights. You must perform the function of supervision. You must demand maximum compliance. Fedotova: Another thought was expressed during our conversation. Belyayev: Recently our service has adopted a strict policy of strengthening supervisory functions and many are unhappy about this. They do not like it. Attempts are again being made to make our service subservient to some other department, and to belittle its role in society. However this process is irreversible everywhere in the world. It is a state service, and that is how it ought to be. Efforts to make it part of some department are an attempt to curry favor with the shadow economy and shady people engaged in small business, and I think that in this case we should take a firm stand.
