Fujii attributed the sharp decline to the muddy outlook in the political scene ahead. But "(stock price fluctuations) are a common phenomenon," he said. "We will wait and see for the time being," he said. The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues plunged more than 4 percent during the two-hour session in a negative reaction to the defeat on Friday of the government's political reform bills in the House of Councillors.
