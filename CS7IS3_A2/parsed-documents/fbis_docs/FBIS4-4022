He stated a six-point proposition for developing China's economic cooperation with Central Asian nations. When Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Kazakh Prime Minister Tereshchenko, arrived at the conference hall, he was accorded a warm welcome by several hundred entrepreneurs and economic and trade officials. Abishev, Kazakh deputy prime minister and minister of foreign economic relations, spoke first. He said: Kazakh enterprises are greatly interested in developing economic cooperation and trade with China. China already has some 170 joint ventures here. They involve a wide range of businesses and play an important role during the course of Kazakhstan's economic development. He said: "Kazakhstan and China are mutually complementary in economics and there is a great potential for cooperation between them. Premier Li Peng's current visit will further promote bilateral economic cooperation and trade." Premier Li Peng said in his speech: The Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing economic cooperation and trade with Kazakhstan. Accompanying me on the trip here are the persons in charge of five major Chinese corporations dealing in construction engineering, petroleum and natural gas, iron and steel, textiles, and import-export of electronic products respectively. They are here to have direct contacts with Kazakhstan's enterprises and to explore ways of expanding cooperation. Extending his welcome to Kazakh entrepreneurs to visit China, Li Peng said: "Enhancing understanding is the basis for developing cooperation." Premier Li Peng stated a six-point proposition for further developing China's economic cooperation and trade with Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations: 1. Cooperation should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's needs, benefit each other, stick to the principle of exchange at equal values, and basically maintain a balance of trade, which should be regularized. The setting up of joint ventures should benefit both or all parties, with the fundamental purpose to help develop the national economies of relevant countries. 2. Cooperation should be developed in diversified forms. While barter trade takes up a big portion in bilateral trade at present, cash payment trade represents the trend of development. Of course, there must be an adequate means of banking settlement to conduct cash payment trade. The Chinese Government fully agrees with the Central Asian nations' hope to develop economic cooperation with different parts of China, in addition to the nearby Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 3. Economic cooperation should proceed from the actual conditions, with full use of local resources. Economic cooperation follows a course of gradual development from small to large quantity and from lower to higher level. Market prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very beginning of joint ventures. Market demand is an important factor deciding the survival of enterprises. We should take full advantage of local resources such as raw and processed materials, and enable enterprises to bring in good economic returns with competitive products. To do so, we should give full play to the role of those enterprises which have both strength and good reputation. 4. Communications and transportation need to be improved with a view to building a new "Silk Road." To further expand economic cooperation and trade, it is essential to gradually improve communications and transportation. The Chinese railways minister and Kazakh transportation minister have held fruitful talks and reached an important agreement. The two sides should strive to ensure smooth traffic through the Euro-Asia continental bridge, to bring benefits to the peoples of all countries concerned. 5. The small amount of economic assistance China has provided the Central Asian nations within its means is only a symbol of friendship. China itself remains a developing country with a very low per-capita GNP and faces an arduous task of economic development. China is providing assistance within its power to some developing countries, including Central Asian nations, but the assistance is very small in amount. It is only a symbol of friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of those countries. 6. China is willing to develop multi-lateral cooperation to promote common development. China's open policy is meant for the developing countries as well as the developed nations, particularly the neighboring countries. While China will maintain and further develop friendship and cooperation with Kazakstan and other Central Asian nations, it is also willing to see the growth of trade, economic cooperation and friendly contact between them and other countries. It is a matter of course that other countries will come to invest and run factories in Central Asian countries. China is ready to participate in equal and fair competition. China seeks no spheres of economic or political influence in Central Asia. Premier Li Peng's speech won warm applause among Kazakh economic and trade officials and entrepreneurs.
