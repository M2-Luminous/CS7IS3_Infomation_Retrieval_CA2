"Are you declaring a war?" "You declared a war first. Seoul is not far from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will also be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, you will not be safe, either." Dialogue held between Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate and vice minister of the National Unification Board [NUB] and Pak Yong-su, chief North Korean delegate and deputy director of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, was aired nationwide that day on the nine-o'clock [12:00 GMT] evening news, and North-South relations now face a situation which is dominated not by issues of dialogue and negotiations, but by issues of confrontation and security that call for the deployment of Patriot missiles and warnings of withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Even though the image was blurred, the North Korean delegate's "extreme remarks" were conveyed vividly like a live broadcast, and can be viewed as a threat to the South. Attention is now focusing on why the contents, which might amplify people's fears, were allowed to be broadcast without any filtering. Scenes of none of the seven contacts to date were reported. Only the greeting sessions prior to talks were open to reporters and photographers. While North Korea's remarks at the last contact were far more serious than its previous "threats," the government's release of footage of the talks to broadcasting stations was also exceptional, especially when considering that the talks were, as before, held in "closed session." Heads of relevant departments, including the Vice Premier and NUB Minister and the Senior Presidential Secretary for foreign affairs and security, were able to watch the development of the talks even though the North-South contacts at Panmunjom were held in closed sessions, to allow for quick evaluation of developments in the talks, quick countermeasures, and provision of new guidelines in answer to the other side's position. While only audio is available when talks are held at the North side's Tongilgak, both audio and video are available through closed-circuit television [CCTV] when talks are held in the South side's Peace House. Furthermore, it has been learned that CCTVs are installed at Chongwadae [presidential office], the Secretariat for North-South talks, and the Agency for National Security Planning, so policymakers monitoring the talks on the CCTVs, clearly heard the North Korean delegate Pak Yong-su's remarks of "Seoul sea of fire," as the eighth contact happened to take place at the Peace House. Details of how the government came to the decision to release the contents on video tapes to broadcast stations are unknown. It did not take the government very long, however, to decide to "vividly" convey the remarks in question to the people. Around 2 PM [05:00 GMT] that day, less than three hours after the talks had ended, the NUB asked broadcast station reporters who were covering the day's talks if there were any technical problems in airing footage recorded from the CCTV and when their deadlines were. In answer to the question of whether this would violate the agreement between the South and the North to keep the talks closed, the NUB explained that North Korea had also made the contents of the talks public. This later turned out to be a poor excuse. It was 9:00 PM [12:00 GMT] in the evening the next day [20 March] when North Korea reported the eighth contact in detail through its CENTRAL BROADCAST. Concerning this, an NUB official said: "The video tape was released to convey the fact to the people matter-of-factly that North Korea made such intimidating remarks." After viewing the two-minute-and-forty-second tape, a broadcast station executive asked related departments, including the Chongwadae, for confirmation that the contents were allowed to be aired. The answer from the Chongwadae was: "We are aware of the fact." The announcement of the decision to deploy Patriot missiles, whose deployment was the subject of much controversy, was subsequently made during the security-related ministers' meeting on 21 March.
