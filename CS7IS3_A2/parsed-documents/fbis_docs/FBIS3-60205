The full Bench of the Supreme Court accepted the accused's bail plea. The Bench was composed of acting Chief Justice Shafiul Rehman, Justice Abdulqadir Chowdhery, and Justice Ghani Mohammed. The suspect Asima was accused of trying to smuggle two kilograms of heroin in London and was arrested at Heathrow airport. She was returned to Pakistan and the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board had taken her into custody. The accused was sent to jail where she later spent 10 months and 18 days. Her appeal for bail was refused by various courts before it. However, the Supreme Court because of her gender has released her on a bail of 100,000 rupees. Two other persons, Matlub Hussein and Ziaul Din, were also arrested when Asima had fingered them. They have been jailed. Ilias Siddiqi represented Asima in the bail proceedings and Attorney General Mumtaz Ali argued on behalf of the government.
