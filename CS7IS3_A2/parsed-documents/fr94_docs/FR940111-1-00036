SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background for This Action Regarding Section 211(m) of the Act Motor vehicles are significant contributors of carbon monoxide emissions. An important measure toward reducing these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starts, which are more prevalent in the winter. Section 211(m) of the Act requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment areas with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each state's oxygenated gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide. Under section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months unless a state can demonstrate that, because of meteorological conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances outside of such reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992. 1 1 See ``Guidelines for Oxygenated Gasoline Credit Programs and Guidelines on Establishment of Control Periods under section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act as Amended_Notice of Availability,'' 57 FR 47849 (October 20, 1992). In addition to the guidance on establishment of control period by area, EPA has issued guidance related to the oxygenated gasoline program. On October 20, 1992, EPA announced the availability of oxygenated gasoline credit program guidelines in the Federal Register . 2 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content than is required (i.e., an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight. 2 See footnote 1. EPA issued guidelines for credit programs under section 211(m)(5) of the Act. EPA issued labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These labeling regulations were published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992. 3 3 See ``Notice of Final Oxygenated Fuels Labeling Regulations under section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act as Amended_Notice of Final Rulemaking,'' 57 FR 47769. The labeling regulations may be found in 40 CFR 80.35. The Oxygenated Gasoline Program areas in the State of Colorado are designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide and classified as moderate with design values of 11.3, 11.8, and 16.2 parts per million, respectively, for the Fort Collins-Loveland control area, the Colorado Springs control area, and the Boulder-Denver 4 control area, based on 1988 and 1989 data. 5 Under section 211(m) of the Act, Colorado was required to submit a revised SIP, meeting the criteria specified in section 110 and part D of title I of the Act, which includes oxygenated gasoline programs for the Fort Collins-Loveland MSA, the Colorado Springs MSA, and the Boulder-Denver MSA, by November 15, 1992. 6 On November 27, 1992, Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado, submitted to EPA a revised SIP including the oxygenated gasoline program that was adopted by the State on September 17, 1992, which updates the State's existing oxygenated gasoline program based on the criteria outlined in EPA's program guidance. EPA summarizes its analysis of the state submittal below. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) dated September 25, 1993, which is available from the Region 8 office, listed in the Addresses section. 4 See credit program guidelines in footnote 3, wherein the November 15, 1992 SIP revision due date was specified. 5 See ``Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes,'' 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). 6 See credit program guidelines in footnote 3, wherein the November 15, 1992 SIP revision due date was specified. 1. Type of Program and Oxygen Content Requirement As discussed above, section 211(m)(2) of the Act requires that gasoline sold or dispensed for use in the specified control areas contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Under section 211(m)(5), the EPA Administrator issued guidelines for credit programs allowing the use of marketable oxygen credits. The State of Colorado, by the authority of the Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC), has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area, not allowing for the use of marketable oxygen credits. The following sections of this notice address some specific elements of the State's submittal. Parties desiring more specific information should consult the TSD. 2. Applicability and Program Scope Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period based on air quality monitoring data and established by the EPA Administrator. Colorado has established control periods consistent with the EPA guidance. The control period for all of Colorado's affected areas begins on the first day of November each year and ends following the last day of February. Colorado State oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline to be sold in the Fort Collins-Loveland MSA, the Colorado Springs MSA, and the Boulder-Denver MSA, consistent with the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. 3. Transfer Documents Colorado has no requirements related to transfer documentation in its oxygenated gasoline regulation. EPA feels that the State's policy of presumptive liability provides the incentive for all parties to ensure gasoline meets the oxygen content requirements of the program. In lieu of transfer documentation indicating oxygen content, the State provides for presumptive liability on the part of the party in possession of gasoline found to be in violation of the required oxygen content, and allows for no defenses. The State has historically inspected refineries, bulk fuel storage plants, fuel distribution plants, pipelines, and retail station for fuel compliance, holding all parties responsible to meet oxygen content requirements for gasoline in their possession. 4. Enforcement and Penalty Schedules State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states visit at least 20% of regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling and record review. In addition, each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should reflect the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental harm associated with the violation. The Colorado oxygenated gasoline regulation is legally enforceable by the Colorado Department of Health, Division of Air Pollution Control (APCD). The APCD is committed to the enforcement of this program requiring a level of sampling greater than EPA's recommendation for the sampling of 20% of all oxygenated gasoline dispensing sites. Violation of this regulation results in a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of violation. The APCD considers three factors when assessing penalties: the penalty constraint; the economic benefit of noncompliance; and a gravity component taking into consideration the intentional nature of the violation, whether the violator cooperated with the APCD, whether a repeat violation has occurred, the actual oxygen content of the sample, and an other relevant factors as detailed in the Oxygenated Gasoline Program Policy and Procedure Manual (Procedure Manual), published by the Colorado Department of Health, Air Pollution Control Division, October 1992. Penalty authority is contained in section 25&hyph;7&hyph;122 C.R.S. 5. Test Methods and Laboratory Review Each state regulation must include a test method. EPA's guidelines recommend the use of the OFID test, although parties may elect to use ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 or another method, approved by EPA. EPA has tentatively approved a variation of the ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 testing method for use in Colorado, as detailed in the Procedure Manual. The State may continue to use this testing method unless otherwise instructed by EPA. EPA has established an interim testing tolerance, which states appropriate ranges for credit and per-gallon programs. 7 As EPA states in the memorandum, for a per-gallon program, such as adopted by Colorado, the purpose of the testing is to determine whether the gasoline contains less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Colorado is using testing tolerances consistent with the tolerances in the EPA memo. 7 See Memorandum dated October 5, 1992 from Mary T. Smith, Director, Field Operations and Support Division to State/Local Oxygenated Fuels Contacts. 6. Labeling EPA was required to issue Federal labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These regulations, published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992 8 , required the following statement be posted for a per-gallon program or credit program with minimum oxygen content requirement: 8 See footnote 3. ``The gasoline dispensed from this pump is oxygenated and will reduce carbon monoxide pollution from motor vehicles.'' The Federal regulation also specifies the appearance and placement requirements for the labels. EPA has strongly recommended that states adopt their own labeling regulations, consistent with the Federal regulation. Colorado has adopted labeling regulations which conform to Federal regulation. B. Background for This Action Regarding Regulation No. 13 Prior to the Requirements of Section 211(m) of the Act On August 6, 1990, the Governor of Colorado submitted additional revisions to Regulation No. 13. The Regulation 13 amendments were necessary because the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) found that progress toward attaining the carbon monoxide (CO) standard was not adequate to meet the December 31, 1987, Clean Air Act deadline. The August 6, 1990, revisions required between December 1 and March 1 of each winter season, a 2.6 percent level of oxygen for all gasoline except premium unleaded. EPA recognizes that this, August 6, 1990, revision to Regulations No. 13 does not meet EPA's current guidance for oxygenated gasoline programs. However, Colorado's present SIP revision, November 27, 1993, for the oxygenated gasoline program amends the State's existing program, which includes elements that were contained in the past SIP revision, August 6, 1990. EPA is also proposing to approve this past revision, in order for the SIP to be considered fully approved. Request for Public Comment The EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the address above. Comments must be received on or before February 10, 1994. Proposed Action EPA is proposing to approve the revisions to the Colorado SIP for both Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated gasoline program) revisions, meeting the requirements of section 211(m) of the Act. Executive Order This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
