Greater confidence has been placed in the private sector in this second 25-year development period than in the previous PJP. During PJP I the government gave the private sector a 60-percent role in total national investment; in the upcoming 25-year period the private sector will be given an even greater role, i.e., about 73 percent and the remaining 27 percent will remain the responsibility of the government. This means that during PJP II the private sector, including the State-Owned Corporations (BUMN) and cooperatives, must be able to provide 660 trillion rupiahs of total national development, a very large figure. How will the private sector furnish or try to find such a large amount? The only way is for it to work harder than it has to date. In addition, the government must create a climate conducive to its development and determine which part of the private sector must be given the highest priority in playing a role and developing. The government has said that in developing the private sector small and medium businesses have been given the highest priority. This is in line with trends found in other countries, in which the role of large businesses (conglomerates) will shift more and more to small and medium businesses. Nevertheless, the government warns that private participation in national development should not depend on foreign loans. It cannot be denied that foreign loans are needed for development but if the amount is too great, it will harm Indonesia. In that connection, it is hoped that the private sector will no longer dream of glory by continuing to force the construction of megaprojects. These require large amounts of money. Where is the money to come from if not from abroad? Also, the failure to build megaprojects due to the inability to pay off the foreign loans can prove fatal. It might increase Indonesia's "country risk" for foreign investors. It would be quite different if these megaprojects were 100 percent Foreign Capital Investments (PMA) because this would mean the introduction of foreign exchange into Indonesia, especially if the PMA is a state investment. However, we must also be careful with these 100-percent PMAs because a megaproject based on a 100-percent PMA might in fact use investment funds originating within the country. At the present time, Indonesia's "country risk," according to an evaluation made by an international institution, is triple B minus, not such a bad category. But if this is not watched or run carefully, it is quite possible that Indonesia will get a worse "country risk" rating. For example, the recent problems that the Bentoel cigarette factory in East Java experienced in paying off its foreign loans had serious consequences. A lack of trust in the Indonesian private sector developed abroad at that time. Nevertheless, that does not mean that foreign loans are unnecessary. They continue to be needed even though they are not without risk, especially if they are in foreign currency, for example Japanese yen or American dollars. Foreign loans can result in an increase in the Debt Service Ratio (DSR/ratio of installment debt to total value of exports) for which the government must assume responsibility. At the present time Indonesia's DSR is 32 percent, 21 percent of which is government debt and 11 percent is private-sector debt. Since foreign debt is not a government monopoly, in all honesty it is very difficult to detect private-sector foreign debt. "There is no monetary authority in the world which can control the traffic in private loans," said the Minister of Finance. The Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as a monetary authority, may not be able to find out whether someone in the private sector has obtained a secret loan from abroad. It is possible that many private companies do not register the foreign loans which they have obtained. [passage omitted] The private sector's role in national development will be challenged even more by the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT is a big opportunity for the domestic private sector to prove whether it can compete in international trade. Given our current work ethic, it is certain that we will not seize this opportunity. The Indonesian private sector, whether it wants to or not, must be able to produce goods which are more competitive in quality or in price than those produced by other countries. But it cannot just rely on itself. The various institutions closely connected with the private sector must provide support, especially capitalization, to allow it to compete in international trade. At the present time domestic bank interest rates do not support the development of the private sector very well. Interest rates of about 18 percent, which are relatively high compared with those in other countries, make it hard for domestic firms to compete in this era of globalization. Actually, in order to make the private sector a moving force in the next 25 years, the government must also pay close attention to the role of the capital market as a source of funding. The market had not yet played much of a role in PJP I, but PJP II is the time for the government to entrust the it with this vital role. No less a person than Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad would like the capital market to play a greater role, parallel to that of the money market, in funding national development. So, in order to make that market parallel to the money market the government has issued a policy allowing the use of stocks as additional collateral when submitting an application for credit. This policy would seem to be very simple, but since it is accompanied by certain conditions stating that not all stocks can be used as collateral for credit its effect has been to churn transactions on the capital market. Under these regulations, non-liquid stocks (sleeping stocks) to be used as collateral in applying for credit must be transacted first. Unwritten government stipulations concerning the Price Earnings Ratio (PER) have also supported this feverish activity. At first, on grounds of watching out for investor interests, especially small investors, the government set a maximum PER of 13 for a single issue of new stocks because a low PER means that initial offerings are within the reach of investors and will also give investors the opportunity for capital gains on the secondary market. However, the Minister admitted, prospective issuers (companies that go public) do not like a low PER because with a maximum PER of only 13 the hopes that issuers have of obtaining more funds by going public are only a dream. Not long afterwards, however, the government, in this instance the Capital Market Oversight Board (BAPEPAM), changed the maximum PER standard from 13 to 15. BAPEPAM's policy differs from the Minister of Finance's more conservative policy of wanting a maximum PER of 13. Irrespective of that difference, BAPEPAM has strong reasons for raising the maximum PER limit to 15. It is hoped that a PER of 15 will continue to protect investor interests while not harming the interests of issuers. Conditions very beneficial to both parties might provide an impetus for issuers to speed up the process of going public, which in turn might brighten the Indonesian stock market. Hopes are particularly high for State-Owned Corporations, which on average have performed better than companies going public at the present time. According to figures issued by the Indonesian Business Data Center (PDBI), there are about 24 BUMNs suitable for entering the capital market. Up to now, unfortunately, only Gresik Cement Inc has started to do so.
