The DN agrees with all of the points in the letter made public yesterday by the army chief, who said there is an organized political manipulation over the sorrowful death of young Jean Paul Genie. The DN expresses its solidarity with the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] in the face of an attempt to ruin the EPS' prestige and eliminate it through a campaign orchestrated by ultrarightist sectors from Nicaragua and the United States. The EPS has been fundamentally an instrument of defense of sovereignty and self-determination, peace and reconciliation, and our people admit that. The Army has shown a high spirit of institutional discipline, and it is a solid guarantee for the stability of Nicaragua. The government, the justice courts, civilian society, and the FSLN are obligated to consolidate that role. The FSLN hereby makes an appeal that tragic events such as the case of Jean Paul Genie not to be manipulated or politicized and that justice be expedited for the satisfaction of all Nicaraguans. Free fatherland or death. FSLN DN.
