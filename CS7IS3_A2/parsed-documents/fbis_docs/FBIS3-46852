De La Cruz] [Text] A total of 353 critical public infrastructure and social services projects, with an aggregate cost of P67.771 billion [Philippine pesos], has been approved by the Ramos Cabinet the other day to form part of the Core Public Investment Program (CPIP) next year, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday. Out of the total, only P23.008 billion will be shouldered by the national government as most of the projects will be funded either by international financial institutions or through internal cash generation resources of government-owned and controlled corporations [GOCCs]. In real budgetary terms, government will shell out P21.212 billion in local counterpart funds and subsidies to government corporations and the GOCCs will give P1.796 billion through their incomes. Based on the aide-memoire submitted to the President, the CPIP projects will be "spared from any budget cuts even if government's fiscal position worsens during the year," with the end view of "restoring government's effectiveness in implementing critical projects." Based on the approved list of core investments, agro-industrial development projects accounted for 55 projects amounting to P1.861 billion; human development sector, 64 projects costing P4.906 billion; infrastructure support sector, 222 projects worth P60.842 billion; development administration, five projects worth P12.896 million; and disaster mitigation projects, six projects worth P149.156 million. Among the selected projects, 188 are included under Category A, which is composed of ongoing and new foreign-assisted projects such as capital activities in basic education, water supply, health, nutrition, family planning, and, housing; 128 fall under Category B, which is composed of energy-related projects; and, 37 projects fall under Category C, which are locally funded. Based on the CPIP concept, the agencies concerned are tasked to immediately prepare their work and financial plans for the projects, which will be the basis for the budget releases to be made by the Department of Budget and Management [DBM]. "One unwritten rule which was adopted by the DBM is the 30 percent-30 percent-20 percent-20 percent quarterly budget release pattern for the CPIP projects," a NEDA official said. "Effectively, the projects will receive 60 percent of their share in the first half of the year." A performance contract will be drawn up between the agencies and President Ramos for closer monitoring of these projects.
