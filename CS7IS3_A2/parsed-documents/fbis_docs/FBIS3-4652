Japanese, French, British and other reptile Western media accepted the false report and are working with extra zeal to spread the fiction of "defection" of DPRK's forestry workers. The rumor is an unfounded propaganda and sheer fabrication, a mere intrigue to do harm to the DPRK. This is a malicious abuse and slander against the DPRK, a dignified country, and an unpardonable insult to the Korean working class who are masters of the country. The DPRK Government bestows all solicitudes upon the Korean forestry workers who are now working devotedly in the Far East with a single resolve to contribute to the development and prosperity of the country, so that they may feel not the slightest inconvenience in their life. And it grants many state benefits to their families in the homeland. It is unimaginable for the Korean forestry workers to turn their back on the beloved homeland and ask for "asylum" in the cursed society of South Korea, the workers who are devoting themselves to timber production with burning patriotic zeal, encouraged by the good benevolence of the socialist system. The rumor about "defection" of forestry workers spread by the South Korean puppets is a preposterous fabrication that could be invented customarily by two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a lie. It is only too clear that the rumor spread by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique as well as the persistent clamor about "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK is aimed at tarnishing the international image of the DPRK, doing harm to the cause of anthropocentric Korean-style socialism and frustrating joint timber production in the Far East at any cost. It is not hard to gather that also lurking behind it is the ridiculous intention of the puppets to divert elsewhere the people's attention in a bid to extricate themselves from the dilemma in which they find themselves now, hit hard at the 50th meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights now open in Geneva for the devastated human rights issue of South Korea. Deserving attention is the despicable move of Japanese and Western subsidized means of propaganda which readily accepted the false report and are misleading the public opinion. They have made no scruples of false propaganda, paying no heed to the authenticity of their news, for their sinister political aims and money-making. The unbiased public opinion cannot but be angry at such filthy and base behavior of theirs. Whatever intrigues the South Korean puppets and seditious forces of the West may hatch up, they cannot break the Korean people's singlehearted, rockfirm unity, nor can they destroy the socialist system of the DPRK which is demonstrating its invincible might. It is as foolish as trying to break a rock with eggs to make an attempt at destroying the socialist system of the DPRK with intrigues. The South Korean puppets and seditious forces of the West must look straight at the trend of the times and immediately stop their false propaganda aimed at harming the DPRK.
