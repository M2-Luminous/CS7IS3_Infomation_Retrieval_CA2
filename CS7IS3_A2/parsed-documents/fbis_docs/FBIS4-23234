In a radio broadcast, the chairman of the council, His Excellency David Kpomakpor, called for the immediate encampment of all fighters for the subsequent disarmament by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. The council says it finds it difficult to understand that while discussions about deployment of ECOMOG and disarmament are under way, some people are still fighting for territorial control. He called on Alhaji Koromah, Mr. Roosevelt Johnson, Dr. (George Buley), Mr. Charles Taylor, and others to stop the hostilities and urge their fighters to disarm. The council called on ECOMOG to begin effective deployment throughout the country and to take control of all entry points into the country and disarm all fighters according to the mandate given them by the Cotonou Accord.
