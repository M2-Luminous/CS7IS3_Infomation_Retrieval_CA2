The construction dates are still undecided, but this will be the world's first advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR). It was developed jointly by five electric power companies including Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric Power and Japan Atomic Power, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the government, and the U.S. company Westinghouse based on the Standardization Program for Third Generation Advanced LWRs. This plant will consist of Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4, which each will have an output of 1,420,000 kW. Previous PWR type LWRs have used a dual system emergency core cooling system (ECCS) but the APWR will have a quadruple system ECCS. Plans call for the reactor to used a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides (MOX) for fuel. At most, plutonium oxide will make up 33% of the fuel. However, Toru Ishii (Director, Nuclear Power Technology Administration Office, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) says, ``The APWR will have the capability to burn MOX with as much as 50% plutonium oxide,'' because it was designed for core and operational diversity. This plant will use a large core that can load 30% more uranium and yield 20% more output than Kansai Electric Power's Osaka NPP No. 4. Having this difference of more than 10% means the time until the next fuel replacement can be extended. It also has the advantage that the amount of heat produced by the individual fuels will be less, making things easier to control. The reactor will have a stainless steel neutron reflector positioned around the fuel assembly. The neutrons that have been wasted because they do not collide with fuel will be reflected once more into the center to increase burnup of the nuclear fuel. Yutaka Kurihara (Executive Director, Japan Atomic Power) says, ``Strictly speaking, the Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4 are not APRWs according to the Standardization Program for Third Generation LWRs'' because they do not include a spectral shift mechanism to increase burnup efficiency of the fuel. This mechanism has zirconium rods inserted in it, and later they are withdrawn and replaced with water. It is designed so that the increased water slows down the neutrons, and that enables efficient burnup of fuels that gradually become harder and harder to burn. Key: 1. Comparision of Core Construction; 2. Past PWR; 3. Spectral shift increases burnup efficiency by 10%. However, because the fuel cost accounts for only 20% of the total cost of nuclear power generation, it only reduces the total costs by about 2%. Moreover, maintenance and inspection of the device that raises and lowers the zirconium rods are delicate and complex operations, so Japan Atomic Power decided not to use it. A demand will arise about the year 2000 for refurbishing aging nuclear power plants in the U.S. At that time a new generation of reactors will be needed. The APWR and advanced boiling water reactors have become the prime candidates to fill that need.
