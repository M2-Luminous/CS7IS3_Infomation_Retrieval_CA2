Although the document is named regulations for management, it is actually a signal of opening up wider to the outside world. As a result, the regulations have attracted attention in banking circles in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States, which are ready to apply to open branches in mainland China. More than 10 years ago, foreign-funded financial organizations were allowed to set up representative offices or branches in the four special economic zones [SEZ] of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In recent years, foreign-funded banks have been allowed to set up offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other open cities along the coast. To meet the needs of the increasing number of foreign-funded financial organizations, the State Council promulgated the "Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded Banks and Sino-Foreign-Funded Banks in the SEZ's" on 2 April 1985, and the People's Bank of China promulgated the "Regulations for Management Over Foreign-Funded and Sino-Foreign-Funded Financial Organizations in Shanghai" on 8 September 1990. However, the two regulations were local documents and the provisions were too strict, which evoked complaints from many foreign investors. Compared with these two regulations, the unified national regulations for foreign-funded financial organizations, which will come into force on 1 April, are rather flexible. Figures from Hong Kong's financial circles say that the new regulations have increased the proportion of fixed assets of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations from 25 percent of net capital plus reserves to 40 percent. This move encourages foreign-funded financial organizations to increase investment and buy premises. Although the new regulations do not include renminbi businesses in the scope of foreign-funded financial organizations, some people say they are allowed to deal with "approved businesses in the country's currency and other foreign currencies." This shows that there is a possibility of Chinese financial authorities lifting restrictions on foreign-funded financial organizations dealing with renminbi business in a limited way. A financial expert pointed out: The new regulations turn convertible currency equivalent to the dollar into convertible currency equivalent to the renminbi, which has enhanced the status of the renminbi and has also paved the way for the renminbi to officially become an internationally circulated currency. According to the new regulations, provisions for the business scope of foreign-funded banks and foreign-funded financial organizations, include the following: Foreign exchange savings and lending, foreign exchange acceptance, approved foreign exchange investment, foreign exchange guarantees, foreign exchange transactions, investigations and consultations, and approved renminbi businesses and foreign currency trading. As foreign-funded banks have increasingly asked for permission to do renminbi business, Zhao Haikuan, director of the Finance Research Office of the People's Bank of China, said that foreign-funded banks will be allowed to deal with renminbi business sooner or later, but the problem is that the conditions are not ripe at present. The tax rate of Chinese banks on the mainland reaches as high as 55 percent, while that of foreign-funded banks is only 15 percent. As there is a wide gap between the two, it benefits one side and it would be impossible to introduce fair competition. Only when reform of the mainland's banking system is completed and commercial banks are established, which operate in the ways of a modern banking system, will it be possible for foreign-funded banks to deal with renminbi business and compete fairly with mainland banks. To date, there are 98 foreign-funded banks with branches or offices on the mainland. With the further deepening of China's economic structural reform and opening up, an increasing number of foreign-funded banks and financial organizations will set up branches and representative offices in China. Citicorp recently transferred its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai and became the first foreign-funded bank to set up a headquarters in China. J. P. Morgan, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez of France have gone to Shanghai one after another to discuss setting up branches there. More than 50 banks from countries and regions including Japan, the United States, France, Germany, and Hong Kong have also held talks respectively with the People's Bank of China Beijing branch on the possibility of establishing a joint bank. Taiwan financial consortia which intend to set up branches on the mainland include Juntai, Tungtisi, Tungyee, Leeba, and Yuantung. With the rapid development of China's economy and the implementation of the new regulations, it is estimated that more and more foreign-funded financial organizations will set up branches or offices on the mainland.
