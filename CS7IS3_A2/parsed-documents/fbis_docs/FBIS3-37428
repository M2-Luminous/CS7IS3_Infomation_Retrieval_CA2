"Lack of unity has hampered the opposition armed formations from taking radical measures to stabilize the situation in the republic," a spokesperson from the opposition headquarters told Interfax. According to the same sources, after the final unification of the opposition forces, the regime of President Dzhokhar Dudayev will be "more precarious than ever." Interfax asked several supporters of the opposition to comment on the proclamation of sovereignty by official Groznyy. "I do not need that kind of independence such as when my mother is not paid her pension for two years," Rizvan Gairabekov said. "Sovereignty proclaimed by a group of bandits, leads to surprising paradoxes: A person who was in prison at the same time with me is now a major of the Committee of National Security," he remarked. According to Zaindi Khajimuradov, Chechnya is now a "hotbed of crime." "Kidnapping of women, murders, vendettas have become wide spread and murderers and rapists are still free. We are an integral part of Russia. So why did it forget about us? Where are we living?" he said. The opposition headquarters showed Interfax a list of weapons which could be acquired in Groznyy: a Kalashnikov automatic gun is sold for 700,000-850,000 rubles, a Makarov gun for $600, a short gun for $1000, a 76-millimeter canon without battle scale of ammunition will cost 50,000 rubles, a howitzer goes for 30 Mn rubles and an APC for 5-6 Mn rubles.
