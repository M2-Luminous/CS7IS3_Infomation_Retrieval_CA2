As the Jordanian Government denounces the brutal aggression against innocent Muslims in Sarajevo and strongly condemns this fierce barbarism, which ignores all values, ideals, and human rights, it calls on the international community to move immediately to shoulder its responsibility to save the innocent Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the continuing aggression and to work toward ending the siege on the Bosnian capital. The Jordanian Government appeals to the UN Security Council, the United Nations, and human rights organization to work earnestly to stop the bloodshed and achieve security, tranquility, and peace for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina who are being exposed, day and night, to human rights violations before the eyes of the world.
