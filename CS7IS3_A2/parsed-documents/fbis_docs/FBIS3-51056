In this first contact at Langley, which U.S. presidents usually make, Clinton told the personnel at the world's largest espionage center that he "firmly trusts the intelligence reports he receives every morning" on the state of international affairs. Despite the warm welcome afforded to the visitor, the press and observers have said that Clinton is not "a totally likeable personality" for the espionage services because of his liberal past and lack of interest -- according to what is said -- in foreign affairs. The visit also serves -- in the opinion of the same sources -- to iron out "certain difficulties" between the CIA and the White House, stemming from a CIA report to Congress that cast Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide in a bad light, just when the Clinton administration was working on Aristide's return to Port-au-Prince. Another point of contention surfaced after last week's disclosure of secret radioactive experiments on humans in the United States after World War II, an affair that directly involves the CIA. The White House ordered its espionage agency to join the government investigations on these tests, which were even performed on newborns, the mentally retarded, and inmates, and to specify its involvement in these tests, a presidential adviser disclosed. "We are going to be working with the CIA, and we expect their cooperation," said George Stephanopoulos, one of President Clinton's top advisers. The big investigation was decided on yesterday at the executive mansion in a meeting attended by the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, as well as the National Security Council. But the espionage services were absent.
