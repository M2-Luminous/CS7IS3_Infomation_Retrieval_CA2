Chinese herb-compound, containing Huangqui (Radix astragali), Ciwujia (Acan thopanax Senticosus), etc. was administered by mouth to the patients and mice exposed to microwave, radiation or chemotherapy with anti-cancer drugs. Mice exposed to noise were treated with herb-compound containing panax ginseng and Linguisticum chuanxiong. Both Chinese herb-compounds have the same tonic character. The results in patients showed reduction of patient's complaints, increase of WBC and thrombocyte count, and recovery of immune function. All of the changes were significant. Increase of WBC and thrombocyte count, recovery of immune function, increase of corticosterone and serotonin content in blood, cerebrum and spleen were also found to be significant in mice treated with Chinese herb-compound as compared with the control mice. Improvement of many physiological functions in the whole body after treatment with Chinese herb-compounds of the same tonic character suggested that, different adverse environmental factors may cause same general reaction, the general depression syndrome, which has been described in our previous paper. Key words: depression syndrome, hematopoietic, immunity, serotonin, Chinese medical herbs.
