In a note to parliament, Weiss said there was no agreement so far to the requests, made in April, but that the government was continuing to seek an accord with the three countries. Denmark runs a refugee camp in Bosnia-Herzegovina and another in Croatia but the Croatian authorities last month refused to allow Denmark to set up another one there. Denmark has also offered shelter for some 18,000 refugees from ex-Yugoslavia but believes haven should be provided as close as possible to home to facilitate return and to cut government spending.
