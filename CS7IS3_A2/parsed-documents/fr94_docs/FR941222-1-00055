FR941222-1-00055 FR941222-1-00008 Discussion This waste is generated from the treatment of wastewaters from triarylmethane dye and pigment manufacturing. These wastewaters often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of other dyes and pigments. As a result, the wastewater treatment sludges typically are managed also as a commingled wastestream from the production of triarylmethane and any other dyes or pigments manufactured at the site. Based on the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the 1991 volume reported by the industry for this wastestream is 1,404 metric tons. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments is generated at only five facilities. The Agency's sampling program, which was conducted in support of this listing determination, included wastewater treatment sludge from one of the five facilities generating this waste. However, the facility was not manufacturing triarylmethane dyes or pigments during the time of the sampling activities. Therefore, the resulting absence of constituents attributable to the triarylmethane operations was not unexpected. In conclusion, based on insufficient characterization data, the Agency proposes to defer a listing decision on wastewater treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock). The Agency is proposing to conduct additional sampling on this wastestream and will publish a supplemental notice with a proposed listing determination. b. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock). Summary EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock) because the constituents in this waste were observed at concentrations that present low risk levels ( i.e. , calculated at less than 1E&hyph;6 for carcinogens and lower than 1 HQ for non-carcinogens) through ingestion of contaminated ground water, and no other hazardous constituents attributed to triarylmethane dye or pigment production were detected. Discussion Volume information reported by the industry in the 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire for the wastewater stream from triarylmethane dye and pigment production is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock) often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of azos and other dyes and pigments.
