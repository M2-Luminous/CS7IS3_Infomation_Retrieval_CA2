FR940325-0-00065 FR940325-0-00015 This action reduces the proportion of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel relative to other pollock products on board the vessel during a fishing trip from 10 to 7 percent. A reduction in the proportion of pollock roe that may be retained is one of several measures contained in a proposed rule, which invited comment through September 23, 1993 (58 FR 44643, August 24, 1993). The measure proposed at that time would have reduced the retainable roe proportion specified in the regulations from 10 percent to 5 percent. Seven letters of comments were received that addressed the retainable pollock roe proportion. They are summarized and responded to in the Comments Received section of this preamble. Other measures contained in the proposed rule published on August 24, 1993, would establish standard product types and recovery rates for groundfish products. Those measures are still under review by NMFS and will be covered in a separate final rule. Changes From the Proposed Rule The proposed rule would have amended §§672.20(i) and 675.20(j) of title 50 CFR to specify 0.05, rather than 0.10, as the allowable ratio of pollock roe to the round weight equivalents of other pollock products that may be onboard a vessel during a trip. NMFS has determined that the current 10 percent proportion of roe that is allowed to be retained when harvesting pollock is too high, given actual proportions that resulted during the 1991, 1992, and 1993 pollock fisheries in the BSAI, and that it should be reduced to 7 percent rather than to 5 percent as proposed. Under a roe retention rate of 10 percent, processors could ``top off'' with amounts of pollock roe by stripping roe from subsequent pollock catches and discarding the carcasses. Actual amounts of roe produced during the 1992 and 1993 pollock roe seasons show that processors typically produced pollock roe as an ancillary product as intended by the BSAI FMP. Roe production resulted in an overall proportion of less than 4 percent of pollock primary products. However, NMFS recognizes that this proportion represents an overall average proportion. Although NMFS acknowledges variation in pollock production throughout a season, individual processors may achieve higher proportions by topping off retained amounts of pollock round-weight equivalents with additional pollock roe. To allow too high a proportion could encourage this ``topping of'' practice. In determining that 7 percent should be the applicable limit, NMFS reviewed 1993 roe recovery information during the roe pollock fishing season, which was conducted between January 20 and April 15. These vessels were typically participating under Community Development Quotas during 1993 and achieved roe recoveries during a time when roe recovery was optimal. Data from 12 participating vessels, which produced 1,422 mt of pollock roe from 31,772 mt of retained pollock catch, show that the average roe recovery was 0.045 during the roe pollock fishing season. The highest average roe proportion achieved by any one vessel participating under Community Development Quotas was 0.072. The lowest proportion achieved by one of the 12 vessels was 0.020. An allowable proportion of 0.07 (rounded to the nearest 100th) would minimize amounts of roe that might be discarded as a result of regulations, while still complying with the intent of the Magnuson Act to prohibit roe stripping. Therefore, NMFS is implementing 0.07 as the allowable proportion of roe as measured against other pollock products rather than 0.05 as proposed. Response to Comments This action responds to concerns expressed in public testimony that the previously allowed retainable roe proportion of 10 percent does not successfully prohibit roe stripping. No additional comments to that effect were received during the comment period provided by the proposed rule. Seven comments were received from industry participants, primarily expressing concern that the proposed reduction to 5 percent would result in unnecessary economic loss to the industry. Comment 1: The proposed reduction from 0.10 to 0.05 of allowable pollock roe that may be retained is too low and will result in substantial economic loss. Average roe recoveries have been substantially lower than 0.10, which means that the average vessel is not topping off its retained pollock production with pollock roe. The average vessel, therefore, is not stripping pollock roe, and the reduction is not necessary. Response: NMFS has decided to reduce the limit to 7 percent rather than 5 percent. Seven percent is the highest average roe proportion achieved by any one vessel for which NMFS has records during the 1993 directed fishery for roe-bearing pollock. NMFS does not concur that substantial economic loss will result. Maintaining the existing 10 percent limit could encourage roe stripping when the average recovery is substantially less. This would be inconsistent with the Magnuson Act, which prohibits roe stripping. Comment 2: The proposed reduction in the amount of retainable pollock roe will discriminate against the offshore fleet. Response: When the Council developed Amendments 14 and 19 to the FMPs for the BSAI and GOA, it considered several options for implementing the Magnuson Act's ban on roe stripping. The Council's recommended alternative was based, in part, on the fact that the agency's ability to regulate on shore processing is limited under the Magnuson Act. Shorebased processing facilities may be subject to a State of Alaska policy that pollock roe stripping be eliminated to the fullest extent possible (AS 16.10.164). Classification
