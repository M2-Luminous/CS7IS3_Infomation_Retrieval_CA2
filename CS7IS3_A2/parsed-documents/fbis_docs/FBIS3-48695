While receiving a major shock, the LDP is desperately attempting to keep the changes to a minimum. Meanwhile, the coalition government parties are poised to attack the LDP en masse regarding the funds aspect, and an uproar is spreading throughout Nagata-cho. On 2 September [1993] following a conference of the Keidanren chairman and vice chairmen, Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa stated at a press conference, "There was a strong view that corporate donations per se are not bad. However, the political circumstances have changed, and there is strong criticism by public opinion. Therefore, the Keidanren has decided to halt mediation to respond to the new era, and has set forth a direction of abolishing corporate donations." Also, General Secretary Miyoshi pointed out that "among the 12 vice chairmen, three opposed Mr. Hiraiwa's proposal (abolition of mediation)." However, the Miyoshi statement was a false statement, akin to an announcement by the Imperial Staff Headquarters [during World War II]. One of those present says: "Three, including Vice Chairman Katsuhiro Utada and Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi, were in clear agreement with Mr. Hiraiwa, but nine either disagreed or expressed caution. Mister Hiraiwa was apparently determined to submit his resignation if his will was not accepted, and it ended as a railroaded breakthrough. A decision despite overwhelming opposition was unprecedented since Keidanren's inception." The Keidanren system of engaging in the accumulation of funds and distribution procedures--created after self-reflection over the shipbuilding scandals and lasting for 40 years--has come to an end. It is the result of Chairman Hiraiwa's judgment and determination. Even Hiraiwa himself was badly shaken. On 18 June [1993] at a press conference immediately after the dissolution, he stated as follows. "The LDP has splintered. However, we will continue our supportive posture regarding funds for the LDP. We are not considering the New Party for the time being." The financial circles responded with strong opposition. The political donations had been the realm of the Keidanren's exclusive authority, and the other economic organizations normally had no say in the matter, but the leaders are overpowered by the underlings in a turbulent era. Chairman Ken Nagano of the Nikkeiren [Japan Federationof Employers' Associations] said: "Political donations should be distributed to the conservative parties commensurate with their respective numbers of Diet seats." Furthermore, the following views continue to surface. "The Keidanren acts smart by doling out the money. Our views should be included concerning money allocation." "Donations should not be limited to the LDP, and neutrality should be observed. Corporate donations should eventually be abolished with political reform, and should be replaced by public assistance and individual donations." A contrasting view is offered as follows. "Chairman Nagano of the Nikkeiren and representative manager Hayami of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] have a common awareness of having cooperated with the coalition government. Consequently, they criticize the LDP severely." Moreover, general trading companies like Marubeni-Iida and Sumitomo Corporation have proposed "freezing political donations," while the Department Stores Association has also decided to abolish donations. Chairman Hiraiwa anguished during the concentrated barrage of criticism from the leaders of the various organizations, and his posture changed on 1 August as follows. "We might as well take the lead in political reform. The Keidanren would like to stop distributing political donations." Also, when an opinion was expressed at a conference of four organizations, including the Keidanren and the Nikkeiren, that "distributions should be made according to the number of Diet seats including other parties besides the LDP on a sliding scale," Chairman Hiraiwa stated: "We will not stoop to such a stupid act as if we were distributing baked dumplings." The Keidanren thus decided to completely abolish fund-raising duties. Doko-Kikawada-Hiraiwa Geneology This is not the first time that the Keidanren quit collecting funds. In 1974 Chairman Toshio Doko called (the then) managing director, Jinpachiro Hanamura, and told him: "The Keidanren will withdraw from handling political contributions. We cannot permit any further mediation." Hanamura resisted vehemently, and Shigeo Nagano called Doko a fool, which threw the financial circles into an uproar. At the time, it was the Tokyo Electric Power chairman, Kazutaka Kikawada (Keizai Doyukai representative manager), who fully backed Doko. It was an era of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's theory on the reconstruction of the Japanese Islands and runaway commodity prices. There was a movement against payment of power rates, and Fusae Ichikawa (Dietwoman) contended: "The power companies are making political contributions on the one hand and raising electric fees on the other. We cannot permit this." This contention hit a sore point of the power companies, and Kikawada conceded by declaring: "In the future, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. will stop political donations completely." The Kyushu Electric Power Co. followed suit, and the electric power industry has subsequently refrained from contributions under the Keidanren system. The Keidanren statement that "although the LDP may be demolished, we cannot destroy Tokyo Electric Power for the sake of the people's livelihood" remains effective. Hiraiwa was Kikawada's favorite disciple and executive director in charge of general affairs at the time. Why did Doko decide to abolish fund-raising activities? During the 1953 shipbuilding scandals, Doko who was president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries gave a donation to Secretary General Eisaku Sato through President Kensuke Matano of the Iino Kaiun Kaisha in order to receive loans from the Japan Export-Import Bank and the Japan Development Bank. Doko was also arrested due to President Matano's confession and was jailed for about 20 days. Although he was released without an indictment, Doko reportedly achieved the following conviction because of this experience. "I will absolutely not associate with politicians in the future. Political donations are evil." In the summer of 1974 upper house elections, Prime Minister Tanaka, feared a reversal of power between the conservatives and reformists, and he demanded 20 billion yen in contributions from the financial circles. At the time, the annual donations amounted to about 5 billion yen, so the financial circles were petrified by the demand. "This is terrible. Political donations have been raised by one digit." Chairman Doko, the "rough priest," reacted strongly against the money-power politics with a halt to fund-raising that lasted for about a year. This became a factor for the collapse of the Tanaka cabinet. Close Relationship Between Hiraiwa and Ozawa Keidanren Chairman Hiraiwa thus follows the personnel link between Doko and Kikawada, and he inherits their temperament considerably. Takeshi Sakurada, president of Nisshinbo Industries and formerly one of the "Big Four" in the financial circles, once evaluated Kikawada as follows. "A president who is unable to decide the prices of products made at his own company is not a manager." Power rates are decided by MITI [Ministry of International Tradeand Industry]. The criticism meant that such a company president could not be recognized as a manager. Hiraiwa inherited Tokyo Electric Power from Kikawada and, in Sakurada's words, is not a manager, but still serves as Keidanren chairman. An elder of the financial circles says: "Both Kikawada and Hiraiwa stand outside the economic movements and their thinking is mainly theoretical or conceptual." Hiraiwa has served as chairman of Ichiro Ozawa's support association for many years and is reported to be closely associated with him. A reporter, who covers the financial world, says: "Hiraiwa believes in Ozawa. Although he questions Ozawa's political methods, I have heard him highly evaluate Ozawa's great ability to formulate ideas, his decisiveness, and his power of execution." Hiraiwa also states: "The LDP splintering is a history inevitability. They must converge into two major parties." It sounds like he is parroting Ozawa's theory. During the general election four years earlier, Ozawa as the LDP secretary general demanded and forcibly received 30 billion yen from the financial circles. The financial reporter continues: "At the time, the Keidanren distributed 12-13 billion yen annually. Ozawa considered that as insufficient. He negotiated directly with the four major industries of autos, electrical machinery and electronics, finance, and construction for quota donations and secured their promises. Chairman Eishiro Saito went over his head to protest, but was rejected." It was probably possible because it was during the bubble when the economy was smooth-sailing. An LDP executive complains: "About 4.5 billion yen remains unpaid from the loans received from the city banks with special donations as the collateral at the time. Ozawa and his followers left the party, and only the debts remain. It was horrific, given his repayment plan on the scale of 280 member in the Lower House." An expert on the financial world says: "Hiraiwa and Ozawa frequently got together. Ozawa told Hiraiwa that he wanted a halt to donations made solely to the LDP, and to stop contributions if they cannot also be made to the other parties. Hiraiwa had apparently heard about the 60 billion yen in public subsidies from Ozawa quite early beforehand." In mid-September, Hiraiwa spoke to his close associates as follows. "In view of the fierce upheaval in politics, the political donations system cannot continue to operate in the 1955 form. While I am chairman, I will not commit myself to such a shameful act as resuming the handling of donations." Until now, while the Keidanren was in charge of fund allocations, sufficient funds were accumulated despite lower yields due to the recession. An LDP member in charge of finance says: "Last year, there was 25.5 billion yen in revenues. 12 billion yen was received from the Keidanren via the People's Political Association. Party costs totaled 5.7 billion yen, party supporter costs added up to 2 billion yen, and business revenues from newspapers and ads totaled 4 billion yen. 16 billion yen was requested from the Keidanren, but real revenues came to 12 billion yen because of the recession. What will happen next year when the Keidanren's mediation will no longer be available? A veteran reporter observes, "Even if the Keidanren stops mediation, General Secretary Mori estimates that 70-80 percent of past revenues can be secured through organizations and companies. However, there is the recession on the one hand and the stockholders' representative litigation system on the other. The regional financial circles will probably begrudge donations when even the Keidanren has quit mediation. The LDP will be decisively damaged. Its fund-raising ability will probably be halved, or even drop to one-third." The veteran reporter adds: "The LDP was badly shaken because Hiraiwa was drawn into the Ozawa strategy. The fact that Hiraiwa was appointed chairman of the prime minister's advisory organ to write a new Maekawa report may be seen as an honorary reward." Direction Toward Abolition of Corporate Contributions The first step toward abolition of corporate donations is included in the coalition government's political reform bill submitted to the National Diet. It is labeled "the abolition of corporate donations to individual politicians." Hajime Ishii, an executive of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party) and chairman of the lower house political reform special committee, points out as follows. "If corporate donations to individuals disappear, the politician has no recourse than to receive funds from his party. If he thinks about secret money, the strict implication system will preclude that. Is awareness of this not lenient toward the LDP? The structure of political funds will change fundamentally. Yet, they talk about public subsidies of 30 billion yen, hoping it to be accepted by public opinion. They should agree to the government proposal of 41.4 billion yen." Representative Manager Hiroyuki Sonoda of Sakigake [Harbinger] says, "Sakigake has contended that corporate donations to individuals should be recognized. Of course, it should be limited to 10,000 yen monthly. However, because the stipulation to `move toward abolition of corporate donations' was used as a loyalty test when forming the coalition government, we have decided on abolition." What happened to the tax exemption advocated by Representative Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary) of Sakigake? Takemure stated at the time as follows. "It is advisable to recognize a donation to the specific party of one's desire with a limit of 1 percent of the submitted tax amount." Such a system is practiced in the United States, but the Ministry of Finance did not even consider it. The next proposal submitted was "to exempt 100 percent of the tax amount as an inducement toward individual contributions. "By giving political donations, taxes would be fully exempt and the individual tax burden would be zero. The Finance Ministry showed indifference toward this also. After a tug-of-war debate, the government proposal resulted in a 30-percent exemption. The system stipulates that "if an individual makes a political donation of 1 million yen, 300,000 yen will be returned." Despite such attempts to increase individual contributions, swift progress is inconceivable. Hiroyuki Sonoda's outlook is as follows. "When the recession and public criticism of corporate donations are considered, a rise in the weight of public subsidies is inevitable."
