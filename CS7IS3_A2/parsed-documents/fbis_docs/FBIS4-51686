FBIS4-51686 "dreas085_a_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Bureaucrats in Senior Contractor Posts Reported Bureaucrats in Senior Contractor Posts Reported OW0305102794 Tokyo KYODO in English 0956 GMT 3 May 94 OW0305102794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, may 3 KYODO -- Of some 1,000 senior executives in 38 major Japanese construction companies, 238 were formerly bureaucrats in government ministries or officials of local autonomous bodies or of state-run corporations, a labor union report said Tuesday [3 May]. Of the 238 executives, 67 were from the Construction Ministry, 30 were from the Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, 18 from the Transport Ministry and 15 from local governments, according to the 6,500-member union formed by workers at public corporations. It spent about 18 months analyzing lists naming retired bureaucrats from ministries and tracked their next steps, as part of its efforts to look into the practice of "amakudari." "Amakudari," literally meaning descent from heaven, is a common practice in which retired bureaucrats are hired by companies or public corporations having connections with the ministries. The union also surveyed the whereabouts of 440 retired career bureaucrats from the Construction Ministry, with cooperation from construction firms' labor unions, union officials said. Of those, 204 were working at private-sector firms, 177 at nonprofit organizations under the jurisdiction of the Construction Ministry, 49 were at state-run corporations, while 20 had become politicians and 12 professors, it said. Twenty-two of the retired bureaucrats held multiple posts, it added. Of the 440 retirees, the union discovered that 111 had been accepted by companies after they had worked at nonprofit organizations or state-run corporations, union officials said. The National Public Service law bans bureaucrats from working at companies related to their previous ministry duties for two years after retirement, but they are free to go to public firms. Some bureaucrats were hired by companies via public corporations apparently because of the regulation, the officials said.
