FR940228-2-00022 FR940228-2-00005 The Department notes that although the expectations of the purchasers of bearing grade steel and of rings cut from tube steel are the same as those of purchasers of in-scope TRB parts, no one argues that bearing grade steel or rings cut from tube are steel are covered by the order. Moreover, bearing steel might be destined for bearing-related production but it has not been advanced to the point of dedicating it to a TRB component, finished or unfinished. By the same token, it is also possible that some rings cut from tube steel may not necessarily be intended for use in TRBs. However, the forgings in question have been advanced to the point that some use other than a TRB component is highly unlikely. Because the expectation of the parties importing the instant forgings is to make TRBs, the Department's position is that this criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order. Ultimate Use Timken points out that forgings are more dedicated to use in TRBs than rings cut from tube steel, since these forgings more closely approximate the dimensions of the finished cup or cone and do not require as extensive a turning process as steel tube rings. Koyo contends that a ring cut from steel tube is as dedicated to use in TRBs as a forging is, because both are made from bearing grade steel, which Koyo claims is too expensive to be used for other purposes. Furthermore, Koyo argues, a steel tube ring and these forgings are equally limited in the range of bearings for which they can be used. However, Koyo uses the overwhelming portion of its imported forgings in the production of TRBs. Koyo suggests that it is possible to use some of the forgings to make both TRB and ball bearing parts (Koyo submitted an example of a ball bearing and a TRB that have inner rings made from the same forged ring), and it is theoretically possible for the manufacturer to use a forging originally intended for use in a TRB to produce a ball bearing instead, if production needs change after importation. In practice, this possibility is seldom realized because it is not cost efficient to create a forging with multiple uses. Forgings are used to limit the amount of machining that is necessary. The very concept of forging embodies shaping a blank to the degree that it appears dedicated to one product.
