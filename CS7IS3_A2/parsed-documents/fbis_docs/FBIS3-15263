A number of countries have not taken time out for lengthy contemplation of the proposed plan but have hastened to take the opportunity. The number of signatories to the framework document of the "Partnership" is already approaching 10, including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Slovakia, and Latvia. The first from the CIS is Ukraine. In their statements at the signing ceremony officials from a number of the aforementioned states intimated that they have not renounced their long cherished idea of full NATO membership, and so the signing of the program is seen as the first step toward achieving the coveted aim, which will certainly facilitate integration into Western Europe. For instance, Hungary sees itself in the first group, and the Czech Republic and Poland also aspire to this. Romania is concerned at the prospect of ending up in the group of "laggards." In this connection it is timely to recall that the alliance's partners should not expect dividends alone, as their participation entails commitments, including financial ones. Material outlay will vary according to the specific content of bilateral agreements (joint military exercises, the standardization of armaments, the implemenation of scientific research, and so on). The state coffers will have to earmark around $50 billion for the relevant measures announced by Poland in this sphere in 1994, for instance. Obviously, such sums are beyond the reach of countries in the East which are not experiencing the best of times. This, in turn, will determine the pace at which they become involved in the activity of the Western bloc. But what kind of peace does the program promise our country? The Brussels concept is aimed at developing the partnership relations and practical cooperation with all European CSCE member states, including in the East of the continent. We welcome this approach, and we are prepared to become a responsible and keen partner of NATO. Our stance is that the transformation of the European security system should be approached in a balanced and gradual manner. It is also necessary to ensure the openness of regional organizations and institutions and to guarantee an equal level of security for all European countries without any "differentiation." It is a matter of forming a really pan-European security system, of joint, collective resistance to any new threats to stability on the continent, and of the worldwide strengthening of the potential of the CSCE, under whose auspices other European structures would also function -- namely, the EU, NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union], and CIS. Russia's stance is evaluated positively by Western official circles, which believe that security in Europe is impossible without or in defiance of Russia. Developing it, the advocates of constructive cooperation with Moscow urge that every effort be made to attain a strategic partnership with Russia. Nothing must be done, they warn, to damage its political stability or reinforce the "besieged fortress syndrome" which continues to exist in influential military circles. Unfortunately, the Cold War left deep scars on the minds and mentality of Western politicians. How else can the following comment be explained. For instance, NATO Secretary General M. Woerner said in the lobbies at the Brussels summit that in order to establish an "honest partnership" with the alliance Moscow must continue democratic reforms and renounce the idea of expansionism. The "resolute" warnings of Belgian Foreign Minister W. Claes are even more perplexing. If Moscow continues in the same vein and alarm signals continue to come in, he declared, then NATO may accelerate steps aimed at integrating the countries which meet the required terms for entry into NATO. You get the impression that it is to the advantage of some people in the West to remain deaf to all Moscow's arguments based on international law. This is the theme which Foreign Minister A.V. Kozyrev developed in his article entitled "Partnership for a United, Peaceful, and Democratic Europe," published in THE WASHINGTON TIMES. In it the leader of the Russian foreign policy department shows that Russia's foreign policy has already demonstrated that it is geared toward achieving national interests through partnership and not confrontation with the world. This policy is enshrined by the new democratic Constitution. Russia, in his words, has no territorial claims against any country in the world, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, its new military doctrine gears the Armed Forces exclusively toward defending Russia and its allies, and also toward participating in peacemaking operations in line with international commitments. It is also well known that Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to FRG Chancellor H. Kohl. In it the Russian leader gives assurances that he will not heed those who are calling for a nationalist or imperialist policy to be implemented. The West is now trying a different tack, attempting this time to cast doubt on Moscow's desire to officially formalize its participation in the "Partnership for Peace." According to the Western mass media, Moscow is sending out contradictory signals, and confused Western leaders cannot fathom whether Russia is interested in joining the aforementioned initiative. For greater cogency, references are made to alleged differences of opinion on this subject within the Russian Federation leadership. A Foreign Ministry representative at a recent briefing dispelled doubts about the Kremlin's true intentions and confirmed our positive attitude toward the program. He explained that the Russian side will soon hold talks with a delegation of NATO experts during which it is planned to discuss plans for Russia to join the program, to obtain explanations from NATO officials, and to propose its own scenarios for cooperation. In particular, we will put forward our proposal that partnership develop on the basis of the NACC, in which neutral states could play a full part. The main forum within which key problems of partnership will be thrashed out will be meetings between ambassadors and permanent representatives, while the practical implementation of its decisions will be entrusted to a political-military steering committee subordinate to the NACC. In this way the process of elaborating a strategy of European partnership will develop.
