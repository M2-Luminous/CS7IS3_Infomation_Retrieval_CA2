Alongside 'Ali Khamene'i, Rafsanjani is the only official of the Islamic Republic who is mentioned by the Voice and Vision with the titles of "His Honor" and "His Reverence" and using third-person plural verbs instead of third-person singular. With the publication of the harsh report of the Majles against the Voice and Vision, there is no longer the slightest doubt that Khamene'i wants to remove this important stronghold from Rafsanjani and also impose the rights that the laws have provided for the leader. But, informed observers say, after placing $5 billion of his budget at the disposal of the Majles and after giving in to the pressures of the Majles and giving up the idea of having Mohsen Nurbakhsh as his minister of economic affairs and finance, if Rafsanjani loses this stronghold as well, he will no longer have any job to the end of the second (and last) term of his presidency except to go on a trip once in a while or entertain a foreign guest. Informed sources say Rafsanjani wants to keep this stronghold at any price and for this reason has told his brother, Mohammad Hashemi, the general manager of the Voice and Vision, not to listen to anyone, even the leader of the Islamic Republic. And Mohammad Hashemi, by refusing the order of the leader, showed that he respects his older brother more than the successor to the "Imam." The situation was that the leader of the Islamic Republic instructed the head of the Voice and Vision not to publish its response to the report of the Investigation Committee, but the Voice and Vision not only published its response but, as the saying goes, added other insults to what they had heard from the Majles and hurled them back. Informed sources, which carefully monitor the events of the Islamic Republic, believe that the power struggle between the leader and the president has reached a point of no return for both sides.
