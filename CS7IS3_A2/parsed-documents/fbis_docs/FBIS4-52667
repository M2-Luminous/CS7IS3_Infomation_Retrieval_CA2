FBIS4-52667 "dreas092_c_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 North Korea Film Studios' Release of New Movies Reported Film Studios' Release of New Movies Reported SK1205103894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1019 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205103894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Korean film studios have recently released many feature films of high ideological and artistic value. The 17th and 18th parts of the multi-part feature film "The Nation and Destiny" recently released by the Korean film studio are showing at cinema houses throughout the country. These parts of the film deal with the life of Ho Chong-suk who was a well-known woman political activist of Korea. Born into a patriotic lawyer's family in Seoul, Kyonggi Province, she (the heroine of the film) joins in the communist movement as a girl. But she has to experience twists and turns for the absence of an illustrious leader. The film gives a keen anatomy of the tragic situation of the early communist movement in the 1920s which was divided due to factional strife for leadership, and eloquently tells the truth that only under the guidance of a wise leader can a country lost to outside forces be retaken and the nation be saved as well. Among the films released by the studio are "The General Clad in Red", the second part of "Japanese Invasion in 1592", a feature film about Kwak Chae-u of the aristocratic class origin, commander of the volunteers who organized volunteers with patriotic-minded average people, transcending the difference in caste, and valiantly fought the Japanese aggressors, and "Looks of a Party Member", a feature film showing a party cell secretary at a fertilizer factory. The Korean February 8 film studio released a feature film "Political Commissar of the 8th Regiment" (two parts). The film represents on an artistic canvas a historical occurrence in the mid-1970s out of the brilliant career of Comrade Kim Il, a staunch communist revolutionary fighter and prominent activist of the party and the state who remained unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, to the country and people till the last moments of his life since he participated in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle under the guidance of the great leader President Kim Il- song. It truthfully shows that loyal subjects are brought up in the bosom of a great leader and their lives are exalted in holding the leader in high esteem. A feature film "The Daughter of Veterans" based on a story about a girl teacher who volunteers to be the daughter of a disabled veteran couple without anyone to rely on and looks after them with the utmost care, leaves deep impressions upon young men and women.
