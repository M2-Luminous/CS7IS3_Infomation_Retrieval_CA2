At the same time, an active labor market policy should open up new opportunities -- particularly through qualification programs. This was demanded by the chairman of the metal workers trade union, Klaus Zwickel, at an employment forum in Bonn, which was jointly organized by the European Commission, the German Trade Union Federation, and the Hans-Boeckler Foundation. "Europe must convince people by creating jobs," Zwickel demanded. This is the best publicity for the European Union [EU]. Currently, there are 20 million unemployed [11 percent] in the EU. Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, used the event to emphatically support the Commission's proposals for the promotion of employment (white paper). The white paper is no attempt to change the balance of power in Europe, Delors stressed. Brussels does not want any additional authority. He warned against relaxing efforts to eliminate the structural causes of unemployment in view of the economic recovery. Delors called for a reversal of the logic of the current employment policy: Active expenditure promoting employment must be given priority. Unemployment benefits must only be granted as a last resort by the employment offices. According to Delors, new jobs will primarily be created in the sphere of social services, in the leisure and environmental industry, and in the media. However, these must not be "jobs a la McDonald," Zwickel demanded. The creation of future-oriented jobs in the industry and services on the basis of social benefits must be promoted. The reduction of unemployment must not be achieved through further deregulation and by cutting wages, as planned by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. Zwickel also criticized "obvious deficits" concerning the social laws of the EU. Hardly any progress has been achieved in the collective representation of the employees. He expressed the hope that the Commission, the Council, and the European Parliament will not make it easier for the employers at the European level to prevent social regulations as is the case at the national level. The employment target must be clearly stipulated in the economic policy of the EU. So far, neither the instruments nor the institutions for an active European employment policy exist. The commission's white paper is merely an initial step to fill the dangerous gap in the employment policy. Delors promised that he will try to ensure that the trade unions are granted adequate representation in the EU. This is necessary for Europe's social cohesion. It is important for the social partners to prove soon that they are responsible partners without whose cooperation nothing can be achieved. There can be no economic development without a social dimension, he stressed.
