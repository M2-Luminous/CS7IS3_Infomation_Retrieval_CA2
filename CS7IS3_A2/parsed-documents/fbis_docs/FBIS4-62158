Commenting on forthcoming joint Russian-American exercises to be organized on the Totsk training ground in the Orenburg region, Shirshov said that for organizing such an arrangement at first a legal procedure must be devised. "We do not have any laws, in compliance with which foreign troops could be invited to Russia," deputy to the Federal Assembly from Bryansk said. Regarding the possiblity of Russia's participation in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" programme, Pyotr Shirshov called it a "danger for Russia". In his opinion, by participating in this programme Russia does not gain anything from the point of view of any access to NATO strategies and workings, and simultaneously, the Russian Army "becomes transparent to the North Atlantic bloc."
