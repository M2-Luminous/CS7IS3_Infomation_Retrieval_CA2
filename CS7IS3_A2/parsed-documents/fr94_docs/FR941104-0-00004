FR941104-0-00004 FR941104-0-00001 There are approximately 2,506 propellers of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,150 propellers installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per propeller to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and on the average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year equating to 4 inspections, the total cost impact of the current AD per year on U.S. operators is estimated to be $379,500. However, based on an average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year, this superseding AD will eliminate 2.7 inspections per year per propeller, resulting in an approximate yearly cost savings to U.S. operators of $256,163. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
