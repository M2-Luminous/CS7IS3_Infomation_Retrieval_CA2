They emphasized that mountainous areas are the key to whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living. All trades and professions in the municipality should support the development of mountainous areas, visit these areas more often, and make contributions to their development. Fanzipai Village used to be the poorest village in Beijing's suburban mountainous areas. Chen Xitong has come to the village seven times since early 1990, when Chen Xitong came to the village to help it shake off poverty. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan arrived in the village by a minibus very early in the morning. They first listened to reports given by Li Yonghua, secretary of the village party committee; and Zhang Lianyin, head of Miyun County. Fanzipai Village again reached new heights in development in various trades in 1993. Its industrial and agricultural output value was 30 million yuan, up 50 percent from the preceding year; its per capita income was 1,150 yuan, up 3 times from the 290 yuan of 1989; output of haw was 1.22 million kg, up 100 percent; and number of goats in stock was 540, which enabled 50 households to earn more than 1,000 yuan. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong gave a speech to affirm the great progress achieved by the village and urge it to make continuous efforts to tap its potential. He said: Miyun used to be a revolutionary base area during the revolutionary war years. After liberation, Miyun people made tremendous and special contributions to the capital by building the Miyun reservoir. It would be unfair to the people of Miyun County if we did not help its mountainous areas to promote their economy. Chen Xitong pointed out: Mountainous areas are the key to whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living. Beijing's mountainous areas have a population of 1.5 million and 60 economically less developed villages, thus lagging far behind the plain areas. If the economy of the mountainous areas is not promoted, and many villages and households remain poor, Beijing will have a big difficulty in achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living. He emphasized: All trades and professions in the municipality should support the development of mountainous areas, which is their duty and an honor permitting no turning back. Instead of visiting advanced localities and units or attending parties, their leaders should visit mountainous areas more often to conduct investigation and study to learn about the situation and help solve specific problems. All departments, committees, and offices of the municipal party committee and government and large and medium-sized enterprises should also visit mountainous areas more often, not just during Spring Festival, to help solve problems together. Mountainous areas continue to be the largest problem in Beijing's endeavor to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living. If everyone makes concerted efforts and contributions together, mountainous areas will be developed more rapidly. This is a task we should fulfill if Beijing is to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. It should be given wide publicity in the municipality. Chen Xitong said: Development of the mountainous areas is an important part of the development of the capital. We should make more reports to the central departments and welcome them to develop the capital with us and to support and help the development of the mountainous areas. We should also establish more ties with other provinces and municipalities and welcome them to help the capital in developing mountainous areas. In short, we should mobilize the forces and positive factors from all quarters to accelerate the development of Beijing's mountainous areas. He pointed out: The municipal rural work conference held not long ago was a very important conference. Mountainous areas should make particular efforts to conscientiously implement the new ideas and new moves put forward at the conference and, on the premise that laws and plans are abided by, further relax policies. It is a good thing, not a capitalist thing, for households in mountainous areas to earn 1 million or even 10 million yuan. We should relax policies resolutely and act bravely. [passage omitted]
