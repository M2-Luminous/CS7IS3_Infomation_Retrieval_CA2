As part of a visit to Cuba of an Argentine delegation from La Plata, an agreement was signed in Havana to declare Havana Vieja and La Plata twin sisters. The agreement was signed by Raul Joaquin Perez, chairman of the La Plata Town Council, and (Miguel Angel Brown), president of the Assembly of the People's Government in Havana Vieja. Both parties recognize the friendship ties between the two towns and promise to actively cooperate in the areas of tourism, preservation of their historical heritage, health, sports, and culture. [Begin Perez recording] They have given us a great deal of material, including the laws that are in effect in Havana, the tax system prevailing in Havana, the coparticipation framework among companies, and others. Well, speaking of Cuba is speaking of tremendous development in the textile industry, for instance; and of course we know that, because of the special period, some important factories with qualified personnel have been closed. We believe that we also have a propitious field in this area because our city has a petrochemical industry that produces such raw materials as threads. [end recording] La Plata is a town of 900 square km, with some 600,000 inhabitants. Its economy is based on fruit, vegetable, and flower production, in addition to an important petrochemical plant and several large- and medium-sized industries.
