FBIS4-42374 "drweu107__a94010" FBIS-WEU-94-107-A Daily Report 3 June 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs Council Adopts Directive on Hydrofuels Council Adopts Directive on Hydrofuels BR2705102994 London REUTER Textline Database in English 26 May 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2705102994 London REUTER Textline Database English BFN [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Energy Council Definitively Adopts Directive on Hydro-Fuels"] [Text] The "Energy" Council adopted without debate on Wednesday [25 May] the directive on the conditions for granting and exercising authorizations to prospect, explore, and produce hydrofuels. The main aim of this directive (adopted under the co-decision procedure with the EP) is to assure nondiscriminatory access to activities and thus promote competition in the sector. The principle adopted is that Member States own the sovereignty and sovereign rights to their hydrofuels resources (situated on their territory); national authorities consequently retain the right to designate those parts of their territories where prospection and exploitation can take place. But, each time an area is opened to the exercise of these activities, the Member State will be held responsible for ensuring that there is no discrimination between the different operators interested in access. The States will, however, be allowed to refuse, for "national security" reasons, access to operators which are effectively controlled by third countries or nationals of third countries. The States will have to conform to this directive at latest by 1 January 1995; the new authorizations granted by Denmark before 31 December 2012 are the subject of certain exemptions.
