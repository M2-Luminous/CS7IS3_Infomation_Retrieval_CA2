Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting him. The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of the case, as well as certain political and psychological considerations. While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.
