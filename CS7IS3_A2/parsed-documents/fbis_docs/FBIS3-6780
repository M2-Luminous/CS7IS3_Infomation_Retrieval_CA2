"That's not true. Golkar and ABRI have been partners for a long time," Harmoko said here on Monday. He said the allegations were made by irresponsible parties out to see Golkar lose votes in the 1997 general election. "Golkar and ABRI are in complete cooperation in making our national development a tremendous success. It is groundless to say that there is a rift between the two," said Harmoko. Harmoko is the first civilian to be appointed to head Golkar since the group was founded with the help of the Army in 1964. He is currently visiting Pati as part of his current Ramadan tour. He expressed optimism that in the 1997 election Golkar will regain the votes it lost to the other two contestants, the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in 1992. Golkar has won all four elections held under the New Order administration. Although the government-backed political organization won the 1992 election with a comfortable 68 percent of the total votes, this represented a decline from 73 percent seen five years earlier. Many within the party have blamed Lieutenant General (ret) Wahono, then chairman for Golkar, for the decline in popularity. Wahono was replaced as chairman by Harmoko last October. Harmoko, who is also minister of information in President Suharto's cabinet attributed the decline in Golkar votes in the 1992 election to a lack of information and communications among the group's cadres. "But I'm pretty sure that Golkar will not suffer another setback in 1997," he said emphatically. He asked all Golkar members to make every effort to maintain the organization's image as an agent of reform that responds to the wants and needs of the people. "Golkar should be more involved in finding solutions to the problems that are facing the people," he added. Harmoko emphasized that there must be better communication between Golkar's provincial counselors. He also stressed the need for all Golkar cadres to exercise what he cryptically referred to as 'social control.' "Every Golkar cadre must do more than support the implementation of national development," Harmoko said. "He or she must also exercise social control in an effective manner." Central Java was one of the areas where Golkar fared poorly in the last general election and Harmoko in his speech blamed this specifically on the cadres' for failing to mobilize support. Harmoko also took time to meet with the executives of the Nahdlatul Ulama [NU] [Association of Muslim Scholars] in Semarang, Central Java, on Monday where he gave a donation of Rp [Rupiah] 20 million. The Golkar chairman denied that he was using the donation to influence NU votes in Golkar's favor. NU with its estimated 30 million members in Indonesia, represents a potential block vote at each of the general elections.
