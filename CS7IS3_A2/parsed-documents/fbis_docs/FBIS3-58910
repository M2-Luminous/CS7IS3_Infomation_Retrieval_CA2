For his part, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta said it was "unimaginable" that Butrus-Ghali would not authorize interventions which, basically, would be directed at the alleviation of the difficult situation in which UN ground forces find themselves in Bosnia. Ciampi and Andreatta were speaking to journalists here in connection with that part of the summit's final statement which deals with Bosnia and, in particular, with the confirmed standby readiness of alliance members to launch air strikes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo, to rotate out the Canadian blue helmets blocked at Srebrenica and to reopen the Tuzla airport to humanitarian airlifts. Dire situations like those at Srebrenica and Tuzla are all too concrete and call out for United Nations forces to be put in a position to carry out their mandate, even if that means intervention by NATO planes, Ciampi said. However, any step in this direction must be carefully analyzed, taking into account all possible consequences, including reprisal action and the difficulties of pinpointing with certainty those responsible for the situations one wants to remedy, Andreatta added. However, it is not with fighter bombers that the Bosnia problem will be solved, but by convincing the belligerents that a military solution to the conflict has already been tried and cannot be repeated, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. "The illusion of a spring offensive" is today the worst enemy for chances of peace in the former Yugoslavia, he said. The NATO summit ended here Tuesday without reaching agreement on new wording for a threatened air strike on Serb forces. The final communique only called on the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command in Bosnia to "urgently draw up plans to ensure the rotation of the UN forces at the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at Tuzla," without referring to military action that NATO might undertake to achieve these goals. The document reiterated last August's reference to air strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the "strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic. United States President Bill Clinton expressed the view that today's declaration, while not making substantive changes to the August stance, "increased the possibility of the use of air strikes in Bosnia."
