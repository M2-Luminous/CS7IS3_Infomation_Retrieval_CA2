The Constitution, the concordat, the deputy ministerial posts in the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the new Popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] Law, the vacant post of the deputy prime minister and finance minister, the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT]--these are the most important areas of the current conflict. [passage omitted] The next predictable disputes between the president and the parliament along with the coalition will be over KRRiT, when the report of the council is voted on and if the Constitutional Tribunal decides that Walesa did not have the right to recall Marek Markiewicz. Another controversial issue may be the concordat, if the Sejm rejects it, first of all with the votes of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. A storm will be caused by the president's decision concerning the budget, regardless of what the president finally decides. If he vetoes the budget law, the coalition will accuse him of impeding reforms, populism, destructive activities. If he signs this law, he will cause a storm himself because he will want to justify the decision--to Solidarity, for instance. The foretaste of the storm can already be felt when Walesa criticizes the coalition for not implementing its preelection promises and for deceiving the people. Now and then one of the coalition politicians... Will Try To Frighten the President ...with prospects of limiting his powers--that is, something he does not like listening to the most. The president will repay in kind with threats of earlier elections--that is, he will hit the most sensitive spot of the parliament members and the coalition. On this issue, however, probably neither party will take any specific steps in the near future. The coalition seems to be aware of the fact that an attempt to limit Walesa's powers would mean total war. In the Thursday [31 March] interview for the PAP press agency, Walesa implied very clearly that, in such a situation, he would ask the people to decide. "Then I would tell the people: You fought for Walesa, we fought for a president, and now we can see a monopoly of the communist type being established. Do you agree to that? Are you not afraid that communism is coming back in the way power is wielded and that it wants to exclude the president--not Walesa but the president? Therefore, if you do not wake up now, if you do not make your deputies retreat from that, I will not guarantee further stability processes." In the future, we may witness a conflict over who should carry out Poland's foreign policy. Lech Walesa likes to make decisions in this area himself, and the activeness of the parliament members who willingly travel abroad is beginning to irritate him. Walesa is not directing his criticism at the government or the prime minister. If he vetoes the new popiwek law, it will be a propaganda blow delivered to the parliament, to the coalition that passed this law and not to the government, which prepared it and forwarded it to the Sejm. If the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister is still vacant, it is the result of the game played between Walesa and the coalition, not the government. It Is Not the Government That Is the Evil Spirit ...but the parliament and the coalition, or, in fact, the SLD. This does not mean that he protects the government. The reason for this is more banal: He may gain more, in terms of prestige, in a war with the parliament or with the SLD; one of the reasons for this is the fact that the government is for the time being not perceived as one "close-knit" team. Now, it is known that a good opponent is one that is clear and specific.
