FR940919-2-00039 FR940919-2-00032 A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements Existing Sources and New Dischargers. 2. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is authorized to discharge treated groundwater and storm water that has been contaminated by Aviation Gasoline, Jet Fuel or Diesel. It is anticipated that these contaminated waters will be treated by air stripping, followed by activated carbon adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment to meet the following effluent limitations. Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: ␣ 1Effluent characteristic 1Discharge limitations 2Daily average 2Daily maximum 1Monitoring requirements 2Measurement frequency 2Sample type Flow, MGD Report Report Continuous Flowmeter. Benzene, m g/l 1.0 1/month Grab. Naphthalene, m g/l 100.0 1/month Grab. Total lead, m g/l1 30.0 1/month Grab. pH, standard units (SUs) (2) (2) Acute whole effluent toxicity (3) (3) Grab. 1Monitoring for this parameter is required only when contamination results from leaded fuel. 2See Part I.A.1. 3See Part V. An LC 50 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a violation of FAC (July 11, 1993) §17&hyph;4.244(3)(a) and the terms of this permit. The testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. The permittee shall comply with the same pH requirements for this Part I.A.2 as in Part I.A.1. The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). In accordance with FAC §17&hyph;302.500(1)(a-c), the discharge shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on surface waters. Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual discharge or mixing with the receiving waters. A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements 3. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is authorized to discharge produced groundwater from any noncontaminated site activity which discharges by a point source to waters of the United States, only if the reported values for the parameters listed below do not exceed any of the screening values below. Before discharge of produced groundwater can occur from such sites, analytical tests on samples of the proposed discharge water shall be performed to determine if contamination exists from other sources. Minimum reporting requirements for all produced groundwater dischargers. The effluent shall be sampled at the final effluent before the commencement of discharge and once every six months for the life of the project to maintain continued coverage under this general permit. The effluent shall be sampled for the parameters listed below and the analytical results obtained shall be submitted to EPA at the address given in Part III.A. ␣ 1Parameter 1Daily maximum Total organic carbon Report, mg/l. pH Report, standard units. Total recoverable mercury Report, m g/l. Total recoverable cadmium Report, m g/l. Total recoverable copper Report, m g/l. Total recoverable lead Report, m g/l. Total recoverable zinc Report, m g/l. Total recoverable chromium (Hex.) Report, m g/l. Benzene Report, m g/l. Naphthalene Report, m g/l. Reported analytical test results for the parameters listed above exceeding any of the screening values listed below shall be considered an indication of contamination from sources other than petroleum fuels: ␣ 1Parameter 1Indicator if discharge is into_ 2Fresh waters 2Marine waters Total organic carbon 10.0 mg/l 10.0 mg/l pH, SU's 6.0_8.5 6.5_8.5 Total recoverable mercury 0.012 m g/l 0.025 m g/l Total recoverable cadmium 9.3 m g/l 9.3 m g/l Total recoverable copper 2.9 m g/l 2.9 m g/l Total recoverable lead 0.03 mg/l 5.6 m g/l Total recoverable zinc 86.0 m g/l 86.0 m g/l Total recoverable chromium (Hexavalent) 11.0 m g/l 50.0 m g/l Benzene 1.0 m g/l 1.0 m g/l Naphthalene 100.0 m g/l 100.0 m g/l If any of the analytical test results exceed the above screening values, discharge is not authorized by this permit. See paragraph I.A.3.b for further guidance. In accordance with FAC 17&hyph;302.500(1)(a&hyph;c), the discharge shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on surface waters.
