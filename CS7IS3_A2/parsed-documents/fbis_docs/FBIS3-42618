It reminded many of us, even those who rarely go to stores, that our income was once again cut almost in half just in the fourth quarter alone. The supporters of radical reforms, citing statistical data, claim that one of the primary positive results of the shock therapy in 1993 was the lowering of inflation rates in comparison with 1992. Almost in half! But this is a deceptive figure. Let us look into it: Due to what did inflation "get lower?" And did it become easier for the people to live because of this? First, the general excess of the inflation in 1992 over 1993 is linked to the January shock increase in prices by a factor of 3.5. If it is "removed," then the average monthly inflation index of last year immediately becomes higher. But if two sharp price jumps (spring and autumn) in energy sources, of which there were none further on, are also excluded, then the claims of the reformers about lowering inflation are generally not corroborated by anything. In addition, the startling stability of the inflation coefficient, which did not exist the year before last, invites attention: for 10 of the 12 months, it held steady in the range of 120-126 percent, and in only the last two months did it get somewhat lower. This aspect is especially interesting. The trend toward a lowering of inflation, which appeared in September and obviously showed up in November-December, very accurately coincided with a complex of draconian measures on the regulation of financial mutual relations. First of all, this is expressed in the sharp increase in indebtedness of enterprises to one another and, as a consequence, in the nonpayment of wages. It is difficult to estimate the true scale of indebtedness to workers of industrial enterprises. Perhaps it is even impossible. According to my estimates, it reaches a half trillion just in the industrial sphere. Add the debts to "those who are paid out of the budget"--to workers in health services, education, science, culture, and state institutions. The indebtedness to students of some higher educational institutions is also not fully paid off. There simply is no mention concerning the introduction of a "new" December minimum wage in the sum of 16,000 rubles [R]. It is clear to everyone that the question in this case concerns an actual half-yearly freeze on wages of workers of the budget branches. This kind of an "anti-inflationary lever" makes it possible for the Ministry of Finance to uncontrolledly manipulate unpaid wages. They are intimidating us intentionally or through incompetence, claiming that, apparently, the indexation of wages is the main factor in inflation. The explanations are crude. After all, it turns out: supposedly, the less indexation there is, the lower inflation will be, and the lower the inflation is, the more stable will be the budget-financing system and production in the economy. And there, you see, it will become easier for the hard worker as well. If, of course, he lasts that long and does not die. It is necessary here to look back, to recall certain facts and figures, which we have already "gone through." As far back as a year and a half ago, the Ministry of Finance conducted at least two experiments with our wages. At the beginning, the half-yearly delay in the payment of money for wages for practically all enterprises and organizations of the state sector paralyzed the work of entire branches of the national economy. Many millions of workers were left without the means for existence, and they were forced to use up their accumulated savings, sell property, and even eat up the stores of "Ryzhkov" macaroni of blessed memory. But when this financial action was of necessity cut short, the government switched to another experiment--the actual freezing of yet another minimum wage and social compensation payments to the poor. The second experiment also lasted about a half year. As a result of such "fruitful" activity of the financiers, at least the state budget held for all of 1992. But on the other hand, the people's standard of living rolled back in this period to some 30-40 years ago. But how did inflation "behave," which, according to the logic of the reformers and stabilizers, was supposed to decrease? Inflation in 1992 grew by a factor of 30 even according to the official statistics, and wages--by a factor of 10. Moreover, every month the highest rates of inflation occurred precisely in the periods of the declared stabilization--the fourth quarter of 1992 and the first in 1993. Nevertheless, everyone remembers the triumphant speeches of all of our leaders in congresses and showcase meetings. A similar experiment in the regulation of wages is also picking up speed this year, but now on a new basis--under conditions of a deepening crisis of the entire financial system that is associated first and foremost with the insolvency and mutual indebtedness of enterprises. We felt its appearance, because in the third quarter of last year there was no revision in the periods stipulated by law of the scale of rates of the Unified Wage Scale. It was revised only in September, and R8,000 was established for the first category. In addition, even the wage rates, which were changed in accordance with the Law on Indexation of the Minimum Wage, were not backed in the second quarter by corresponding budgetary financing. This led to many months of delays in wages. Millions of people went on leave without pay. It will be recalled that the cost of manpower in the first place should at least guarantee its simple reproduction and not drop lower than the subsistence minimum. But in the present economy, the cost of manpower constitutes less than one-fourth of the subsistence minimum. It is necessary to learn not only from someone else's mistakes, but also from one's own. It is necessary to pay off debts. Honestly and on time. I would like to offer one more piece of advice: we should not patch up the hole in the budget with workers' wages. This usually ends up badly.
