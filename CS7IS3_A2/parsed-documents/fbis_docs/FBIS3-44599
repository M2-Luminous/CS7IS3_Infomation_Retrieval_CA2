Known for his strategic talent and diplomatic acumen, Chen was also popular as a poet and "go" player. Collected in the three-volume works are 453 poems (including traditional Chinese Ci) in chronological order -- from the prime of his life to the revolutionary times and the construction period of New China. Chen Haosu, the eldest son of Chen who compiled the books, said that it was his father's long-cherished wish to publish a collection of poems to depict his 50-year revolutionary career. Chen Yi was among the ten soldiers who received the highest military ranks after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Later he became the second foreign minister of New China after Premier Zhou Enlai. He died on January 6, 1972.
