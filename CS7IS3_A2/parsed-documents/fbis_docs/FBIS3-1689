The co-chairmen said in a statement that "the presence of six military jet aircraft detected and engaged by NATO aircraft this morning was a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 781." "The action by NATO was clearly authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 816 which was aimed at ensuring compliance with the ban proportionate to the specific circumstances and the nature of the flights," said the statement. "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be used by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," they stressed. On 6 October 1992, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 781 which banned all unauthorised flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina. A week later, on 13 October, the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic gave his assurance, in a meeting with the co-chairmen in Geneva, that Bosnian Serb fixed-wing aircraft would not violate the U.N. ban, according to the co-chairmen's statement.
