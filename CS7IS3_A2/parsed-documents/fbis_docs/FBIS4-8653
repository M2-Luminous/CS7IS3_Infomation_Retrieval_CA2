FBIS4-8653 "dreeu073__a94002" FBIS-EEU-94-073-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria `Sharp Debate' in Assembly on FYROM Convoy `Sharp Debate' in Assembly on FYROM Convoy AU1504100194 Sofia BTA in English 2128 GMT 14 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1504100194 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 14 (BTA) -- There was a sharp debate in the National Assembly today, provoked by the request of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the Bulgarian Government give its consent for the transit of UN equipment across Bulgarian territory. The equipment is provided by the U.S. Administration and intended for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. It consists of 14 armoured vehicles and supplementary equipment. This morning a Government Press Office official announced that at its regular meeting the Bulgarian Government decided to give its consent for the transit passage of the UN equipment from Romania to Macedonia across Bulgaria. Later on the press centre of the Foreign Ministry reported that the ministry had instructed the Bulgarian permanent representation in New York to inform the United Nations about the Council of Ministers' decision, stressing that Bulgaria considers this to be a one-time act which cannot be seen as creating a precedent for future actions. "Besides, Bulgaria informs the United Nations that it reserves its right to refuse the transit passage of UN property, equipment and peacekeeping troops provided by the countries in this region, which is in harmony with the position Bulgaria has stated many times," the Foreign Ministry's press release says. In the afternoon the MP's included in the agenda of their regular parliamentary meeting an older proposal for the adoption of a resolution under which Bulgaria's territory, its territorial waters and its air space should not be used for the passage of foreign military forces involved in the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1993 the Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration which states that Bulgaria will not interfere neither directly nor indirectly in the Yugoslav conflict even if such operations are launched under the aegis of the United Nations. The MP's who took the floor today accused the government of exceeding its rights and violating the Constitution. Under the Constitution, it is parliament's prerogative to approve the passage of foreign troops across Bulgaria's territory. Minister of Transport Kiril Ermenkov, Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev and General Staff Chief Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov were invited to attend the plenary meeting. Addressing the MP's, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov pointed out that in the view of the government the transit of military equipment should not be interpreted as crossing by foreign troops, therefore the Council of Ministers' decision does not contradict Bulgaria's official position. "If Parliament reverses the government's decision, this may be taken to mean that Bulgaria is not willing to render assistance in preventing the possible spread of the conflict to Macedonia," Mr. Daskalov told a BTA reporter in the lobbies of Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, acting as prime minister during Prof. Lyuben Berov's absence for reasons of health, denied that the government had adopted such a decision. According to Mr. Matinchev, Foreign Minister Daskalov had just suggested "some views of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry" to the government for consideration. The other deputy prime minister, Valentin Karabashev, confirmed that the cabinet had decided to approve the UN equipment transit passage. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) proposed a draft resolution which says that the cabinet headed by Prof. Lyuben Berov, who is in hospital now, exceeded its rights and that this act could give rise to mistrust between Bulgaria and the United Nations. The SDS moved for presenting the transcript of today's cabinet meeting to see if it had decided to allow the UN equipment passage or not. Both motions were defeated. The formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party moved for an extraordinary parliamentary meeting at night, so that parliament could pronounce itself on Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request. The motion was not put to the vote and though extended by two hours, parliament's working time expired. Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev announced that the cabinet will hold an extraordinary meeting opening at 2300 hours tonight.
