Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to preside over a meeting of working-level officials from the Foreign, Home, Justice, Transportation, Trade, Industry and Energy, and Finance ministries and the Agency for National Security Planning next week to decide on the liberalization, the sources said. An inter-ministry meeting in November last year agreed on the need to liberalize travel to China during 1994, they said. "There is no particular objection from the concerned ministries so the decision will probably be made at next week's meeting," an official said. Under a prime ministerial decree, the basic guidelines for cooperation and exchange with the so-called "northern" countries, government permission is currently required to visit China. If a decision is made to liberalize travel to China, the basic guidelines will be amended so that Cuba, Laos and Cambodia will remain classified as "specific countries." Government permission for travel to those countries is given only on the basis of invitations from the countries.
