Turkish President Demirel called President Izetbegovic over the phone, congratulating him on reaching an accord to establish the Bosniak-Croatian federation. Turkey believes that this is a very important step toward peace which should in the future engage the Serbian side also, said President Demirel, promising that his country would continue to mediate in all initiatives and actions that lead toward the end of bloodshed and destruction of this country's economic base.
