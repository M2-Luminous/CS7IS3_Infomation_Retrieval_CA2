In a ruling variously interpreted as a devastating blow to the Government and a matter of little practical consequence, the European Court of Justice said that workers, representatives had a right to be informed and consulted about large-scale redundancies or when a business was transferred from one owner to another, including when it was privatised. The European Commission said that Britain would have to change its legislation on workers rights. Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said: "There is no question that change will have to be put in place to satisfy the Court ruling." Mr Flynn would not say whether he thought the ruling would open the way to compensation claims by workers whose jobs were switched from the public to the private sector in the 1980's. However, last night, Jack Dromey, the Transport and General Workers Union [TGWU] official in charge of public services, called on the Government to negotiate compensation for all those who had suffered as a result of compulsory competitive tendering -- or fight the unions through the courts. He said the TGWU would take legal action against any local authority which tried to derecognise unions. "We believe this decision will put an end to derecognition in public services." The Employment Minister, Michael Forsyth, said that the Government would have to consider the judgment, but its effects were extremely limited. Employers would not have to recognise unions as a result of redundancy and transfers, but workers would have to be consulted. John Hendy, QC, chairman of the Institute of Employment Rights, said: "The significance of the decision is not the question of possible compensation, but a step towards democracy at the workplace." The ruling led to a clash between John Major and Labour's environment spokesman, Jack Straw, during the European election press conferences yesterday. Mr Major said it was based on a European directive approved by the Labour government in 1975. But Mr Straw insisted that the ruling was based on a law signed by the Government 13 years ago. "It is now going to be enforced to give British workers the same rights as those enjoyed by workers across Europe." John Monks, the TUC [Trade Union Council] general secretary, described the decision as a "devastating blow" for the Government. "Once again British workers have been shown to be denied rights that are accepted in law in all other European Union countries." The rulings came in two cases brought by the European Commission against the Government for incorrectly implementing EU (European Union) legislation. The first concerned the acquired rights directive -- known as Tupe in Britain -- which protects workers' wages and conditions in a sale or transfer of their enterprise. The second involved legislation protecting their rights in collective redundancies. British unions have used Tupe to challenge the practice of worsening pay and conditions when public services are transferred to the private sector. A series of court cases, including a ruling involving binmen in Eastbourne, culminated last year in Government acceptance that Tupe covered privatisations. The Commission brought its case on Tupe after a series of complaints from workers and unions. The Court upheld the Commission's arguments on almost every count. The key part of its ruling was that the Government had failed to meet the requirement that employers consult and inform workers whose jobs were transferred. One aspect of this was the Government's failure to set up a mechanism for consulting workers when employers refused to recognise unions. The Court also ruled that the Government had failed to "provide for effective sanctions" against employers. The ruling on collective redundancies also said that the Government had failed to legislate for consultation and information. In addition, Britain's definition of collective redundancy was too narrow.
