Following the death of the head of state, President Juvenal Habyarimana at the hands of the clique opposed to the Arusha peace agreement and determined to maintain the grip of dictatorship on our country, that clique, using members of the Presidential Guard, Interahamwe and Impuzamigambi, the militias of CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] and MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] parties, and some members of the regular army and gendarmerie, turned against sections of the civilian population, considered by MRND and CDR as opponents, and tried to completely exterminate them instigating the violence with ethnic sectarianism. [passage omitted] We call upon you once again to take very urgent steps to preserve yourselves from the imminent destruction towards which the clique of murderers is pushing you. Let us join hands, instead, in shoving that clique from power. We repeat our assurances that we shall not attack any member of the government Armed Forces who do not fight us. We also call upon you members of the Armed Forces of Rwanda to stop discarding your uniforms and disguising yourselves in civilian population. Come out confidently and rest assured that you will be treated honorably as appropriate instructions have already been communicated to all the authorities concerned, regarding the manner of the reception. Our desire is that we shall in due course cooperate in forming a new national army responsible for maintaining public security. In order to avoid the recurrent [word indistinct] bloodshed in our country, let he who has ears hear, let he who has eyes see. We have no doubt whatsoever that the majority amongst you have the wisdom and foresight to take the correct decision now. Thank you. Signed, Major General Paul Kagame, Chairman, Rwandan Patriotic Army High Command. [Dated] 18 April, Mulindi
