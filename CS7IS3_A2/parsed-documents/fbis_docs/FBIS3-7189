He said that according to the latest information received, 25,000 Cambodians have fled into Thai territory. Thailand therefore has to provide them with shelter and safety in line with humanitarian practice. No time period has been set for repatriation. They will be sent home once the fighting in Cambodia ends. In case the problem becomes a prolonged one, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will be requested to take care of them again. At the time being, he was not sure whether coordination has been made with the UN. On the question of Cambodian armed forces encroaching on Thai territory, the prime minister said that if that happens, Thailand will have to take action in accordance with the rules. Any Cambodian faction would have to be disarmed in order to avoid any international conflict. On the fear that the Thai border will be used as a base for a Cambodian faction, Chuan said that issue should not be a concern, as he has instructed the officials involved to prevent such problems from occurring. Therefore, the Thai people should feel relaxed on this matter.
