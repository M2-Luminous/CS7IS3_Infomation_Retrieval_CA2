FBIS4-13200 "drnes075cc_94002" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Islamic Affairs Paper Reports Israeli Contacts With al-Jihad Paper Reports Israeli Contacts With al-Jihad NC1804151294 Cairo AL-'ARABI in Arabic 11 Apr 94 pp 1, 10 NC1804151294 Cairo AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Report by Khalid Salah and Yasir Zari'] [Text] Reliable sources have revealed some very important information to AL-'ARABI, which is being published for the first time, about a long series of contacts between Israel and the groups carrying out religious violence in Egypt during the last five years. Approximately 30 contacts have been monitored by the security service in this country. AL-'ARABI has secured a letter confirming these contacts and asking the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to provide Israeli researchers and research centers with specialized information on the results of secret contacts with these groups, in particular with the al-Jihad organization. Israeli attempts to contact these groups in Egypt started in 1989. These contacts used to take place under the slogan of information and press dialogues. The Israeli researchers used to introduce themselves to the members of the religious groups as reporters for Western media organization. The following is what happened in a contact monitored by the Egyptian security service in the summer of 1989 with a student in the School of Agriculture at Cairo University: He was a prominent member of the Islamic group at the University. An Israeli researcher succeeded in introducing himself to the student as a correspondent for the German magazine DER SPIEGEL. Through this student, the Israeli researcher managed to meet a large number of members of the group who were also members of the Student Union. In 1990 an Israeli journalist from the magazine HA'OLAM HAZE visited Imbabah accompanied by a member of the Islamic group. The latter knew the real identity of the journalist. The Israeli journalist met in Imbabah with a large number of leading figures from the group and learned about their activities there. This journalist resided in Egypt many weeks during which he managed, through another member of the Islamic group who at that time was training to become a journalist in a newspaper that labels itself Islamic, to meet with leaders of the group in the Governorate of al-Minya. He met with these leaders after a seminar that he attended with them at the Sudanese Student Union's headquarters in Cairo and after the sectarian sedition incidents in Abu Qurqas in al-Minya Governorate in 1991. A lawyer called M.W., who is also a member of the Islamic group, accompanied a number of Israeli researchers to the city of Abu Qurqas after he learned of their true identity. This caused a serious dispute between the leaders of the group in al-Minya regarding contacts with Israelis. In this dispute, one group defended contacts with the Israelis under the pretext that the call also targets the Jews since they are the People of the Book. The document that AL-'ARABI has procured reveals an important aspect of the Israeli contacts with the religious groups in Egypt and the U.S.-Israeli cooperation in this field. In the summer of 1991 an Israeli researcher from the Gustav Heineman Institute, which is part of Haifa University, held many meetings with members of the Islamic groups. He also met with a number of leaders of a group called the Husam al-Battuti group, which has seceded from the al-Jihad group in Bani Suwayf led by a man named Majdi Kamal. In this context, we have the "document," which is really a letter from the director of the Asian and African Studies Center of the Heineman Institute dated 5 September 1992 to an American researcher named Dr. Harold Marthuni from the University of California. The letter refers to the meetings mentioned earlier that the Israeli researcher held. The literal translation of the letter is as follows: "Dear Dr. Harold, (5 September 1992) "We thank you for the valuable documents you provided to the Israeli researchers in Cairo. In fact, we are looking for a different kind of cooperation. Our colleague Dr. Dick Bergman contacted some of these fundamentalists who took him to the home of one of them in the city of Bani Suwayf. They presented him with documents similar to your papers on the concept of judging the state authorities as heretical. However, our researchers doubted the results of all the contacts. This is why we asked our embassies to mediate with the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to inform us of the results of their contacts with the al-Jihad group in particular. We also hope for your cooperation in this framework. In addition, we hope you will place the study you are currently carrying out on the agenda of the special seminar we are holding in cooperation with your renowned university. "Thank you "[Signed] Gavri'el Warburg, director of the institute" The value of the letter lies in the fact that it shows the tip of the iceberg on this subject. It notes the visit by one of the most famous Israeli researchers on Egyptian matters to Cairo. This researcher is Dick Bergman, the researcher at the African and Asian Studies Center of the Heineman Institute. His objective was to prepare a field study on the religious groups in Egypt. The sources confirm that some of the reasons that prompted the Israeli researchers to doubt Bergman's results were the fact that some of the people he met with who belong to the Islamic groups confirmed that they might agree to accept Israel in the region as soon as they assume power. According to him, they consider the ruling regime to be further away from God than the Jews, since the Jews are the People of the Book. The sources confirm that the Israelis were very careful about getting the largest amount of information possible from the Americans regarding their meetings with the religious groups in Egypt, especially after they learned that these contacts continued outside of Egypt after the contacts between these groups and the U.S. Embassy were revealed. Proceeding from an American proposal, the Israelis organized a research roundtable in June 1993 at Haifa University. Four of the most prominent U.S. researchers specializing in studying the fundamentalist groups in the region and Egypt took part in this roundtable, in addition to Israeli researchers from the Gustav Heineman Institute. The sources confirm that this roundtable went on for three days, during which they discussed and analyzed all the reports and U.S.-Israeli contacts with members of religious groups in Egypt. Researchers who participated in this roundtable explored the various scenarios that could be expected from the contacts and changes in behavior of the religious groups toward Israel should they assume power in Egypt.
