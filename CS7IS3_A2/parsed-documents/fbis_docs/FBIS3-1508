The emergency will remain an option for the TEC and President F W de Klerk if the security situation continues to deteriorate in the province and if political initiatives fail to produce results. The other option is the declaration of unrest areas in selected magisterial districts. The TEC on Tuesday agreed in principle to a state of emergency to ensure that election preparations went ahead and that the security situation was stabilised. Troops were already being deployed on an "incremental basis". The TEC's Law and Order Sub-Council, TEC legal advisers and government representatives were meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday afternoon to draw up the regulations in terms of the public safety act. The preparations would be completed by Thursday afternoon, putting President de Klerk in a position to introduce at the stroke of his pen draconian security measures last seen in the province when the state of emergency there was lifted in October 1990. The TEC source said there would be a state of emergency "unless there is major movement on the political front". "The emergency will be held as a sword of Damocles over kwaZulu," the source said. Meanwhile, negotiating teams representing the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party were due to meet in Johannesburg on Wednesday afternoon to put the finishing touches to preparations for international mediation to resolve their outstanding constitutional differences. The mediation process could get underway next week. And the four-sided summit involving President de Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is due to take place next week. The TEC source said the emergency regulations may be held in abeyance until the outcome of the summit.
