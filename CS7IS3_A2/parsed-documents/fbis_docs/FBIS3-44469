Petroleum: Opening to the Outside World and Involvement in Multinational Operations By the end of November, the China National Petroleum Corporation had produced 127 million tonnes of crude oil, up 1.38 percent from the same period last year, and 141 million cubic meters of natural gas, up 3.6 percent from the same period last year. In recent years, to speed up petroleum industrial development, China has opened the southeastern part of the Tarim Basin, Xinjiang, and part of the East China Sea to prospecting by foreign petroleum firms. More than a dozen big firms from a number of countries signed up to bid for these two regions. Ten contracts have been signed on the East China Sea and one on the Tarim Basin, signalling another breakthrough in the China's petroleum industry's opening up to the outside world. Another breakthrough this year: The China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation stepped out of the country to engage in multinational oil and natural gas operations. Since October, the corporation has signed four overseas oil contracts and accords with Peru, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand. So China is not only attracting foreign firms to prospect its land and seas; its petroleum industry has also gone out of the country in oil and natural gas prospecting. Electric Power: Strive for Sustained and Accelerated Growth China's electric power industrial growth rates have been astounding to the world. Since 1988, China increased its installed generating capacity by 12 million kw, though power supply remains short compared with its recent 20 percent industrial growth rate. To ease power shortages as soon as possible, the Ministry of Power Industry has decided to increase financing and use of foreign funds for the power industry. From now on, investment in the expansion and reproduction of the power industry will take up another 25 percent over and above its present proportion in the GDP. By the end of this century, China's installed generating capacity will have increased from the current 240 million kw to 310 million kw, which is expected to basically ease the power shortage across the country. This year, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang progressed to the design and production stage, and the first generator unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong started generating power for electric grids this year, signalling a new dimension for China's nuclear-powered electricity. Coal: Diversified Operating Modes, Move Toward the Market Coal accounts for over 70 percent of China's primary energy structure and is vital. The state has decided to deregulate raw coal prices and stop subsidizing its production in the near future. State-owned coal mines are facing grim challenges. On the basis of its diversified modes of operations, the coal industry is quickening its move toward the market. The average output value of coal production under diversified operations between 1986 and 1991 annually rose 25 percent and by the end of last year, the diversified part of the industry was employing 1.45 million people, generating 15 billion yuan in output value, which is expected to hit 18 billion, and absorbing 150,000 people made redundant by staff cutting. The diversified operating part of the coal industry has generated more than 20 different trades, set up close to 20,000 operating units and factories and a number of Sino-foreign joint ventures or jointly invested ventures. The development of diversified operations has contributed to stabilizing raw coal production and reversing losses in state-owned coal mines.
