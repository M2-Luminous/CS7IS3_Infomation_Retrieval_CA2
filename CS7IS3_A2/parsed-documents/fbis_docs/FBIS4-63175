"We are concerned about the crime problem and the position of the poor in that republic," Filatov told Interfax correspondent Vyacheslav Terekhov on Thursday. "It's not the status of Chechnya or any legal matters that we are concerned about but the maintenance of peace around Chechnya," which is being threatened today by tension between Chechnya and another Russian republic, Dagestan, he said. "We would like to preclude further impoverishment and even lower living standards in Chechnya. Those matters are giving President Boris Yeltsin a lot of concern," Filatov said. Yegorov replaces Sergey Shakhray, recently dismissed by Yeltsin as minister of the affairs of nationalities and reginal policy.
