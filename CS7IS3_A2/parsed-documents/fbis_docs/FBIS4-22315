Let us recall that in these materials the standard of living is appraised by the criterion of the population's purchasing capacity as a ratio of income to the cost of living. The cost of living is determined by the system of consumer budgets. At this point, we are looking at only two of the entire range of consumer budgets: the subsistence minimum and the minimum consumer budget. In February the subsistence minimum across Tatarstan increased by 16.1 percent (by 4,672 rubles [R] in absolute value) and amounted to R33,716 as compared to R29,044 in January, while the value of the minimum consumer budget amounted to R121,595. According to data of the Republic of Tatarstan State Committee on Statistics, in the consumer market prices for consumer goods in February rose by 11 percent--a 1.5-fold rate increase as compared to January (7.8 percent). Prices rose for both foodstuffs (11 percent) and nonfood items (10.9 percent). Prices and fees for for-fee services for the population continued to rise at an anticipatory rate (44.4 percent). At the same time, February is the month when the main indicators characterizing the standard of living--the cost of consumer budgets and income--fall into a predefined ratio; when income grows faster than prices for basic consumer goods and services included in the subsistence minimum. We remind the reader that throughout 1993 the republic was able to contain the anticipatory rise in per capita income in relation to increases in the cost of the subsistence minimum. For instance, on 28 January we published in IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA the data that over 12 months of last year the value of the subsistence minimum increased 7.3-fold (from R3,400 in January to R24,900 in December) while per capita income increased 9.7-fold (from R7,500 to R72,800). In January of this year, however, per capita income fell to R53,400 (we wrote about the reasons for this in IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA 1 March 1994), but in February the picture began to change gradually: Per capita income rose in February by 40.2 percent and amounted to R74,870. The curve of changes in per capita income and the subsistence minimum are presented in the graph. One can see from the graph that over the entire last year per capita income in the republic rose at a higher rate than the cost of the subsistence minimum--a steeper "per capita income" curve in relation to "subsistence minimum" curve. Specialists of the Center for Social Problems have forecast the data for March-May. As we can see from the forecast, over the next two to three months, despite the general worsening of the economic situation in the Russian Federation, the republic will be able to maintain the trend of anticipatory rises in per capita income in relation to the rate of price increases for goods and services included in the subsistence minimum.
