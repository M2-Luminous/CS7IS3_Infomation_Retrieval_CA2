Nations do not enter into treaties and agreements, multilaterally or bilaterally, on the basis simply of the calculus of gain or loss of so many rupees or dollars. Certainly, questions of national sovereignty, equality of participation in decision-making processes, status, impact on national psyche, signals emanating from the process and content of the negotiations, etc., are no less relevant. But much the more basic are the questions of national priorities, development policies, domestic power balance and the way we place and view ourselves in the comity of nations. These factors matter since the recent GATT agreement among 117 nations and the proposed setting up of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) are going to have a far-reaching impact on the emergent world order. What kind of world order the GATT agreement would lead to? An indication of it may be had from the reported statement of the U.S. President claiming success through the GATT agreement for the continued leadership (read, hegemony) of the world economy for his country. This seems to be no empty boast. The G.7 and the United States have asserted their one-up-manship at every step: the determination of the agenda, the process of negotiations, the Draft Final Act and the final Act. A quick reflection would make it clear that our sins of commission and omission have contributed to this outcome in no small measure. Let us see how. The Third World countries have a majority in that GATT which works on the basis of 'one country one vote' and without veto power with any country. The agreement is hammered out through a protracted process of negotiations providing opportunities for detailed home work, marshalling of theoretical and empirical arguments, articulation of individual country and group interests, preparation of alternative scenarios based on different negotiating stances, with ample time for pre-and-post agreement contingency plans in order to be able to acquire the necessary strength to back up one's negotiating minimum and maximal positions mobilisation of both domestic and international public opinion and preparation of the country to take up the gauntlet in case extra-economic or extra-trade pressures are being brought to bear on the negotiations process for tilting the scales against our interests. Since there have been slips up throughout this process, little wonder one throws up one's hands in despair at the end and bemoans or takes shelter behind the facade of no-availability of any option but to give in. Since trade policy has significant linkages with all the real and financial sphere policies, our capacity to strike a good bargain would depend on our overall policy regime which spell out our options and the capacity to withstand pressures. If we are critically dependent on external finance, technology, supplies of essential commodities and have downplayed the role of internal articulation and mobilisation as the kingpins of our development, little wonder we make ourselves easy prey to armstwisting. Thus invoking of the TINA (there is no alternative) is an acknowledgement of the extent to which autonomous national development linked with the forces of social justice has been neglected and bungled. Our negotiating positions are essentially a reflection of the relative weight of various domestic stakeholders, say, for instance, the relative balance between import and export dependent sections, and those whose economic fortunes depend but marginally on the factors and forces beyond our boundaries. The domestic political economy of our stand on GATT derives from a further differentiation among the divergent interests of our extant and potential partners in the external economic area, particularly those whose appetite for foreign exchange and the craze for the "phoren" have made export earnings such a great "national" cause that no price seems too high for these. And the price of treating exports as an overriding objective includes diversion of domestic supplies causing rampant malnutrition, larger allocation for export production with high import and capital intensity causing unemployment, unrequited income transfers in favour of our trading partners via worsening terms of trade and depreciating rupee, environmental degradation, and concentration of benefits from such trade in the hands of a few lakh exporters and importers. Judging further on the basis of official admission that in signing the GATT agreement we have made the best of a bad bargain, let us examine some of the implications of the acceptance of the final act. The basic thrust of GATT agreement is to assure market access to goods by bringing down and/or eliminating tariffs, something which had been agreed upon by both the developed and the developing countries. It is claimed that this would spur a big spurt in world trade from which countries like India too would benefit. As a price for it the developing countries have given an undertaking not to raise the tariffs, in future also. In case of balance of payment difficulties, they have to use quantitative restrictions only. It is too mechanical to believe that across the board lower tariffs and by all the 117 countries granting each other MFN status (reduced to some extent to a farce by the nations joining customs union and free trade areas like the European Community and NAFTA) would really lead to a higher volume of world trade notwithstanding continued recession, and forecast of global slowdown. Similarly naive is the view that countries like India would be able to share in this presumed growth on account of tariffs lowered by everyone, and thus at least denying us any comparative price advantage. One has just to recall the results of our past devaluations as also the role of domestic factors like fluctuating farm output, slow industrial growth, growing import-intensity of our exports, foreign exchange and infrastructure constraints, super profitability of domestic sales, entry of MNCs in export goods with their penchant for selling in the host country, etc., to appreciate the amount of make-believe involved in such a reckoning. But undertaking a commitment to lower tariffs and not to raise them in future has many other non-trade related grave implications. It restricts our domestic fiscal and investment policy options in so far as we cannot raise excise duties, particularly on traded goods, without disturbing the balance between make or buy option. If we did raise excise duties for various reasons like curbing inflation, reducing consumption inequities, discouraging consumption of non-merit goods, financing development, etc., beyond the point disrupting their parity with customs duties, it would amount to discrimination against domestic production. But by remaining within the range prescribed by the GATT- given customs duties, we cripple our fiscal and public investment policy. This is how the GATT gnaws away at our sovereignty and nationally determined path of development. It is on account of such ceilings on excise duties implicit in the GATT terms that our business classes are plumping for the GATT agreement. Take another serious implication. With the opening of trade in farm products and with market pull of OECD countries' higher incomes for our exotic food, fruits, flowers and the lure of higher profits among our rich and big landlord farmers, our scarce land and other farm inputs would get allocated to crops other than those which are needed and can be afforded by millions of poor Indians. To assume that the foreign exchange thus earned could be allotted for importing essential foodgrains is an instance of stoneheadedness: the pull of highly skewed domestic income distribution rules out any meaningful possibility of this kind. The policy predilections manifested in our overwilling acceptance of the GATT agreement have to be seen in the context of the use of the marginal external economic sector to set the tone, terms and tenor of the overall economic policy regime (a la internationalisation, marketisation, privatisation, etc.). Thus, the sacrifices imposed on us through the GATT are but a component of the heavy cost of the reckless, fundamentalist drive to implement the structural adjustment programme. Let it be remembered that these costs are grossly unjustly distributed among our domestic interests and have to be borne for long by our future generations as well. Two NRI economists commissioned by the Finance Ministry to endorse and endear the liberalisation drive must be appreciated for their frank advice that GATT terms have to be accepted in order to further the cause of liberalisation or what they called, "economic reforms."
