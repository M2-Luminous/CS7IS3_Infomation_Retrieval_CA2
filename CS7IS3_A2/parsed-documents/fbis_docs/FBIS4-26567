It is an organic, changing society, which has continued to develop since he negotiated the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and set the seal on the territory's return to Chinese control. Yet some members of China's Hong Kong transition team, the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), seem to assume the territory's legal, political, and social development should have been frozen at the moment the treaty was signed and to regard any changes that have taken place since as a breach of the agreement. The PWC Legal Affairs Subgroup, however, is made up of experienced lawyers and should be a forum where such opinions are out of fashion. That they are not tells us much more work has to go into persuading some Chinese officials and pro-China figures here that the territory has changed over the past 10 years and its laws can, and should, reflect the changes. Shao Tianren, the group's mainland co-convenor, and his local counterpart, former Appeals Court judge Simon Li Fook-sean, have warned that planned amendments to the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, aimed at relaxing controls on freedom of assembly and the ban on links to organisations overseas, would violate the Joint Declaration's provision that "the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged". Article 3 (3) of the Joint Declaration, from which that phrase is taken, was not intended to embalm the body of Hong Kong law exactly as it stood in December 1984. On the contrary, Article 3 sets out the basic policies of the People's Republic of China for the Special Administrative Region (SAR). It should be clear that the agreement to leave the laws basically unchanged applies to laws currently in force at the time of the creation of the SAR on July 1, 1997. The article is intended to reassure the people of Hong Kong that China has given legal backing to its promise that their way of life will continue after 1997. The PWC is on stronger ground if it argues that the government's proposals relaxing the Societies Ordinance are in conflict with the Basic Law. Article 23, introduced as an afterthought into the second draft in the light of Hong Kong's strong reaction to the June 4, 1989, crackdown on the Chinese democracy movement, bans subversion against the Central People's Government, prohibits foreign political organisations, and bans local political groups from establishing links with foreign organisations. It is harder to attack the revisions to the Public Order Ordinance, since the Basic Law guarantees "freedom of association, of assembly, of procession, and of demonstration." It is for the SAR government to decide if the changes that have taken place before its establishment should be reversed to conform with the Basic Law. But it will have to reflect, as the PWC should be reflecting today, that the changes in Hong Kong society are not imposed from the outside by the British administration but have often been forced from the administration with great reluctance in response to organic changes within society. Hong Kong did not begin to change with the arrival of Chris Patten but long before. That development was recognised and encouraged by the Joint Declaration, which called for the legislature to be constituted by elections and guaranteed the same freedoms later enshrined in the Basic Law. China seems to have begun to regret those enlightened and farsighted policies in 1989. But it is in Beijing's interests, and Hong Kong's, to return to the views that helped shape the Joint Declaration.
