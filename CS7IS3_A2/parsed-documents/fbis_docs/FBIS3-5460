The section in charge of North Korean affairs of the Institute for the National Unification (Section Chief So Chae-chin) examined the difference of national power between North and South Korea in seven areas such as politics, social management capacity, economy, education, science and technology, military capacity, and diplomatic capacity for two years since 1992. These facts have been disclosed in a thesis "A Comparative Study of National Power Between North and South Korea" issued by the institute on 7 March. To examine the difference of economic capacity between the North and South, the section in charge of North Korean affairs used the Kline model based on the GNP, energy and mineral resources, industrial productive capacity, food production, and trade volume. In assessing the difference of their economic capacity, the institute gave 100 points to the GNP and 20 points to other five areas. Accordingly, as of 1990, South Korea received 110 points in total economic capacity, while North Korea received 18 points. This shows that South Korea's economic capacity is six times larger than that of North Korea. The Kline index, based on South Korea's GNP, shows a 100:10 ratio in economic capacity. This indicates that South Korea's economic capacity is 10 times larger than that of North Korea. This shows that the difference of economic capacity between the North and South has been widened more compared with the 100:78 ratio in 1960 and of 100:50 in 1970. In 1990, South Korea's GNP was $237.9 billion. South Korea's GNP has increased 179 times from $1.35 billion in 1953, while North Korea -- with a GNP of $23.1 billion in 1990 -- has increased 53 times from $440 million in 1953. The Kline industrial index based on the production of iron and steel products, aluminum, and cement shows that South Korea has received 19 points while North Korea has received 8 points. This indicates that South Korea's industrial capacity is 2.4 times larger than that of North Korea. In the manufacturing business area, South Korea is three times more advanced than North Korea; in iron and steel products, four times; in automobile production capacity, 57 times; in shipbuilding capacity, 16 times; in chemical production capacity, two times; in refinery capacity, 12 times; and in cement production capacity, four times. The index in the social indirect capital areas, including transportation and communication -- which was assessed separately by the section in charge of North Korean affairs -- shows that South Korea has received 20 points while North Korea has received 6. This indicates that South Korea is three times more advanced than North Korea. The total length of South Korea's roads is 56,715 km, with 71.5 percent of them paved, while the length of North Korea's roads is 23,000 km, with 10 percent of them paved. North Korea possesses 264,000 cars while South Korea has 3.39 million cars. This indicates that South Korea has 13 times more cars than North Korea. In 1990, South Korea's harbor loading and unloading capacity was 224.35 million tons while North Korea's is 34.90 million tons. The Kline index in the external trade sector -- which shows the country's trade position in the global economy -- indicates that South Korea has received 20 points while North Korea has received 1. South Korea's trade position is 20 times firmer than that of North Korea. The trade volume of South Korea is $134.8 billion while that of North Korea is $4.7 billion. South Korea has 28 times more trade volume than North Korea. It has been learned that North Korea's self-sufficient index in food, mineral resources, and energy is higher than that of South Korea. The self-sufficient index in food shows that South Korea has received minus 20 points while North Korea has received minus 3. South Korea imported 11.18 million tons of food from foreign countries in 1991 while North Korea imported 1.6 million tons. The self-sufficient index in energy, including oil, coal, gas, and power plants, shows that South Korea has received minus 12 points while North Korea has received minus one. The amount of South Korea's oil imports in 1990 was 55.90 million TOE (1 TOE equals to 7.3 barrel), while North Korea imported 3.55 million TOE. The mineral resource index shows that South Korea has received minus 17 points while North Korea has received minus three. This has been comprehensively assessed based on North and South Korea's dependency on foreign countries in minerals necessary for the heavy and military industries.
