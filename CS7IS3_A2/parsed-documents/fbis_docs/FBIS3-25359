The FAT believes that the sole purpose of these accusations is to tarnish its image. Kouakou Tovie has more details. [Tovie] The FAT's reaction, published today by the Army headquarters in a statement of clarification, reads as follows: For some time now, it has become common practice for those whose objective has always been to discredit, divide, and destroy our Army, to make gratuitous allegations against the FAT. Any time a man in military uniform commits a crime, evil-minded and unscrupulous persons blame such crimes on the security agencies, and yet everyone is aware that on several occasions the law and order agencies have arrested organized groups dressed in Army uniform, who were involved in criminal activities such as armed robbery, murder, hold-ups, sabotage, and terrorist attacks. More than once, such criminals have been arrested and turned over to the Justice Department. It will be recalled that searches carried out in the residences of some politicians on 10 and 31 January led to the discovery of fatigue dresses and green and red berets. The FAT, which remains committed to its traditional mission of protecting the territorial integrity of the country, warns all those who use military uniform to indulge in criminal activities with the intention of denting the image of the Army against such action. The forces reiterate their commitment to democratic principles and to their desire to live in peace and total harmony with all other sections of the population.
