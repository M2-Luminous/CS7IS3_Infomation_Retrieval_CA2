The executive president of CAF, Enrique Garcia Rodriguez, said that $55.6 million went to loans for investment projects and share purchasing, $174.9 million for short- and medium-term financing, and $1.5 million was allocated for technical assistance. He pointed out that the institution's credit support was concentrated primarily in two sectors: hydrocarbons and transport, specifically, the development of petroleum fields and the maintenance of the country's highway system. Garcia Rodriguez said that this would result in an increase of foreign exchange earnings generated by the petroleum sector and, in addition, would facilitate the transportation of private sector products, internally as well as toward ports, increasing the competitiveness of domestic industry by reducing transportation costs.
