As the Concanaco president attended the meeting in which Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Institute of the National Housing Fund for Workers director general, submitted a report on its activities, he added we will be able to remain calm insofar as we know how to preserve the balance and analyze significant issues. Dajer pointed out: The political aspect undoubtedly takes a toll of the investors' minds, but we also know that economic reasons will eventually prevail, as we saw on 22 and 23 April when the respite returned. We are positive this trend will prevail, he added. To that effect, the Concanaco leader emphasized his proposal to restructure interest rate effects with a new plan to ensure that they will not have a major impact on productive enterprises. He also said it is necessary to solve, once and for all, expired portfolios to ensure that both enterprises and banks will no longer have constant friction between them and that economic development will reemerge. Dajer stressed that relations between Concanaco and the bankers are good and believes in solving the country's economic ups and downs. As he was interviewed at the Concanaco headquarters, the processing industrialists' leader said the political debate, to which Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party and his opponents from the National Action Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution were invited, "will not eliminate anguish, uncertainty, or fears, which we must not link to the economic arena because they spark negative effects. The political debate is simply the analysis of political platforms to ensure that we, the citizens, will be able to analyze them more objectively." Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of Canacintra [National Association of the Processing Industry], said businessmen, as citizens, "favor this political change because thanks to the debate, we will establish which presidential candidate offers a better alternative to solve our country's political and socioeconomic issues." As he talked about the meetings the business leadership held with President Carlos Salinas at the Los Pinos presidential residence on several occasions, Terrones said the following: The objective of the meetings was to analyze socioeconomic and political development. The president expressed the need that we offer him special support, but we have already supported him and his economic policies. Salinas also wants some adjustments to adapt the economic policies to the current times and circumstances. As for last week's recovery of the Mexican Stock Exchange [BMV], Terrones said the recovery was only logical because "we must take into account that the BMV is a volatile stock exchange. Mexico does not face this problem alone, however; it occurs in all of the world's stock exchanges. This is why the ups and downs are normal, but they fail to indicate whether there will be a resounding bear market." He said that due to the maturity already reached by the Mexican private sector, "financial agitation is already leaving us because the changes are not as radical as those we previously experienced. For instance, the case of the BMV is currently handled more professionally because virtually all of the stock exchanges thank the funds from which they receive greater financial backing than if it were done by individuals." As Terrones talked about economic recovery, he maintained that it will take place in May, but "it will not be a widespread recovery" because some sectors are indeed producing more, but others will not recover until late 1994. He acknowledged that recession or stagnation prevail in two-thirds of the production sector because even though recovery indexes were encouraging in January and February, the recovery "fell in March." Industries and demand, however, will begin to recover slowly at the beginning of the second half of this year. Finally, the Canacintra president added that the sectors with greater growth capacity are those sectors that have greater export capacity because production recovery will not be widespread. "Achieving growth will take us several months, but it will be more consistent by late 1994," Terrones concluded.
