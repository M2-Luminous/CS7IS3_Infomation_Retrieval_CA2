Does it mean that prior to this state control was not efficient? [Kolev] No, after 10 November 1989 Bulgaria firmly declared that it would observe the international norms related to the export of arms. Then we issued a document that regulated the manner and means of trading in arms. We worked on the basis of that document until the decree was adopted. The decree is stricter toward the exporters in anything related to the information that they must provide. I would like to stress that the Interdepartmental Council firmly, steadily, and uncompromisingly controls arms exports. In many cases we refuse the exports because we are concerned that Bulgaria should not be drawn by any means into international scandals regarding the arms trade. [Todorov] It has been claimed that in recent years we have lost 80 percent of our arms markets -- is this the real picture and what could be changed? [Kolev] This figure is probably related to the collapse of the agreements with the former Warsaw Pact countries. Our exports were predominantly directed toward those countries. In comparison with the top year -- 1988 -- our exports have decreased eight times. I do not want to cite precise figures. However, at the same time I very much hope that in 1994 Bulgaria will export twice as much as in 1993. While we are encountering difficulties in regaining our positions, we are nevertheless slowly and painfully regaining them in our traditional markets. Our arms and goods are of high quality and they are being sought. However, I must point out that arms markets throughout the world have shrunk. We can hardly compete with such giants as Russia, the United States, China, or even Switzerland and Sweden. However, we have our place and are doing everything possible to regain our positions. The main thing is how to come up with new systems and new items. It is high time that those who are concerned about Bulgaria began speaking about investment, innovation, creating new production, and purchasing licenses, and not rally slogans and cliches. In 1945 Japan was restored from ashes because it purchased licenses on a massive scale. [passage omitted] [Todorov] Recently at the National Assembly Economic Commission Andrey Lukanov, National Assembly member, said that our middleman companies have taken advantage of Bulgarian obligations to the former CEMA. The Teraton Company and the sum of 230 million leva were mentioned. Do you consider such deals normal and do they help our military-industrial complex? [Kolev] I sincerely regret that I cannot answer this question in a profound manner, because it has not been reviewed by the Interdepartmental Council, and I do not have the necessary documents. I am vaguely aware of the problem from what I read in the press, and thus I cannot commit myself to a professional answer. I could say one thing -- the trade companies must work in a manner that will bring revenue to the state. [Todorov] There are four state companies, which have been allowed to conduct arms business -- Kintex, Armymex, Teraton, and Element Engineering. Have additional companies, including private ones, shown any interest? [Kolev] Now a barrier rightly exists -- the arms trade must be implemented only by state trade companies. Probably the moment will come when, under certain conditions and criteria, private businessmen will be allowed to trade with such production, if they can prove to the state that they have the possibilities of doing this. The arms trade is a complicated process. It is not regular trade. It require specialized knowledge and training. The people who work in these organizations must have experience. There is a risk involved in allowing private companies to trade in arms without having any guarantees that we would not be drawn into a new international scandal. [passage omitted] [Todorov] Are you optimistic over the possibility of the Bulgarian military industry restoring the stability and market scope of 1988? [Kolev] I am a realist. It will be incredibly difficult, but restoring those dimensions and even expanding them can become possible only when we change the range of our merchandise. Arms production as a generalized concept is an agent of technical progress. Its top achievements were incorporated in space vehicles. Inventors in the United States and Russia were slow and rather jealous in conveying their achievements to civilian production. Even now the top technologies in the United States, Russia, France, and the world technical and technological centers are utilized first of all by the military industrial complexes. Therefore, we must be realists in assessing our possibilities and place. [Todorov] Thank you for this interview.
