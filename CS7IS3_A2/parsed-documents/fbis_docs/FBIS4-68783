Karavayev, doctor of economic sciences at International Economic and Political Research Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences: "Possibilities for Foreign Investment in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan"] [Text] Economic affairs in Russia have been accompanied by unique changes in recent years. These changes have seemed chaotic at times, but now they are clearly taking the form of a system contributing to economic stability. Although this stabilization still requires a great deal of time, we can already ascertain the emergence of the most important market elements of the future system, primarily in the spheres of property relations, privatization, credit and monetary policy, and foreign trade relations. What kind of opportunities can these changes offer foreign businessmen in Russia and other CIS countries? The following is an analysis of these possibilities, based on studies by the International Construction Institute and the International Economic and Political Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Foreign Investment in Russian Economy Russian laws have allowed the creation of joint ventures within Russia since 1987, and the Law of the RSFSR of 4 July 1991 "On Foreign Investment in the RSFSR" also allowed enterprises with 100-percent foreign participation. On 1 July 1993 there were 9,125 joint ventures registered in Russia, and around 4,000 of them had been formed in the preceding three months. The combined capital stock of the enterprises amounted to 62.7 billion rubles, including 7.56 billion dollars in foreign capital (data for 1 April 1993). This amount, however, does not exceed 4 percent of the value of the fixed capital of all Russian enterprises. Additions of new foreign capital to capital stock increased 3.9-fold in the first quarter of 1993. The joint ventures still produce only around 0.7 percent of the gross output and employ only 0.3 percent of the able-bodied population. It is interesting that in spite of the general slump in production (by 30 percent during the period from 1992 to the end of the first quarter of 1993) and in the total output of registered joint ventures, more than 70 percent are producing goods, while the rest have not begun production operations yet. The distribution of joint ventures among different branches of the economy is the following (in percentages): industry--6.7; trade and food service--9.3; construction--5.8; transportation and communications--4.6. For the sake of comparison, in 1989 the proportional number of industrial enterprises was under 30 percent, and most of the joint ventures were concentrated in the trade and service sectors. Italy has 511 joint ventures in Russia (5.5 percent of the total), surpassed only by the United States, FRG, and England (Figure 1) [not reproduced; converted to table]. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Participation by Governments of Different Countries in Joint Ventures in Rus-| |sia | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Country |Percentage of total | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |United States |15.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germany |12.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |England |6.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italy |5.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Austria |5.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poland |4.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Finland |4.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PRC |3.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Switzerland |3.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |France |3.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sweden |2.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bulgaria |2.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Canada |2.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Japan |1.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hungary |1.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Foreign investors recently expressed an interest in participating in privatization processes after the cancellation of many of the restrictions on the acquisition of enterprises slated for privatization and on land use rights. According to Russian Central Bank Regulation No 16 of 16 July 1993, foreign businessmen who are not residents may open special ruble accounts in Russian banks for settlements in privatization projects. According to estimates, by the beginning of 1993 foreigners had acquired around 12 percent of the stock in enterprises undergoing privatization in Russia. Several well-known large enterprises, including Lukoil (Tyumen Oblast), plan to sell their stock in Western stock markets. All of this suggests that the investment climate in Russia is gradually becoming increasingly acceptable to foreign businessmen, but how does it compare to the situation in other CIS countries? Comparison of Investment Climate in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan These republics were not chosen at random: They accounted for more than nine-tenths of the national wealth, production potential, natural resources, and foreign economic ties of the former USSR (Figure 2) [not reproduced; converted to table]. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic |Area, thousands of km |Population, thousands | | |[.sup]2[/] | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |17,075.4 |136,532 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |607.7 |49,881 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus |207.6 |9,451 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |2,717.3 |14,564 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When we use the term "investment climate," we are referring to the fairly complex entity made up of the legislative confines, economic-administrative mechanism, and political, social, environmental, and other conditions of the host country. The investment climate may be judged by the method of expert evaluation, the method most commonly used in international practice. A multi-factor analysis was conducted with the aid of 31 indicators, arranged in five groups: administrative and legal conditions (4 factors); social, political, and environmental conditions (5 factors); foreign economic conditions (6 factors); economic potential of country (9 factors); level of market relations (7 factors). Each indicator was evaluated by a group of specialists on a scale from 1 to 10, with the highest number of points corresponding to the most favorable conditions. After that the rating for each group of factors and the overall rating were calculated for each country. There were four separate indicators, for example, in the group of "administrative and legal conditions": stability of economic legislation; taxes on foreign investments; administrative conditions; guarantees and protection for foreign investments. For the first indicator, Russia and Ukraine received four points each, Belarus received eight, and Kazakhstan received ten. The grades for the second indicator were nine, nine, and ten points respectively, and so forth. The results of the study are illustrated in Figure 3 [not reproduced; converted to table]. The results did not reveal any significant differences in expert evaluations of the investment climate in these countries. These were evaluations of conditions at the end of the first quarter of 1993. Comparative Analysis of Groups of Factors Influencing Capital Investments in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan Categories Russia Ukraine Belarus Kazakhstan Administrative-legal 9 9.3 13 15.4 factor Socioeconomic policy 10 14 18 17 International relations 21 17 20.6 18 Economic potential 34 24 22 26 Level of trade 26 17 20 20 relations Total 100 81.3 93.6 96.4 The evaluation of Russia, the country with the most favorable investment climate, was influenced by such well-known factors as Russia's natural resources, tremendous production potential, and large domestic market--with 150 million consumers. In terms of these parameters, Russia surpassed all of the other countries combined, and this was the reason it finished in first place. Russia was also the leader in terms of radical and consistent market reform. Measures are being taken for financial stabilization, a strict monetary policy, and a stronger ruble. The rate of inflation has been lowered, the recession has been curbed, and the exchange rate of the ruble has been stabilized. The Law on Foreign Investments, which extended the national regulations adopted in 1991 to foreign investors of capital, already needs to be adjusted with a view to accumulated experience. A law on free economic zones and concessions is being considered. Continuity in the development of laws and the maintenance of invariable rules of play for investors are important for a better investment climate. Nevertheless, opportunities for foreign investment in Russia are still growing: 100-percent foreign enterprises and subsidiaries are being established in addition to the traditional joint ventures; opportunities are being created for operations by joint and foreign banks, for the purchase of stock in enterprises undergoing privatization, and for the long-term leasing of parcels of land. A system of services for foreign investors is being established. Presidential Edict No 282 of 26 February 1993 created the National Agency for the Insurance of Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation Against Non-Commercial Risks, and Presidential Edict No 184 of 2 February 1993 created the State Investment Company, with over a billion dollars in capital stock. The present situation is quite paradoxical in Ukraine--second to Russia in terms of production potential, but last in terms of the overall investment climate. Ukraine's strong points are its geographic location, its proximity to Western partners, its ports, and its developed infrastructure. Ukraine's industrial potential is also highly developed, and there are favorable conditions for the development of agriculture in basic and processing industries. The new laws on foreign investments are quite liberal. All of this is nullified, however, by Ukraine's exceptionally severe economic crisis and imprudent economic policy. Ukraine is lagging behind perceptibly in the sphere of market reform after wasting approximately a year to see the results of the reforms in Russia. This was followed by the choice of the most drastic form of shock therapy, but the genuine threat of social turmoil forced the government to retreat. The result was the escalation of hyperinflation and the complete devaluation of the recently instituted national currency--the karbovanets. This affected foreign investors because the government had to cancel some of the tax privileges they had been granted earlier. Surpassed by its neighbors in terms of natural resources and production potential, Belarus is not regarded as a leader in economic reform. In spite of this, the state is ahead of its neighbors in terms of the rate of increase in the number of joint ventures, attesting to its appeal to foreign investors. Belarus' strong points, in addition to its convenient geographic location on the shortest route to Western Europe, are its sociopolitical stability, its liberal laws on foreign investments, the strong guarantees it has established for them, and--what is most important--its unchanging rules of play. Belarus also benefits from its skilled and highly productive labor force. Because Belarus is the smallest of these four countries, however, it has fewer spheres for the investment of capital. The economic policy of the Belarusian Government is not as reform-oriented as the policy in Russia or Kazakhstan. This has guaranteed its comparative economic stability. The recession, for example, is much less severe here; the level of consumer prices is lower, although inflation does exist--largely because of Belarus' close economic interaction with Russia and Ukraine. Belarus was effectively crowded out of the ruble zone, and its national quasi-currency--the settlement coupon--is extremely weak, complicating settlements with its partners. Kazakhstan's strong point is its natural wealth. The country is close to Russia in this respect, in terms of the variety of its resources if not in terms of total reserves. Furthermore, it is distinguished by its gas and oil fields and its largely undeveloped deposits of ores of nonferrous and rare metals. Kazakhstan has the most highly developed legislative base for foreign investments. It has already passed laws on foreign investment, free economic zones, concessions, and so forth. It has stable legal and economic-administrative regulations for foreign investors, and the government effectively encourages investments. Major investment projects in the oil and gas industry are being carried out with the participation of leading corporations in the United States, England, France, and Japan. The market reform policies of the president and government of Kazakhstan are being pursued consistently, without any delays or interruptions, although there has been a recent tendency toward stronger government regulation of some economic processes, particularly the rise in prices and income. In addition, the political situation is essentially stable. The economy of Kazakhstan, however, is closely related to the Russian economy and is experiencing a critical decline of production and investment activity and a rate of inflation slightly higher than the Russian rate. Kazakhstan is still in the ruble zone and is striving for closer economic integration within the CIS framework and for stronger regional cooperation in Central Asia. From the standpoint of the foreign investor, however, Kazakhstan appears to have a relatively underdeveloped infrastructure and serious environmental problems. This study revealed the most promising sectors and spheres of foreign investment in the economy of the four countries in question. In Russia they are the petroleum and petrochemical industries and woodworking, as well as shipbuilding, aircraft and automotive engineering, agricultural machinery production (particularly for family farms), medicine and medical equipment production, the processing of agricultural raw materials, the food distribution network, the conversion of defense production units, and others. In Ukraine these sectors and spheres also include sectors undergoing conversion, particularly satellite telecommunications, radar, gas turbine production, corn, sunflower, and sugar beet farming, the production of agricultural machinery and equipment for the food industry, and others. In Belarus these spheres are potash salt extraction and processing, mineral fertilizer production, mineral water production, the pulp and paper industry, and medicine production. In Kazakhstan they are the oil and gas industry, the extraction of nonferrous and rare metal ores, nonferrous metallurgy, the meat industry, light industry, mining equipment production, automotive engineering, and others. In these states there is a need for investments in the storage and processing of agricultural products, the production, shipment, and sale of food products, the development of the production, social, and market infrastructure, and the training of personnel for the market economy. In Lieu of a Conclusion This study presents an overview of foreign investment opportunities in the Russian economy, but the businessman considering investments of this kind will have many specific questions. The International Construction Institute has compiled summaries of Russian legislation and practical aids on the following topics to answer some of these questions: --How can an enterprise be established with foreign capital in Russia? --How can an enterprise dealing in foreign currency be opened in Russia? --How is land acquired in Russia? --What kind of information is essential for the use of Russian mineral resources? --What kind of taxes have to be paid in Russia? --The rules of play in the Russian market: currency regulation; export-import regulation; customs regulation. --What do construction projects in Russia entail? --The Russian construction complex (statistics). --Housing policy in Russia. --Banking in Russia. --The capital market (current reports). --The bankruptcy of enterprises in Russia--a condition preventable by legal means. --A survey of the experience in privatization in Russia. --A comparative analysis of the investment climate in Russia. Counseling and assistance can be offered in all of these fields, and it might be useful to do this in the magazine, with a view to the actual experience of the International Construction Institute in working with Banca Agricola Mantovana and Intesa Finanziaria (Brescia). Note: The International Construction Institute is a research and consulting organization which was founded to promote foreign investment in Russia and other CIS countries. The institute's foreign founder is Banca Agricola Mantovana and its Russian founders are the Academy of the National Economy of the RF Government, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the International Builders Union, and the Tekhnopromeksport foreign trade organization.
