Title: Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program. Abstract: The Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP) is a mechanism by which lending institutions, mortgage servicing companies and others servicing mortgage loan portfolios can bring their mortgage loan portfolios into compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Implementation of the various requirements of the MPPP should result in mortgagors, following receipt of notification of the need for flood insurance, showing evidence of such a policy or purchasing the necessary coveragee through their local insurance agent or appropriate Write Your Own (WYO) company. It is intended that flood insurance policies be written under the MPPP only as a last resort, and only on mortgages whose mortgagors have failed to respond to the various notifications required by the program. Type of Respondent: Individuals or households, State or local governments, farms, businesses or other for-profit, Federal agencies or employees, non-profit institutions, and small businesses or organizations. Estimate of Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden: 4,013 hours. Number of Respondents: 6,526. Estimated Average Burden Time per Response: An estimated 150 hours for WYO companies to set up an initial operation under the MPPP; an average of .5 hours per lender to sign an agreement with a WYO company to participate in the program; an average of .5 hours per WYO company to send notices to each mortgagor (3 notices at 10 minutes per notice); and an average of .5 hours for each mortgagor to respond to the notices and ask any questions. Frequency of Response: One-Time. Dated: August 22, 1994. Wesley C. Moore, Director, Office of Administrative Support.
