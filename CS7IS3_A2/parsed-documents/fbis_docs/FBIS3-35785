"Nothing is impossible in our world. A diplomat who says that something is impossible, in principle is not a diplomat," he said. He believes that the current Russian Government is as reform- oriented as its predecessor. "The Cabinet has only been reorganized, so the current government is old, not new. That is why the Cabinet's membership will not be submitted to the State Duma for endorsement," said Kozyrev. He noted that some of the departments had been reorganized. "New appointments have been made and some of the Cabinet members have been given a new status, say, a deputy prime minister has become a minister. This does not mean, however, that the government is new," he said. Kozyrev emphasized that as before the Russian government would promote reforms and that Russia's foreign policy will definitely remain unchanged. He told journalists who accompanied him on his way from China to Moscow that from the beginning he had not considered Gaydar's resignation a necessity. "I had serious doubts about this. I told Gaydar right away that I respected his personal and political reasons. After all, everyone has the right to long-range tactical and strategic moves. However, taking into account prospects for the democratic movement and the results of the recent parliamentary elections, I thought that Gaydar should have stayed in the government to defend his views. The democratic potential should not have been weakened, particularly after a relative defeat during the elections," said Kozyrev. He pointed out that the "practice of resignation" would hardly strengthen the democratic movement. Precisely because of this, he has spoken out for a mediatory stance. "I consider both my co-thinkers," he said referring to Gaydar and Chernomyrdin. "Yegor Gaydar's resignation from Yeltsin's reformatory team was a shock for me," he said. To quote Kozyrev, disputes do occur in the government and a minister may find it difficult to defend his point of view. "But after set-backs, one may raise the same question once again. This is what I told Gaydar," said Kozyrev. He expressed hope that after Gaydar's resignation, the democrats would regroup their forces. "It is the democrats' duty to tell the people what happened during the elections and what they are going to do in connection with this. The type of reform based exclusively on Boris Yeltsin's popularity is no long viable [as received]. Reformers, particularly the democrats who intend to form up a government, must win a mandate of their own during elections," said Kozyrev. He said that the relative defeat during the recent elections would lead not only to a chain of dramatic resignations, but also to a dramatic self-analysis in the democratic camp. With reference to Russia's relations with China, Kozyrev noted that they are not directed against third countries, particularly those in the West, and that they are developing "without looking back on anyone." The head of Russian diplomacy said that the idea of "strategic partnership" suggested by Russia may be materialized during a visit to Moscow to be paid by Chairman Jiang Zemin this year. He also said he is confident that Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China planned for the first half of this year will contribute to the development of bilateral economic cooperation. "Everyone is tired of the petty cross-border trade. We should pass to a new stage of our cooperation," he said. With reference to the possibility of using China's experience in conducting economic reforms, Kozyrev noted that Russia "must not copy blindly" either the Western or the Chinese experience. "We should search for such economic solutions that would be acceptable to each of our areas individually," he said. When asked whether the human rights issue was discussed in Beijing, Kozyrev said, "Yes. This topic is not closed for us, even though we have no intention of exaggerating it," he said. The foreign minister confirmed that he views China as Russia's "closest" neighbor. He stands for returning to "common sense," he explained. "The term 'close neighbor' only means that the country in question adjoins Russia, and that Russia wants to develop with it equitable relations based on neighborliness. In this sense China or, for instance, Finland are 'close neighbors' for Russia," Kozyrev said.
