The alarm at the consequences of Boris Fedorov's departure from the cabinet had barely abated when the Foreign Ministry and its head came under ever more pronounced attack. Some observers now ask how long will Andrey Kozyrev manage to stay in his post? Let us hear the point of view of the political scientist Andrey Kortunov: [Kortunov] Kozyrev is currently one of the last representatives of the radical team within the new, moderate government. I think that heightened criticism can be expected in the nearest future in many areas indeed. In the first place, it is thought that the Foreign Ministry is not defending the interests of the Russophone population in the close neighboring countries with enough consistency. It is thought that the ministry is taking a stance that is too pro-Western as far as a whole gamut of international issues is concerned, essentially following in the wake of Washington's foreign policy, for instance regarding the former Yugoslavia. Apart from this, Kozyrev is blamed for the somewhat discursive nature of our foreign policy and for the inability to determine with any precision the new place and role of the Russian state within the system of modern international relations. This criticism is not wholly justified, in the first place because foreign policy is not being made by the Foreign Ministry alone -- the Security Council and other ministries and departments have taken an active part in the elaboration of our foreign policy, which, in the final analysis, is Yeltsin's foreign policy and not Kozyrev's. However, the question is to what extent can this criticism lead to changes in Russia's foreign policy and in the personnel composition of the Russian Foreign Ministry. I think that if one proceeds from the constitutional norms, the Russian Federation president has enough powers to have foreign policy made exempt, in practical terms, from debates in the State Duma, so as to be able to pursue a sufficiently consistent and constructive foreign policy course. Yeltsin is clearly intent on pursuing presidential foreign policy, a policy that would be independent of the domestic political circumstances in Russia. On the other hand, if one focuses on the evolution of the Russian Federation's foreign policy course over the past several months, a certain tightening up is, of course, clearly discernible. In particular, it is possible to speak of a greater pressure, above all economic pressure, but also diplomatic pressure, upon the close neighboring countries. It is also possible to speak of attempts to set up Russia's own, liberal concept of nationalism that would oppose the ideology of Zhirinovskiy and his party and it is also possible to speak of some new nuances in the attitude toward the West. How great are the current foreign minister's chances to retain his place within the new Cabinet? I think that what is, perhaps, the best circumstance in the minister's favor is the fact that the president has essentially removed the power-wielding ministries from the remit of the council of ministers and the prime minister. The foreign minister, the defense minister, and the minister of internal affairs are currently subordinate directly to the president of Russia and hence there is a hope that Boris Yeltsin will, nevertheless, retain Andrey Kozyrev as his minister.
