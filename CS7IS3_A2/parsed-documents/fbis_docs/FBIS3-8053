Meciar Favors Election on 24 and 25 June"] [Text] Bratislava--"I think it is admirable that Mr. Kohl has expressed an opinion on something about which he does not think it necessary to ascertain the actual facts; this underscores the credibility of his point of view," said V. Meciar following the coalition talks between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party [SNS] in reply to a question from SME on what he thinks of the view expressed by A. Kohl, secretary general of the European Democratic Union, who feels that holding a referendum on the deputies' mandates is incompatible with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. According to Meciar, the need to stabilize the situation and to resolve the current political crisis was discussed at the coalition talks. The two parties agreed to fundamental talks with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] on the means of achieving stability. He also pointed out that it was necessary to take into consideration the forceful protest from representatives of the Association of Slovak Towns and Communities against holding local and national elections at the same time and the view expressed by more than 400,000 citizens that all three issues be resolved by a referendum. "It is in the interests of the state to hold the elections as soon as possible. The optimum date seems to us to be 24-25 June, but our two parties do not have enough votes to push this through parliament. Therefore, we need to negotiate with other political parties," said the prime minister. He added that "we have agreed with the SDL that both parties will hold talks with it." SNS Chairman Jan Slota said that the date of the early elections is the most important thing. He said that, for the SNS, "the most suitable time is June. For this reason, it is necessary to strive to ensure at all costs that the elections are held in June, and, if the Slovak part of the SDL decides to support them, we will be very pleased." He specified what he meant by the Slovak part of the SDL as follows: "You would have to look among those deputies and see. There are enough ethnic Hungarian deputies there and, perhaps, also deputies of other nationalities. In this part of the SDL, the majority are Slovaks." In reaction to the possibility that no agreement will be reached in parliament, V. Meciar said that, in this case, the citizens will have to decide because "such a loss of time leads to a decline in credits and a decline in investments, the state's economic interests are harmed, and the laws that can help the economy cannot be passed." According to the prime minister, the petition questions and the referendum do not only concern whether a deputy can make a free decision when laws are being determined, but also whether the citizen has the right to supervise a deputy's activity. The statements made by the Christian Democratic Union "are, in this regard, a distortion of the situation; they do not correspond to the political, legal, or actual situation, and I believe that it will be necessary, to say the least, to draft a new electoral law," added the prime minister.
