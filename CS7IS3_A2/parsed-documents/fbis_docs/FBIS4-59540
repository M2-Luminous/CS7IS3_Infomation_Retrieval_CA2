He said that the YSP, which had led the moves for unity and democracy, had neither planned nor even thought of resorting to a military approach. Brother Salim Salih Muhammad added, in a radio interview with him today with the Netherlands international radio, that the readiness of the Armed Forces had been destroyed over the last four years. There were also various assassinations of YSP leaders, cadres, and members. It was the other side which was driving the country into the inferno of this destructive war. The only real loser would be the Yemeni people. He pointed out that the Yemeni people -- from one end of the country to the other -- their brothers in the Arab homeland, and their friends worldwide, demanded an immediate cessation to the fighting, which was destroying the resources of Yemen, its military establishment, and all the other facilities which they had been building over the last thirty years. Moreover, the war was inflicting a fatal wound to the body of national unity built four years ago. The brother member of the Presidential Council said that the ideal option of imposing unity could not be effected without conviction. People should come to unity voluntarily, not by force, by the pounding of villages and towns, or by genocide. He demanded an immediate end to the fighting and the beginning of a dialogue. All issues should be tabled for discussion. By these means we can arrive at solutions satisfactory to the Yemeni people, their brothers, and their friends.
