"We hope to see a breakthrough in coming hours," Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said as EU negotiators bargained with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden over terms for their entry into the Union. Diplomats said Brussels was offering the candidate countries more money to help merge the highly-subsidised Nordic and Alpine agriculture with the lower-cost EU farming system. The EU wants the high farm prices of Austria, Norway and Sweden cut to EU levels in one "big bang" on the day when the applicant countries join the EU. The candidate countries, being relatively wealthy, will contribute a total of about one billion dollars a year more to the the EU budget than they will get back in benefits. The diplomats said a large part of this money could be used, at least initially, to help the high-cost, difficult-to-farm Nordic and Alpine regions. French Minister for European Affairs Alain Lamassoure said there had been little progress in one major sticking point -- Austria's insistence on keeping strict limits on truck traffic across the Austrian Alps until 2004. The restrictions would contravene the EU's freedom of movement principle, but diplomats said the EU was likely to back down on this point rather than let it torpedo the enlargement negotiations. There was also no change in Norway's refusal to allow EU fishing fleets increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of Oslo's price for joining the Union. However, one diplomat said the EU might reach at least the outlines of a deal with Austria, Finland and Norway before dawn on Tuesday, then give Norway a little more time to consider a compromise on the fish issue. Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries join the EU together. Lamassoure said the negotiators might delay a decision on another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's balance of power towards its richer northern members, and increase the influence of its smaller ones. The French minister predicted that the decision, along with the dispute over Norwegian fish, might be held over until the weekend. The EU had set a Monday midnight deadline to wrap up the year-long negotiations so that the membership accords can be ratified in time for the applicants to join the EU on January 1 next year. But officials said the deadline could possibly be stretched to March 10, giving Euro-parliamentarians just enough time to cement their entry before parliament breaks up in the first week in May for Euro-elections in June.
