The country may well be on its way to becoming a major oil and gas producer by 1998. Results of the short production tests at the Malampaya-3 well in offshore northwest Palawan flowed at a rate of 5,487 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 5.05 million standard cubic feet of gas per day, the Department of Energy (DoE) said in a report yesterday. Dre Boon, Shell Phils. [Philippines] Exploration (SPEX) vice president told BUSINESS WORLD yesterday the results are more than what they expected. SPEX is the operator of the Camago-Malampaya fields in offshore northwest Palawan. "This is very good news. We are very happy about it. This is a confirmation of our studies and reports," he said. He explained that the initial tests were done on the oil zone of the well at about 3,400 meters below the rig. The tests are usually done from the bottom which contains the oil deposits and then upwards where the gas deposits lie. Another 24-hour test will be done on the oil zone before SPEX goes up to the gas zone, after which, a full gas test will be done. Based on their schedule, the gas test will start next week. Mr. Boon said SPEX will finish its testing on the Malampaya-3 well by the end of the month. Afterwards, SPEX will immediately drill its second appraisal well which would be between the Malampaya-3 well in the southern part and the Camago-Malampaya 1 and 2 wells in the northern part. He said there is a distance of about 10 kilometers from the north and south parts of the Malampaya fields. Thus, the results of the next drilling will determine if the basin from north to south contains oil or gas. Mr. Boon said the 5.05 million cubic feet of gas daily flow rate registered in the oil zone is just normal and is not a determining factor on whether or not there are enough gas deposits to warrant commercial production. However, in the upcoming full gas tests, SPEX needs at least a flow rate of about 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. At present, SPEX is gathering more information on the geology of the well to be able to establish the reserves of the whole Camago- Malampaya fields. Meanwhile, Alcorn (Production) Phils., operator of the West Linapacan fields also in offshore northwest Palawan has set and cemented the seven-inch liner at 7,595 feet. The operator is currently preparing to drill out excess cement. Then, it will run the cement bond log. Ampolex, Ltd. operator of Villaba-1 well in offshore Leyte has drilled to a depth of 4,049 feet. Gas shows predominantly methane, propane with traces of butane were recorded. The operator is drilling ahead.
