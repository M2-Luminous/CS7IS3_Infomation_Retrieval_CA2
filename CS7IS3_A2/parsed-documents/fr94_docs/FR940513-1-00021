FR940513-1-00021 FR940513-1-00006 8 CFR Part 3 [Order No. 1872&hyph;94] Executive Office for Immigration Review: Appeal Procedure AGENCY: Department of Justice. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule establishes an alternative procedure for filing proof of fee payment for appeals of Immigration Judge decisions to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board). It provides added flexibility in the appeal filing procedure by permitting a respondent/applicant to certify that a fee was forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service). It further allows thirty (30) days from the date of filing the appeal for the respondent/applicant to submit a fee receipt. It also provides that failure to present proof of payment of fee will cause the appeal to be deemed improperly filed. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before July 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments in triplicate to Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, suite 2400, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia 22041. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Suite 2400, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia 22041, Telephone: (703) 305&hyph;0470. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule provides a flexible alternative to the existing procedure of filing appeals of Immigration Judge decisions before the Board of Immigration Appeals. The current procedure mandates that a timely filed notice of appeal include a copy of a fee receipt or a fee waiver application. The proposed alternative procedure would allow the filing of an appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision to the Board with a certification stating that the fee has been forwarded to the Service. A sample certification follows the proposed rule. The respondent/applicant would then have thirty (30) days from the date of filing the notice of appeal to obtain and file a copy of the fee receipt. This alternate procedure may be particularly useful when the respondent/applicant is located a great distance from a Service office or is in a custodial setting. This alternate procedure provides additional flexibility for such a person by creating a thirty (30) day window of time, in which he or she may submit proof of payment of the appropriate fee for an appeal. It also preserves the current appeal filing deadline and fee filing procedures. This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b). This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866. Nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612. The rule meets the applicable standards provided in section 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule will not: (1) Preempt any state or local laws, regulations or policies; (2) have any retroactive effect or require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.
