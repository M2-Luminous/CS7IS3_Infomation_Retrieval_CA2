Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Saturday such a clarification was in the interest of good relations between the two countries. Speaking to reporters here, he said the claims were very serious for if they were true then Australia had interfered in Malaysia's political affairs. This is not in order and should be corrected.....We are not interfering in Australian politics as it is the right of Australians, our politics is our right and others cannot interfere, he said. If it had really happened then Malaysia could not just keep quiet and Australia should inform the Malaysian Government as to who were the recepients -- were they individuals or political parties, he said. He said it was not correct for opposition parties in Malaysia to look for funds outside of the country to finance their political activities. In the interest of good relations between the two countries and to erase any doubt on the issue, the Government of Australia should state its stand on it, he said. He said he did not think it was necessary to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter. Those involved should be frank and admit it, as it was a question of honour and dignity, Mohamed Rahmat said.
