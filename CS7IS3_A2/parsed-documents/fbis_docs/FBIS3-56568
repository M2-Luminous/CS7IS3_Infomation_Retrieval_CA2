Greetings Eduard; a Georgian official state delegation last week visited Turkey. What do you think are the most important results of this visit? And another question; Turkey was brought out of the political and economic crisis by the so-called Turkish wonder, as well as the will of the whole nation. To what extent is Georgia ready to share this experience? Because the instability in Georgia today was earlier no less alien for Turkey. [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I spoke widely about the results at the meeting of the Tbilisi branch of the Citizens' Union of Georgia, and therefore, I will not dwell on them. The results, both political and economic, are quite impressive. Many contracts and agreements are to be signed. We have signed many agreements. Batoni Chikvaidze, who stayed on in Turkey and phoned me yesterday, told me that the issue of credits is being resolved positively. Other prospects have been mapped out, among them being cooperation in the field of science and culture, and many others. One important result is our mutual understanding, good mutual understanding, of the processes which are under way in the Caucasus, and, in particular, in Georgia, and on a wider scale, in Europe and the world. From this standpoint, the visit was undoubtedly a success. The second question, which is of no less interest for us all, our citizens -- how did Turkey achieve success with its economy and in developing democracy and political life? Your question in effect implied the answer. I may reiterate it, but I will be brief. It achieved it by being patient; by declaring and setting genuinely national and state interests as the highest goal; by integrating into the European and world economy. It did not refuse it. [as heard] From the very beginning it refused the policy of being shut out and living in isolation, which brought Georgia to this dead-end. Unlike Georgia, Turkey followed a completely different course, which has brought it tremendous success; it could be called a wonder. At the meeting with business circles, where unique dialogues and conversations were held with about 200 businessmen and bank representatives of Turkey, and where you [Oniani] were not allowed, we saw a 20-minute movie about Turkey's wonder -- if we call it this. Having seen this movie I have drawn a conclusion for myself as to how Turkey managed to achieve such success in a comparatively short span of history. Turks have tried may forms of rule over the last 20 years. You know there has been a coup d'etat and military dictatorship. The ruling democracy, as I would call it, proved to be the best. There is quite a strong opposition, there is political pluralism, but there is the most important thing, which you can feel everywhere -- the people's wish, their disposition. Common state interests and party interests do not damage state interests. I think that if we are to learn anything -- and there is much that we must learn -- it is establishing this kind of attitude in Georgia. [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, Suleyman Demirel, in an interview with us, said that Georgia and Turkey have a lot in common and that a lot of Georgians live in Turkey and are very good citizens. You met some of them; among them the minister of agriculture, Refaettin Sahin, was always with our delegation. There were others as well. You were given Georgian magazines which are published in Turkey, including CHVENEBURI magazine. There were warm contacts there. What can you say about them? How important was it to you as the head of state to meet these Georgians? [Shevardnadze] To say that I was indifferent to them and looking at them casually would not be true. I have always met these people this way. [as heard] In this respect -- about the Georgians there -- I would like to say, and we in Georgia must comprehend it well, that first they are honorable citizens of their own country, as Demirel said and you just repeated. They are honorable citizens of their country, Turkey. Therefore, for honesty and faithfulness to the state, the Turkish Government values them greatly, and trusts and respects them. By playing such a role they will also play the role of a bridge of friendship between Georgia and Turkey. They will do a very good service also to Georgia by being faithful to their adopted country, being devoted, honest and being good citizens and, as I said, they can also play a role as a bridge of friendship. [Oniani] In Turkey you put forward the idea of the commonwealth of commonwealths, that is the CIS plus the alliance of the Black Sea basin countries plus the CSCE. What is it? Is it a continuation of the process of integration or one more mechanism of self-defense for Georgia, and not only Georgia? [Shevardnadze] This is what I would call objective processes, which are under way in today's world. Countries on their own, even gigantic countries will not be able to resolve the issues they are facing, and integration is one of the most important characteristic events of this epoch. Such form of integration as the CIS must be reckoned with within the limits of the vast general process of integration. But the processes in the south, that is, in the Black Sea basin countries, the economic alliance of the Black Sea countries, which is making its first steps and which is just starting to function realistically, must also be taken into consideration. Whatever has already happened in Europe must all the more be reckoned with -- the European Community has taken 30 years to form, and it has reached definite standards and a high level. Generally speaking, when I was talking about the commonwealth of commonwealths, what I mean by the commonwealth of commonwealths is that this commonwealth is not directed against anyone, and must be viewed as a constituent part of the general process of integration. The commonwealth of commonwealths, as you have just said, is the road leading to a space of a single economic or military security which can assume either European, Euro-Asian or finally, a world scale. The commonwealth of commonwealths is the road leading to a space of a single security. [Oniani] Turkey, which has not yet managed to join the European Community, must have been interested in this idea. [Shevardnadze] Many ideas voiced by us or the Turkish authorities have a lot in common. And one more thing, the commonwealth of commonwealths responds to NATO's latest initiatives and Clinton's address -- Partnership for Peace. I view it as a single complex leading to a vast single space. [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, at the meeting with President Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, chairman of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, your suggestion that the meeting of the presidents of the countries of the alliance [Black Sea basin countries] be held in Tbilisi, was approved. You said that judging from this, you believed that order would be established in Tbilisi and Georgia. Establishing order on the highways was discussed at the meeting with businessmen. Enforcement of order was the main theme at the conference of the Tbilisi branch of the Citizens' Union of Georgia, yet rumors circulate that there is a pressure from the high echelons of either authorities or the government, and that these measures will stop halfway and will never be continued. [Shevardnadze] I announced at the meeting the day before yesterday that those who oppose the will of the people, irrespective of what post they may occupy, will not remain in their posts. Order will be established by all means. We cannot stop halfway and we will not stop; this movement making the the country healthier and clearing the atmosphere will not be stopped. If it is stopped, then people will sweep away everybody and everything that prevents them from achieving the set goal. [Oniani] At the Citizens' Union of Georgia conference it was noted that the union's youth organization had been formed. This was announced by Giorgi Maisuradze and Giorgi Baramidze. What is your attitude toward this fact and how do you assess it? [Shevardnadze] I am proud of the youths who are joining the Citizens' Union and those who decided to set up a youth satellite organization having the orientation of the Citizens' Union. They are wonderful youths. I would say one more thing: That the Citizens' Union is an organization for young people -- not only of young people, but for them, as well. This initiative was raised at one of the sessions of the board of the Union, and we all supported it actively. It is a brilliant generation, and they will undoubtedly make our union and the country too, more beautiful, richer, and they will mature, grow up and take over tommorow's Georgia. [Oniani] You said at the conference that the process of Russia's change has begun; and later you said that we would resolve the issue of returning to Abkhazia. We already know about the activities of our delegation in Geneva; a paragraph on the inviolability of the Caucasian borders was contained in a Brussels declaration at a NATO meeting, where Americans raised a peace initiative. In the immediate future, President Yeltsin is to visit Georgia. Judging from all these events, how advantageous are the circumsatnces for resolving the Abkhaz issue and how will Russia participate in this pocess? [Shevardnadze] Resolving the Abkhaz issue without Russia's active participation is impossible. However, anegative role by Russia at different stages may have been, still, today it is such a palpable reality that one should be blind not to be able to see it. [sentence as heard] Therefore, I would say that Russia's participation in peace-keeping initiatives and in resolving the Abkhaz issue in a peaceful manner is a decisive role -- of course, together with and under the auspices of, and not contradictory to the United Nations. Some people are trying to juxtapose them and find a definite contradiction between them. There are no contradictins here. We must also consider Russia's realistic interests when we are talking about securing Georgia's interests in Abkhazia, and not only in Abkhazia. If we understand each other so well -- and I think we should understand each other well and that we will take into consideration each other's interests -- then I believe that the Abkhaz issue will soon be resolved and the refugees will soon return to their homes. Therefore, I repeat, if we want Russia to understand us, then we must understand Russia, the aches, difficulties and contradictions which the Russian state is faced with now. I think that this process of mutual understanding and of building good-neighborly and friendly relations is going well. Now, as for a very important stage in the life of our two countries, President Yeltsin's forthcoming visit -- it is still early days to talk about dates -- will be a great event. I am sure that our citizens welcome his visit. The Tbilisi branch of the Citizens' Union, when I asked them how our capital would receive him, everyone unanimously expressed their feelings and attitude by saying that we must receive him as an honored guest, a representative of a great country, our great neighbor, the president of a great country. At the same time, I would like to remind you of several things that have to be mentioned before his visit. President Yeltsin will be a desired guest for Georgia, among other reasons because -- Georgians know it well, and those who do not, must know -- it is necessary to take into consideration his role in dismantling the empire. Yeltsin is one of the most impressive and distinguished figures, who has taken decisive steps, especially after the August putsch, when he took a course of dismantling the empire, and on the ruins of the empire is building a new form of relations and cooperation which we today call the CIS. It would be a little difficult to talk about Yeltsin without this role; his role was undoubtedly an historical one. Many citizens of Tbilisi remember that after 9 April [massacre of demonstrators in Tbilisi by Soviet Army troops], Yeltsin, who was in the opposition, was one of the first people to visit Tbilisi to express his condolences. I think this must not be forgotten. There is one more thing I wish to recall for the population in Tbilisi and throughout Georgia: When, at a union congress of deputies, Army prosecutor Katushev accused and started to press charges against Georgia, Yeltsin was the first man to leave the hall as a sign of protest. He was then followed by several hundreds of deputies who also left as a sign of protest. Thus, I have always considered him to be Georgia's friend and I would like that the Georgian people receive him as our friend, a great neighbor and friend. [Oniani] The document signed during the meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin, when Clinton arrived in the post-Soviet territory, was viewed as one of the full stops at the end of the Cold War. What can be done about real wars, either in Georgia, the Balkans, or Nagorno-Karabakh, which assumed a horrendous scale? [Shevardnadze] I think that the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting is an important stage, the most important stage for creating a new world strategy since the end of the Cold War, in the same way as the NATO meeting. These are not contradictory events as some people claim by explaining that if NATO becomes stronger and its influence widens, then Russia will die. On the contrary, work will be directed toward creating and forming the single strategic space, to be more accurate, the single security space. I think that we must go even more assiduously toward creating a new world strategy, a new space for security in the world -- of course, including its guarantees, security guarantees for the world. Clinton's visit was one of these steps. If we continue more assiduously, I am sure that every conflict will be resolved. I think that the experience accumulated in the United Nations about the Abkhaz and Samachablo issues...[pauses] if we end the work which we started it will be a good precedent of how the United Nations, the CSCE and great individual countries like the United States of America, Russia, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, England can combine their efforts in order to resolve these local conflicts so that they do not spread. Thus, these conflicts will be resolved and settled in the process of creating this common space. [Oniani] You mentioned at the news conference held before you left Turkey that Abkhazia will be a test case for the United Nations and Russia. [Shevardnadze] When I said that I meant that the conflict in Abkhazia is not of such a vast scale that large states and the United Nations could not resolve it, it is at the same time a potentially very dangerous conflict and resolving it will be a classical example of how a conflict could be settled by means of joint efforts by many states and such a great international organization. [Oniani] Thank you. It was announced on Georgian television yesterday that some persons guilty of finance and credit breaches had been exposed. Then it was announced that the Caucasus Concern, the Caucasus Exchange was a founder of noncommodity operations in Georgia. It begs a natural question -- the leader of this organization today is a vice premier of Georgia [Amiran Kadagishvili]. [Shevardnadze] In principle, I do not wish to jump to conclusions before the investigation is over. I knew that it would be mentioned yesterday -- not this particular fact, but that 12 criminal cases had been instituted. As for drawing the conclusion that the Exchange is mainly to blame, and that it caused everything -- I think it is a little hasty and a premature decision. I think that a wide-scale investigation must be carried out; 12 cases have been instituted, but there may be cases coming up. The fact is that cases have been instituted, and the beginning of an investigation does not define guilt as yet. It will be a complex case and will have to go through complex stages; the process of investigation, then everything must be examined in the prosecutor's office and the prosecutor's conclusion must be confirmed, then court of law follows, and nobody knows what the court will decide. Therefore, let us not jump the gun; let the investigation carry out the task delegated to it by the head of state. I think that everything will be clarified, among other things, the role of the previous government, which imposed the premature introduction of the coupon on parliament and the head of state. Instead of finding a common language with Russia, we made haste and introduced the so-called national currency, to be more accurate, a transitional form of the national currency. The coupon had to be devalued, however unpalatable it may be to say it, and so it did. I do not want to usurp the name of soothsayer, but right from the beginning of the parliamentary sessions I made no secret of it, and I said then that devaluation was imminent. Then I said that it was a forceful step, and not a natural one toward a national currency that is slightly different -- like it was chosen by other countries, among them our neighbors -- a parallel existence of two currencies which painlessly settled the transition to a new feature. [sentence as heard] Much has to be said about the coupon. The issue of whether we will be able to save it or not is problematic. We must try to save it. Once we have made this step and parliament and the executive authorities have made this decision, we must do everything in order to save it, but not in the way they suggest. I watch television and often we are told to forbid selling everything in rubles or dollars and so on. Any kind of ban will result in repercussions and will lead us to the condition whereby products will not be imported; there will be nothing. Therefore, the way of introducing a ban is not the way to strengthen the coupon and we made a mistake when we stated in parliament that it was the sole means of payment. The coupon cannot be strengthened by force; therefore, we must seek other ways, and the authorities are assessing this today. [Oniani] And yet, our entry into the ruble zone is much talked about. How important and useful is it for Georgia if the entry means handing gold mines over to Russia, refusing independent finance and credit emission, annulling economic laws on the Georgian territory for the benefit of Russia, Russia's appointing one of the vice presidents of the National Bank, and so on? There are many demands from the Russian side. [Shevardnadze] Regarding talks and, moreover, a decision about joining the ruble zone -- this issue is unripe. It was probably right that talks and discussions have been started, and Vakhtang Goguadze was right to have raised this issue that has become a topic for discussion. But it does not mean at all that we are to make a decision in the immediate future on joining the ruble zone. It was hasty to have left the zone -- it was still early in the game -- unprepared and unripe in the same way as the issue of joining the zone is unripe today. This problem has not been studied deeply and substantively by scientists and specialists. Yesterday I noticed the opinion poll carried out in the street, and there were terrific responses. Ask specialists -- I am a consumer, a common consumer -- call specialists and let them tell us what the ruble zone is, what we shall gain, and what we shall lose. Once again, I repeat, we must study this issue as one of the solutions to the problem, not the only one. We must seek other ways also. I may say that I do not rule out that another more effective way may be found. One more thing: Now that people are insulting Goguadze, practically calling him the anti-Christ, and wondering how he could have said such a thing, nobody is asking if Russia will accept us in the ruble zone. I think it is a problematic issue. In his statement yesterday, Gaydar spoke about his disagreement over Belarus joining the ruble zone. Russia knows very well that such a poor country as Georgia joining the ruble zone would mean more of a burden, expenses, additional expenses -- she knows it very well. It is not right to kill each other over arguments on whether to join this zone not knowing Russia's stance. I must say that our political culture is on such a level that we must beat each other up for having a different view. It has become a custom unfortunately. A lot is being said about gold deposits. I do not want to say how many kilos we are talking about. The Russians have a saying that translated in Georgian sounds approximately like: Weight of a cat's tear. This is what our gold deposits equal to compared with our rights. It is not significant, it may last us 10-15 days, giving us a temporary respite. We have no more gold deposits. If we had had a lot of gold then we would have been a different country and state, and the coupon would have had a different value. Now, this is how I see it. When am I going to express my view on whether it is going to be the ruble zone, lari [name of the planned Georgian currency], or the coupon, or anything else? I shall probably express my views after my visits in Paris. [Oniani] It will probably be held this week, will it not? [Shevardnadze] Hopefully. What does the status of a developed country, which we have just attained, have in store for us? It means a lot. I shall have contacts with those heads and directors-general who know this business very well and what it would mean for us economically, financially, and so on. I can answer this question more definitely after I meet the World Bank and its management, the management of the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Administration -- especially the international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank. I must carry out a special investigation and account for those $200 million that Sigua says Shevardnadze has hidden away. I do not know where it has been hidden, and if Christopher Columbus was trying to discover America, I, too, shall set off looking for the $200 million and maybe I shall discover it. [laughs] God help me, I may find it. After I have done all this, I shall be able to say what might happen with the coupon and what are the ways out from this state. [Oniani] Your visit to France begins later this week. What do you expect from this visit? [Shevardnadze] I am going to France with great hopes. Not because I am going to bring back suitcases of dollars and francs and so on... [Oniani, interrupting] I hope you will not bring coupons with you. [Shevardnadze, continuing] ...not only for this. Although there may be something interesting in this regard as well. France has traditionally been Georgia's friend. It has always been so and that is still the case today. It is especially tangible now that the Abkhaz issue is so acute. France is one of the initiators of a group called the Group of Georgia's Friends, which together with the United Nations is aspiring to establish peace in Abkhazia and peacefully resolve the conflict there. This envisages the return of refugees, restoring the economy of Abkhazia, and so on. It would not be right for a young democratic and independent country not to have a legal basis with such a great country as France -- a country that has a great reputation and weight. A wonderful treaty on cooperation, friendship, and understanding between the two countries has been prepared, and President Mitterrand and I will sign it. After that, intensive relations between our two countries will start. We are to join the Paris Charter in France. Since the end of the Cold War this charter has been regulating relations in Europe and not only in Europe. The United States and Canada have joined it. This is a charter recognized all over the world. Of course, I am looking forward to a meeting with President Mitterrand, who is one the most remarkable politicians of our times. Many other interesting and useful meetings are awaiting us in Paris, including meetings with UNESCO and other international organizations, various parties, government leaders, and so on. I think that close ties with Paris and a process of establishing closer ties, which is now starting and which lays the foundation of our new relations, will undoubtedly help us emerge from the crisis as soon as possible. I am leaving for Paris with these hopes. [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to the head of state and Supreme Council chairman, Eduard Shevardnadze.
