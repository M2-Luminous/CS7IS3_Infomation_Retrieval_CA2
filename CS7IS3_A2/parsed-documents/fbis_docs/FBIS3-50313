MTI's Warsaw correspondent yesterday reported that Polish Minister of Defence Piotr Kolodziejczyk, returning from a visit to Prague, said on Tuesday evening [25 January] that a military exercise of this kind, the largest held within the Peace Partnership framework, would be held shortly. Erdelyi said military exercises would definitely be held within the Peace Partnership, but no concrete preparations have been made so far. NATO member states would also participate, as one of the goals is to coordinate with the western military forces.
