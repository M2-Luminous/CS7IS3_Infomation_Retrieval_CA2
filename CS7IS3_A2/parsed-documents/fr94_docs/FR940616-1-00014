FR940616-1-00014 FR940616-1-00005 The Service proposes to amend the regulations to provide for the issuance of eagle permits when the parts are lawfully possessed by American Indians and public institutions for the transportation into and out of the United States. The intent or the end result of the transportation into and out of the United States by American Indians and public institutions shall not be, under any circumstance, for the purchase, sale, barter or trade of bald eagle or golden eagle parts, nests or eggs. The Service proposes to provide that eagle permits of limited duration may be issued under substantially the same general requirements and conditions applicable to the domestic possession and transportation of such articles by American Indians and public institutions. The Service hopes that this revision of the regulation will facilitate the international travel of American Indians and representatives of public institutions. The Service believes that it can serve its mandate to protect and preserve the viability of bald eagle or golden eagle populations and at the same time provided for a reasonable and proper balance of regulations which address the legitimate needs of the American Indian community and public institutions. In addition to the above changes, several references within the Sections have been updated or more clearly stated. Required Determinations Note. This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior (Department) certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630. The only effect of this rule will be to make it easier for American Indians and public institutions to travel or move internationally with lawfully possessed articles containing bald or golden eagle parts. This proposed rule does not contain any additional information collection requirements, beyond those approved under OMB approval Number 1018&hyph;0022, that would require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This action does not contain any federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. These proposed changes in the regulations in Part 22 are regulatory and enforcement actions which are covered by a categorical exclusion from National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 516 Departmental Manual. An Environmental Action Memorandum is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office in Arlington, Virginia. The determination has been made pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act that the proposed revision to Part 22 will not effect a federally listed species. Civil Justice Reform_Executive Order 12778 In revising these regulations the Service has made every reasonable effort in formulating these proposals to ensure that these regulations: (A) Have no preemptive effects upon other regulations not being revised herein. (B) The major effects upon Federal regulations is to provide eagle permits for the transportation into and out of the United States with lawfully obtained bald and golden eagle parts, nests, and eggs, for American Indian tribe religious use and public institutions for scientific and exhibition purposes. (C) The standards proposed in this proposed revision are intended to articulate a precise and understandable criterion of what transportation into and out of the United States is being regulated and how the affected interests may conform their activities and comply with applicable eagle permit regulations. This standard will promote regulatory simplification and burden reduction upon affected interests by providing notice: (1) That members of American Indian tribes and public institutions may now take their lawfully obtained eagle parts, nests, eggs, or items containing such with them when they travel outside the territory of the United States; (2) That, a Service eagle permit is required in order to transport eagle parts, nests, or eggs into or out of the United States; (3) That the Service will issue such permits under specified permit ``Issuance criteria'' stated in 50 CFR 22.22(c); (4) That permits for the transportation of eagle parts, nests, or eggs into and out of the United States will be of certain and limited duration; and (5) That the import, export purchase, sale, barter, or trade, of eagle parts, nests, or eggs shall remain prohibited by regulation. (D) These proposed changes to the regulations in title 50 CFR part 22 are intended to have no retroactive effect directly or indirectly. (E) The Service Administrative procedures for permit application, issuance, revocation, denial, and appeal are set out in title 50 CFR part 13. No additional Administrative procedures are anticipated for exhaustion of remedies. (F) All key terms have been defined within the CFR.
