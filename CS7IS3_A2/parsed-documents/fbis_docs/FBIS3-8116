Mazowiecki has insisted on the importance of this event for quite some time in his reports. The opening of the airport defended by the Muslims in Tuzla in Bosnia was announced by Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs in Moscow on Tuesday. Mazowiecki, special rapporteur of the UN human rights commission on the observance of human rights in the former Yugoslavia, returned to Warsaw from Geneva on Wednesday, where he had presented his report on Monday. The conflict entered a new phase from the moment that the heavy divisions left Sarajevo in result of the pressure exerted by the UN secretary general and NATO, emphasized Mazowiecki, adding that for the first time the international community has put its words into action. "This is why we can hope that peace in this region is possible," he concluded.
