To help them cope with the rigours of competition, academics suggested that the education level of labourers as well as their ability to take the initiative to learn new skills should be improved. In the seminar, "The Thai economy in the Year 2000", at the Royal Orchid Hotel on Wednesday, Dr Pawadi Thong-uthai, an associate professor of economics at Thammasat University, said Thai manufacturing industries in the future will have to place greater emphasize more on efficiency, cost reductions and the adoption of new technology. [sentence as published] They will have to respond quickly to market demand. With improved communications technology, they may have to adapt production in response to market orders and rely on fast delivery. "Thailand will see growth in the adoption of the subcontract system, such as in garments and jewelry. This will reduce labour costs and help diversify risks. As the market will be increasingly volatile, (under the subcontract system) the main company will not have to invest (so much) in machinery. They can rely on the facilities of small subcontracting factories," she said. Pawadi said to add production flexibility, the main plant will hire only the best workers and subcontract part of the production to small factories. Employment will be separated into two main categories. The first class labourers working at the main plant will have higher wages and more job security. The second class workers in subcontracting factories will be hired temporarily to fill individual contracts. The subcontract system has both advantages and disadvantages. It helps a company compete, if it can ensure strict quality control and especially if the main factory assists the subcontracting factories in utilizing new production techniques. "But the downside is that labourers (in subcontracting firms) will not have job security. Even in Japan (where lifetime employment is a common pattern) the second class workers are the first to be laid off," Pawadi said. They tend to work longer hours, and under pressure. Most of these `second-class' labourers will have recently left the agricultural sector.
