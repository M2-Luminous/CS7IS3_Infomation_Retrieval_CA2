The warning was contained in a letter sent to the Southern Command by Ustadz Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, leader of the Sulu- based extremist group. Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, chief of the Southern Command, earlier ordered Col. Ponciano Millena, 2d Marine Brigade chief, to disband the group at all costs. The military reportedly planned an offensive against the Abu Sayyaf, now said to be holed up in the villages of Takes Jakil and Buhangiran in Patikul, Sulu. The group was reported to have joined forces with the "lost command" group of Commander Redjulan. Regional Police Director Roberto Lastimoso has placed all police personnel here on alert and ordered the setting up of checkpoints in the city's strategic entry points. "We cannot be intimidated by the Abu Sayyaf," he said. The group abandoned its main headquarters in Basilan last June and sought sanctuary in Patikul after the military launched an all-out operation after the kidnapping of Fr. Bernardo Blanco and six-year-old Luis Anthony Biel. Blanco was able to escape, while Biel was later freed by his captors. The Special Action Group of the Philippine National Police arrested on Friday a suspected member of the Abu Sayyaf along Governor Lim Avenue here. Police identified him as Jalilul Amin, 31, of Jolo, Sulu. Seized from Alalin's possession were a .357 Magnum revolver and a handheld radio.
