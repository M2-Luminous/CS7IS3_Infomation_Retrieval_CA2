In the words of Yevgeniy Belyayev, the committee chairman, just in 9 months of this year the incidence of measles in Russia increased by 4.2 times, that of whooping cough increased by 29 percent, and that of epidemiological parotitis grew by 31 percent in comparison with the same period of last year. In 1993, 10 outbreaks of dysentery, typhoid fever, hepatitis and salmonellosis were noted in the country, as a result of which around 7,000 persons became sick. Diphtheria is assuming epidemic proportions: The number of patients with this infection has reached 5,000, and around 300 patients have died, to include 50 children. In Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion this situation is the result of the unfavorable state of the environment, a decrease in the immune status of Russian, the failure to immunize many children and adults, and the shortage of vitamins and of therapeutic and preventive drugs. According to information from the ``Kedr'' constructive ecology movement, which is cooperating actively with the country's epidemiological services, around 60,000 Russian citizens are living today in places where the maximum permissible concentrations of toxic substances are perpetually exceeded. Levels of atmospheric contamination exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations by 10 times are periodically recorded in over 80 of the country's cities and industrial centers. Each year around 28 cubic kilometers of contaminated liquid wastes are dumped into Russia's water basins, including 8.4 cubic kilometers untreated. Highly toxic organic compounds, salts of heavy metals, phenols and petroleum products are detected in water sources. In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr'' movement, the threat to the health of the population, primarily children, motivated its members to start a drive to purchase from other countries a large quantity of medical preparations that raise immunity, and equipment with which to make them in Russia. After the needed pharmaceuticals are acquired, specialists of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight will deliver them with the help of active members of the ``Kedr'' movement to citizens needing them most in the threatened regions.
