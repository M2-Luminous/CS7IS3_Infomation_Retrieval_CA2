FR940607-1-00012 FR940607-1-00003 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 240 and 249 [Release No. 34&hyph;34140; File No. S7&hyph;17&hyph;94] RIN 3235&hyph;AG15 Proposed Rule Changes of Self Regulatory Organizations; Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements of National Securities Exchanges, Securities Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and Form 19b&hyph;4, the rule and form that set forth the procedures for the filing by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') of proposed rule changes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amendments would expand the scope of those proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposed amendments are intended to expedite and streamline the process through which proposed rule changes are filed and become effective. The Commission also is proposing to amend the rules and forms applicable to the annual filing of amendments to registration statements of national securities exchanges, securities associations, and reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, to streamline those requirements. DATES: Comments should be received on or before August 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 6&hyph;9, Washington, DC 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;17&hyph;94. All comment letters received will be made available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, or Andrew S. Margolin, Attorney, at (202) 942&hyph;0073, Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 7&hyph;10, Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on SRO Rule Filings A. Statutory Framework for Filing of Proposed Rule Changes Section 19(b)(1) 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 2 (``Exchange Act'' or ``Act'') requires a self-regulatory organization 3 to file with the Commission its proposed rule changes 4 accompanied by a concise general statement of the basis and purpose of the proposed rule change. Once a proposed rule change has been filed, the Commission is required to publish notice of it and provide an opportunity for public comment. The proposed rule change may not take effect unless it is approved by the Commission or is otherwise permitted to become effective under Section 19(b) of the Act. 5 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 2 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. 3 Section 3(a)(26) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง78c(a)(26), defines the term ``self-regulatory organization'' to mean any national securities exchange, registered securities association, registered clearing agency, and, for purposes of Section 19(b) and other limited purposes, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''). 4 Section 19(b)(1) of the Act defines the term ``proposed rule change'' to mean ``any proposed rule or rule change in addition to, or deletion from the rules of [a] self-regulatory organization.'' In turn, Sections 3(a)(27) and 3(a)(28) of the Act provide, essentially, that the term ``rules of a self-regulatory organization'' means (i) the rules of the MSRB and the constitution, articles of incorporation, bylaws, and rules, or instruments corresponding to the foregoing, of any other SRO and (ii) such stated policies, practices, and interpretations of an SRO (other than the MSRB) as the Commission, by rule, may determine to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to be deemed to be rules. The Commission has exercised this rulemaking authority in paragraph (b) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, which defines the term ``stated policy, practice, or interpretation.''

No. 94&hyph;75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 22&hyph;38 (Comm. Print 1975)(``Senate Report''), reprinted in , [1975] U.S. Code Cong. & Ad.

Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 6 sets forth the standards and time periods for Commission action either to approve a proposed rule change or to institute and conclude a proceeding to determine whether a proposed rule change should be disapproved. Generally, the Commission must either approve the proposed rule change or institute disapproval proceedings within 35 days of the publication of notice of the filing or within such longer period if the Commission finds appropriate or to which the SRO consents. The Commission must approve a proposed rule change if it finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the SRO proposing the rule change. If the Commission does not make that finding, it must institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. The Commission also may approve a proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to 30 days after publication of the notice if the Commission finds good cause for so doing and publishes its reasons for so finding. 7 6 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). 7 Section 19(b)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B). Section 19(b)(3) of the Act 8 provides that, in certain circumstances, a proposed rule change may become effective without the notice and approval procedures required by Section 19(b)(2). Paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) permits certain types of proposed rule changes to take effect in this manner if appropriately designated by the SRO as within the following categories: (1) Constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the SRO; 9 (2) establishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the SRO; 10 or (3) concerned solely with the administration of the SRO. Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) also gives the Commission the authority to expand by rule the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) if the Commission determines that the expansion is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of Section 19(b). Rule 19b&hyph;4(e) implements the authority of Section 19(b)(3)(A) by detailing further the scope of proposed rule changes that may be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). The rule tracks those categories enumerated in Section 19(b)(3)(A) mentioned above and also includes a category adopted in 1980 relating to registered clearing agencies. 11 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3). 9 Rule 19b&hyph;4(b) defines the term ``stated policy, practice or interpretation'' to mean generally any material aspect of the operation of the facilities of the SRO or any statement made available to the membership, participants, or specified persons thereof that establishes or changes any standard, limit, or guideline with respect to rights and obligations of specified persons or the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule. 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4(b). 10 The Commission has stated that as a matter of general policy, a proposed rule change of an SRO, other than the MSRB, that establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge applicable to a non-member or non-participant should be filed under Section 19(b)(2) for full notice and comment. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17258 (October 30, 1980), 45 FR 73906, at 73910. 11 The 1980 amendment, which is similar to the amendments proposed today, expanded the category of filings that qualify to take effect under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include those proposed rule changes that relate to mechanical or operational details of existing clearing agency services and thus are similar to ``solely administrative'' rules. The adopting release stated that the Commission was not expanding the category at that time to include rule changes of SROs other than registered clearing agencies, but that it could become appropriate to do so as other SROs developed more varied and complex services.
