They were received by students and workers from the Federico Engels Pre-University Vocational Exact Sciences Institute, with whom they discussed the teaching system used at this center as part of the revolutionary education [program], linking study with work. In foreign policy we work from the basis of what is done in the interior of the country, and tobacco is one of the principal scenes. That is why we are here -- said Minister Robaina, upon visiting tobacco fields in San Juan [y Martinez] and San Luis Municipalities. On that occasion, he and those accompanying him spoke with mobilized workers, volunteers, and Havana students who are fulfilling their phase of the School-in-the-Fields plan. This province produces 70 percent of Cuba's tobacco, a product that brings approximately $100 million to the the national economy. This year, the people of Pinar del Rio have planted 1,800 caballerias of tobacco, from which they expect to harvest approximately 470,000 quintals of a quality far higher than that seen in recent times. After spending an entire day with us in Pinar del Rio, these colleagues of the press have had an opportunity to get to know the reality of the Cuban people more closely.
