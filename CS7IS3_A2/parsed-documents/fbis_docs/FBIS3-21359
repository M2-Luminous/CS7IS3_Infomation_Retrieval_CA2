Karim: "Following FIS Representatives' Statements Halting Violence, `Armed Islamic Group' Announces It Is Decision Maker"] [Text] Yesterday's faxed statement by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) presented the group's stand on dialogue in a way that contradicted the view that Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam presented last week. The GIA thus is trying to register its presence forcefully in preparation for the next phase. Regarding negotiations with the government, the GIA said that "the mujahidin are those who make the decisions; no one may speak as a mujahid or in their name except the GIA--certainly not those who live overseas." Kebir, Haddam Seek To Go It Alone, Obtain Prominence The group, which in the past has announced that it does not belong to the FIS, added a warning about how "media glitter and the temptation of enticing positions is causing some groups to forget our mutual promise to unite the ranks of mujahidin in a unified organization. A clique has appeared, alleging that it speaks for the mujahidin, in order to participate in talks and negotiations with the regime in the manner of the FIS leaders at home and abroad." Externally, the GIA's statement goes on to confirm the existence of talks with the government--what it terms "maneuvers"--saying that it had warned against them, but that they have now become a tangible reality through positions taken in various places to stop the "jihad" and embark on dialogue with the regime. The GIA, which is led by Djaafar Seifalla [God's Sword] (called "El Afghani"), was alluding to Rabah Kebir's statement linking continued talks by the FIS to the extent of Liamine Zeroual's acceptance of the five conditions that Ali Benhadj has demanded, as well as to the statement against violence that a delegation of FIS representatives made overseas through Anwar Haddam. In the latter statement, Haddam came out demanding a halt to acts of violence against Algerians (civilians and military personnel) and foreigners who did not become involved in security operations. The GIA thinks that "these men and others are trying to go it alone and obtain prominence at the expense of true Islam." Makhloufi an Intelligence Agent, Traitor On a related matter, the statement mentions what it calls "internal maneuvers" that it said coincided with a number of maneuvers that Said Makhloufi engineered to split the ranks of the mujahidin from within. Among these was the discovery of elements that the latter had planted in mujahidin ranks. The statement added that 70 of these infiltrated elements had been executed and that the others' turn would come--especially that of their leader. The statement opens fire on Said Makhloufi, whom it accuses of treason and threatens with execution. This seems to explain the disputes between the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which is said to consist mostly of participants in the Afghan war, and the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA), which, according to circulated reports, has turned into the FIS' army. Said Makhloufi and Abdelkader Chebouti head the latter. No Presence for FIS and Its Army In an earlier statement, the GIA said that it is not the FIS' military wing, but an independent group. The same statement, issued about two and one-half months ago after the tape by Said Makhloufi and the statement by Abdelrezak Redjam, contained threats against Makhloufi's group and the "big butcher's friends," [as published] whom it described as "opportunistic groups whom everyone knows got on the train when it was about to pull into its destination." Yesterday's statement, however, did not allude to "the big butcher's friends"; it merely described Kebir and Haddam, who are close to this current, as "those who are seeking to go it alone and become prominent." Also, the GIA did not include in its last statement its stress on continuing the "jihad," nor did the statement include the words, "No dialogue, no compromise, no negotiating, no discussion, no handing of power to a neutral government or transition government, and no half-solutions"--words that occurred in the previous statement. The authors of the latest statement preferred not to use these words. The group's concern may be to record its presence during this period so that it is not overlooked in any proposed solutions to stop the violence. In this context, it has adopted the method of intensified media activity. Speaking in an interview with AL-WASAT magazine before the date of the national convention, one of Djaafar El Afghani's assistants--he said he was head of the political and legal committee--tried to claim responsibility for all the assassinations reported throughout Algeria. He said that although the GIA was founded in 1989, its military activity began on 18 December 1991. He added that most of its members were Algerians who had been in Afghanistan. Speaking for Djaafar El Afghani about assassinations of foreigners, the speaker declared: "We have attacked foreign Jews, Christians, and pagans, because they are part of the imperialist plot. They represent the vital artery and the heart of every occupation, whether external or internal." He added: "Those foreigners represent the regime's economic backbone. Their safe presence indicates that the country is living in a normal state." Responding to a question about possible merger or cooperation with the army of the FIS, he said: "We wonder who this front is to which you are referring and what army it is about which so much has been said, especially now that peaceful solutions involving capitulation are being brought forward. If anyone has something else to say, let him confirm it inside the country in the land of fire and dust, not in Intercontinental, Holiday, and Hilton hotels." Regarding a possible FIS accommodation with the government, he said: "The position of the GIA will be defined by the Shura Council of mujahidin and the courts of Islamic law."
