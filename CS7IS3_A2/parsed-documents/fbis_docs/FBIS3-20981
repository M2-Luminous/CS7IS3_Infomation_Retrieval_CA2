"I'm going to buy some bread," calls the five-year-old to his mother on Saturday morning. She replies, "OK, but don't forget the chip card." Benjamin routinely pays the baker with the card. "Where did you last see a doctor?" asks the physician in Munich. He is talking to the tourist from Hamburg who is having heart trouble. Instead of answering, the patient inserts the medical insurance record chip card into the physician's computer, releases the data stored in the chip using his personal identification number, and allows the doctor to read the patient's history. "Please insert your chip card," requests the screen of the new arrival. Only after comparing the typed code with the code stored on the chip card does the computer network become enabled for the user. Paying, storing, unlocking. The variety of applications of the plastic card is virtually inexhaustible thanks to the integrated chip that may contain a complete minicomputer. The handy medium is opening completely new possibilities of drumming up customers primarily for the service branch. "The present applications are just scratching the surface," says Hans-Dietrich Kreft. He is the managing director of Angewandte Digital Elektronik (ADE) from Dassendorf in North Germany. Kreft is one of the most committed trail blazers of the chip-card technology. The untiring promoter was among the winners in 1987 of the innovation prize of the German economy. Today, he can be certain that the chip card is conquering the world with mass applications. The Europeans, in particular the French and Germans, are the front runners. They have an important advantage, "the larger domestic market," says Winfried Gaal. He is the product manager at Giesecke & Devrient (G&D), a chip-card manufacturer in Munich. After successfully introducing the phonecard, the Germans are now reaching for the chip twice with the medical-insurance chip card and a new Euroscheck [check guarantee] chip card. While the electronic substitute for the medical insurance record card will be introduced starting on the first of January 1994, the new 'ec' chip card will presumably be available in 1995, according to information from the banking branch. About 120 million chip cards will be necessary just for these two applications. The European electronics industry, which has not exactly been spoiled, is the beneficiary. "The chip card can become a new pillar for the European semiconductor industry," predicts Ulrich Hamann. He is the director of marketing for chip-card ICs at Siemens AG. Besides Motorola as the only non-European, just Siemens, Bull, SGS-Thomson and Philips possess the necessary know-how and fabrication capacities at this time. Due to this, the ranking of vendors is unusual for electronics conditions. With 30 per cent of the market, both Siemens and Motorola are running neck and neck, followed by SGS-Thomson and Philips. Hitachi appears in fifth place as the first Japanese chip manufacturer. It has a skimpy six per cent of the market. The Europeans have fallen by the wayside in the triad competition. However, they may be able to experience another success story with the chip card similar to that for the GSM standard for cellular telephones. This has proven to be an export hit. In any case, the timing of the market introduction is perfect. The insurance card does not appear to make sense at first glance because the potential of the chip is not fully exploited. Only the data present on the medical insurance record card are stored. The physician prints out a standardized form with these data and continues to handwrite his services on this form. However, this is just what the semiconductor manufacturers want. On the one hand, "Using these relatively simple chips, we can learn how to stabilize our production process," according to the Siemens expert Hamann. On the other hand, the corresponding readers and physician's computers will create an infrastructure that will subsequently enable the use of more demanding chip cards. Consequently, the big bang in the card industry is set. Market surveys by Siemens claim that the world market for the chips the size of a finger nail will grow from 160 million marks last year to almost 1,000 million marks in 1997. Of this amount, the German chip manufacturer wants half. Axel Hartstang is the managing director of the German subsidiary of Motorola. He expects that sales of less than 50 million cards currently will grow almost ten times to more than 400 million within five years. In this respect, the chips are only a fraction of the business. They must be integrated into the card and personalized for the individual user by special service providers. For image reasons, marketing strategies allow the plastic substrate to accept high-quality printing. In addition, the system operates only with readers. With the domestic market and technical lead, the Europeans have the best chance of dominating the world market over the long term. Card producers such as G&D, Orga Kartensysteme, Oldenburg, Gemplus and Schlumberger are already supplying their products to the burgeoning markets in Australia, Brazil, South Africa and Hong Kong. Success is beckoning Siemens even into the lion's den. The conglomerate from Munich is on the verge of completing deals with Dai Nippon Printing and Toppan, two of the largest printing firms in the world. The company from Munich is to supply chips to Japan. The chips will be installed in cards there. The Europeans have also been working flat out on chips that offer processors and complex operating systems (so-called controllers). Courageously, they are now defying Motorola, the vendor previously dominant in this sector. These open systems form the prerequisite for so-called multifunctional cards. Such cards allow not only one special application but can even be equipped with new functions later. Consequently, according to the plans of the Central Credit Committee (ZKA), the owners of the new 'ec' cards will not just be able to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines and make telephone calls. These cards will also function as electronic wallets. To allow for the transfer of small amount such as paying for bread, the chips are loaded with specific sums which can be paid out little by little. For larger amounts, a credit line is stored on the card. Even the primitive medical insurance chip card will be extended to a comprehensive patient card over the long term. Then, it will store data regarding accidents and portions of the medical history in addition to management specifications. Such multifunctional cards could also work as tickets for buses and trains. While buying the correct ticket at an automat is more of a game of chance today--primarily in strange cities--the electronics does everything for the user of the chip card. "Because of this, we are hoping to reduce the inhibition threshold and get more customers to use public transportation," says Achim Muller. He is the managing director and consultant for the cities of Luneburg and Oldenburg. Without having to study any sort of schedule, the rider inserts his card into a reader when entering and exiting. The central computer can then not only determine the cheapest fare. Frequent riders also get a discount. In Luneburg, no rider pays more within 30 days than the price of a monthly ticket.
