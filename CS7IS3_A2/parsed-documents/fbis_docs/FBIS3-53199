Under the headline "The Madrid Formula is the Basis," AL-BA'TH says: Undoubtedly, the entire world is showing great interest in the summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. AL-BA'TH indicates that U.S. political circles are showing special interest in the summit. Considering it a major event in the peace process, these circles pin hopes on it as an effort to achieve real progress toward the aspired peace. Noting U.S. political circles' statements, the paper says that these statements affirm that the importance of the Geneva summit stems from the issues that will be raised for discussion. The U.S. political circles believe that the summit will discuss very substantial and meaningful issues, especially since President Hafiz al-Asad will emphasize the stipulations of the Madrid peace conference. These stipulations stress a comprehensive solution through the implementation of the UN resolutions which call for a full, comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. AL-BA'TH says that Syria went to the Madrid conference and then to the Washington talks with a specific and clear vision of the nature of peace. A few days from now, Syria will go to the Geneva summit with the same view because of its absolute faith in the need to work to establish a just, comprehensive regional peace which will guarantee Arab rights. The paper says that despite all that has happened and all that might happen, Syria will not change its stands concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is because Syria is fully convinced that without a full, comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, it is impossible to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The prerequisites and requirements of a genuine peace are known and clear. He who wants such a peace to prevail will only have to abide by implementing the contents of the Madrid formula, which will continue to be the basic pillar of any effort to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. TISHRIN also comments on the al-Asad-Clinton summit. It affirms that the summit will give a very strong boost to the peace process. This is because, according to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Syria is a main player in the region and has a very important role with regard to the achievement of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN adds that this U.S. acknowledgement of Syria's sincere cooperation to render the peace process successful did not rise from a vacuum. Rather, it is based on the experiences of two years of talks in Washington, during which Syria provided an example in the quest for a just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Only a genuine peace can hold fast in the face of events and changes. The paper says that Syria has never sought separate deals, nor has it been involved in maneuvers or bargains. Rather, its main concern is to establish a firm peace which leads to a Middle East peace and improves the world peace climate. For over two years, Syria has warned against the course of separate deals and unequivocally proved that such deals do not make peace. TISHRIN adds: Syria's past and present announcements are shared and approved by all peace advocates. Syria firmly believes that for peace to hold in the face of events and developments, it should be just, fair, and comprehensive. A just, comprehensive peace requires Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and recognizing the Palestinian people's basic rights. TISHRIN indicates that Syria has a genuine interest in peace, as does the United States and the world. Stability in the Middle East is vital for world stability. World peace will remain incomplete without peace in the Middle East. However, peace does not depend on Syria and the Arab parties alone. It requires a substantial change in the Israeli position and a categorical Israeli commitment to the implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions, something which has not happened so far. Concluding its comment, the paper says that for its part, Syria will do all it can in the interest of a just, comprehensive peace. In this context, the United States is called upon to employ its influence, which is very great, to make Israel accept the resolutions of the international legitimacy as a basis and a framework for peace leading to the establishment of rights and an end to the occupation and the acts of repression and terrorism against the Palestinian people. On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH runs a commentary under the headline "The Summit of Hope." It says: On the eve of President Clinton's European tour, which he will conclude with the summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher emphasized Syria's important role in the quest for a comprehensive peace in the region. He said that this pivotal role renders the Geneva summit extremely important, something that will affect the overall peace process. He also reiterated his country's commitment to an honest and sincere full-partner role. AL-THWARAH believes that what Christopher has said reflects the unchanging U.S. position on the issue of a comprehensive and just peace on all fronts of the conflict. It also proves that Washington is not convinced of the usefulness of partial solutions and separate deals that are held in secret and away from the formula and bases of the Madrid conference. The paper says that although it welcomed the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the U.S. Administration still believes that any attempt to impose an incomplete solution that bypasses Syria's role and that is not in line with its vision and concept of the nature, bases, and requirements of peace, will have grave consequences for the region's security and stability. AL-THAWRAH says that the U.S. Administration is certainly aware of Syria's credibility in the peace process and the extent of Syria's seriousness about working to establish the aspired peace.
