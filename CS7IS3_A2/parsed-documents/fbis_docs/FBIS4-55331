The course of events lately has unsettled relations between Zagreb and Istria. It began in mid-April with the foundation of the Council for Istria, that did not include the IDS representatives who had won the elections in Istria. Furthermore, the Statute of the Istrian County was annulled. In a very tense situation, with the media scrutinizing the situation through its magnifying glass, in late April the IDS organized an extraordinary convention of the party in Rovinj, at which heretical demands for a special, autonomous status for Istria were stated again. [Jurkovic] How do you assess the new tension between Zagreb and Istria? [Jakovcic] There are no changes in relations between official Zagreb and Istria. That is, the consistent policy of President Franjo Tudjman is proven to be so only by the example of Istria. From the 1990 electoral campaign up to now we have had a situation of continuous depreciation of the Istrian authorities -- represented by the Social Democratic Party before, and now by the IDS -- and the rejection of any initiative coming from Istria. [Jurkovic] A different interpretation is also possible, that you are looking for bad blood beforehand. You condemned the foundation of the Council for Istria from the outset. [Jakovcic] It is solely official Zagreb that is to blame for such relations between the central administration and Istria. I can prove this quite simply. In the referendum for independent and sovereign Croatia a great majority of the Istrian people had voted for it, just as they voted for the IDS in the elections. Which is to say, Istria is indeed for Croatia, but for a democratic Croatia, rather than for one ruled by the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ]. We have to give careful consideration to any initiative made by the state leadership, because any initiative by official Zagreb in these four years has been aimed at crushing the authorities in Istria, and causing disorder. It is not a coincidence that as many as three messages came from Zagreb -- first, there was the establishment of the Council for Istria, which I commented very cautiously, though it is not true that I rejected a priori the establishment of that council. I just wanted to have some latitude in order to see what it was all about. Immediately thereafter the Statute was annulled -- actually it happened on the same day. And thirdly, we received at the same time the message from the parliament's highest officials that the problem of Istria may as well be settled by the police, the army, or the executive boards. Of course, such an attitude already verges upon totalitarian methods, which we have to condemn. [Jurkovic] How would you comment the assessment, which I personally hold to be true, that the HDZ and IDS work according to the principle of two vessels linked together, so that pressure applied by HDZ strengthens the IDS, and vice versa. In concrete terms, does the IDS have any use for the actions taken by the HDZ? [Jakovcic] Neither Istria nor the IDS can make any use of the attacks by the HDZ, or steps taken by President Tudjman, because any straining of relations between Istria and official Zagreb in no way benefits Istria, nor, therefore, Croatia as a whole. The suspension of democracy that is being announced means "good night" to Croatia. The HDZ, which is thus making internal enemies, follows the logic: Divide et impera [divide and rule]. It wants to divide the citizens of Croatia in order to be able to control them more easily. Of course, Istria will resist this, because we want to be fully present in the Croatian political life with our principles. That is the problem that our dispute is about. [Jurkovic] Will the IDS agree to take part in the activities of the Council for Istria after all that has been said these days? [Jakovcic] In view of the current circumstances I do not see any possibility of the IDS representatives' taking part in the Council's work. Still, I cannot foresee what the County Assembly will decide. To say that the Council will be engaged in economic, cultural, or similar matters means to suspend the county's leadership, and indirectly the Croatian government, because that is a job of the executive bodies. After all, I may well feel that the Council is an attempt to create parallelism and overthrow the authorities, but what I really want to feel is that it is a council that would make suggestions to the president to reconsider an appropriate status for Istria, in view of all the events, the election results, the mood among the citizens, and Istria's surroundings. That would be a positive advance, and we might possibly discuss our joining the Council. [Jurkovic] In addition to the Council the relations are tensed also because of the annulment of the Statute of the Istrian county, for which you said recently that it was the minimum of what Istria wanted. We Are Defending Our Country's Reputation [Jakovcic] Firstly, the Statute is in compliance with the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, and we shall prove this at the Constitutional Court, and show that Istria absolutely observes Croatia's legislation. Of course, the Statute is not an expression of the political will of Istria's citizens, for neither the country's system, nor the legislation are an expression of the will of Istria's citizens. You remember how we struggled in the parliament to change the bill on the territorial organization of the Republic of Croatia, so that the territory could be organized according to the historic regions, but our efforts failed. The Statute is not an expression of the political attitudes of the IDS, because we demand that Croatia be regionalized in such a way that the regional assemblies are given the legislative and governing authority. We see modern Croatia as a country of regions founded on the tradition of Stjepan Radic's [Croatian politician, assassinated in 1926 because he supported independent Croatia] constitution that read, let me quote: "Counties must adopt regulations, of a quality equal to that of laws." Another buttress of our regionalism is the European standard of organizing regions. That is a condition sine qua non [necessary condition] of the IDS activities. [Jurkovic] It is precisely your advocating Europe that is disputable. For instance, you are being reproached for having taken a copy of the bill on the constitutional law on Istria with you to Geneva without the knowledge of the Foreign Ministry. How did that happen, and why? [Jakovcic] Firstly, the IDS defends the Croatian reputation in the world wherever it goes, and this we can rightfully prove by documents, deeds, our struggle for minorities' rights, for the freedom of media, for private ownership, for individual freedom. Since we are an eminent regional party, we are quite respected in Europe, so we were invited to the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. The delegation of the Council of Europe will visit Croatia soon, including us as well. The IDS has a right to be politically active on the European political stage in its own way. As for your question, it should be said that no move has been made without previously having informed the Croatian authorities of our demands, because we do nothing behind their back, before we inform either the president or the Government of our intentions. We discuss everything in the Assembly, while the fact that some eminent European politicians, being familiar with the power structure in Croatia, show interest in talking directly with the IDS is something else. [Jurkovic] Let us further discuss the disputed bill. As early as in September 1993 the bill was discussed for the first time, while at the party convention in Rovinj it was brought into the focus of attention again. What is the document about? [Jakovcic] The bill was worked out following the experience and practice of European regionalism, which means that the County Assembly is to be given legislative and governing authority. It involves also the apportionment of revenue, where, if it were organized as we have envisaged, one-third would suffice for the state, while two-thirds of the revenue would remain in the region. [Jurkovic] Ivan Herak has recently stated that President Tudjman, when he learned about the program, agreed to the possibility that two-thirds of the revenue should remain in the region, as a pilot-program for economic autonomy, but he did not want to hear about the county's having legislative authority. Can you confirm this, since you have talked with the president yourself? [Jakovcic] Either Mr. Herak is lying, or Tudjman has really changed his stance. I am not familiar with such an assessment, but I would really be glad if the situation were so. I believe that many relations would be different if such a political will, in favor of apportioning the revenue, existed. Still, it seems to me that Herak improvised [as published] the statement, because such an apportionment means consequently the apportionment of authority. We cannot expect the government to get smaller, and to pay for everything else. Therefore it is clear that his statement is not true. Fear of Totalitarianism [Jurkovic] All right then, but would you still explain why the constitutional law is again being insisted upon? [Jakovcic] Because it is natural that the Croatian Assembly should adopt the bill on the regional organization of Croatia, or at least adopt it with regard to certain regions. It is also natural that our current status cannot be as the IDS would wish it to be, because no corresponding constitutional law exists, and therefore the Bill has been worked out in compliance with the existing regulations. Constitutional law is a normal legislative form in the industrialized democratic states, by which certain regions are given their own authorities and statuses within a particular state. [Jurkovic] Does it mean that you shall propose the same to the Assembly? [Jakovcic] Yes, when we decide that it is necessary. [Jurkovic] Still, it is unrealistic that the proposal would pass in the Assembly, so would you explain what a participant at the IDS convention meant when he speculated what would happen if the proposal was rejected in the Assembly? [Jakovcic] Any policy, if it is wise, brings about actions that benefit the citizens it represents. I believe that our party will be taking such actions, so that it will propose the constitutional law at the moment when we estimate it could win the majority of votes. However, in order for a referendum to be announced some really dramatic moments should occur. [Jurkovic] What dramatic moments? [Jakovcic] I refer to a possible deviation of official Croatian policy toward totalitarianism. Then the IDS would decide to follow a quixotic path, doomed in advance to fail in the Assembly, but then that would be an ultimate expression of our political stance, that the will of the Istrian voters is to be respected. If Croatia diverts to dictatorship, which is mentioned as a possibility also by some former aides of the president, the question is what methods the IDS will go for. They will be democratic in any case, while the referendum is the most democratic method. [Jurkovic] A new dimension to Istria's political position has been brought about by the general elections in Italy. The statements by the winners that the Osimo agreements [made in the 1970's, by which relations between Italy and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the fields of politics, economics, minority rights, and so forth, were defined] ought to be revised, have brought about much apprehension in Croatia. How would you comment on all that? [Jakovcic] The Italian political scene has been overwhelmed by statements, some of which were not at all serious, but I would not say that they are dangerous for the Croatian sovereignty, because neither Istria nor Dalmatia accept any revision of the state borders. I have to say that it is normal that in any state there are those who dream about greater Italy, greater Serbia, or greater Croatia. Fortunately enough, such people are marginal. I am deeply convinced of Italy's democratic orientation and I believe that the new Italian government will also be one of the pillars of democratic Europe, following the principles of the Helsinki and the Maastricht convention. The Lega Nord, being the leading Italian party, was first to dissociate itself from the statements by neofascists. The relations between the IDS and the Lega Nord are quite correct, and we intend to cultivate them further. The Lega Nord was the first party in Italy to state clearly and vociferously as early as in 1991 their support for the independence of Croatia, and to visit, I think, minister Separovic. By the agency of Lega Nord we shall insist that Croatia and Slovenia be admitted to the European institutions as soon as possible, and we believe that in such terms the IDS can considerably help Croatian foreign policy. Whether our Foreign Ministry will be wise and make good use of us, I do not know, but that would be quite a prudent thing to do. [Jurcevic] In your relations with Italy the most disputed matter are the Osimo agreements, their revision. What is your attitude in that regard? [Jakovcic] The Osimo agreements are a complex matter, regulating many things, but what is important is that they closed the history book in this region by definitely fixing the boundaries, and this is irrevocable. However, the agreements deal with many other things as well, for instance, with the property of refugees (esula), the protection of the Italian ethnic minority, economic cooperation, the traffic of goods and people, and those are clauses that require amendments, because they have not been implemented. It is only that part where we can talk about a revision of the agreement, of course in the way that friendly neighbors would do it. Istrianism Is Reality [Jurcevic] In addition to that there is a fear that some people's declaring themselves as Istrians benefits the Italianization of Istria. Generally, that designation is disputed, yet Istrianism is protected also by the Statute of the County. [Jakovcic] Today, Istrianism is very much an explicit reality in Istria, and it is impossible to estimate in which way it would manifest itself further. Nobody can ignore the fact that in the 1991 census some 40,000 people declared themselves as Istrians. That has nothing to do with the Italianization of Istria, but rather with the awakened regional identity among the people who have suppressed their national being, and accepted a geo-ethnic relation they have with the region they are living in, so they feel that Istria is their micro-fatherland. [Jurcevic] Do you think that the Istrians are a people in their own right? [Jakovcic] They are what each of them feels to be. A people, or a deception -- you can understand it whichever way you will. It is too early now to assess that phenomenon. It should be analyzed by serious, competent people, while politicians would only bring in too much passion, so I would not like to interpret what happened in the past census without an expert analysis, which will have to be made anyway. [Jurcevic] An extraordinary convention of the IDS was held recently in Rovinj. How do you assess it? [Jakovcic] We have adopted four declarations that give operative strength to the party's platform, and precisely determine attitudes regarding the democratization and regionalization of Croatia, the autonomy of the Istrian county, and Istria as a European region. These are documents that clearly show to all those who expected us to subvert Croatian sovereignty, that they have ended up with the short end of the stick. What I, personally, find particularly bothersome is that some distinguished Croatian politicians speculated about the convention in Rovinj, thinking out various scenarios of how it would eventually end up. A Right of Herak and Martincic [Jurcevic] It is interesting that your declarations have been severely attacked even by the colleagues in the regional RIDS [extension not known], that heads the Association of Regional Parties of Croatia [ARSH]. They say that your declarations are preposterous, improper, a sheer provocation.... [Jakovcic] The colleagues in RIDS have many times made very strange assessments on the IDS attitudes, and I have to add that when we had the most difficult time, the most difficult problems to deal with, they deliberately sided with those who wanted to crush our party for personal reasons. Whether the RIDS wanted to stamp out the ARSH will be shown in the course of time, but I have to tell you that I am less and less bewildered by their reactions. Although I am a great supporter of talks, I think that the room for cooperation with them is getting narrower and narrower. [Jurcevic] Does that attitude of yours call into question the ARSH as well? [Jakovcic] I think that the ARSH may become well established in the Croatian political space, if democratic processes prevail in it in such a way that each party acts autonomously, rather than -- as was the case -- to let RIDS impose its attitudes regarding the resolution of the situation in our party. I think that the RIDS has to take serious care of what is to be done further. [Jurcevic] With respect to your party's convention, and the turbulence that occurred within the party not so long ago, how do you explain the legalization of factions within the party? [Jakovcic] As for the functioning of the IDS in factions, that was my idea from the very day when the problems in personal relations broke out in the party. However, those who wanted to overthrow Delbianco and me did not want to accept the idea. Debeljuh's initiative to allow factions has come about somewhat late, but nevertheless, it is a constructive and well-meant initiative, so we shall set up criteria for the factional organization of the party. In that way we shall increase the degree of democracy. I have immediately asked Debeljuh to take part in The Parties' Club on Croatian television, because he is entitled to that, representing, as he does, a future faction. [Jurkovic] Finally, I would like you to comment on the announcement of the foundation of Istria's new party by former IDS members, namely Herak and Elio Martincic. [Jakovcic] To found a new party is their democratic right. One should pay attention to their platform and what they offer to the voters. For the time being the attitude of the IDS is neutral.
