Wan Li had a discussion at Zhongnanhai with comrades from the China Youth Development Foundation. On the implementation of the Hope Project, he said: At present, some localities cannot guarantee even the issuance of teachers' wages. They spend money on sedan cars and wining and dining instead of building schools and developing education. They should not have done so. Other localities fail to pay teachers because of financial difficulties. However, in my view, teachers' wages must not be in arrears no matter how poor we are or how difficult our situation. Wan Li said: In the final analysis, the trial of national strength is a competition of talented people. To keep pace with the world's development, we are emphasizing meeting the needs of the next century. In other words, we should train a cross-century generation of new people, and the key to training is education. Wan Li said: At persent, poor regions have two problems in education. One is they have no schools, and the other is, even if they have schools, school-age children there cannot afford to attend them. There is a vicious circle of illiteracy causing backwardness in the economy and stupidity creating poverty. So, we should redouble our efforts to build more schools, and all the people should be concerned about education and the future of our country. I approve of a slogan: let us basically wipe out the phenomenon of some poor children being deprived of schooling and ensure schooling for all school-age children by the end of the century. On the orientation of running rural schools, Wan Li said: Rural education should develop in the direction of promoting vocational education. I suggest that we should take the road of integrating agriculture, science, and education in running rural schools. In pastoral areas, for instance, we should teach children animal husbandry and the skills to develop the grassland economy, in addition to reading. Wealth is created by man. With scientific and technological personnel, the rural areas will become prosperous and the country will become rich and strong. Wan Li emphasized: Developed regions should also attach importance to the development of education, and the success and failure of education should be regarded as one of the criteria for appraising leading cadres' job performance. I have been told that some children in developed regions are engaged in business operations instead of attending school. Such a practice is absolutely impermissible. We should use legal means in ensuring schooling for children. Without schooling, nothing can be achieved. Now, parents in urban areas spoil their only child and want the child to seek high marks with the sole purpose of advancing to a higher-level school. They pay no attention to cultivating their child's ability to be independent nor do they consider the child's overall development. In this way, how can the child meet the needs of a modern society? In conclusion, Wan Li said: The Hope Project is a nice thing. If everyone puts in efforts, it is certain that education will be successful.
