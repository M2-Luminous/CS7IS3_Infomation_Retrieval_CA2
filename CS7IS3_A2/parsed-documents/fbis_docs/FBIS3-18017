After arriving in Kronberg this afternoon for the G-7 meeting, Shokhin stated: "We want to take this opportunity to improve our relations with the international financial organizations." His delegation will first brief the G-7 representatives on the economic and political changes in Russia. Russia's goal is closer cooperation with the G-7 and the IMF. With its Bosnia initiative, Russia showed a few days ago that it continues to be a major power, Shokin pointed out. Russia must improve its cooperation with the West, both in political and in economic areas. Thus, the economics minister considers that expanding the G-7 -- which now consists of the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada -- to include Russia is desirable for political and economic reasons.
