The report, "Secrecy versus Safety," by Helena Kennedy QC, follows an inquiry set up by Reading council in March to give local people and organisations a chance to air their concerns. Its main recommendation is that Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, set up a public inquiry into safety at the base to inform people of the risks. Ms Kennedy says the establishment, "like many other British government institutions, seems to be suffering from a very British disease -- the need to cover even its most mundane activities in a cloak of official secrecy. "This is very much a remnant of the Cold War mentality which is being perpetuated by the Ministry of Defence. Consequently, however much the management genuinely wish to be more open, they will run up against superiors who seem to have little concept of public feeling in and around Aldermaston. "If any one factor is clear from this inquiry, it is the fact that the concerns and anxieties will not go away. Furthermore, it is difficult to see why they should. People have contracted fatal illnesses for which they and their families have received no satisfactory response, waterways are threatened with pollution and the environment is seen to be constantly at risk. "As most of the witnesses stated there may be nothing to fear from AWE's activities, but then again there might. Without any information the fear, anxieties and rumours will continue and expand. There is no greater way to encourage such feelings than for a government institution to hide behind the Official Secrets Act at every turn and refuse any independent monitoring of its activities." Ms Kennedy says local people need to be able to make informed choices about work, housing and schools. These concerns could be satisfied only by a full, independent public inquiry covering all aspects of the establishment. The report suggests the inquiry should start before the end of 1994. Reading council will today forward the report to Mr Rifkind with a request that one be set up. Natalie O'Toole, a spokeswoman for the council, said local people had no proper means of communicating with the plant. There was a liaison committee on which the council had a representative but it had met only twice and the public had no access to it. The council is planning to set up a community forum on Aldermaston to raise locals' concerns. The council would then ask for answers on their behalf at the liaison meetings. Ms O'Toole said: "Getting answers out of Mr Rikind on these matters is like chipping away at a block of granite."
