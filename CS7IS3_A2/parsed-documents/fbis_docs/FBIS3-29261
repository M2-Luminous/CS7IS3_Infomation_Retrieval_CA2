An initial strategy meeting was held at the office of South-North dialogue under the chair of Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae on Wednesday afternoon. No contents of the talks were formally disclosed. But, a government source said the attendees decided to try to resume the deadlocked working-level talks at the earliest possible date with an aim to materialize the exchange of special envoys next month. The strategy will be further reviewed by a unification-related ministers meeting to be presided over by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday, the source said. At Wednesday's meeting, the source said, it was decided that the South would propose to resume the working-level talks if North Korea does not offer it first within next week. The Seoul government hopes to resume the working-level talks suspended since last October toward the close of this month or early next month, he said. If North Korea proposes the resumption of the talks first, the South plans to cope with it flexibly even if North Korea offers a meeting other than the exchange of special envoys, the source said. At the moment, however, there is no change in the government policy to materialize the exchange of special envoys at the earliest possible date, the source said. "We plan to promote South-North working-level contacts early so as to facilitate the first-round exchange of special envoys next month if possible," a government official said. Saying that officials of related government offices like the National Unification Board have begun to work out a strategy for the resumption of the South-North dialogue, he said the Seoul government may be the first to propose the exchange of special envoys depending on the attitude of North Korea. Chong Chong-uk, senior Chongwadae [presidential offices] secretary for foreign affairs and national security, said, "We expect working-level talks will be resumed to discuss the proposed exchange of special envoys soon after the International Atomic Energy Agency began inspection of North Korean facilities." It has already been agreed that when IAEA begins inspection, an inter-Korean working-level contact would take place before long, Chong said.
