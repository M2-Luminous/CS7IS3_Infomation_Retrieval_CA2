There have always been military councils. The tradition of a collegial approach to deciding the most important questions and those having a bearing on the future emerged at the same time that a Ukrainian military force first began to form. The Zaporozhian Cossacks invested such councils with a special ritual. The Zaporozhian Cossacks usually held their general councils on 1 January, on the feast of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary [Pokrova] (the feast of the patron of the Zaporozhian church), on the second or third day of Easter, as well as at any other time that the Cossacks troops requested the convocation of a council. The councils dealt with the most important matters affecting the life of the army: making peace and declaring war, organizing military campaigns, punishing criminals, and distributing lands and property among the kurins [barracks in which Cossacks lived in a permanent fortified camp or Sich, and, by extension, to the military unit that lived in them; also translated as a "platoon"]. The distribution of lands and elections were held every year without fail. A few days before the council was to be held, the entire Cossack army gathered at the Sich. The Cossacks made special preparations for the council -- they put on their best clothes and weapons and attended church, first matins and later Mass, which were celebrated with great ceremony on these days. These services were followed by communal noonday meals in the kurins. After the meal, a cannon shot was fired to signal that the council was about to begin. A kettle-drum was brought out of the church, and the drummer sounded the preparatory signal. He was followed by the Osavul [Adjutant-General], who carried a large military banner into the main square. A second roll of the kettle-drum signaled the actual "assembly." The rank-and-file Cossacks were followed into the square by the Starshyna [Cossack Officer Corps] wearing the insignia of their rank. They were greeted by a drum roll. When they reached their assigned place, the officers bowed to the whole assembled company, which stood in a circle around the square. After the lands had been distributed by lot, the Koshovyy [Sich Camp Commander] asked the assembled company if it wanted to change the entire Officer Corps in keeping with tradition at the start of a new year. In response, the Cossacks either supported his leadership, or they demanded that he lay down his mace [bulava]. In the event that the latter happened, the whole officer corps resigned, except for those whom the Cossacks asked to stay on in their posts. Genuinely democratic elections were then held to elect candidates from all the kurins. The election was also regulated by custom: each elected officer twice refused the post for which he had been chosen, while the ritual of smearing his head with dirt was to remind him not to think of himself as better than the rest of the Cossack brotherhood. If a foreign ambassador was present at the Council in order to make some request of the Cossacks, he set forth the terms he was offering before the entire company, after which the matter was decided in his absence. If there was disagreement between the officers and the rank and file, 20 representatives were elected, who conducted detailed talks with the ambassador and concluded an agreement. There was no formal vote: the matter was decided by acclamation, that is, by a decisive numerical majority voicing support for a decision. In addition to general councils, if the Starshyna did not want to convoke such a council, there were smaller councils "in the kurins," called skhodky: the otamans [leaders] of the kurins gathered in the Camp Commander's kurin [kurin koshovoho]. These meetings were held to discuss minor campaigns and secret and urgent matters. Small councils [skhodky] in the palankas [the eight military districts outside the Sich in the so-called "Free Lands of the Zaporozhian Forces"] dealt with insignificant matters and were held by married Cossacks who lived outside the Sich. By the end of the 17th century, a General Council was called only to elect the Hetman or ratify treaty articles with Moscow; other matters were decided by a council of officers. This council met at Christmas or the feast of the Epiphany and at Easter. It dealt with planning campaigns, the construction of forts, and the maintenance of subunits. It was this council that came to resemble a real military council. The things that are useful and warranted at each historical stage assume a new content to suit the needs of subsequent periods. Today, when Ukraine is building her Armed Forces in difficult economic and sociopolitical conditions, military councils play a unique role. In accordance with the directive issued by the President of Ukraine on 24 March 1993, which ratifies the Statute on the Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Statute on Military Councils in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they have the status of permanent collegial advisory bodies. One of the main tasks of today's military councils is to work out recommendations on such issues as maintaining the combat and mobilizational readiness of forces, strengthening military discipline and the social and legal protection of military personnel, improving the effectiveness of the exercise of command over the troops, conferring military ranks and awards, receiving reports from commanders of subunits within the different combat arms and formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and from the military districts on their activity, and submitting their conclusions to be included in drafts of normative acts to be sent to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. What is new in the work of the military councils? Today's military councils play an important role as a collegial organ in implementing cadre policy. This procedure for appointing generals and officers to responsible posts and for conferring military ranks precludes the kind of protectionism that we often saw in the past. The military council deals with the issue of training reserve cadres. In their work, the military councils are guided by the constitution and laws of Ukraine, the decrees of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the edicts and directives of the president of Ukraine, the decrees and directives of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the decisions of the Defense Council of Ukraine, and the orders and directives of the minister of defense of Ukraine. To guarantee that the military council performs its tasks effectively, its chairman must ensure that the discussion of issues at the council meetings is unconstrained, principled, and comprehensive and that the views of all participants are taken into account when decisions are made. He also sees to it that the council's decisions are implemented. It has become customary for members of the council to make regular reports about their personal role in carrying out the council's decisions and on questions pertaining to preventing accidents and traumatism among military personnel, the guards, etc. There is now greater oversight of implementation of the council's decisions, translated into orders issued by commanders: the commanders report on the execution of these orders. After analyzing the positive results of the work of the Military Council of the Odessa Military District, it is clear that this council has introduced a fine tradition of conducting visiting sessions. Such sessions are held directly in the combined formations, formations, and military units. At the same time, practical instruction on questions put on the agenda for discussion are held with commanders and chiefs of services. Urgent measures are applied on the spot to make the necessary provisions for combat instruction and other vital activities of the troops. In my opinion, another positive fact is that participation in the meetings of the military councils and field exercises are not confined solely to the Chairman of the Oblast Council of People's Deputies, who is a member of the Military Council, but that representatives of the local state executive organs, of local and regional self-government organs, and of enterprises, institutions, and organizations are also invited. This gives them an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the kind of socioeconomic and purely military problems that the Armed Forces of Ukraine face today, as well as with the military equipment at the army's disposal. In addition, this gives military personnel an opportunity to work more closely with the representatives of local government. As we know, every military formation is stationed on the administrative territory of an oblast or a rayon, and fulfillment of the laws of Ukraine on the social protection of military personnel depends in large measure on how well the military councils work with the leadership of local government organs. Neither the local authorities, nor the military units can carry out such measures as organizing the defense and communications of a region, mobilization, conscription into military service, and military recruitment on their own. And what about purely everyday matters?! The oblasts and rayons rely on assistance from the military to bring in the harvest, while the latter, in turn, ask for help with housing. It has become customary for the military councils to seek the help of the local authorities in preventing desertion and avoiding the draft. One can make a long list of the issues that need to be solved jointly, but the key question facing both the military and local authorities is how to solve anything at all in the present state of overall economic decline. Clearly, matters are not confined solely to economic and everyday social problems. Providing care for invalids and war and labor veterans, establishing patronage relations between enterprises and military units, and the military and patriotic education of youth -- these are issues that have to be dealt with on a national scale. Unquestionably, the military councils, like the Armed Forces of Ukraine, are still young, but in the short time that they have existed, a certain amount of positive experience has been accumulated which should be made public. As Defense Minister of Ukraine, I do my best to ensure that the military councils of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not continue the worst traditions of the military councils of the former Soviet Army, in which these bodies performed punitive functions (deciding whom to dismiss from his post, whom to demote in rank, etc.). An officer left such military councils demoralized. Crudity, boorishness, and conduct humiliating to officers and generals were the hallmarks of these councils. As a rule, these were not gatherings at which colleagues met to exchange views, but rather a place where punishments were meted out. Historical experience testifies that military councils should serve as assemblies of military personnel for consultation -- that is, serve the very purpose they were meant to serve when they were first formed. As such, they will enhance the authority of the commander, provide him with an opportunity to reveal his personality, and strengthen the principle of unity of command [yedynonachalstvo]. This will allow him to put forward vitally important recommendations in all fields, ranging from the practical implementation of military policies in the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the things that pertain to the ordinary concerns of everyday life.
