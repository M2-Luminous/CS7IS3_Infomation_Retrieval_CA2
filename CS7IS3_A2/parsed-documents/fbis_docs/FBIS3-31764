He recalled his representative Lech Falandysz from the Constitutional Committee, and withdrew his constitution bill, which was drafted during the term of the previous parliament. He wants to draft a new constitution along with "social forces" and he does not intend to submit it in the parliament," we were told by President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. "The president would really like to be reelected and so he thought that he might treat the Constitution as game factor in the fight for reelection," Aleksander Kwasniewski, head of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, commented on the decisions of the president. "As for the Constitution, it was the parliament, not me, who rejected the possibility of cooperation. I tried to cooperate," declared Lech Walesa in his statement for the Polish Press Agency [PAP]. In line with the 1992 Law on the Procedures for Preparation and Passing of the Constitution, the president may prepare his own constitution bill, independently of the parliament; however, he must submit it in the National Assembly by 9 May. President's spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski told us on Tuesday that the president would not forward the constitution bill, prepared with the participation of the people, to the parliament. ``He Will Embark on a Campaign for the bill. Political life will show which bill -- the one prepared by the parliament or the one prepared by the president -- is stronger. The point is that it should be recalled that the creator of all laws is the nation,'' said Drzycimski. In his 23 February statement for PAP, the president said that he would not deprive the parliament of the right to work on the constitution. "I have always thought, and I will still think that the verdict of democracy (election results) should be honored and respected. However, I will not submit to conditions that are unfavorable and defective. Nonetheless, all of us must submit to democracy." He also said that the adoption of the basic law a little later may favorably affect the quality of this law. By taking part in its creation, the nation will understand "what is going on." Walesa explained that he had recalled his representative from the Constitutional Committee... Because the Sejm Rejected on Friday his legislative initiative, which granted groups of 100,000 people the right to submit their own constitution bills; according to this proposal, if the nation does not approve of the bill passed by the National Assembly in a referendum, the parliament is dissolved. Lech Walesa declares that he will no longer hold talks with the parliament on the constitution or take part in its creation. However, the law on the procedures for passing the constitution imposes concrete duties on the president. Once the constitution has been adopted by the National Assembly, the president has 60 days to submit a proposal with amendments to it. His amendments are then adopted by the definite majority of the votes; another condition is that at least 50 percent of the overall number of the National Assembly members are present. Then the president would have 14 days to order a referendum on the Constitution. It must be held no later than four months after it was ordered. Lech Walesa will have to do all these things, regardless of the declared refusal to cooperate with the parliament in the creation of the constitution. The members of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms did not withdraw from the Constitutional Committee. Therefore, Lech Walesa will be able to follow its work indirectly. Lech Falandysz, who has been recalled, had the right to submit motions, but he did not take part in the ballots.
