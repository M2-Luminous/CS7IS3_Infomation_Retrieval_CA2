Information on the laying of sea mines was reported by the U.S. ABC television network. According to DA officials concerned, when a U.S. reconnaissance satellite witnessed North Korea conducting launch tests for its "Silkworm" anti-ship missile on 31 May, the satellite witnessed the presence of what looked like mine-laying vessels within North Korea's territorial waters off its east coast. The satellite also witnessed the frequent flight of airplanes around the vessels. Consequently, the possibility that sea mines have been laid was pointed out. The DA said: "We cannot verify the information on the laying of sea mines on our own. But, if it turns out to be true, then we have no choice but to be gravely concerned." The agency is thought to have obtained copies of satellite pictures of the scene from U.S. military authorities and to be analyzing them at present. The agency is also believed to be hurrying with analysis of communications information collected from radar sites.
