In a part of the statement, PGCC calls for Iran-UAE talks on the disputed islands. Following the release of this statement, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry yesterday, Monday, June the 6th, said: Historical evidence shows that the islands have always belonged to Iran, and to resolve the differences the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes holding of talks with the UAE, without any pre-conditions. The Islamic Republic of Iran has, however, left the door open for talks as put forth by the spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry yesterday. The spokesman said the invitation extended to the UAE's foreign affairs adviser is still valid. The UAE, immediately after the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, without any hard evidence, claimed ownership over the Iranian islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The claims have so far worked as a media propaganda by the regional states and those fueling tension and crisis in the Persian Gulf region. The PGCC statement has also protested against the anti-Saudi propaganda on the Iranian media during the hajj season. In this connection Dr. Mohammadi [not further identified] said: The Iranian media enjoys full freedom--something which the neighbours should understand. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the claim that Iran has supported one of the sides in the Yemen conflict and has provided military assistance to that country, saying: From the outset of the conflict the Islamic Republic of Iran has clearly announced its stance expressing regret over the outbreak of clashes and concern over the division and separation of the Muslim brethren of Yemen. Also, the Islamic Republic of Iran, while opposing any kind of military operations and adopting a neutral stance, announced its willingness to carry out mediation in the conflict. In this connection he added: Iran is deeply interested in preventing the foreign provoked dismemberment of Islamic countries and believes that differences among Muslims should be resolved through peaceful means. Therefore, Iran deeply regrets the killing of any Muslim in Yemen -- whether from the south or the north -- and calls on the warring sides to put an end to the war and begin talks, which should be aimed at preserving Yemen's integrity. Iran also calls on others to show restraint and not become a source for the dangerous escalation of the crisis.
