Both sides agreed to put up the construction of the plant for international bidding. The facility, which will filter radioactive substances from the liquid waste, is expected to be completed within this year. In the coming years Russia will dismantle some 60 nuclear submarines. Several storage ships including a 2,000-ton tanker fully loaded with nuclear waste are currently mooring off Vladivostok. The hazardous cargo could pose a serious threat to the environment as most of the vessels are worn out, although no leakage has so far been reported. For lack of storage and treatment facilities, the former Soviet Union and Russia have dumped thousands of tons of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its coast. The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has sparked international protests and calls for a rapid solution to the storage crisis. Tokyo said earlier this month the plant will be funded from a 70 million dollar Japanese grant for the dismantling of Russian nuclear weapons and nuclear waste disposal.
