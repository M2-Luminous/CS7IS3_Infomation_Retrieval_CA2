To clarify that issue we asked [Foreign Minister] Dr. Velayati whether the ECO is aiming at a free trade zone or is pursuing other goals as well. [Velayati] The ECO pursues numerous objectives, one of which is the establishment of free trade zones so that all member states have the possibility of participating in them. Two documents were confirmed by the leaders at the end of their meeting and were published. One of the documents concerns the ECO's long term perspective, based on the ECO's executive plan which was adopted during a session by the foreign ministers of ECO member states at Quetta in Pakistan. That became the basis for the ECO's long term plan. What is intended in the ECO is mostly long term infrastructural cooperation; or infrastructural cooperation which can have most positive and constructive effects in the region for long-term ECO action.
