The intended duration of the action is unknown. Following the orders of a prosecutor who linked Freddy Pulecio, a member of the board of directors of the Workers Trade Union (USO), to a case of alleged rebellion, Colombian secret agents arrested Pulecio in eastern Arauca during the past hours. USO is comprised of Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] workers. The strike has negatively affected the north-central Barrancabermeja installations, which houses the country's most important oil refinery, and has forced Ecopetrol to implement contingency measures to maintain the production rate and fuel distribution. The strike started on Thursday afternoon and it is not known if it will last 24 hours or if it will be extended indefinitely.
