In opening itself up to the outside world, China has been taking the road of focusing on its coastal areas and gradually extending the policy to its hinterland. This is a correct decision and a correct measure which accords with China's national conditions and the laws governing economic development. At present, our opening up is facing a new situation, and the international and domestic situations are favorable to our opening up. We should sum up our expereinces and explore new ways to advance China's opening up to a new stage. [end of editor's note] At the beginning of this century and the end of last century, then U.S. Secretary of State John Mohan [name as transliterated] drew an inference: "The Mediterranean is a sea of the past, the Atlantic is the ocean of the present, and the Pacific is the ocean of the future." Nearly a century has passed. Now, whenever people turn on the television and read the newspapers in various areas of the world, they can feel the vitality of countries and regions on the Pacific rim; particularly they can feel how China, which is in the midst of reform and opening to the outside world, is marching from the depth of history toward the future, toward the new century. The Call of the Pacific The shifting of the center of the world's economy toward the Pacific region began in the sixties of this century. Rapid economy growth occurred in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and China's Taiwan and Hong Kong regions. But at that time, Mainland China missed the opportunity for economic development. China's economy was still relatively closed and backward. As soon as the "Great Cultural Revolution" ended, China felt, most sorrowfully, the urgency to open itself up and to develop economically. At the CPC working conference held in the spring of 1979, a leading comrade of the Guangdong provincial party committee made a suggestion: We can take advantage of Guangdong being close to Hong Kong and Macao and begin opening up to the outside world. With foresight, Comrade Deng Xiaoping supported this suggestion and also said: We can designate a piece of land and call it a special zone. Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is a special zone, you know. It is better to run special zones. As soon as the central working conference ended, a vice premier of the State Council led a work group to inspect Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. They discussed with the responsible comrades of the two provinces specific questions on setting up special zones. In June of the same year, the Guangdong and Fujian provincial party committees wrote their respective reports in which they decided to designate areas in Guangdong's Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou and Fujian's Xiamen for running special export zones on a trial basis in line with the Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal. In the spring of the following year, the Central Committee held a meeting in Guangzhou, in which leaders of Guangdong and Fukien participated. At the meeting, the special export zones were officially named "special economic zones." It was decided that the Shenzhen special zone would have an area of 327.5 square kilometers [km]; the Zhuhai special zone, 6.18 square km; the Shantou special zone, 1.6 square km. In Xiamen, a beautiful coastal city, 2.5 square km were designated for its special economic zone. Today, not only have the areas of these special zones been expanded, but the entire Hainan Province has been designated as a special economic zone. Morever, the special economic zones and open cities and areas along the coast have formed an entirely new open economic pattern. Facing the Pacific, China's coastal areas have become areas with the greatest economic vitality and attraction on the continent in the East. In constrast to the Atlantic's economic position, the Pacific remained silent for nearly a century. The "silence, which spanned the last century and this century," was finally broken thanks to China's reform and abrupt rise. Going toward the Pacific -- this marks the beginning of a new era for China. Drawing the Blueprint of the Opening Up of the Republic In early 1984, Comrade Deng Xiaoping arrived in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen to begin his first inspection of the coastal special economic zones. What he saw there was a flourishing scene of prosperity. Comrade Xiaoping was able to take control of the trend of China's opening to the outside world because he viewed economic issues from a political perspective. China was closed to the outside world for more than 300 years, from the middle period of the Ming Dynasty to the Opium War. This brought for it poverty and backwardness. At present, there is spring everywhere when the East wind blows. With great interest, Comrade Deng Xiaoping inspected the Luohu commercial zone, which was under construction, visited a fishing village, and toured the China Aviation Technology Import-Export Corporation in Shenzhen... on the top floor of the National Trade Center, which had just gone into operation after completion, he viewed the lights from tens of thousands of home in Shenzhen and the meandering Shenzhen River. He looked far into the distance and saw Hong Kong through the mist. To people by his side, he said: "I saw it, I saw it clearly!" In the dim light of night, China suffered more than 100 years of humiliation, experiencing ups and downs and striving to move forward. This cannot but make people sigh with emotion. At that time Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: In establishing special economic zones and pursuing the open policy, we should have a clear guiding principle -- that is, we should not retreat but open up to the outside world. He further made an overall important suggestion regarding China's opening up to the outside world. A entirely new pattern of opening up to the outside world has taken shape in China: There is overall development of economic and trade relations between the hinterland and the surrounding countries, and opening up in the frontier regions has opened another door to the outside world; we have established five special economic zones, including Hainan Province; we have opened 14 coastal port cities and established 32 economic and technological development zones and 52 national new and high technology development zones in the open cities; after opening up the Chang Jiang Delta, the Zhu Jiang Delta, and the Triangle Area in Southern Fujian Province to the outside world, the entire coastal areas have been designated as areas open to the outside world; following this, opening up to the outside world has moved toward the hinterland along the Chang Jiang and the European-Asian Continental Bridge; some cities in the hinterland have successively opened up to the outside world; China has more than 900 cities and counties opening up to the outside world.... The world-renowned opening up and development of Pudong, which has reached its peak in the nineties, stimulated the development of the economic belt along the Chang Jiang. The following data can serve as a vivid history of the China's opening up to the outside world. -- China's total import-export trade volume has increased from $20.64 billion in 1978 to $195.8 billion in 1993, an eight-fold increase, averaging 16.2 percent a year. In 1993 China's total foreign trade volume ranked 11 in the world. China's total import- export volume has accounted for more than one-third of its gross national product. -- China now ranks second in the world in using foreign capital. In the 15 years between 1979 and 1993, China approved 174,000 foreign investment projects, with actual investment of $63.9 billion. Foreign businessmen who invested in China came from more than 120 countries and regions. Foreign investment in China has continued to surge upward. In the second investment upsurge, which occurred last year, China approved 83,000 foreign investment projects, with actual investment of $25.7 billion, up 70.6 percent and 150 percent over 1992, respectively. -- China's opening up to the outside world has shifted from one-way importation to two-way exchanges. A number of Chinese enterprises with strong financial strength have moved to set up enterprises overseas. By 1993, China's overseas enterprises numbered 4,497, with $5.16 billion invested by the Chinese side. They are located in more than 120 countries and regions. Following the opening of its doors to the outside world, China, an ancient country, embraced with boldness of vision the tide of the century coming from the Pacific. China has become one of the most open countries in the world. Reform and Opening Up: China's Second Revolution When economic and social prosperity, which once existed in the history of this ancient country of China, began to dwindle in the memory of the century, the resurgence of the world economy has finally come along with the tide of the Pacific. China is at the point where the regression of history, the replacement of one era by another, and reform and opening to the outside world converge. When Comrade Xiaoping revisited Shenzhen in the spring of 1992, he said: It is necessary to seize the opportunity. Now is the opportunity. Judging from international experiences, in some countries there have been periods of rapid development or phases of rapid development. At present, China's internal conditions are ripe, and the international environment is favorable. Morever, we can take advantage of the fact that in a socialist country, forces can be mobilized to do great things. In the long process of modernization in the days to come, it is necessary, and also possible, to bring about several phases of rapid development with high efficiency. We must have lofty aspirations and great ideals. In 1949, the world pattern changed as a result of the Chinese revolution. Today, Deng Xiaoping has called China's reform and opening up to the outside world the second revolution. With the passage of the last 15 years, a line has been clearly charted for the victory of China's second revolution by the developments in the various regions and industries. Reform and opening up to the outside world have been written into the basic line of the CPC and thus have become the unchangeable basic national policy for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. From 1979 to 1983, China started the building of special zones; from 1984, the year Xiaoping inspected the special zones for the first time, to 1988, the pattern of the opening up of China's coastal areas was basically formed; from the spring of 1992, the time when Xiaoping inspected Shenzhen and Zhuhai for the second time, to the present, the third upsurge of opening up to the outside world emerged in the vast land of China. These are precisely the "three campaigns" of opening up to the outside world in which Comrade Deng Xiaoping seized the opportunity and directed the tens of millions of people throughout the country to participate. It was precisely in one victory after another that rose in the new cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Pudong; it was these victories that led foreign corporations, such as Beijing Jeep, Shanghai Volkswagen, Siemens, Philips, and Bell, to settle in China; more than 4,000 Chinese enterprises have moved overseas, and 50 of them have issued stocks abroad.... It was precisely in the course of difficult marches forward that the Chinese have discovered their own latent ability, have seen the brilliant light for the rejuvenation of an ancient civilization, and opened up a path that it must go down to make itself fit into the family of nations. Now, the "relay baton" of reform and opening to the outside world has been passed on to the new generation of China's leaders. At the 14th CPC National Congress, which was a congress of greatest historical significance, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin declared: -- Open up more areas to the outside world and form a multi-layered, multichannel, and multidirectional opening up pattern; -- Accelerate the opening up of hinterland provinces and autonomous regions to the outside world; -- With the opening and development of Pudong in Shanghai as the lead, futher open cities along the Chang Jiang to the outside world; -- Efforts should be made to quickly build Shanghai into one of the world's economic, financial, and trading centers, so as to stimulate rapid economic development in the Chang Jiang Delta and in the Chang Jiang basin as a whole; -- Accelerate the opening and development in Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, and in areas around the rim of the Bohai. Efforts should be made to turn, in about 20 years, Guangdong and other localities with suitable conditions into China's areas which have basically attained modernization.... Facing the Pacific, the Zhu Jiang, Chang Jiang, and Huang He are all responding mangnificently to the call of history.
