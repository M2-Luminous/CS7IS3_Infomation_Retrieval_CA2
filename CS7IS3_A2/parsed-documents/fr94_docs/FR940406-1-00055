FR940406-1-00055 FR940406-1-00014 48 CFR Parts 19 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;19] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Subcontracting Plans AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to expand the circumstances when subcontracting plans may be required and negotiated with more than the apparently successful offeror and to prescribe an Alternate II to the clause Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan to be used when contracting by negotiation and subcontracting plans are required with initial proposals. The intent of this proposal is to ensure that small and small disadvantaged business concerns are being afforded the maximum practical subcontracting opportunities consistent with statutory requirements and acquisition objectives. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;19 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Shirley Scott at (202) 501&hyph;0168 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;19. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because subcontracting plans are not required from small business concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . (FAR case 92&hyph;19), in correspondence. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act ␣␣ (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of revised burden estimates for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Clearance Number 9000&hyph;0006 is being submitted to OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq . Public comments concerning this request are invited through a notice document in this Federal Register issue. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 19 and 52 Government procurement. Dated: March 28, 1994.
