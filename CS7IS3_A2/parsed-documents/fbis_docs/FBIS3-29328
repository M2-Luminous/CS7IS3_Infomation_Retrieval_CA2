It is only logical that skepticism is voiced about the economic stimulating effects of the official discount rate. The author stresses the need for improvements in financial and capital markets, while asserting that the official discount rate has lost its raison d'etre. Transition Signaled by Issuance of Government Bonds Japan's official discount rate functioned well as a system until 1969 when we witnessed implementation of the "first hike in the official discount rate in the face of international balance-of-payments surpluses." After completing the postwar recovery phase and entering 1955, economic cycles looked good to everyone. Because the Japanese economy still possessed vitality, demand outstripped supply and management's desire for capital investments was very strong. However, because capital accumulations were still meager and foreign currency reserves had reached only $2 billion, any growth in economic activity soon led to a shortage in foreign currency to pay for increasing imports. The barrier posed by the foreign currency levels would force the government authorities to convert to tighter monetary policies. Government authorities would signal their intentions to convert to tighter monetary policies by postponing government expenditures and raising the official discount rate. When the economy fell during recessions and foreign currency reserves accumulated, they would work on the recovery of the economy by taking the opposite type of actions. It was because of these circumstances that the official discount rate functioned like the "red and green" lights of a traffic light and the mere announcement of a change had a very major impact. A primary segment of the economic policies of those days was the low-interest policy. During the days when government policy called for progress toward catching up with European and U.S. economic levels, a handicap in the area of economic competition was the difference in interest levels. Because they were the days of the export tax abatement system to promote exports, a low-interest policy that sacrificed the interests of depositors dominated the situation to satisfy the great cause of compensating for differentials between domestic and international interest rates. One phase of those policies provided for undisputed low-interest, large-volume loans from the Bank of Japan to major banks. A limited number of major banks were able to borrow huge volumes of funds at low interest rates from the Bank of Japan. Preferential treatment of this nature was rarely seen. After 1960, a topic that received wide coverage in the mass media was that concerning "excessive loans." All major banks maintained huge Bank of Japan loans and call loan balances and constant excess liabilities, while basic industries suffered from chronic liability excesses because of borrowings from banks to pay for aggressive capital investments. Arguments for and against the merits of the policies existed, but I recall that the final analysis assumed the position that they supplied funds necessary for growth and that allocation of sorely needed funds to basic industries on a priority basis led to the sound growth of the Japanese economy and the enhancement of competitive strength. A metamorphosis in the Japanese economy became gradually apparent in connection with the first oil shock. International competitiveness of industry was strengthened and capital accumulations had progressed to a considerable degree. Capital markets witnessed the full-scale issuance of secondary stock offerings at market prices and the issuance of convertible debentures, providing for the establishment of a bond market albeit not perfect. It came to a point where no one mentioned low-interest policies, and the nation experienced the imperceptible demise of the excessive loan issue. Japan's financial markets reached levels approximating those of the European and U.S. markets and monetary coordination by the Bank of Japan could be adequately handled through its market operations. Further, the underlying growth potential of the Japanese economy gradually diminished and the provision of growth funds lost its significance as a principal issue. These changes in the flow of events were made decisive by the issuance of government bonds. Because the Ministry of Finance adhered to balanced budgets until 1965, provision of growth funds depended primarily on Bank of Japan loans. However, when government bonds were issued to overcome the recession of 1965, adequate growth funds were supplied through the issuance of additional government bonds. Further, the Ministry of Finance issues government bonds in the form of government construction bonds and government deficit bonds, treating the former as beneficial and the latter as detrimental, but such labeling can be referred to as conventionalism and the merits of issuing government bonds should be discussed solely on an objective and positive basis. Impediment to Economic Countermeasures The bubble of the period subsequent to 1985 was caused to a large degree by imprudent financial decontrol policies, but that period did signal the transformation of Japan into a capital supplier nation. Further, the recent collapse of the long-term Liberal Democratic Party's one-party government and formation of the Hosokawa coalition government probably reflect changes in public opinion that seeks a shift from Japanese economic policies, which strongly favor preferential treatment of manufacturers and corporations to those which provide for the interests of consumers and the general public. And, I might add that, the appearance of the Clinton administration in the United States represents the antithesis of the trend calling for emphasis of efficiency and decontrol and deregulation which aims at the perpetuation of the theories of the strong. In the case of Japan, controls are much more extensive than in the United States and regulations that favor manufacturers and corporations are widespread, thus ensuring that decontrol will remain a primary issue for the Hosokawa coalition government, but I feel that the theory of the powerful as embraced by Thatcher, Reagan, and Nakasone faces the fate of modification even in Japan. In looking back at economic policies of the six years following 1987, there were aspects where the timing was very faulty, leading to accelerated overheating and intensive over-cooling. During the initial stages of the bubble, the Ministry of Finance gave priority to financial reconstruction, causing an overburdening of the financial policies, confusion based on the theory of a major creditor nation with low interest rates and theory of Japan playing the role of anchor nation for interest rates, and Japan-bashing by the United States, all leading to excessive liquidity. We should treat as a critical lesson learned the fact that the money supply grew at double-digit rates for four years in a row during that period. If the official discount rate system had not existed, we probably would not have adhered to an ostensible interest level of 2.5 percent from February 1987 to May 1989. And, I believe we could have changed interest rates a more flexible and issued warnings that excessive liquidity would lead to unexpected situations in the Japanese economy. It is obvious that the existence of the official discount rate impeded the quick action of the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance even during the economic recession after 1991. First, it was feared that a drop of the official discount rate in the early stages of the recession would cause a resumption of the bubble. As evidence of that fear, the Ministry of Finance did not lift the ceilings on real estate loans on a conditional basis until very near the end of 1991. The official discount rate was dropped from 6.0 percent to 1.75 percent between July 1991 and September 1992. The Bank of Japan stressed during that period that, "Current interest rates are at a historically low level," and explained that, "The series of rate drops will soon result in the manifestation of cumulative effects," but the statements were proven wrong. The 2.5-percent rate following the sixth reduction was same as the 2.5-percent level of 1987, and calling that rate a "historically low level" was not a mistake, but what is important in relation to the economy is the level of real interest rates. Even though the official discount rate has fallen to 1.75 percent, the real interest rates are not at all low. Stressing historically low levels merely serves to degrade the authority of the Bank of Japan. Not only has the cumulative effect of seven drops in the official discount rate failed to appear at all, but various sources now speak of long-term recession and a dropping of the bottom of the economy. There is no way that we can realize a recovery in the economy solely on the basis of interest policies, but we cannot deny a conspicuous decrease in the effects of interest policy. The question is, why? Source of "Subsidies" The reason is that the Bank of Japan call rate is being maintained at a high level. Until the spring of last year, short-term rates were higher than long-term rates. This represented the reversal of short- and long-term rates. Call rates approximate the goals of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan uses this authority as an instrument to influence the short-term financial markets as a whole. The Bank of Japan most probably feared a resumption of the bubble until the spring of 1992. Accordingly, long-term interest rates where Bank of Japan controls have little effect continued to fall in response to market conditions, but the Bank of Japan, fearing excess liquidity, maintained short-term rates at levels higher than long-term rates and caused large sums of money to be parked in call markets. This artificial, illogical reversal of short- and long-term rates disappeared with the fourth drop in the official discount rate in April 1992. Just as we had thought that change led to the normal condition where long-term instruments called for higher rates and short-term instruments called for lower rates, the Bank of Japan introduced unsecured overnight call loans which carried interest rates that were higher than three-month certificates of deposit (CD). This second reversal of rates for short-term instruments continues even to this day when the official discount rate has fallen as far as 1.75 percent. We can only reaffirm our amazement at the tenacious attitude of the Bank of Japan. The result is the continued retention of over 4 trillion yen in funds in the call market and the failure of the money supply to improve despite repeated drops in the official discount rate. The failure of money policies rests to a large degree in this situation. It is estimated that normal levels of funds managed in call markets would be around 20 trillion yen. In this case, money with nowhere to go in excess of 20 trillion yen has targeted the Bank of Japan short-term high interest rate policies as a rare opportunity and has taken refuge in the call markets. I would like to point out that one condition for recovery of the economy is the exodus of this 20 trillion yen pool to where it belongs; i.e., expel it from the call market. And even more illogical is the situation wherein Bank of Japan interest rate manipulation and monetary coordination have caused unsecured overnight call rates to be constantly maintained at levels 0.25 to 0.5 percent higher than the official discount rate. In the United States, the federal fund rate, which is equal to the call rate, is often maintained at the same level as the official discount rate which is currently at 3.0 percent. The question is, why does the Bank of Japan maintain the call rate at a level higher than the official discount rate? The first reason most probably relates to consideration given to the operation of small and medium financial institutions which issue call paper. Small and medium financial institutions traditionally have low loan to deposit ratios and are historically heavily dependent on call markets. However, that situation is not one that can be justified at all times. A second reason is the need to maintain Bank of Japan influence over large banks. Large banks constantly purchase call paper and borrow funds from the Bank of Japan, providing fatter profits from Bank of Japan borrowings if the official discount rate is lower than call rates. Assuming current Bank of Japan loans average 6 trillion yen throughout the year and a difference of 0.75 percent exists between the 2.5-percent call rate and 1.75-percent official discount rate, large banks which benefit from the Bank of Japan loans are in effect subsidized to the tune of 45 billion yen a year. No matter how one views the situation, it is strange that such huge subsidies are made available to large banks which forced the management of small and medium financial institutions into difficult straits and forced them to find refuge in other industries in the form of subsidiary companies based on the decontrol of financial markets. Even more puzzling are signs that the rate differentials between the official discount rate and call rate are being misused in salvaging failed financial institutions. If newspaper reports that top executives of Daiwa Bank lodged a request saying, "We would like to ask for special consideration for a Bank of Japan loan," when a decision was made for Daiwa to assist Cosmo Securities, are true, it appears that he was asking for the issuance of the type of hidden subsidy discussed in the preceding paragraph. It may be that a separate secret Bank of Japan loan fund exists to aid those banks which were forced to assume huge liabilities in connection with past salvage actions. Abuses Connected With Official Discount Rate I believe there are no reasons in existence today for continuing the official discount rate system. First, I have already spoken of the issuance of government bonds to provide for growth funds. Since the underlying potential for growth in the Japanese economy has declined, the system whereby the official discount rate was maintained at a low level and growth funds were supplied through Bank of Japan loans is now outdated. Next, the question is what is the situation from the standpoint of realizing appropriate money supply levels? This question is answered by money supply records since 1987. I would like to say that the absence of an official discount rate would have created a more appropriate money supply. The third reason is the relationship between monetary adjustment and economic coordination functions. The mission of the central bank is to manipulate interest levels and adjust monetary levels appropriately to prevent both inflation and deflation and to maintain sustained growth. If we were to be asked if the official discount rate is indispensable in meeting those goals, the answer would be that we can do without the rate. Principal nations that still maintain the official discount rate system are Japan, the United States, and Germany. Great Britain and France recognized the shortcomings of the official discount rate long ago and their central banks have converted to a system whereby they control interest rates through market intervention. A condition that can be noted through observations in Japan, the United States, and Germany is that the new environment posed by advances in the information age and huge growth in financial markets have made it more difficult to manipulate the official discount rate because it has transcended its symbolic existence and is subject to wide and constant exposure to the public. Manipulation of the official discount rate has been subjected to conditions not conceivable to monetary experts of the past, such as the requirement that changes must be subject to a surprise element. Excessive focusing of attention precludes the effectuation of smooth changes, while the inability to avoid the situation in which the Bank of Japan president just one week prior to drops in the official discount rate must say obvious lies, such as, "We have no intention of dropping the rate," or "We have no intention whatsoever of dropping the rate," are indications that the effects of announcing official discount rate changes have been distorted. Already, the need no longer exists for central bank presidents of the various nations to indicate the direction of economic policy through manipulation of the official discount rate. Last August [1992], the Bank of Japan, which was concerned about the future of the economy, introduced lower short-term interest rates. Since such measures are feasible, the absence of an official discount rate would enable implementation of more flexible monetary policy. It would be better in a mature monetary market that the central bank demonstrate its goals by constantly intervening in the markets. Even if a decision is made to retain the official discount rate system, its levels should be the same as the call rates, and I believe the source of last resort in the form of the Bank of Japan should be made available only to problem banks. I would like to say that we should discontinue the practice of maintaining Bank of Japan loan balances that are constantly running at several trillions of yen.
