R. Grigoryev, S. P. Naumov; UDC 681.325] [Abstract] A structural circuit of a neural network employing an algorithm for sorting a sequence of n-numbers is examined. The structural circuit takes into account the limitations concerning engineering implementation of the proposed circuits on an optical neural chip. The examined structural circuit was modeled as a package of computer programs. The circuit consists of an adaptive neural network, whose weight coefficients are adjusted depending on the input data. Modeling of the neural network for n=256 with a program package allowed to experimentally test the convergence of the proposed neural algorithm and to verify the obtained analytical time estimates of its performance. With the contemporary technology of VLSIC, it is possible to develop neural chips capable of sorting 512 numbers during a single cycle. Figures 9, references 18.
