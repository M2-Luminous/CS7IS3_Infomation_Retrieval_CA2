FR941021-2-00003 FR941021-2-00001 Preliminary issues that have been identified include helicopter noise disturbance to residential areas, wildlife, and ground-based recreation users; impacts to the local economy; and public demand for helicopter landing tours. In 1992, an environmental assessment analyzing the effects of these tours was completed. A Finding of No Significant Impact was made. That decision was reversed on appeal and remanded to the deciding official. Comments from the 1992 EA were used to identify issues for this EIS. Comments were also solicited between May 17 and June 27, 1994 through a news release and letters to the public. Federal, state and local agencies, interested individuals and groups are invited to participate in this analysis. Comments will be accepted throughout the EIS process but, to be most useful, should be received by October 21, 1994. Because most of the data collection and scoping was completed during preparation of the 1992 EA and subsequent re-evaluation of the original proposed action, the draft environmental impact statement should be available for review by November 5, 1994. The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed by January 15, 1995. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of availability in the Federal Register. The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. The Final EIS and Record of Decision is expected to be released in January 1995. The Juneau District Ranger, Chatham Area. Tongass National Forest will, as the responsible official for the EIS, make a decision regarding this proposal considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and supporting reasons will be documented in the Record of Decision. Dated: September 29, 1994. Kenneth E. Mitchell, District Manager.
