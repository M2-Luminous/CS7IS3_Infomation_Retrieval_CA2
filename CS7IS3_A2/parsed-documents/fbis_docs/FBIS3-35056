The following is the text of the message: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The brother chairman and members of the expanded people's gathering of the Aden Governorate. It is my pleasure to extend to you and all the sons of the valiant Aden Governorate my best wishes and congratulations on the blessed month of Ramadan during which your gathering is convening. No doubt, your gathering is a positive step and bodes well for carrying the accord document -- once it is finally signed in a few days, God willing -- to a new stage. The most important features of this stage is that it ensures sound development, progress, peace, and unity for unified Yemen. You are meeting in valiant Aden, which occupies a special place in the heart of every Yemeni, since this city witnessed the greatest positions and noblest sacrifices for the triumph of the 26 September and 14 October Yemeni revolutions against invaders. In Yemen's contemporary history, this city has been a bright center and a source of radical historical changes, most important of which is raising the flag of unity to flutter high in its skies. Also, Aden witnessed the signing of a historic unionist agreement on 30 November 1989. This valiant city, which occupies a special place in the heart of every Yemeni, has remained a city for honorable unionists of the Yemeni homeland, which is proceeding today toward great changes. These changes will achieve for our people more progress, stability, and peace, God willing, under the banner of the young Yemeni Republic and under the umbrella of the blessed unity, which rid our people of fragmentation, disunity, and backwardness, toward a new world of progress and development. This could never have happened without unity. While blessing your assembly and blessing all positive steps and national efforts, we tell you that we are very eager to embody and put into action the accord document, which is a practical way out of the political crisis. This document also expresses national consensus. We hope that this document will end all the misunderstandings and disputes that have harmed the interests of the people and the homeland and hampered development efforts in the homeland. We are confident that your assembly's decisions and recommendations will further enhance the building of unity and the homeland's march. These will be added to what your brothers in the rest of the governorates have contributed. Your decisions and recommendations will also emphasize adherence to our national principles, foremost are unity and democracy, and eagerness to safeguard higher national interests. We are also fully confident that the masses of the valiant Aden Governorate best reflect the city's history and role, as well as its great national stands in national struggle against hostile and imperialist forces until victory was achieved. Aden became brighter after the proclamation of the state of unity on 22 May 1990. It was a glorious day that dispelled the darkness of fragmentation in the life of our people, ended for good decades of domination and persecution, and ushered in a new era in the life of Yemen based on justice, freedom, and respect for human rights. Our people have suffered a great deal as a result of the crisis and its negative effects, manifested in price hikes, a drop in the value of the national currency, obstructing work at government departments, administrative chaos, and other phenomena. All these phenomena got worse because of the escalation of the political crisis. As we are about to implement the accord document, we hope that all these regrettable phenomena will end. Our patient people have endured all the negative effects of these phenomena for the sake of unity and democracy. Despite all the misunderstandings and irregularities that accompanied the regrettable crisis, our people, in all their factions and forces, will maintain their cohesion, strength, and ability to face challenges. Our people will also look with hope and optimism toward ending this accidental crisis and will not be influenced by malicious propaganda that tries to take advantage of this crisis to undermine our national principles, fragment our national unity, and cause bloody conflict, dissension, and catastrophes in Yemen whose scope is only known to God. However, the people's vigilance and awareness of the objectives of Yemen's enemies has denied the enemies any chance to achieve these objectives. Also, the awareness and vigilance of the Armed Forces and security agencies -- and this national institution's awareness of the scope and dangers of being carried away by the enemies' schemes -- has thwarted all conspiracies and emphasized that the army of September and October is the army of Yemeni unity and is for all the people. This army cannot but share the same views and options of the the people, away from all influences, and defend the homeland, its sovereignty, unity, and democracy. Concluding, I greet you again and wish your assembly success along the path of defending unity and democracy. Peace be upon you. Also, a message from brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], was read. To begin, the message conveyed the YSP Political Bureau's wishes for the success of this important gathering. It stated that the YSP remains true to the position it chose for itself in the course of the struggle of the Yemeni people for their freedom and comprehensive social progress. The message stressed that the YSP, which has contributed, along with all national forces, toward drafting the accord document, will be faithful to the implementation of this document. The gathering opened its activities yesterday evening with several speeches and poems. Brother Fadl 'Ali 'Abdallah, head of the preparatory committee of the Aden gathering, made a speech in which he welcomed the attendees. He noted the importance of holding such a gathering in Aden, which saw the birth of the accord document. The Yemeni masses think of this document as a solution that embodies a comprehensive national program. Other speeches were made on behalf of other mass gatherings in the governorates of Ibb, Hadramaut, and Shabwah, expressing hope for their success. Leaders for the gathering's committees were elected and a plan of action was read, reviewing the situation of the homeland. The plan was discussed by the attendees.
