The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has implicitly requested major automakers to formulate their own plans for voluntary purchases of U.S.-made auto parts, MITI sources said. The step, termed by some an administrative guidance, is in response to growing U.S. pressure for Tokyo to establish a specific program for increasing American access to Japan's auto and auto parts markets, ahead of the February 11 meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. MITI, unwilling to cave in to a U.S. call for Tokyo to use numerical targets as a means of gauging its penetration of Japanese markets, is trying to get the private sector to soften Washington's stance, the sources said. But the U.S. policy runs the risk of leading to managed trade, a concept the Japanese Government has strongly rejected under the framework talks. This would run counter to the Hosokawa administration's chief goal of easing government controls on rules and regulations. Earlier this week, top executives of Japan's three major carmakers -- Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. -- were separately called to meet MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, the sources said. Details of the meetings were not disclosed but they must have discussed the carmakers' foreign parts purchase plans, the sources said. Asking the auto industry for cooperation may be one idea Hosokawa can take to his meeting with Clinton in Washington, the sources said. But cooperation must not go beyond that made on a voluntary basis, the sources added. The latest request to the auto industry came after a proposal by a senior MITI official for a more cooperative approach by the private sector, which is designed to increase Japanese purchases of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. "The cooperation approach" being recommended by MITI is aimed at dispelling "mutual distrust" between Washington and Tokyo in the framework talks, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, said in a recent press conference. The new cooperation scheme consists of three phases -- setting of objective criteria by each automaker in U.S.-made parts buying and other areas, evaluation of buying records in accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding whether or not to devise extra steps based on the assessment. Criteria for Japanese automakers may also cover the number of their dealership chains handling U.S. autos, dealers' records of U.S. car imports and whether the "design-in" cooperative approach between users and makers from the initial stage of development to manufacturing is being adopted by makers. The cooperation approach is also applied to U.S. automakers by measuring their business efforts based on such criteria as whether products are tailored to meet the needs of Japanese motorists by, for instance, having right-hand steering wheels, Okamatsu said. Okamatsu said the approach is not like administrative guidance, which he said is inconsistent with Hosokawa's deregulation policy.
