How are your spirits? [Quijano] First, I want to say one can say the process has been clean, clear, precise. The Electoral Tribunal has shown great honesty in this electoral process, something of which all Panamanians should truly feel proud. I hope Panama will continue to hold elections such as today's. Regarding vote counts, I believe these results include approximately 40 percent of the cast votes. What we do not have is an idea of what sectors these results cover. In the particular case of Panama City's, I believe we have results from sector 8-7, partial results for 8-6, but I do not know whether there have been any results for 8-8 and 8-9, where Change '94 held much hope. The same goes for the interior of Panama Province--western Panama, sectors 8- 1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4, and 8-5. This also holds true for the Republic's countryside. Information has been released on the provinces' urban areas and not from the rural sectors. We will have to wait another hour or so until we have a higher percentage of results to allow us to announce some kind of decision. [Rivera] Can we interpret that you still believe Professor Carles' trend may continue to increase? [Quijano] It is possible rural sectors and other Panama Province sectors may begin to make a difference in the final result. It is too early to make any prediction. What viewers can be sure of is that if Change '94 is not the winner we will recognize the victor, because up to now the elections and vote count have been clean and honest. [Rivera] Even if the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] is the winner? [Quijano] No matter who the winner is. I believe the only way Panama can grow politically is by having those who lose recognize the triumph of the winners. If we win, we also hope the PRD recognizes our victory. [Rivera] The latest provincial figures indicate that Professor Carles lost in Cocle Province, his home province. How do you explain this? [Quijano] The reason is that the only votes counted so far are from the urban sectors of Penonome and Aguadulce, where most of the voters are public workers and where a high percentage belong to the PRD and another high percentage belong to the Arnulfist Party. We now have to reach into the countryside, Toabre, Tambo, El Roble, all rural sectors in Cocle Province, where we are strong.
