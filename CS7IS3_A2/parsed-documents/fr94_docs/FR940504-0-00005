FR940504-0-00005 FR940504-0-00002 The Monetary Control Act of 1980 (12 U.S.C. 248a) directed the Board and the Reserve Banks to establish and set prices for services with due consideration to ensuring an adequate level of services nationwide. In keeping with this directive, the Board expects that Reserve Banks will provide check collection services to financially troubled banks that cannot obtain services elsewhere. If a troubled bank fails, the Reserve Bank may be liable on warranty claims that it cannot pass back to the failed bank. Accordingly, the Board believes that it is appropriate to provide some protection to the Reserve Banks from pending insolvencies. Thus, the Board has adopted the proposed security interest provisions, with modifications. The modifications to §§229.5(d) and 229.12(i) clarify when a default occurs. Specifically, a Reserve Bank's rights to take any action under those sections will apply only: (1) If the Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender or (2) at the time the sender suspends payments and is closed. The Board believes that requiring the Reserve Bank to advise a bank of its concerns about the bank's solvency will prevent the routine use of set-off or other actions on collateral by Reserve Banks. The Board believes that private-sector banks often reserve the right under security agreements to take steps, such as placing a hold on collateral, to protect themselves in cases where the banks consider themselves insecure. Under the final rule, when a Reserve Bank receives notice of a warranty claim based on alleged forged indorsement or alteration, it would pass the notice back to the bank from which it received the check. The Reserve Bank would not, however, unilaterally pass judgment on such a claim. Rather, the Reserve Banks' uniform operating circulars provide that they will process adjustments for these types of warranty claims only with the agreement of the prior collecting bank. If such agreement is not forthcoming, the Reserve Bank would wait to be sued on the warranty claim and would tender defense of the suit to the prior collecting bank under §§210.5 (b) and (c) and 210.12 (e) and (f) of Regulation J. Entries would be made or collateral disposed of only after judgment as provided in those sections. The amendments to §§229.5(d) and 229.12(i), however, would not require a sender bank to fail or a Reserve Bank to deem itself insecure before the Reserve Bank could make credit or debit adjustments to reserve or clearing accounts in accordance with adjustment procedures established in Reserve Bank operating circulars. Section 210.6(b) The Board proposed to amend §210.6(b) to conform the Reserve Bank warranties to the transfer and presentment warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. (See discussion of §210.5(a).) The amendment clarifies that the Reserve Banks make the warranties set out in §229.34 of Regulation CC. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed. Section 210.6(c) Section 210.6(c) provides a 2-year statute of limitations for claims against Reserve Banks for lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care under Regulation J. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that the Regulation CC limitation period of one year would apply to any claims against a Reserve Bank under Regulation CC, such as breach of a warranty under §229.34 or lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care under §229.38. This amendment clarifies that claims against Reserve Banks for Regulation CC violations are subject to the same time limitations as those against private-sector banks. The Board received three comments on this section. Two commenters believed that limitation period for breach of Regulation CC warranties should be two years rather than one year. One of these commenters often receives adjustment requests from the IRS one to two years after the fact and does not wish to be precluded from pursuing such adjustments with a Reserve Bank. This commenter suggested that the Regulation CC limitation period be extended to 2 years. Another commenter noted that, if the one year limitation period is adopted, it should run from the date of the last entry for the check in question rather than from the date the check first cleared. The Board believes that the same limitation period should apply to Reserve Banks and private-sector banks for Regulation CC violations. As Regulation CC provides a one-year statute of limitations, the Board does not believe Regulation J should lengthen this period for Reserve Banks and has adopted the proposed amendment. The one-year period was established in subpart C of Regulation CC to match the one-year limitation period for subpart B (funds availability) violations, which was set by statute. As provided in Regulation CC §229.38(g), an action must be brought within one year after the date of the occurrence of the violation involved. Section 210.9(a)(5) Section 210.9(a)(5) provides that paying banks must settle for checks presented by Reserve Banks by ``autocharge'' (i.e. a debit to an account at a Reserve Bank), cash, or other means agreed to by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that a Reserve Bank may, in its discretion, elect to obtain settlement by autocharging the account of the paying bank for the amount of a cash letter. Virtually all Reserve Bank presentments are settled via autocharge. This amendment would restate the autocharge provisions that currently are set out in the Reserve Banks' uniform cash item operating circular. The Board also proposed to amend this section to provide that paying banks that receive presentment from Reserve Banks may not set off other claims against the amount of settlement owed to the Reserve Bank. Paying banks may set off against private-sector presenting banks under §229.34(c)(4) of Regulation CC. The Regulation CC set-off provision was designed to protect paying banks under the same-day settlement rule, which requires paying banks to accept presentment from and settle with all presenting banks, some of which may be in poor financial condition. If a paying bank overpays a cash letter in reliance on a cash letter total or check encoding warranted by the presenting bank, it could face the risk that the presenting bank would be unable to settle for adjustments. Protection against insolvency risk would not be necessary against a Reserve Bank. In addition, as banks generally settle with Reserve Banks via autocharge, set-off against a Reserve Bank would be impractical. Therefore, the Board does not believe this amendment would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of private-sector banks to compete effectively with Reserve Banks. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.
