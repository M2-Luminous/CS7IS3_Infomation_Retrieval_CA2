Mr. Kostov is member of the Foreign Debt Management Committee which is in charge of negotiations with Bulgaria's Bank Advisory Committee. The remaining 15 banks are also expected to apply for participation in the deal. Among them are big Russian banks, to which Bulgaria owes 6.4 percent of the $8,700 million debt. According to Mr. Kostov, the proportion of banks that have applied for participation in the deal is very good, considering that deals of that kind can be finalized even when offers cover 80 percent of the debt. He said that German and Japanese banks hold the largest portions of the debt. Within the 88 percent portion offered for settlement, 12.8 percent is for debt buy-back, 27.8 percent for front-loaded interest reduction bonds, and 59.4 percent for collateralized discount bonds. Bulgaria's actual expenses on the deal cannot be calculated at this stage as the interest for the September 1992-June 1994 period, which will not be capitalized, is still to be set and the $180 million which Bulgaria has paid so far (about $90 million under Filip Dimitrov's government, $30 million at the end of 1993, and another $60 million which Bulgaria is still to pay for the first half of 1994) are to be deducted from the total amount. According to Mr. Kostov, the finalization of the deal is of major importance for Bulgaria as it expects foreign banks to open credit lines amounting to some $250 million-300 million within three to six months after the agreement is signed. This will boost Bulgarian companies' sales and output by about 10 percent and will help create more jobs and raise wages. Bulgarian production and trade have been declining in the last few years, dropping 4-5 percent in the second half of 1993 alone, Mr. Kostov said. The total reduction of the debt and its servicing will be an estimated 47-50 percent, and that of its par value 37-40 percent. Between 1994 and 2000, Bulgaria will make annual payments of $250 million on the average and will spend $945 million on buy-back of principal and interest. Bulgaria will pay up front some $670-700 million. In Mr. Kostov's view, the country is in position to finance the deal as it has a foreign exchange reserves of more than $1,000 million at its central bank. Within two months it will also receive money from Japan on the SAL agreement and funds for the deal promised by international financial institutions, the IMF and the World Bank. A total of $250-300 million in extra funding is expected, Mr. Kostov said. The debt buy-back will start as soon as the deal is finalized on June 30, when it will be signed and the up-front payment made. The Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank will be discharged of its obligation as the nominal debtor on the day of the first payment. The newly issued bonds will be traded freely and will be registered on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. According to Mr. Kostov, futures deals on debt bonds have already been made. He said that the debt agency may be assumed by any reputable Bulgarian or foreign banking institution which would boost confidence in the Bulgarian foreign debt bonds on the secondary debt market.
