According to the same source, Croatian multiple rocket launchers and long-range artillery on the left bank of the Sava river have been pounding the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic. The shelling has been especially heavy in the Serb villages of Krepsic and Obudovac and the town of Doboj. The Bosnian Serb command says that although the Moslems are attacking practically all borders of the Bosnian Serb republic, the brunt of their attacks is directed against the corridor linking the eastern and the western part of the republic. The same source emphasizes that the Bosnian Serb army is responding to all attacks and inflicting heavy losses to the enemy, and that everything indicates to a complete breakdown of the Moslem offensive very soon. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo reports continuation of inter-Moslem fighting in the northwest between forces loyal to Fikret Abdic and Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic. Abdic, a fierce opponent of Izetbegovic's war-mongering policy, last October proclaimed independence for the province of western Bosnia.
