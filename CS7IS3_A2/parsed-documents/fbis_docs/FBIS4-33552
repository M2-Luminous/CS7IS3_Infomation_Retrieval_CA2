Herrera Cabral said that if the absolute blockade is maintained along the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, "an induced and announced genocide" would be fostered. The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Until recently, food, medicine, and other goods for stores and factories flowed from the Dominican Republic into Haiti despite the embargo ordered by the United Nations to force the ousting of the military and the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was toppled on 30 September 1991. A systematic contraband supply of gasoline joined those "humanitarian" supplies along the Haitian border, prompting Washington and the United Nations to pressure Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer to make effective the total closure of the border posts. Balaguer agreed and since then a military cordon along the border strip, measuring 300 km in length, has been set established. Herrera Cabral said he discussed the matter with Balaguer but declined to comment on the outcome of the meeting with the president, who is a steadfast opponent of the embargo for fear of a massive invasion of Haitians into the Dominican Republic. Reports from the border area indicate that hundreds of Haitians living in nearby villages try to cross the border every day to obtain supplies in Dominican stores. Until now, the Dominican controls along the border have resulted in the death of one Haitian at the hands of a Dominican soldier. The deputy foreign minister said UN negotiator Dante Caputo promised to provide the Dominican authorities a list of the products that may be sent to Haiti, but the Dominican Foreign Ministry has yet to receive it. "There is a quantity of food ready to be sent to Haiti, and I hope that the matter is resolved today or tomorrow," Herrera Cabral stated. The official warned that "the time will come when the patience of armed soldiers will not let Haitians have an open field because that would be dangerous for the country." He concluded by saying he did not know the date of the arrival of a mission of UN observers and logistical support, including U.S. helicopters, to monitor compliance with the embargo along the border.
