FR941026-0-00009 FR941026-0-00003 Food Safety and Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 391 [Docket No. 94&hyph;013F] Fee Increase for Inspection Services AGENCY: Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. The fees reflect the increased costs of providing these services primarily as a result of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William L. West, Director, Budget and Finance Division, Administrative Management, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700, (202) 720&hyph;3367. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq .) provide for mandatory inspection by Federal inspectors of meat and poultry slaughtered and/or processed at official establishments. Such inspection is required to ensure the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and poultry products. The costs of mandatory inspection (excluding such services performed on holidays or on an overtime basis) are borne by FSIS. In addition to mandatory inspection, FSIS provides a range of voluntary inspection services (9 CFR 350.7, 351.8, 351.9, 352.5, 354.101, 355.12, and 362.5). The costs of voluntary inspection are totally recoverable by the Federal Government. These services, set forth in Subchapter B_Voluntary Inspection and Certification Service, are provided under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq .) to assist in the orderly marketing of various animal products and byproducts not subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act. The fees charged by FSIS for voluntary inspection services provided to operators of official meat and poultry establishments, importers, or exporters are reviewed annually and a cost analysis 1 is performed to determine whether they remain adequate to recover the costs FSIS incurs in providing the services. The fees charged are for overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification, certification, or laboratory services. 1 The cost analysis is on file with the Docket Clerk. Copies may be requested free of charge from the Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700. Based on the projected Fiscal Year 1994 cost analysis, FSIS is increasing the fees for voluntary services. These increased costs are attributable to the average FSIS locality pay raise of 3.2 percent for Federal employees effective January 1994; the increasing number of employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System and subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax; and increased health insurance costs. On June 27, 1994, FSIS published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (59 FR 32940) to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. FSIS received one comment in response to the proposal. The comment was from the owner of a small meat establishment who felt that the current fee of $30.72 per hour was excessive and a burden on his company. After analyzing the available data relating to costs of providing these services, FSIS has determined that these rates reflect the cost of providing inspection services. The new rates reflect only an incremental increase in the costs currently borne by those entities electing to utilize overtime and holiday inspection services and certain other voluntary inspection services. To recover these increased costs in an expeditious manner, the Administrator has determined that these amendments should be effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . Executive Order 12866 This final rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866. The fees provided for in this rule reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities which elect to utilize certain voluntary inspection services. As discussed in the background of this document, the increase in fees reflects the increased costs of providing these services primarily as a result of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. Under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts, the administrative procedures are set forth in 7 CFR Part 1. Effect on Small Entities The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The fees reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities which elect to utilize certain inspection services.
