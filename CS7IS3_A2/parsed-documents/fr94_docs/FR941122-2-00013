FR941122-2-00013 FR941122-2-00009 NAS Fort Worth JRB is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability analysis was performed for air pollutant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO X ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the 1993 General Conformity Rule for determining conformity of federal actions to state or federal implementation plans (40 CFR Parts 6, 51, and 93). The analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source emissions associated with the proposed action. Neither NO X nor VOC emissions estimates for any year of the proposed action exceeded the de minimis levels of 100 tons per year established by the General Conformity Rule. The proposed action was determined to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and is exempted from any further requirements of the General Conformity Rule. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has reviewed the applicability analysis presented in the FEIS and has approved the air permit application resulting in the issuance of a construction permit to the Navy. An aircraft noise study was conducted to analyze the effects of noise patterns associated with JRB operations as compared to the previous operations at Carswell AFB. The area exposed to sound level DNL 65 dB or greater is expected to decrease by approximately 2,605 acres and affect 2,300 fewer residents than the previous Air Force aircraft noise impacts. No significant degradation of levels of service for on-base or off-base road systems are expected as a result of the proposed action. Current utilities to the base are of sufficient capacity to provide anticipated services. Utility lines within the base infrastructure will be upgraded in some locations where additional fire protection, natural gas, sanitary sewer, or electrical services are required. The local economy will not encounter any significant impacts from the proposed action. NAS Forth Worth JRB will initially reuse 83 units of family housing on-base. An estimated 3,939 housing units within the local communities will be vacated as a result of the closure of Carswell AFB. An estimated 1,196 housing units will be required to accommodate the in-migration of permanent personnel associated with the JRB. Based on this projected in-migration, 281 new students will enroll in the area's various school districts; this number is less than the decreases experienced in each of the last three years as a result of the Carswell AFB closure. Clean-up on identified installation restoration program (IRP) sites will continue regardless of the reuse or disposal plans. The Departments of the Navy and Air Force have entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to identify which department will continue the management of the clean-up program and provide the funding requirements. The two Departments have agreed to finalize program arrangements by October 1, 1995. In the interim, the Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA) will continue to administer the program. New construction and renovations requiring excavations will be closely coordinated with the IRP project manager to avoid any impacts to IRP sites or construction plans and maintain the health and safety of contractor personnel. The Navy will institute a hazardous material minimization program at NAS Fort Worth JRB by issuing hazardous materials in increments for daily consumption to the various departments and users on base. The hazardous waste storage facility currently permitted under a Part B permit by the State of Texas will continued to be used as a permitted facility for the storage of generated hazardous wastes. The AFBCA has identified all underground storage tanks that were in place at Carswell AFB. Navy design teams are evaluating what tanks are required for continued support to facilities planned for reuse. These tanks will be inspected and certified for use in accordance with all applicable underground storage tank regulations. The AFBCA is continuing with efforts to remove all other tanks not planned for reuse. The proposed action would result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered by either federal or state agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has concurred in this conclusion. No impacts to wetlands will be experienced as a result of new construction. Minor impacts to floodplains will be mitigated through the construction of improved storm water drainage and handling systems. The estimated 24 acres of disturbance from new construction will have minimal impacts to biological resources because of adjacencies to current airfield/industrial operations and the already existing built-up conditions. Potential impacts to cultural resources at NAS Fort Worth JRB have been evaluated in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations are proposed for two buildings (Building 1430 and 4175) that have been identified as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior renovations to Building 1430 will include the installation of a new roof. Interior renovations will include movement of office walls added to the facility during earlier Air Force interior renovations. Building 4575 will undergo major interior renovations to adapt this alert crew facility to a squadron operations building. Exterior renovations will include removal and demolition of surrounding equipment, addition of some windows, and altering some facility points of ingress/egress. All proposed modifications to these buildings will be coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) during project design. The Navy is proposing to the THC, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the acknowledgment, operation, and maintenance of eligible historic structures on NAS Fort Worth JRB. No significant archaeological, Native American, or paleontological resources have been identified on NAS Fort Worth JRB that would be adversely affected by the realignment activities. In the event that archaeological, paleontological, or Native American resources are discovered during the course of project activities, ground disturbing activities will cease in the immediate area and a qualified archaeologist will be consulted.
