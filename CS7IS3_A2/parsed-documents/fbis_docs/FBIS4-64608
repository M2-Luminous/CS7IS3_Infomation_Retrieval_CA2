Denktas today received the U.S. ambassador to Lefkosa [Nicosia] Richard Boucher and conferred with him for some time. The U.S. Embassy under secretary was also present at the meeting. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he told Boucher that the Republican Assembly, at its Cyprus debate yesterday, expressed support for him regarding the principles he stressed he would not be making any concessions on. He further noted that he informed the ambassador that the parties represented at the Assembly share his view that the package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been punctured and that it cannot be implemented in its current form. Denktas said: I clearly told him that the ball is now in Kliridhis' court, that the holes in the package have to be mended, and that the second map is unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot side. In reply to a question by a journalist on whether his meeting with Boucher is the beginning of a new process, Denktas said that he might consider it to be so but that circles interested in the Cyprus issue have, anyway, not accepted that the process is over. Pointing out that it will be wrong to assume that the Cyprus problem can be solved within a short period and that the Turkish Cypriots will be left in peace, Denktas stressed that he has very clearly expressed the views of the Turkish Cypriot side but that they should be put forward even more clearly. Noting that the circles interested in the Cyprus issue will, thus, understand what can be solved and what cannot, Denktas added: We have to explain to the world in detail on which parameters and milestones we shall insist. Denktas drew attention to the fact that the message being given to the Greek Cypriots that they can still join the EU if an agreement is not reached due to the failure of the Turkish Cypriot side gives the Greek Cypriots the opportunity to play the game of throwing the ball into the Turkish Cypriot court each time. Denktas said: I cannot concede each time to prevent Kliridhis from playing this game. No matter how flexible I am the result is still the same. What kind of a game is this? We are only helping Kliridhis join the EU. Europe has to be told that they should inform the Greek Cypriots that this game will not prove to be successful. Europe should tell the Greek Cypriots that the door to the EU is closed to them. Denktas said that he told the UN secretary general that a decision should be reached through a referendum to be held on both sides. He added that so long as the Greek Cypriots are not informed of this the carrot to be given to the Greek Cypriots will prove to be a very big stick for the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas stressed that no results can be achieved at the negotiations by giving hope to the Greek Cypriots and threatening the Turkish Cypriots. In reply to a question, Denktas said that the Republican Assembly is the best national platform and that the government will do whatever is necessary to expand the unity within the assembly.
