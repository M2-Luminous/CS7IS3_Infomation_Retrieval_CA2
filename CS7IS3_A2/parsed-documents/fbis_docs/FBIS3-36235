The many-days-long efforts of politicians and diplomats from the two countries were rounded off by the signing of the Russo-Georgian Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations and Cooperation. They had to display much persistence in their effort to restore the traditional ties of friendship between the two countries in spite of the destructive upheavals of past years and contrary to the speculations of enemies of the treaty. The leaders and foreign ministries of the two countries have exerted titanic efforts in this direction over the past few weeks. Assessing the results of their work, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed during a recent meeting with leaders of the North Caucasian republics that it was neither in the interests of Russia, nor of each nation of the North Caucasian region to have next to them a state torn asunder by internal strife, plunged into an economic chaos and crime. In his opinion, the treaty is a key to stability in the entire southern region of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This is perhaps the briefest answer to the question: What will the treaty give Russia and the Caucasian peoples? "The treaty is primarily important politically for Russia," ITAR-TASS was told by member of the Russian Presidential Council Emil Pain, "because it is wrong to adhere to two criteria at a time in politics: If you are an advocate of Russia's integrity, you must be also an advocate of the integrity of neighbouring states". Moreover, the current summit talks have shown that the treaty gives Russia several purely pragmatic advantages: Access to ports, establishment of military bases, maintenance of a military-strategic status quo, which is of common importance for all the CIS nations. Along with the treaty, which lays a solid legal foundation for the entire complex of relations between the two states, Russia and Georgia have also signed more than twenty other documents. They have also exchanged views on problems linked with bilateral cooperation, settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, on key international problems and on the situation in the transcaucasian region as a whole. "The Russian side," President Yeltsin stressed, "stands for a cardinal improvement of relations with Georgia in all spheres, for the quickest possible restoration of ruptured economic, cultural, and spiritual contacts, for rapprochement and integration. Russia proceeds from the need to honour Georgia's territorial integrity and to guarantee fully the interests of Abkhazia and South Ossetia." "The documents signed in Tbilisi and the results of the summit talks will contribute to the strengthening of cooperation not only between our two countries, but among all the nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States, too," Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, told a press conference in Tbilisi. "The importance of President Yeltsin's visit transcends the limits of Georgian-Russian relations. Their normalisation is closely linked with the settlement of all the outstanding problems in the Caucasian and Black Sea region, with the achievement of peace and stability there." Asked whether the negotiations touched on Georgia's inclusion in the rouble zone, President Yeltsin told the press conference that it was decided to set up working teams to examine all the "pros" and "cons" concerning both Georgia and Russia. Journalists put another "difficult question" to Yeltsin: What do you think about the State Duma's attitude to the signed treaty? The president did not rule out discussions, because "any international treaty is subject to debate". "Nevertheless," he said, "I am sure that members of the State Duma will positively approach this full-scale treaty with the independent Republic of Georgia".
