Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 'Abdallah paid a brief visit to Jeddah and held talks with Prince Sa'ud, Arab diplomats said, only a day after a senior northern Yemeni envoy had visited Oman. Meanwhile fighting raged in the suburbs of Aden, following the collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the two-month-old civil war. Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in securing the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which called for an immediate ceasefire. Oman currently chairs the Security Council. On Saturday 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the northern Yemeni presidential council, handed a message to Sultan Qabus of Oman from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The northern Yemeni authorities blamed the south for violating the latest ceasefire, declared by Sanaa late Saturday. It was set for midnight (2100 GMT). "The (southern) rebel outlaws violated the ceasefire and continued their aggression against our armed forces in the Aden and Hadhramawt provinces," a northern spokesman said. The northern Yemeni cabinet held a special meeting Sunday to discuss the ceasefire, Sanaa radio said, but ministers learned of the renewed fighting during the meeting. [passage omitted]
