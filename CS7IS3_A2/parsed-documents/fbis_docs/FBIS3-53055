[Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Rahim] For us, the agreement is a major accomplishment that would serve to consolidate our national and pan-Arab identities. The agreement virtually strengthens us with a shield, and that is brotherly Jordan. It will help us build an infrastructure for our coming national entity. [Dhiyab] Yesterday, the Royal Commission for Jerusalem Affairs was reactivated and renamed, assuming an Arab and Islamic dimension, as well as the local one. ['Abd-al-Rahim] We want to see the Jerusalem Committee firm up the Arab presence in Jerusalem and counter attempts to suppress that presence so that, when the final stage of a settlement comes, we will be talking about real and identifiable Arab features that have withstood Israel's attempts to erase the Arab civilization in Jerusalem. The joint Jordanian-Palestinian committees are to meet in the near future and build on the economic agreement. [Dhiyab] Mr. Ambassador: Have you had any reaction from inside the occupied territory? ['Abd-al-Rahim] Absolutely. Our people in the occupied territory are quite happy with this agreement. As you know, our people there are linked to our brother Jordanian people with close bonds. Whatever pleases the Jordanian people will please them there. I can't see a separation of the two peoples. Our people in the occupied land are just as happy with the agreement as our brother Jordanians. I had congratulations from large sections of our people -- organizations, trade unions, and other institutions -- calling for a further reinforcement of this distinguished relationship, sponsored by His Majesty King Husayn and brother Yasir 'Arafat.
