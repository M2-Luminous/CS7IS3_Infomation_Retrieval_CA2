During a lecture at a private university, Figueroa described the guidelines of the foreign policy of President Eduardo Frei's administration. Figueroa said negotiating for a free trade agreement with the United States, or Chile's acceptance as a NAFTA member, should be the government's priority goals. He explained that in order to step up the internationalization of the Chilean economy, alliances and agreements that will ensure the country's appropriate insertion into the great world markets are necessary. Regarding the European Union, Figueroa said this area is very important to Chilean foreign policy because, in his opinion, the European economy represents the largest integrated market in the world and is one of the most important megamarkets for Chile. Another subject mentioned by the foreign minister as being of great importance to his foreign policy are relations with Latin American countries, which should be relations that would contribute to a climate of democratic stability. Figueroa pointed out the need to participate, in a selective manner, in initiatives to promote peace, the broadening of democracy, respect for human rights, and development and equity in the international system. The minister said the current government, which was sworn in 11 March, hopes to implement a lasting foreign policy that will provide continuity. That foreign policy should respect international law and agreements and promote the legal and peaceful solution to controversies and the search for peace.
