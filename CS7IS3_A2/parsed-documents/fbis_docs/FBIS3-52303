The foreign minister is urging the Palestinians to allow implementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho and to put off their demands that have stalled the talks until negotiations begin on the fate of the rest of the West Bank. David Ze'ev reports: [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Contacts between Israel and the PLO can happen at any moment these days, including twice by phone as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was briefing the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th was on the other end. A Knesset official at the closed-door committee meeting referred to the second phone conversation as relatively long, lasting several minutes. Members of the media followed Peres when he slipped into a side room after the committee meeting ended. The foreign minister said there was nothing to report, at least in public: [Peres] Nothing for the public knowledge yet. [Ze'ev] But Peres made it clear that Israeli rejection of at least certain Palestinian demands is not final. The PLO has been told by Israel: Let's get the Gaza-Jericho First self-rule arrangements moving and then you may raise the demands again. [Peres] There were requests that were rejected, and Chairman 'Arafat returned to them. Actually we told the Palestinians: Look, this is not the end of the story. We do not understand 'Arafat's claim that this is a Bantustan, because in a matter of several months we are going to continue the negotiations about other parts of the West Bank. So actually what they are claiming is not land, but wasting time [sentence as heard]. In due course we shall continue the negotiations. It is not a closed story. [Ze'ev] Inside the committee room the foreign minister is said to have insisted that Israel will not compromise on controlling security at the border crossings into Jordan from the Jericho area, and into Egypt from Gaza. Peres said the Palestinians have withdrawn their demand for an international force. But in response to a question, Peres did not rule out that Jewish settlers could be uprooted, though he said it would be an internal Israeli decision, not in the shadow of the negotiations. And on the upcoming summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al- Asad, Peres said despite the high hopes in the United States for dramatic progress, he has his doubts.
