Suleyman Karagulle, who made a significant contribution to creation of the project, does not believe that the RP and Necmettin Erbakan are sincere about the "Just Order." Karagulle lives in the Kyrgyzstan capital, Bishkek, and answered our questions by FAX. [Cakir] Is the "Just Order" platform that Necmettin Erbakan proposed the same as the one you developed? [Karagulle] Erbakan and I worked together on the "Just Order." We agreed on almost all of the sentences. We had no disagreements except for one or two matters. Nevertheless, phrases were changed over time. Meanings change even if the words do not. Different things can be understood by the same words. You understand this only in practice. I cannot say anything because we have not seen it in practice. [Cakir] You said on the news that the RP considered the "Just Order" a means of propaganda and did not intend to implement it. Do you still feel this way? [Karagulle] I said that the project had nothing to do with the RP platform, that the RP had done no preparation for it, and that it has talked about it rather than implement it. This talk may be only to win votes. You must ask them, not me, what happens next. I am forced to make this statement because they have the power, but are not doing anything. They are better at implementing the existing order. This prompts hesitation about the Just Order. I want to tell people again and again that what Erbakan is saying is true, but what he is doing is not the Just Order. It does Erbakan no harm for me to say this. The Just Order has opponents within the RP, and it is Erbakan's job to win them over. Moreover, the West also fears the Just Order. If they would learn the facts, they would not be so opposed. The RP may be angry at me, but they are always angry at me anyway. [Cakir] What do you think will happen if the RP wins the election? [Karagulle] Nothing will happen if the RP wins. The other parties will tighten up at the table and give the RP room. They cannot solve problems with this logic, and today's hard times will continue and grow worse. A single party cannot solve Turkey's problems, but the Just Order can. There is no majority system under the Just Order, but a national coalition. It is an order that recognizes the rights of one sheep as well as the other 99. The RP is saying "Just Order," but is chasing after a majority system. And it will take advantage of the tyranny of the order. This is what will happen, but they are the "false dawn" (false enlightenment). True believers in the just order will come after them, and they will save humanity.
