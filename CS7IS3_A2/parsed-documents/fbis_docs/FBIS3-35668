Tensions Grow as Yeltsin's Visit to Tbilisi Draws Near"] [Text] The relative political calm in Tbilisi seems to be ending. The impression is that the government and the opposition "who retired to their corners" are preparing for a fresh "bout." Shortly before Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit, the council of one of the leading socialist parties had formulated and put forward its stance on the Abkhazia problem. As the Social Democrats, for example, see it, there are three ways to regain Abkhazia. First, by Eduard Shevardnadze's pressuring Russia with some help from Western politicians. Second, according to the parliamentary majority, the renunciation of all talks and the use of military force. Third, friendship with Russia and the regaining of Abkhazia using Russia's means. The third option is what constitutes the stance of Social Democrats on this question. Such a point of view is also held by the majority of political parties that pin certain hopes on the settlement of relations with Russia precisely in connection with the upcoming visit. But the more radical forces in Georgia still remain supporters of a confrontation with Russia. The first among them is perhaps Boris Kakubava, a deputy of parliament, the leader of the organization "Liberation of Abkhazia." During a recent press conference he once again accused the Georgian Government of inaction. He assessed the Geneva talks as extremely negative and called upon the public, primarily refugees from Abkhazia, to stage protest actions against Russia's interference in Georgia's internal affairs in the course of the Abkhazia conflict and to blame Russia for defeat in the war. Irakliy Tsereteli, leader of the "National Independence of Georgia" party, made a similar statement. He thinks that President Yeltsin should know that there are forces in Georgia that are far from delighted with Russian policy toward Georgia. He calls upon the Georgian Government to come forward with a statement on the restoration of Georgia's jurisdiction in Abkhazia and in so-called South Ossetia. In the meantime, Conservative-Monarchist Party chairman Temur Zhorzholiani declared that he welcomes Boris Yeltsin's visit in every way and that he is awaiting a constructive dialogue of the heads of the two states in whose course both political and economic problems would be settled. Incidentally, the number of such statements is considerably greater because it has finally become clear that Russia cannot be easily pressured, the forces are far from equal, and it is impossible to pass overnight from the sphere of Russian influence into the sphere of Western influence. Thus, the points of view of the government and those of the opposition have grown somewhat closer on this matter. A conference of mainly opposition political organizations to which were invited representatives of nearly all parties and organizations of the republic, persons prominent in science and culture, was held in parliament hall yesterday. Eduard Shevardnadze, who did not attend, sent a written apology which seemed to have cooled the speakers' aggressive ardor a bit. But there was criticism galore. For example, Republican Ivlian Khaindrava stated that ever since the weakening of the communist regime in Georgia the signs of a power crisis, which was showing in varying degrees of acuteness under the old regime and which is showing under the present regime, have been starkly evident. This is to be explained, according to him, by the lack of a clear separation of powers between the legislative and the executive branches and by their failure to perform their own functions. As a result, virtually unlimited power is concentrated in the hands of one individual. A situation has taken shape in the country in which, according to Khaindrava, all questions starting from the problems of the Tbilisi zoo and ending with Georgia's joining the CIS are solved singlehanded by the head of state. The speakers of virtually all opposition parties showed solidarity with the Republicans in this regard and in the supposition that the cabinet was unable to solve economic and financial problems and follow a purposeful policy in the area of economic reforms. Trying to explain the reasons for the economic failure during yesterday's parliament session, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya asked for another 10 days to study this problem. The time was sufficient, he thought, for a specially created commission to find the reason for the plunging of the coupon. Many complaints about the head of state and the policy he follows were voiced by People's Fund of Georgia chairman Nodar Natadze. In his opinion, the current leadership had been artificially stoking up the atmosphere and deepening the crisis in which joining the CIS should appear the only way to save Georgia. The same is being done regarding the idea that is floating in the air about joining the ruble zone, which would deprive Georgia of one of the main trappings of an independent state --its own currency. Georgia's course toward Russia, Natadze stated, is nothing but an open recognition of the latter's diktat. But it should be noted that not only criticisms were voiced, but also constructive proposals on overcoming the crisis. Those gathered generally arrived at the conclusion that in order to get out of the situation that had taken shape it was necessary first and foremost to revise downward the powers of the head of state, to increase the role of parliament, and to create a cabinet able to at long last to work out and carry through economic reforms. Tough demands, no doubt about it. It is hard to say if Shevardnadze and the government agree on a compromise. This newly emerging situation too will perhaps become clearer during Boris Yeltsin's visit.
