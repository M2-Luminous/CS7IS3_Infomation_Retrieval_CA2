FR940728-0-00054 FR940728-0-00019 III. Summary of Today's Final Rule EPA is finalizing a revised version of the January 8, 1988 proposal in today's notice. The final rule states in essence that recovered oil from petroleum refinery operations, petroleum exploration and production, and transportation incident thereto, is excluded from the regulatory definition of solid waste if it is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The recovered oil thus need not be generated at the site of the refining process_a potentially significant expansion of the proposal. This exclusion applies, however, only if the oil is not managed in land disposal units or accumulated speculatively before it is inserted. EPA expects that most of the recovered oil affected by this rule will be generated from wastewater treatment operations. As explained below, EPA is narrowing the proposal (which would have excluded petroleum refining wastewaters containing oil that eventually gets recycled) by finding that refinery operations upstream of recovered oil systems involve wastewater treatment, not an on-going refining process. Thus, petroleum refinery wastewaters undergoing treatment should not be excluded from the definition of solid waste. In addition, even if these wastewater treatment operations are characterized as also involving recycling, the operations involve discarded residuals that can be part of the waste disposal problem, and hence the wastewater treatment operations need not be characterized as part of an ``ongoing production process'' for purposes of excluding materials from the definition of solid waste. Once oil is recovered, however, the Agency believes it reasonable to exclude it from the definition of solid waste if the oil is to be reused in the refining process (even though the oil may still require a significant amount of further processing before it can actually be so reused). This is because the recovered oil and its management within refining operations can be viewed as part of the petroleum refining process and not part of the waste disposal problem. EPA is also slightly amending the regulatory exemption for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste (see §261.6 (a)(3)(vii), redesignated (a)(3)(vi) in today's rule). The Agency is slightly broadening the current exemption so that it also applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, but the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated. As a matter of drafting, the principal change brought about by today's rule takes the form of an exclusion from the regulatory definition of solid waste. Specifically, paragraph (12) is being added to the list of exclusions in §261.4 (a). In addition, EPA is removing the regulatory exemption in §261.6(a)(3)(v) which is superseded by today's exclusion, and redesignating the remaining exemptions in §261.6(a)(3) (vi) and (vii) as §261.6(a)(3) (v) and (vi), respectively, in order to maintain consecutive numbering. EPA is also revising two other regulatory exemptions in §261.6(a)(3). Finally, EPA is making conforming changes to §§261.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) and 266.100(b)(3), both as a result of today's rulemaking, and to reflect conforming changes that EPA inadvertently omitted during promulgation of the used oil final rule (57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992)). IV. Scope of Today's Final Rule A. Limiting Scope to Recovered Oil From Petroleum Refining, Exploration and Production As noted above, today's rule excludes recovered oil generated from petroleum exploration, production and refining activities, and from the transportation incident thereto, from being a solid waste when the recovered oil is inserted into a designated point in a petroleum refining process. This section of the preamble discusses why EPA is crafting the exclusion in this manner. More specifically, we discuss why the exclusion does not cover oil recovered in operations downstream from petroleum refining, and why the exclusion does not apply to recovered oil from industries other than petroleum refining, exploration, or production.
