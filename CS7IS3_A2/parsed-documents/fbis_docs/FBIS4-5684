The commission conducted a survey on the effects of the yen's appreciation on prices of products from the angle of market structure, comparing wholesale prices of 45 items last December with year-earlier levels. The 45 items surveyed were limited to those covered by both the import price index and domestic wholesale price index. A considerable fall was noted in prices, in yen terms, of imported cigarettes, pig iron, motors and farm tractors, but wholesale prices of comparable domestic products rose, the survey said. Wholesale prices of 19 items in which foreign access to the markets is limited -- such as beer, whisky, brandy and cheese -- posted almost no decline, compared with an appreciable fall in yen- based import prices of comparable foreign products, it said. The survey said that in the case of 15 of the 23 items, the Japanese market is in an oligopolistic state with the combined market share of the top three makers reaching 60 percent or above. Like monopoly, oligopoly tends to stem a fall in market prices. The more imported raw and semifinished materials are used, the more the prices of products using those materials will fall if there are no factors limiting competition, the survey said. It said the more oligopolistic the market is, the less tendency there will be for lower prices.
