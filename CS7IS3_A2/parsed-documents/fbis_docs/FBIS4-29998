In his address reviewing the meeting's success, Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason hailed the high sense of responsibility displayed by all delegates in attendance. They diligently contributed views to the meeting's draft report reviewing national defense work in the first six months of this year as well as work orientations for the consolidation and building of the armed forces in the second half of the year. The delegates unanimously assessed that despite numerous difficulties in the first half of 1994, our armed forces -- together with the multiethnic Lao people -- have managed to thwart every sinister scheme employed by bad elements, thereby keeping the situation basically peaceful throughout the country. Moreover, consolidation of the organizational, political, and ideological aspects of all Army units has also made firm progress. Firm economic foundations have been laid to improve the living conditions of all soldiers. Despite these strong points, our armed forces are still encountering certain obstacles. Political training is still failing to catch up with political organization and practical deeds. The translation of the party's policies into reality has not yet been fully realized. A considerable number of cadres and party members have failed to set up model patterns and practical organizational methods to lead armed units in efficiently performing their work. Negativism still prevails among our cadres and combatants.
