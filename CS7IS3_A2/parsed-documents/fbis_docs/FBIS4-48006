FBIS4-48006 "drafr089_c_94029" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 9 May South African Press Review for 9 May MB0905133794 MB0905133794 BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Whites `Laid the Foundation' for Prosperous South Africa -- "The people, the vast majority of whom are Black, have spoken and are celebrating their liberation with the joy that the ANC's victory gives them," declares the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 6 May. "Neither they, nor the outside world, will shed a tear for the demise of White rule. Yet it will not be amiss to say that the legacy left to Mr Mandela and his government has not all been bad." Apartheid was "a grim abandonment of human values and rights, causing great suffering and holding back a people in most spheres of life. But as a country we have progressed to become a powerhouse in sub-Saharan Africa, a country that has a solid foundation for growth, a developing country with First World as well as Third World standards, a country that can bring to all its people the benefits of modern technology and great entrepreneurial skills." THE CITIZEN believes white South Africans "deserve to be recognised as a people who laid the foundation for what is going to be a prosperous and wonderful country." THE STAR New Cabinet ANC-Loaded -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 9 May in a page-10 editorial notes that South Africans are entitled to "feel a quiet pride" at the formation of the Government of National Unity (GNU). However, "it is a pity that the GNU Cabinet should be quite as ANC-loaded as it is, particularly after all the honeyed protestations of inclusiveness that have dripped from the nation's rooftops in recent weeks. Worse, an alarm bell has already rung loudly, although so far overlooked in the election over Nelson Mandela's victory speech.@??Zn? in the middle of that speech, Mandela seemed to reveal his understanding of the way his party's partners in cabinet are required to behave. Their views were to be accommodated...'within the context of the Reconstruction and Development Programme'." "Alarm bell indeed. Insofar as Mandela is urging his about-to-be Cabinet partners to serve reconstruction (small r) and go in for development (small d), good and well. If he is insisting that they unquestioningly imbibe a party programme with which they have major arithmetical difficulty, not so. 'National Unity' cannot merely mean permitting a token opposition presence in the Cabinet room. It must mean two-way adjustment. Most adjusting, fair to say, must come from the minority parties; but not all. Mandela seems to see his partners as a set of voluntary hostages. He must revise that view before it leads to tears." BUSINESS DAY Mandela's `Curious' Cabinet Appointments -- The page-12 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 May comments on President Nelson Mandela's "more curious provisional Cabinet appointments." The "impending reappointment of Derek Keys to the Finance portfolio is, from business's perspective, a bonus. With Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals's mid-year reappointment already as good as confirmed, Mandela probably need not have gone that far to convince business of his good intentions." However, Mandela should realize that Keys "is not, like some other NP [National Party] Cabinet possibilities, a yes man. A discordant note was struck in Mandela's victory speech on Monday, when he warned that Cabinet partners would have to accept the ANC's reconstruction and development programme, failing which there would be serious strains. Yes, the ANC has a clear mandate to make the RDP the basis of the new government's programme, but Keys will put his foot down if he believes it necessary in the interest of good fiscal management. Mandela should not take that as a sign of hostility to reconstruction and development per se. And, if Keys felt compelled to resign over such a dispute, the effects on investor confidence could be dire." BUSINESS DAY believes Alfred Nzo was appointed foreign minister as "a reward for past services, but he is "likely to be ineffectual in Foreign Affairs." "The two main security portfolios -- Defence and Police -- are the most worrying. Prospective Police Minister Sidney Mufamadi's three-year reign as head of the ANC's peace desk was uninspired as the country descended into violence. Proposed Defence Minister Joe Modise is held in high esteem only by factions of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and a few others. Assuming the NP is still fighting for one of these two posts, it would do Mandela no harm to concede the point." "There are, in the end, two grounds for consolation regarding Mandela's less-inspired choices. Weak ministers can be carried if they have competent directors-general and other senior officials. They can also be removed at the President's will."
