Jarrar, one of the 405 Hamas deportees who returned several months ago from south Lebanon, was arrested again on Monday. Before his arrest, he told THE JERUSALEM POST that Hamas would carry out attacks against Israelis in areas not under Palestinian control. According to Fatah sources, Jarrar has considerable support among the more radical young elements in Hamas. Fatah leader Marwan Barghuthi confirmed Jarrar's statement. But he insisted Fatah's aim in making the agreement is to persuade the fundamentalist group to cooperate with the Palestinian authority and stop its opposition to the autonomy accord. Israel has warned the PLO that an agreement to turn a blind eye to Hamas attacks against Israelis outside the autonomous areas will annul the Israel-PLO agreement. Fatah leaders in the territories angrily retort that an agreement with Hamas is an inter-Palestinian affair designed to keep Hamas quiet and does not concern Israel. "In areas under our control we can ask Hamas to stop attacks against Israelis in order not to destroy the autonomy accord. Outside our areas, we have no control," said Barghuthi. Barghuthi, a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Command, is one of the deportees who returned two weeks ago. He said he had been involved in negotiations with Hamas in Jordan while working for the PLO office in Amman. He argues that it is against Fatah's interest to let Hamas continue attacks against Israel while Fatah talks peace. These attacks, he said, increase popular support for Hamas. Shaykh Jamil Hamami of eastern Jerusalem, who declines to be called a Hamas member following the wave of arrests of Hamas activists in recent days, refers to himself as a member of the Islamic movement. Hamami said autonomy will be implemented despite Hamas's efforts to sabotage the agreement, and he is certain Hamas will try to reach an agreement with the Palestinian authority to avoid internecine bloodshed. It will be difficult, he admitted, because the PLO will be bound by an agreement to ensure calm and cooperate with Israel on security measures, but "both Hamas and Fatah will find ways to avoid confrontation." Hinting that Hamas may temporarily use political means rather than violence, Hamami nevertheless insisted that Hamas will continue to attack Israelis. "No one can forbid us to attack the occupation force. We will strike at the Zionist pirates wherever we find them," he said, adding that for Hamas, Haifa and Yafo are occupied Palestinian lands too. Nor would the Hamas denounce attacks against Israelis to gain a release of its prisoners, Hamami insisted. The PLO has asked Israel to release Hamas prisoners if the movement denounces violence against Israeli civilians. But he said the release of prisoners is not a gift from the PLO or Israel, but a Palestinian right. "They are negotiating a prisoner release while Israel is arresting hundreds of Hamas people. This should be an indication to the PLO that Israel is not serious about peace, and 'Arafat should stop the negotiations," he said. "These statements could mean that Hamas is changing its policy and will recognize a peace treaty with Israel, or they could be a trial balloon to see what Hamas could gain from it," said Riyad al- Maliki, spokesman for PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]. Hamas leaders themselves still don't seem to know what to do. "We will wait and see, and adapt our methods to the new circumstances," admitted Hamami.
