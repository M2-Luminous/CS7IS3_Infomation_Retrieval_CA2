Aguinaldo] [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) expressed dissatisfaction over the performance of the government panel lead by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar, saying the panel is incapable of making important decisions regarding the ongoing talks. In a briefing with BUSINESS WORLD, cashiered Army Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan commented the panel cannot make independent moves, particularly on key issues surrounding peace negotiations. Mr. Honasan said the release of alleged communist Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon demonstrated the power of the government panel tasked to negotiate with the communist National Democratic Front (NDF). The group has been asking for the release of six RAM members who continue to be detained allegedly due to their participation in the series of coups launched against the Aquino Administration. Ambassador Howard Dee, government panel chairman tasked to negotiate with the NDF, was said to be one of those who convinced President Ramos to release Ms. Tiamzon to save the peace talks. Mr. Dee told BUSINESS WORLD he is also personally arranging for the release of more or less 350 political prisoners still detained in Muntinlupa and other parts of the country. On the other hand, Mr. Tadiar said the release of the six soldiers should be left to "judicial discretion" and that the matter should be left to the courts. "Bakit si Wilma Tiamzon pinalaya nila? (Why did they release...) We have been asking for the release of our comrades since 1992," Mr. Honasan said. Similarly, RAM compared Mr. Tadiar's panel with the government panel negotiating with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Last March, Ambassador Manuel Yan, panel chairman, allowed MNLF chief Nur Misuari to bring with him 100 heavily armed bodyguards around Mindanao. During the barangay [village] election period this month, RAM said they were not given permits to carry firearms. One RAM member said Mr. Tadiar told the group he can only make recommendations to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) for them to be exempted. Mr. Tadiar told BUSINESS WORLD his panel will be answerable to the Comelec if the procedure in applying for gun ban exemption permit was not followed. "They allowed Misuari armed bodyguards but they would not allow us to bring guns to protect ourselves," they said. As to whether or not the group wants Mr. Tadiar replaced, Mr. Honasan said "it's not for us to decide." If President Ramos thinks Tadiar is good, it is up to him to retain the panel chairman," he stated. Still, Navy Captain Felix Turingan said they have been consulted on the panel chairman's performance but "we refused to comment." Other RAM members who attended the press briefing were former Army Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, Army major Abraham Puruganan and lawyer Rick Blancaflor.
