FR940713-2-00010 FR940713-2-00006 Financial Assistance Award: Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc. (MATVA) AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) to Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc. (MATVA) under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94CE15599. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $155,728 (DOE contributing $99,862 and MATVA contributing $55,866) for MATVA to use a new whisker growing technique to make and test a high temperature heat exchanger prototype. The subject invention, ``An In-Situ Whisker Reinforced Glass Ceramic'' is a patented process for creating glass ceramic materials with acicular (needle-shaped) titanium oxide reinforcing whiskers grown in-site in one step. This new process is an enabling technology that could permit rapid and inexpensive production of titanium oxide whisker reinforced materials at much lower energy, labor, and health related costs. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the application submitted by the Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc., is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique device for conserving energy by greatly reducing energy costs during fabrication, and by making superior materials available for use in more efficient devices such as the heat exchangers for construction under this project which will be submitted as prototypes for third party testing. The use of this device has a strong possibility for future reductions in the Nation's energy consumption. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because the program, the Energy-Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: Linda S. Sapp, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 24 months from the date of award. Issued in Washington, DC on June 23, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director, Headquarters Operation Division B, Office of Placement and Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16985 Filed 7&hyph;12-&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
