But he stressed that the military option had a huge price-tag attached with severe implications for the humanitarian aid effort. He arrives in Bosnia tomorrow and is due to fly immediately to Sarajevo aboard an RAF Hercules for urgent talks with the new UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose. "What one needs to do is to hear from the UN military commanders on the spot whether they believe there is any useful way in which the UN, by military means or any other way, can help try to prevent a repetition of this ghastly incident," he said. Speaking after a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Munich, he said: "We are all conscious of that fact that our prime duty in Sarajevo at the present time is seeking to ensure the people there get the sustenance they require. "If there are any initiatives of a military kind that the military are able to recommend as being relevant, then clearly that is something we would have to listen to very carefully." U.S. President Bill Clinton indicated tonight that air strikes on Serb positions was one of the options that would have to be looked at. But Mr. Rifkind emphasised it was essential first to find out from the UN commanders on the ground whether responsibility for the marketplace attack can be definitely pinned on the Serbs. "Whether the military role can be increased and enhanced is a very difficult and painful decision," he said. "First, we have to hear the views of the military in Bosnia. We have to be certain that any military initiatives are capable of providing the solution we want to see. Otherwise, we would be exposing our troops to unacceptable risk to their own lives." And he insisted: "The military option has a huge price tag attached to it with implications for the whole humanitarian operation." Sir Michael has adopted what he calls a "very hardline, hardnosed approach" to ensuring humanitarian aid gets through. He has promised the UN forces will be much more "tough-minded" in refusing to be turned back by the warring factions. And Mr. Rifkind revealed that the general, a former head of the SAS, had the full backing of the British Government. "Sir Michael is taking a very robust approach to these matters and he has the full and unqualified support of the British Government in the way which he is approaching his responsibilities," said Mr. Rifkind. "What has often been a cause for concern are the delays that have taken place and the extent to which small numbers of persons from one or other of the factions have been able to hold up aid. "I think the attitude of the new commander will help deal with that particular matter." But he repeated there was no easy answer to the crisis facing Bosnia, particularly Sarajevo. "Today's attack was an example essentially of terrorism," he said. "We know about terrorism in the UK and we know there are no simple answers. "I don't think people in Britain or elsewhere believe we can simply end this civil war by external military involvement. We have seen the problems in Somalia." Britain is due to make a final decision next month whether to keep troops in Bosnia to help the humanitarian aid effort and Mr Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission will be crucial.
