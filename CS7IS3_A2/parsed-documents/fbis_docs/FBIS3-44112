A Lesotho Government spokesman said all attempts to get the warring factions around the table had failed. Mr. Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, says that at this stage he is not considering sending the military into Lesotho, but that South African soldiers are being deployed along the border to monitor events. Mr. Botha emphasized that South Africa would not recognize a new Lesotho Government that came into power by a coup, adding that South Africa will even consider imposing sanctions against it. [Begin Botha recording in English] There may be politics behind this. There may even be an attempted coup behind the present trouble in Lesotho and that is why I made it clear to the Lesotho people, and to the defense force, that this government will under no circumstances recognize any government that comes into being in there in an irregular fashion, and particularly through violence, and that we would close the border. And that we would take other steps, which we can take, we can withhold funds from the customs pool which will make it impossible for a government that takes over by force, to govern that country successfully. [end recording] Storm clouds hung over Maseru today, but for local residents the sound of thunder was a welcome relief from the sound of machine gunfire. Five soldiers have been killed since the fighting broke out 10 days ago. Schools in the capital were closed today and some shops and government offices closed early today. The last sound of gunfire died down at about 0000 GMT this morning, but there are rumors that renewed fighting could break out by tomorrow morning. Foreign embassies in Maseru are monitoring the situation closely and some are ready to evacuate their members if fighting resumes. [Begin Gerhard Visser, South African Ambassador to Lesotho recording] I spoke to my staff members -- some of them have been here for about three years -- they told me that the present troubled situation is much worse than the previous coup in 1990 when General Ramaema overthrew General Lekhanya. Because the present situation is so unpredictable it is really very difficult to make decisions without causing any panic within the South African Community here. [end recording] Soldiers from the Royal Lesotho Defense Force headquarters took up positions in the hills just south of Maseru late today and are believed to be waiting for the soldiers from the Makoanyane barracks to make the next move. Mr. Leeiso Serutle, principal secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said today that until the two factions talked to the government they won't know what the fighting is really about. [Begin Serutle recording in English] They wanted to take the government by force, and I'm not quite clear whether this is true or not. But, yes, your guess is as good as mine. [end recording]
