As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy Koptev has told INTERFAX, an agreement on additional supplies has been reached at negotiations in Bangalore between Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) officials and Russian experts earlier this month. In Koptev's words, India will get two more boosters as compensation for Russia's forced repeal of the additional agreements as incompatible with the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), accords that provide for the delivery of cryogenic technology and equipment to Delhi and for Indian specialists' training. Thereby, Koptev said, "Russia has kept virtually intact the volume of financing" envisaged by the contract and its addenda and estimated at $220 Mn. The first booster is to be supplied in 1995. In Koptev's opinion, putting relations with ISRO on a footing in line MTCR, which Russia intends to join, has not had any adverse effect on bilateral cooperation, which is borne out by the two countries short-term plan to sign an intergovernmental agreement in the field.
