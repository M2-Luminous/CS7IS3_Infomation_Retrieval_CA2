Korean Puppet Clique denounced" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [SDP] in a statement on April 30 branded the nuclear arms development of the South Korean puppet clique as an open challenge to the desire of the whole nation for peace and peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable criminal act of reducing to a waste paper the "agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between the North and the South" and "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula". The statement says: The DPRK already proposed at talks with the United States to replace graphite moderated nuclear reactors by light water reactors in order to remove the "suspicion" of the United States and international reactionaries and reached even an agreement on the way of it. Therefore, if the graphite moderated nuclear reactors are replaced by light water reactors, the "suspicion of nuclear development" by the DPRK will be removed. But the United States is raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear development", while failing to implement the agreed points. This is an outrageous act. The South Korean rulers must admit of their own accord that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in the Taedok complex are reactors for the development of nuclear weapons, take a measure to eliminate them, open to the public the truth of the secret development of nuclear weapons they have stepped up while trying to do harm to the DPRK, apologize for it before the nation and remove the already stockpiled nuclear materials. If the South Korean authorities continue the adventurous development of nuclear weapons in defiance of protest and denunciation from the entire Korean people and international public, they will be held fully responsible for all consequences from it. The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency must renounce the unfair policy of double standard in nuclear inspection, refrain from putting "pressure" on the North which has no intention to produce nuclear weapons, and take issue with the nuclear development of the South Korean authorities and bring chief culprits to the dock.
