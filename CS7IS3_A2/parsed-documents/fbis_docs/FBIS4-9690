FBIS4-9690 "drlat062_r_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 21 Mar 1994 Peru Arrest Warrant for Former President Garcia Issued Arrest Warrant for Former President Garcia Issued PY3003233294 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p A2 PY3003233294 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Supreme Court Chairman Luis Serpa Segura told Italian prosecutor Vittorio Paraggio during a meeting held in the past few days that Peruvian justice has issued a national arrest warrant against former President Alan Garcia Perez. This was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera, a member of the congressional committee investigating the fraud case of the Lima subway's construction. The committee members met last week with the Italian prosecutors visiting Peru to investigate the case, who returned to Italy on 20 March. The arrest order, however, has not been transmitted yet to Interpol, Olivera said. "I have talked with the Interpol representative in Peru and he told me he was not informed by the judicial branch about the arrest warrant," he said. Olivera demanded that the Supreme Court immediately transmit the arrest order to Interpol in order "to prevent Alan Garcia from continuing to flout the law and stay abroad as if he were not sought in Peru."
