He added that this proposal, which "is convincing and satisfactory for all the parties," will be submitted to the Security Council by the Arab group, the nonaligned countries, and the African states and could be accepted because it is not a Libyan one. In his remarks on developments in the Lockerbie case, Col. al-Qadhdhafi said that there are now strong suspicions that Libya is not the sole defendant in this case but that there are several parties, especially after the confessions of Yusuf Sha'ban, who is being tried before a Lebanese court. On tightening the sanctions imposed on Libya, he stressed that his country is ready to confront any situation. But he expressed his belief that the European countries will be the only losers in this. On his meeting with the wife of Mansur al-Kikhya [Libyan dissident who disappeared while in Egypt], al-Qadhdhafi said: We met and I stressed to her that the security organs in Egypt and Libya are fully cooperating to uncover the truth. He pointed a finger of accusation at the U.S. intelligence and its Libyan agents.
