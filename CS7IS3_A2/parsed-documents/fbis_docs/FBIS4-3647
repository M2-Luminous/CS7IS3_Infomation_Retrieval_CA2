Pakistan has decided to provide 3,000 troops for deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina in response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 836 designed to protect six safe areas there. The Pakistani troops, whose equipment supply is arranged by the United Nations from Germany, will be deployed in Bosnia under U.N. auspices. Speaking at the weekly press briefing, the spokesman also informed journalists that Pakistan has moved a resolution in the U.N. Security Council seeking use of air strikes against Serbian artillery shelling on Gorazde. The resolution also demands the withdrawal of the Serbian forces behind the line drawn when Gorazde was declared safe area and lifting of arms embargo against Bosnian forces, he said. "The resolution was moved in light of Serbian aggression against the safe area of Gorazde," he added.
