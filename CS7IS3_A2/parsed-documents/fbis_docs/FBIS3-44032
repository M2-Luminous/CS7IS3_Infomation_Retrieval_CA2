We are joined now by a correspondent in Maseru, Sara Hildebrand. Sara, welcome to you. You have been through quite a weekend. How has the fighting affected you? [Hildebrand] For me personally, well, it's very difficult. I do sympathize with any the other people living in Lesotho with young families. I've got two small children. There is definitely a worry here about what to do. The are queues, apparently, at the border with people leaving, and people coming into Lesotho are being told they do so at their own risk. [Glynn] But, the fighting over the weekend, was it in the center of Maseru, or on the outskirts? [Hildebrand] It was basically -- we have a hotel up on the hill and it was certainly round the surrounding houses, and then on the other side we have a place called [word indistinct] in Thetsane where there was also shelling going on there, you know, where people were really, literally, crouching under the tables and there was just whistling over their homes. In fact my gardener came in this morning to tell me he opened his front door this morning to find two dead soldiers outside in the garden. [Glynn] What are the total casualties to date? [Hildebrand] Well, it's very difficult to say. There have been reports of two or three soldiers, which obviously, I think that not actually accurate, as I've heard from various other sources of people seeing seven soldiers at the side of the road, and I think we are very unsure about that. [Glynn] And the consensus of opinion now as to the cause of the fighting -- are people still believing that it is the wage issue? [Hildebrand] I think it's sort of gone beyond that now. It might have originally been that, but it's certainly between these two rival factions. And again people are climbing on the bandwagon here, the political seems to be getting involved as well. [sentence as heard] We have the troops in the town who are supposedly loyal to the government, and then those outside who again may be [words indistinct] supported by the BNP [Basotholand National Party]. [Glynn] We heard reports that South Africa's been requested for troops to quell the fighting there. Do you have an update on that situation? [Hildebrand] I have been trying to get in contact with the South African ambassador, but he's obviously in various meetings at the moment, but he's promised to get back to me as soon as possible. [Glynn] And what about your plans? I mean, what's going to happen today, for instance? [Hildebrand] I think that's a very good question. We are all waiting here, really. We are expecting it to start up again. I mean, you know there's a lull at the moment but the soldiers are all still out there. I think everyone has to make their own decision about what they are going to do. Some areas have been evacuated, those in the direct line of fire, and I know friends of mine have now moved into the safer areas. I think we've just got to wait and see how bad it's going to get. Certain people have moved across the border already. I know the United Nations have moved their people out. So, I mean, I think everyone had to make up their own minds on this [ words indistinct]. [Glynn] And your bags are packed? [Hildebrand] They are definitely packed and we are ready to go, but we are sticking in here for the moment. [Glynn] But Sara, are there any plans for negotiations, any meetings planned for today? [Hildebrand] I hope so, yes I do. As I say, I am waiting to see that. Some people obviously are in meetings at the moment. I know, for instance, the Lesotho Highlands Project is now closed down. They just rang in to tell me that. The people are being sent home. [Glynn] Well, take care of yourself, Sara, and thanks very much for joining us.
