The relationships between the powder properties and the preparation factors such as reaction temperature, carrying-gas flow rate, and reactant densities are studied. The _b_-SiC ultrafine powder with uniform size (< 0.1 �m), high purity (30 weight percent of carbon content), and homogeneous crystalline structure is obtained through the decarbonization, deoxidization, and crystallization processes. Key words: ultrafine silicon-carbide powder, CVD, low-molecular polysilane. 1. Introduction Due to its high-temperature mechanical properties, and good thermal shock-resistance property, SiC is one of the major materials in research on using high-temperature ceramics for engine parts.[.sup]1[/] To make superior ceramics by a sintering method, one of the crucial techniques is to prepare ultrafine (nanoscale) ceramic powders having the properties of non-agglomeration, size uniformity, and high purity.[.sup]2[/] The best method to prepare SiC ultrafine powder is the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.[.sup]3[/] Among the several CVD methods, one is to prepare the SiC ultrafine powder from reactions between silicon-content monomers (e.g., SiCl[.sup]4[/], SiH[.sub]4[/]) and carbon-content monomers (e.g., CH[.sup]4[/], C[.sup]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]),[.sup]4[/]; and another, from the thermal decomposition of organic silicon compounds containing both carbon and silicon (e.g., CH[.sup]3[/]SiCl[.sub]3[/], CH[.sup]3[/]SiH[.sub]3[/], [(CH[.sup]3[/])[.sub]2[/]Si][.sub]2[/], etc.).[.sup]2,5[/] However, in the monomer reactions, the existence of chlorine reduces the production rate, corrodes the equipment, and pollutes the environment. Moreover, when the carbon-to-silicon ratio (C/Si) is too low, too much free silicon is produced. Therefore, it is worthwhile to research other systems. This paper studies the production factors of making SiC ultrafine powder from low-molecular polysilane (LPS), which is a by-product from synthesizing polyalkyl silane, as raw material and high-purity argon as carrying gas. The research also analyzes the composition, structure, and configuration of the ultrafine powder. 2. Experimental Work 2.1 Raw Materials: LPS is a by-product generated from the cracking process of making polyalkyl silane from polysilane. It is a pale yellow liquid composed of organic silicon oligomers with different boiling points. These oligomers have chain or ring structures with Equation as the backbones, and an average molecular weight of 250. They vaporize completely at 300�C. 2.2 Carrying Gas: The carrying gas is high-purity argon with 12 x 10[.sup]-6[/] of oxygen and 16.5 x 10[.sup]-6[/] of H[.sup]2[/]O as analyzed with a DH-3C trace-oxygen analyzer and a US-1-1A trace-water analyzer, respectively. 2.3 Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine Powder: As shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of the Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine Powder 2.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization and Crystallization of the Ultrafine Powder: The SiC ultrafine-powder product from the reaction is amorphous. The powder is treated at 1600�C for crystallization as well as decarbonization and deoxidization to remove the free carbon and oxygen in the ultrafine powder. 2.5 Ultrafine Powder Characteristics: The powder's infrared spectrum is obtained with a Hitachi 270-30 infrared spectrometer. The size and configuration of the powder are determined with a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM); the powder crystal structure, with a type D/max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer; and the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents, with a USA PE2400CHN element analyzer. 3. Results and Discussions 3.1 Effects of Reaction Temperature Under the condition that the argon flow rate is controlled at 0.24 L/min; and LPS flow rate, 0.025 g/min, different powder batches are made within the temperature range of 900 to 1300�C, as shown in the TEM photos in Figure 2. The reaction temperature has little effect on the particle size and configuration. The powder diameters are between 0.05 and 0.1 �m with very narrow distribution, and most particles are spherical. Figure 2. SEM Photographs of SiC Powder Synthesized at Different Temperatures Figure 3 shows the relationship between the powder's carbon and the hydrogen contents and the reaction temperature. The carbon content increases and the hydrogen content decreases with the increase of the reaction temperature. The fact that the hydrogen content in the SiC product is zero at the reaction temperature 1300�C indicates that the transformation of the organic LPS to the inorganic SiC is complete. In LPS, the ratio of carbon to silicon is 2:1, therefore the total carbon content in the ultrafine powder exceeds the theoretical value (30 weight percent) and free carbon exists in the final product. At low temperature, the main cracking product is CH[.sup]4[/] which will be carried out by the gas flow; as a result, the carbon content is comparatively low for the low-temperature reaction product. At high temperature, the cracking product is mainly H[.sup]2[/], therefore the free-carbon content in the product increases. Figure 3. Effect of Reaction Temperature on the C and H Mass Content in SiC Powder Figure 4 depicts the infrared spectra of products obtained at different temperatures. It shows that as the temperature increases, the transformation of the organic LPS to the inorganic SiC is gradually completed. At 450 cm[.sup]-1[/], there is a Si-O absorption peak. As the temperature increases, the peak becomes weaker. The existence of the Si-O bond is caused by the infusion of oxygen, one of the impurities in LPS. Figure 4. Infrared Spectra of LPS and Its Pyrolytic Products Obtained at Different Reaction Temperatures 3.2 Effects of Carrying-Gas Flow Rate When the reaction temperature is controlled at 1100�C and LPS flow rate at 0.025 g/min, at different argon flow rates, the ultrafine powders remain spherical. When the argon flow rates are 0.088 L/min, 0.24 L/min, and 0.535 L/min, the diameters of the ultrafine powder are 0.1 �m, 0.075 �m, and 0.04 �m, respectively. The SiC ultrafine-powder diameter decreases with an increase in the argon flow rate. The SiC ultrafine-powder growth is a kinetics phenomenon. After SiC ultrafine powder is formed, its growth depends on its length of stay in the furnace. The higher the carrying-gas flow rate, the shorter the SiC's stay in the furnace, consequently the finer the powder produced. 3.3 Effects of LPS Flow Rate When the furnace temperature is controlled at 1100�C and argon flow rate at 0.24 L/min, SiC ultrafine powders are prepared at different LPS flow rates. The results show that when the LPS flow rate is at 0.025, 0.065, or 0.160 g/min, all powders are spherical having a diameter 0.75 �m, which indicates that the LPS flow rate does not affect the size or the configuration of the SiC ultrafine powder. 3.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization, and Crystallization of SiC Ultrafine Powder As aforementioned, the SiC ultrafine powder prepared by this method contains free carbon and SiO[.sup]2[/], which as impurities produce unfavorable effects on the material; thus, decarbonization and deoxidization are needed. Besides, the prepared SiC ultrafine powder is amorphous, therefore, crystallization is also needed. To achieve the purpose of decarbonization and deoxidization and in the meantime crystallization, this process utilizes high-temperature (about 1500�C) reaction in which free carbon reduces SiO[.sup]2[/] and forms gaseous SiO and CO, which eventually evaporate. At the same time the crystallization is also completed. The XRD results (Figure 5) show that as the crystallization temperature increases, the SiC ultrafine powder gradually transforms from the amorphous state to the _b_-SiC crystalline state. When the reaction temperature reaches 1500�C, _b_-SiC is virtually completely crystallized, and no other phases are observed. Figure 4 shows that after crystallization for 2 hours at 1500�C, the infrared absorption peak at 450 cm[.sup]-1[/] in the SiC ultrafine-powder spectrum disappears, which indicates that the powder is deoxidized. The element analysis shows that the carbon content of decarbonized SiC drops from 39.54 percent to 30.15 percent, which is basically close to the theoretical carbon content (30 percent) of SiC. The fact that the color of the ultrafine powder changes from brownish to whitish also indicates that the powder is completely decarbonized. XRD Patterns of SiC Powder Treated at Different Temperatures 4. Conclusions (1) The LPS CVD technique can produce SiC ultrafine powder. The technique is feasible because of its low processing temperature, lack of corrosion, and simple procedures. (2) The carbon and hydrogen contents are mainly controlled by the reaction temperatures: the higher the reaction temperature, the higher the carbon content, and the lower the hydrogen content. The SiC ultrafine-powder size is controlled by the carrying-gas flow rate: the higher the flow rate, the smaller the particle size. (3) After the transformation from LPS, the SiC powder product is always carbon rich. After the decarbonization, deoxidization, and crystallization treatment, high-purity, uniform-sized and almost completely crystallized spherical _b_-SiC ultrafine powder can be obtained.
