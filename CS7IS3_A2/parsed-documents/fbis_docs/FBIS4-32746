"When the deal is finalized, Bulgaria's debt will be 47 percent less," the financial news paper PARI says. There was a scandal on meeting the foreign bank officials at the airport yesterday, the paper writes reporting that journalists were not allowed to speak to the bankers. In a year and a half after the government of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) was ousted, another $900 million have been added to Bulgaria's debt to the creditor banks as a result of the accrual of unpaid interest on it, the SDS paper DEMOKRATSIYA notes. According to DEMOKRATSIYA, the cabinet of SDS leader Filip Dimitrov was likely to achieve much better conditions for the debt deal. Several Russian banks abroad have not sent their offers for the debt deal, opting for a settlement of Bulgaria's indebtedness to them outside the London Club, OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK was told by Mr. Peter Tils, Executive Director of Deutsche Bank AG and chairman of the London Club Bank Advisory Committee. Deutsche Bank will act as an agent for the deal until the end of July. Experts of the Deutsche Bank central office in Frankfurt have warned that some years later, when it will have to make debt settlement payments of over $1,000 million, Bulgaria may find itself insolvent, ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME says. The finalization of the ideal is forthcoming and only time will show if it is good, DUMA writes citing Mr. Mileti Mladenov, vice governor of the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB). It is better to conclude the deal now, because the risk of not signing it is worse than its disadvantages, BNB Governor Todor Vulchev is cited as saying yesterday. Prof. Vulchev warned that if Bulgaria suspends the debt service payments, the creditor banks can deduct them from its assets abroad. All the political forces should support the deal, Prof. Vulchev told the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) at yesterday's [28 June] meeting which NOVINAR reports on. The fact that the electorate is in the dark about the debt deal should sober up the country's administrators, 24 CHASA notes commenting on the results of a poll conducted in Sofia. The debt has been accrued in secret (at the time of the totalitarian regime), but it cannot be paid off in the dark, the paper notes. Bulgarians should know they will have to suffer privation and they should know what for, 24 CHASA goes on to say. [passage omitted]
