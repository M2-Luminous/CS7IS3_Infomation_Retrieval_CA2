ATA reporter said that when Serbian authorities banned the Albanalogic Institute, they gave a decision to Mr. Qosja according to which he must be taken the passport and pay a 3,000 DM [German marks] fine. This is the biggest punishment for passing the border with Albania without exit visas. The punishment is applied by Yugoslavia since 1981 in order to stop any kind of communication between the Albanians who are separated by Albania-Kosova border which is under Serbian forces control. The Council for Human Rights Protection in Prishtina, the Albanian Intellectuals Forum, and the Albanalogic Institute appeal to the international community for stopping the repression on Albanians of Kosova and taking the passports from them.
