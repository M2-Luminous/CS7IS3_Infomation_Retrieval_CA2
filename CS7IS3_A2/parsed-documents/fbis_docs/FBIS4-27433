FBIS4-27433 "dreas106__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 30 May 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ's Kubo on Forming New Coalition With Hata SDPJ's Kubo on Forming New Coalition With Hata OW3005234594 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 May 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3005234594 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and party chairman Tomiichi Murayama held a joint news conference on the afternoon of 29 May following a meeting of the SDPJ Central Committee. During the news conference, Mr. Kubo made it clear the SDPJ was willing to consult Prime Minister Hata in advance about the framework of the next coalition government and the conditions for the SDPJ's participation if the Hata cabinet voluntarily resigned en masse in response to the SDPJ's demand. At the news conference, Mr. Kubo said: "The possibility cannot be ruled out that Prime Minister Hata will become prime minister of the third coalition government." He added: "I believe that if the Hata cabinet resigns en masse, it will be possible for the SDPJ to discuss with Prime Minister Hata in advance on the formation of the next coalition government. If the 1994 budget bill is passed in the House of Representatives, prospects would be opened for forming the next coalition government toward the end of the current Diet ordinary session." In this way, Mr. Kubo indicated that, depending on Prime Minister Hata's handling of the general resignation of his cabinet, the SDPJ would begin talks with him about the formation of the next coalition government shortly after the passage of the 1994 budget bill in the House of Representatives. The SDPJ has criticized Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] for the influence he wields on the coalition government. At the news conference, a reporter referred to the relationship between the SDPJ and the next coalition government and then asked Mr. Kubo: "Will Mr. Ozawa's resignation as representative secretary of Shinseito be a condition of SDPJ joining the next coalition government?" Kubo said: "I have no intention of speaking ill of an executive of another party. I will, however, speak of the decision-making process of the ruling coalition parties if I have to do so."
