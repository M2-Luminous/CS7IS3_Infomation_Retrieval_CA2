This followed a two-round ballot to replace the former speaker Stanislav Shushkevich who was fired earlier this week in a secret ballot in parliament. Grib, a professional lawyer, is head of the parliament's permanent commission for national security, defense and anti-crime struggle. Regarded as a supporter of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Grib favors deepening the integration with Russia and supports government plans to combat the country's current economic crisis. Grib's predecessor, Shushkevich, lost a no-confidence vote Wednesday after being criticized for "having not taken effective steps against corruption." But analysts said that the change was an inevitable outcome of the long-term disagreements within Belarussian parliament. They said that the charges against Shushkevich were just an excuse used to oust him because he advocates a market economy and supports neutrality in diplomacy. Shushkevich became the speaker of the Belarussian parliament after the "August 19" incident of 1991. But he didn't set up his own group in the parliament while in office and held different views from the Kebich-led majority group on major policies to be followed by Belarus as an independent state. The majority group believes that the former Soviet republic cannot maintain absolute neutrality under the present situation, and that instead, must cooperate with Russia in economic areas due to historical ties. Before Wednesday's sacking of Shushkevich, the parliament had made three attempts to vote him out of office. Last July, the parliament failed to oust the former speaker by just eight votes. He had opposed Belarus signing the collective security treaty of the CIS. In a bid to shake off this crisis of confidence in him, Shushkevich set about improving relations with the majority group in recent months. But Shushkevich's plans backfired. He not only failed to win more support but also lost even more of his backers. Observers pointed out that Belarus has returned again to a situation where the country is governed by only one political force. Prime Minister Kebich promised on Friday that his government will continue its reform efforts towards a market economy. However, he said, the reform policy will be revised fundamentally on the basis of careful consideration and that the country will not take the road of radical reform as was adopted by Russia.
