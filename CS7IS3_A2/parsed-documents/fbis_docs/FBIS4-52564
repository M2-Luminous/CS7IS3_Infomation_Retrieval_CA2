Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international politics at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book that the two countries concluded the secret deal during summit talks between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon in November 1969. According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In times of great emergency the United States Government will require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan." The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan, appreciating the United States Government's requirements in times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will meet these requirements without delay when such prior consultation takes place." As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. The U.S. had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa before the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon administration in 1972. Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would reject the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were prior consultations. A government source, when asked to comment on the secret accord mentioned in Wakaizumi's book, said he is not aware of "such facts." "No comment. We ignore (the report)," the source said.
