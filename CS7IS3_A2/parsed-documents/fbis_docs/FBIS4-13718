By extending patenting laws to the Third World it means that companies can control and market crop varieties in countries which may have donated the genetic material used to breed those varieties. Most of the raw materials for the high-yielding seed that is developed in the laboratories of Western companies comes from Third World fields but the irony of it all is that farmers who have received no reward for parting with the raw material that makes manipulation of genes possible, may be asked to pay royalties for their use. The UN International Trade Commission has estimated that U.S. companies, in all sectors, stand to gain USD 61 billion a year from developing countries in royalty payments -- if GATT's proposed patents regime is approved. At present, Indian law, for example, does not allow agricultural and medicinal products to be patented, but all this may soon have to change, if the GATT draft is approved by the Indian government. But, as multinational seed companies see farmer's rights to their own seeds as an obstacle to company marketing expansion, they fully expect that, under the GATT regulations, India will be forced to introduce such patents, or face retaliatory trade measures. But Indian farmers are seen to be fighting back, for they have been staging a number of dramatic protests against GATT's proposed patenting measures. In August, 1993, for example, 40,000 farmers carrying neem branches as the symbol of their collective indigenous knowledge, demonstrated in the Southern Indian state of Karnataka and, in October of the same year, they launched the Third World Farmers' Movement Against Transnational Corporations at a rally attended by over a million farmers. Northern environmentalists are giving all-out support to their struggle. W.R. Grace and Co., one of the largest U.S. chemical companies, and Cargill, which controls 60 percent of the world trade in cereals, are under attack by Indian farmers for the threat they represent to their livelihoods. Grace is accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of millions of Indian peasants by taking out U.S. patents on pesticide products derived from the neem tree which has been used in India for centuries for a range of medicinal and agricultural purposes. Cargill is setting up a hybrid seed-processing complex in Karnataka, and has been singled out as one company which would flood the Indian market. Third World farmers' groups argue that such a monopoly system of patents, combined with open access to markets, would only be of benefit to large corporate concerns and, in return, the Third World will get nothing for the knowledge which led to the development of patented products. Indian farmers are, therefore, protesting this and are proposing, instead, collective patents as an alternative form of intellectual property rights which would reward communities for their traditional knowledge of the uses of plants and animals. With the recent instruction to grow neem trees in Bangladesh, a tree which has always been native to this part of the world, it would be more than a pity should people find that, after planting the trees, they discover their produce has already been patented by multi-national companies based in foreign countries and, as their intellectual property, we shall also have to pay royalties for their use.
