The ambassador gave a detailed account of the results of the meeting between the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents in Moscow and the contents of the declaration they signed. It was emphasized that the accords, reached as the result of the meeting, on providing Ukraine with security guarantees, as well as financial and technological assistance for eliminating nuclear weapons and compensation for uranium contained in nuclear warheads were creating the necessary conditions for gradual elimination of the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian soil and for Ukraine to attain nonnuclear status. It said that the accords, to a considerable degree, were resolving the problems that caused the Ukrainian Supreme Council to have reservations about ratifying the START I treaty and the Lisbon protocol. The hope was expressed that, as a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council, China would play an active part in settling the issue of nuclear disarmament in Ukraine and, in particular, of providing Ukraine with security guarantees and financial assistance in order to eliminate the nuclear weapons deployed on its territory.
