With the advent of the reform and open policies some 15 years ago the local farmers turned to industry and the service sector. Most of the farmers become industrial workers, service attendants or managers. Their average per capita income multiplied. In the past ten years the township economy has developed rapidly in Shandong. The towns are now mostly equipped with water, electricity and program-controlled telecommunications as well as with department stores, schools and post offices. Last year Shandong's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 696 billion yuan, a great increase over the previous year. The gross domestic product (GDP) was 270.09 billion yuan, 4.3 times the figure for 1980. The provincial government is developing small towns to absorb the surplus labor from the countryside. It is planned to transfer 10 million rural laborers from agriculture to the industrial and service sectors within six years. In the construction of small towns the local government takes into account of their locations, natural resources and economic foundations, in order to build each town into a regional center for politics, economy, culture and communications.
