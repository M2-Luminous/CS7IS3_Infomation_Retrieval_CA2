FR940721-2-00115 FR940721-2-00065 Between 1957 and 1981, several State representatives expressed concern to the Commission over the risk from burials of radioactive waste allowed by 10 CFR 20.304, that was in effect at that time. This regulation, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation; Burial of Small Quantities of Radionuclides'' provided that licensees could bury small quantities of radionuclides without prior NRC approval. The State of Florida submitted a request to the NRC to be more stringent by precluding this practice within the State because of its high ground water level. The State's exemption request was reviewed and approved by the NRC. 2. Shallow Land Burial Several States prohibit the practice of shallow land burial of low-level waste. These more stringent regulations would be allowed under the draft policy statement even though a practice is prohibited. There is no overriding national interest in allowing shallow land burial of low-level waste. A different result would likely be obtained if disposal of low-level waste altogether was prohibited, unless the State was able to convince NRC of special public health and safety or environmental basis for this action. 3. Texas Industrial Radiography Certification Texas has established a program for the certification of industrial radiography that is more rigorous than Commission requirements. This program requires persons to perform 200 hours of on-the-job training, complete 40 hours of classroom instruction and successfully complete an examination before receiving authorization to conduct radiographic services with radioactive materials. (This example is based on the assumption that the training requirements in 10 CFR 34 do not meet any of the four compatible criteria.) IV. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This draft statement of policy does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (434 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0029. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of July, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John C. Hoyle, Acting Secretary of the Commission. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17728 Filed 7&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;P
