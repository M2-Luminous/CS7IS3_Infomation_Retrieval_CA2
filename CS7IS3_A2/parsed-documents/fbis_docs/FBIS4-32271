Fifty-four executives from some of Canada's largest corporations studied business opportunities here, while 22 of their Czech counterparts learned about exporting opportunities to Canada during the week of May 9-13. "We've seen some good opportunities here," said David Lambe, head of the consulting firm David Lambe & Associates, based in Ottawa, Ontario. Lambe is a member of the University of Ottawa's first Executive MBA graduating class. During the intensive program, executives from the private and public sectors work at their regular jobs and commit an additional 30 to 55 hours per week attending classes and studying. The two-year program, which focuses on strategic and multinational management skills, culminated this year in a trip to the Czech Republic. For their final school project, small working teams put together Czech market entry strategies for Canadian firms. In cooperation with the Canadian system-integration company SHL Systemhouse, Lambe's six-member team met with local communications experts and analyzed potential business opportunities here. In a detailed 35-page report, the group concluded the company should enter into a joint-venture agreement with a local Czech partner. After returning to Canada, the team will meet with SHL's senior management and present their findings. "We believe there is an opportunity for SHL Systemhouse to make some impact in the integrated technology sector here," said Paul Murphy, a senior manager with the Ottawa-based Bell-Northern Research Ltd. Another MBA exec team looked at the potential Czech market for the atomic energy company AECL-Candu. The four-member team visited AECL's nuclear reactor construction project in Romania and held high-level meetings with officials at the Czech state energy company CEZ. "We're not hidden away in a classroom in downtown Ottawa," said Gerard Lewis, senior marketing advisor at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec. Lewis' team considered how Canada Post could improve its distribution and marketing system in comparison to the Czech postal service. "The course is a bridging of academic models with business practices. It's a chance to take those 10 to 15 years of business experience and put a new framework around it and then take it back out into the business community." While the executives considered how Canadian firms might muscle into the Czech marketplace, the Trade Facilitation Office of Canada (TFOC) conducted a seminar for Czech entrepreneurs keen on exporting their wares to Canada. The three-day seminar in Prague was the first of its kind in Eastern and Central Europe, said David Taylor, TFOC European program director and former commercial counsellor for the Canadian Embassy in Czechoslovakia. "We decided to try it here first because we knew the Czech Republic had a strong industrial base," Taylor said. Representatives from Czech companies as diverse as cheese producer Mika and forklift manufacturer Desta learned the intricacies of Canadian tariff and trade laws, distribution channels and risk management. Canadians are sure to buy Becherovka, the popular Czech herbal liqueur, if it is available at their local liquor store, said Jaroslav Pokora, seminar participant and sales manager at SVP, a Prague-based distribution company. The company distributes the famous spirit in Slovakia, Hungary and Italy. As a result of the seminar, Pokora is planning a future trip to Canada to find an export partner. "When Canadian tourists visit the Czech Republic, they buy lots of Becherovka and take it home with them," Pokora said. "I'm persuaded that Canadians will like it. They know Czech crystal and they know Becherovka."
