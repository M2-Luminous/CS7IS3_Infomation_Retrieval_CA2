If a national referendum on EU membership were to be organized now, 38 percent of all Finns would vote for membership and 41 percent against membership. Last April the configuration was the other way round: Forty-three percent would have voted for and 40 percent against it. The same polling institute conducted the interviews for the Eurobarometer and the HS [HELSINGIN SANOMAT]-Gallup poll, and the number of persons interviewed was almost the same, but the questions differed from one another. The gap between supporters and opponents is so small in both polls that in reality their number may be the same, about 40 percent. On the basis of all the polls, however, the change in support for membership in the EU is unmistakable: Within a year and a half support for it has dropped by 20 percentage points. Eurobarometer polls have been conducted in Finland since the spring of 1992. The Economic Commission, the Economic Information Office, and the Foreign Ministry pay for Finland's Eurobarometer. The same poll is conducted with the same questions twice a year in the EU member countries, commissioned by the European Commission. The November interviews were conducted between 11 and 26 November in Finland. The number of people interviewed was 995. The sampling represents the population of Finland 15 years of age or older. The designation European Community (EC) was still used for the European Union in the questions. When the different countries' polls are compared, it becomes evident that the way Finns feel about European integration and more extensive cooperation with the EU is similar to the way the English and the Danes feel: on average more critical and more negative. They have not yet had time to summarize the results in Sweden and Norway. On the basis of an opinion poll published in Stockholm on Thursday, Swedes clearly feel more negative than Finns about their country's membership in the EU. Twenty-six percent now support it in Sweden and nearly 45 percent oppose it.
