FR941202-0-00156 FR941202-0-00014 RSPA Response. RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. The Common Preamble clearly provides that ``[e]mployers are free to combine supervisor training for alcohol misuse detection with the comparable training for drug use detection currently required by the OA drug testing rules for a total of two hours to minimize costs and inconvenience.'' (59 FR 7334). The Petitioners did not provide any justification for reducing the supervisory training to a total of one hour for both drugs and alcohol, other than to suggest that ``much of the information *␣*␣* will overlap.'' (Jt. Pet. at 11). Although some of the symptoms of drug and alcohol use may be similar, the symptoms vary widely depending on the type and quantity of the substance ingested. Many commenters recommended that additional supervisory training on alcohol misuse (more than one hour) be required, and many employers voluntarily offer recurrent or follow-up training to ensure that supervisors have sufficient awareness of the indicators of alcohol and drug use. Therefore, RSPA is retaining the requirement that operators must provide a minimum of one hour of supervisory training for drug use and one hour for alcohol misuse, which may be combined into a single two-hour training period. Accordingly, no change to the rule is necessary. 6. RSPA Should Clarify Its Position on Follow-Up Tests for Alcohol and Drugs The Petitioners state that the RSPA regulations in 49 CFR 199.225(d)(1) require follow-up alcohol tests in certain situations, but do not address whether it is appropriate for a substance abuse professional (SAP) also to require follow-up drug tests, when an individual also shows signs of drug abuse. The Petitioners point out that the Common Preamble, however, indicates that the rules will permit an employer to conduct follow-up drug tests, if the SAP suspects drug involvement. The Petitioners request that RSPA clarify that the authority in the Common Preamble also extends to RSPA operators. RSPA Response. RSPA is granting the Petitioners' request to clarify this issue. Section 199.225(d)(1) provides that follow-up testing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of §199.243(b)(2)(ii). This reference is in error, and should be to §199.243(c)(2)(ii), which provides that follow-up testing may include testing for drugs, as directed by the SAP, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. RSPA is amending §199.225(d)(1) to include the correct reference. 7. RSPA Should Clarify That Companies Are Not Responsible for Ensuring Contractor Compliance With the Final Rule The Petitioners contend that operators should not be responsible for ensuring that contractors comply with the alcohol misuse program. (Jt. Pet. at 11). The Petitioners contend that the monitoring responsibility for contractor employees is highly impracticable and difficult to achieve, particularly for small operators who rely on many contractors, and may enter into contracts at short notice. The Petitioners assert that there are practical problems in monitoring transient workers, or in knowing which particular contract employees will perform certain jobs. The Petitioners state that contractors ``are used predominantly for construction, and almost never for operations. Therefore, it is difficult to envision circumstances where post-accident testing would be required for contractors.'' (Jt. Pet. at 12). The Petitioners assert that ``for cause'' testing is also unnecessary, because currently when an operator suspects a contractor employee is alcohol-impaired, the contractor is ordered to remove the employee. The Petitioners therefore contend that requiring operators to oversee or manage a detailed alcohol compliance program for contractors is an inefficient use of resources and an unnecessary burden, given that the only testing that is likely to be carried out is ``for cause'' testing, which is already handled adequately by operator/contractor agreements. RSPA Response. RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. RSPA's longstanding and oft-stated position on this issue is that a pipeline operator who chooses to perform safety-sensitive functions by using contractors is held responsible for compliance with the Pipeline Safety Regulations just as if the operator's own employees were performing the work (54 FR 51747, December 18, 1989; 57 FR 59714, December 15, 1992). The proper performance of a safety-sensitive function should not be dependent on the individual's direct or indirect employment relationship with the operator. Furthermore, the alcohol rules are limited to persons performing covered functions, i.e., operation, maintenance, and emergency response functions that are regulated by 49 CFR parts 192, 193, or 195 and performed on a pipeline or liquefied natural gas facility. Covered functions do not include clerical, truck driving, accounting, or other functions not covered by parts 192, 193, or 195 (49 CFR 199.205).
