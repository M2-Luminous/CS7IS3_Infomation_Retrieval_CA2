Section 1249.2 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(4), and (c) (including Note A) and by adding a new paragraph (b)(5) to read as follows: ยง1249.2 Classification of carriers-motor carriers of property, household goods carriers, and dual property carriers. (a) Common and contract motor carriers of property subject to the Interstate Commerce Act are grouped into the following three classes: Class I. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of $10 million or more after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. Class I. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of at least $3 million but less than $10 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. Class III. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of less than $3 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues (excluding revenues from private carriage, compensated intercorporate hauling, and leasing vehicles with drivers to private carriers) after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. Upward and downward classification will be effected as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification. * * * * * (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in classification and any change in annual operating revenues that causes them to exceed the class I limit by writing to the Office of Economics, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual or extraordinary extenuating circumstances, where the classification process will unduly burden the carrier, such as partial liquidation, or curtailment or elimination of contracted services, the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver or an exception from these regulations. This request shall be in writing, specifying the conditions justifying the waiver or exception. The Commission shall notify the carriers of any change in classification. (5) Carriers not required to file an Annual Report (Form M&hyph;1 or Form M&hyph;2) may be required to file the Annual Carrier Classification Survey Form. All carriers will be notified of any classification changes. (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used to adjust gross annual operating revenues. This index number (deflator) shall be based on the Producers Price Index of Finished Goods. Its intended use is to eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification process. See Note A that follows: Note A: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing those revenues with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The formula to be applied is as follows: E:GRAPHICSER03FE94.012 [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2430 Filed 2&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
