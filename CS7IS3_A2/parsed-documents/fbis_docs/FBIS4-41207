[Correspondent] The visit was agreed upon last spring in the United States, when the visiting Georgian head of state met Defense Secretary William Perry. The Pentagon delegation has already met the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry. The delegation was briefed on the process of army construction in Georgia and the problems being encountered. Today, the guests were received by Eduard Shevardnadze. He told them that the cooperation agreement signed last spring is already working and that this visit by military experts is a testimony to that. Today, when the Georgian Army is still in the early days of its development, learning from the Pentagon's experience would be a priceless opportunity for us. Discussing Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, which our republic was among the first in the CIS to join, Eduard Shevardnadze said that the introduction of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia would signal the beginning of a new stage in settling the conflict there. At the end of the meeting, Brig. Gen. Baumann said that the delegation came to Georgia on the instructions of Defense Secretary Perry. We arrived here to meet officials from the Georgian Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs and members of Parliament, said the general. We would like to discuss venues for cooperation and to determine our common interests. Answering a question about his vision for cooperation, the general said: First of all, we should study issues relating to the training of the Georgian Army. It would be interesting to learn how Georgia intends to develop its Army. We would like to share with you our experience in this sphere. The meeting was attended by Defense Minister Varden Nadibaidze; U.S. Ambassador Kent Brown; Petre Chkheidze, Georgian ambassador to the United States; and officials from the office of the head of state.
