To this day, he is moving without any restrictions in the highest military circles, and his former subordinates receive him loyally and cordially, with all honors. Whenever he visits an Army unit, he is met by the commander's adjutant and must sign the visitors' book, as though he were an officer in uniform. (This official duty and regulation does not apply to the civilian Vacek.) Of course, the minister of defense cannot be everywhere. He should, however, make sure that key posts are held by people who recognize the basic military virtue--discipline--and who understand their service as one to their country and not to the former minister. Will it be the prime minister again who will himself have to set right all the potential Milovice and Ralsko affairs [sites of former Soviet military bases, the privatization of which had been sought by high-ranking officers of the former communist-controlled Czechoslovak Army]? Although 82 financial desks (offices) have been established in the armed forces at a cost of some 200 million korunas, the financial officers of individual units have self-evidently retained their previous positions. The situation is reminiscent of that of the Culture Ministry's Theater Department, which, although it in practice no longer takes care of any theaters, employs the same (and, according to some reports, an even greater) number of people as it did in November 1989. "We Do Not Have Other Experts" Minister Baudys (we would like to take his side, were it not that so many results of the Army's transformation testify against him) keeps saying that "we do not have any other experts." Leaving aside the experts who have built for Baudys a laser firing range directly in his office, the chief occupation of the "Ministry of Defense and General Staff experts" is how to create jobs for their fellow warriors from the era of struggle against the imperialist threat, who would otherwise face redundancy. Whereas in the Armies of the United States, Great Britain, and even Sweden staff numbers in logistics are being cut as a result of computerization, in our country they are growing. Is the minister too busy? And what about the much-touted operation against the number of drones who worked as political officers and against the maladies of our military past in general? What Kind of Experts Do We Have? Colonel Josef Bagin, former chief of Military Counterintelligence, today works at the head office of the Military Police. Colonel Frantisek Dvorak, former chief of the Military Counterintelligence Inspection Office in Prague, is today chief of the Ministry of Defense Inspection Authority, which is also in charge of Military Defense Intelligence. He has built his military career on his friendship with Gen. Vacek, which constitutes, at the very least, the potential risk of information leaks. Colonel Josef Dvorak, former chief of Military Counterintelligence in Tabor, can be found serving in Mlada Boleslav today. General Klima, a participant in the Second Nationwide Congress of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (so much for nonparty members), is commander of the 2d Combined Aviation Corps in Hradec Kralove. Colonel Burda (today commander of the Combined Transport Regiment in Pardubice) acquired fame when he declared, as late as 1990, that "the lessons from the crisis-ridden development [a hardline communist document on lessons to be learned from the "Prague Spring" of 1968] are and will always remain valid" for him. Colonel Pavel Vesely, former chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Committee at the Brno Military Academy, who is a friend of [chief of General Staff] General Nekvasil, is today commander of the Prerov air base. Lieutenant Colonel Reznak, formerly political officer of military unit 1,562, has found a safe haven in military unit 1,999 in Pardubice. Experts With a Title Before and After the Name Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Korinek, candidate of sciences, involved as a functionary in "Operation Wave" [planned by the communist regime to crack down on its critics], serves with a high rank at the Higher Military School of Ground Forces in Vyskov, where he is educating future experts. Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Blaha, another functionary involved in "Operation Wave," heads the Department for Pedagogical Science at the Brno Military Academy. From other officers involved in "Operation Wave," we will also find there Lieutenant Docent F. Vizdal, Ph.D. and candidate of sciences. Colonel Docent Zdenek Rozum, Ph.D., candidate of sciences, formerly a staffer at the Evening University of Marxism-Leninism, is now deputy departmental head at the Brno Military Academy. [passage omitted] On the other hand, officers who refused to sign a resolution in support of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in November 1989, who were never members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, who did not abet former political officers, and who have helped shed light on the Army's involvement in Operations "Wave" and "Intervention" [another operation against critics of the regime planned during the latter stages of the communist regime], are being harassed and liquidated "in the spirit" of the minister's Order 023 about interviews and ways of dealing with personnel issues. For example, Captain Kjucukov, from the Third Communications Battalion in Breclav, who helped a Ministry of Defense commission of inquiry decode General Petr's coded message number 4A, became victim to permanent harassment in service and, under psychological pressure from the commander of the engineering battalion, left for civilian life on 31 January 1994. What Did Gen. Nekvasil Have To Say? All the names cited above are from a letter that a group of officers from Olomouc addressed to the Defense and Security Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this January. How did Gen. Nekvasil, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Army, react? On 1 March 1994 (speaking apparently on behalf of all officers who, like himself, underwent their military training and education toward subservience in the USSR), he declared: It is necessary to put an end to the inflammatory voices from Olomouc, which disrupt the working climate and lecture the General Staff on what to do in the Army. What can one add to this? A group of officers from Olomouc had turned to their constitutional officials, which is, and should be, their right, guaranteed by the Constitution. No One Takes Any Interest in the Contents of the Complaint The solution resembles those that the Ministry of the Interior used to apply [in the 1950's], when some prisoner managed to smuggle out from a forced labor camp a letter with a complaint. The investigation, and, of course, the subsequent punishment concerned as a matter of principle the "illegal sending," while the contents of the complaint went unheeded. The senders of the Olomouc letter are in for similar treatment today. The gray pigeons raised their eyebrows and told themselves that the buoyant heads who had written to the Defense and Security Affairs Committee must be cut down to size [sentence as published, apparently a literary allusion]. We do not have anything against members of the Defense and Security Affairs Committee, and we believe that its members are decent, educated people. Nonetheless, similar practices disrupt the trust of the citizens (and not only those who are conscripted) in their freely elected representatives. If a citizen is made to feel again and again that there is no right and no justice, the result is a devastating percentage of people who have no confidence in parliament. Naturally, this also means no confidence in the parliamentary system as such. Free criticism and control represent the foundations of democracy, as those who read [philosopher and first Czechoslovak President] T.G. Masaryk know. In U.S. Army barracks, you will find posters with the text: Blow the Whistle! [last three words published in English] What it means is: Blow the whistle and let it be known when you witness something in your service that you genuinely dislike. The text is usually followed by a list of all the things that give you the right to blow the whistle. If some blowing of the whistle (for example, a letter to a congressman) were to be followed by harassment, those guilty of it would get into very serious trouble. It may be possible that even competent and decent people could be found among the experts who graduated from Soviet military schools and who were members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. But how realistic is it to expect competence and decency from them, after the experience of the past 50 years?
