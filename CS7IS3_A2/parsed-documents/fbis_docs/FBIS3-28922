Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference Japan will do what it should do, whether or not there are any agreements with the United States. He said Japan will notify the U.S. Government and other countries once it makes specific decisions and that the Japanese Government will consider specific measures after consulting with relative ministries and agencies. He pointed out that Japan has already hammered out an action program and it will take measures in line with that. Describing the summit talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton as "meaningful" in that they were able to discuss items of common interest, Saito said it was regrettable that the two countries failed to reach an accord in the microeconomic field of the trade framework talks. But he said it was impossible for Japan to accept U.S. demands in the framework talks since Washington did not change its stance of urging the introduction of numerical targets to measure foreign access to Japan's markets. Japan is opposed to the setting of numerical targets claiming it would lead to managed trade. The two governments were expected to draw up a progress report on the framework negotiations by Friday when Hosokawa and Clinton met in Washington. But they remained at loggerheads over the interpretation of the application of "objective criteria."
