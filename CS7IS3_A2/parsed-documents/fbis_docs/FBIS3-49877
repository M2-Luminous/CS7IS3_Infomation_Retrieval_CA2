For the third day running Tuesday aid convoys headed from the Adriatic to central Bosnia had to be called off because roads were blocked by demonstrating civilians in Moslem-held areas, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said here. On Monday, some 300 people held up a food convoy between Zenica and Kakanj, central Bosnia, and police had to fire into the air to disperse them, he said. Last week, three UNHCR convoys were attacked in Moslem-held areas, notably between Gornji Vakuf and Novi Travnik, and a British armoured vehicle had to fire into the air to disperse civilians, the spokesman also said. UNHCR representatives suggested civilians were angry at the way food was distributed by the Bosnian authorities. [passage omitted]
