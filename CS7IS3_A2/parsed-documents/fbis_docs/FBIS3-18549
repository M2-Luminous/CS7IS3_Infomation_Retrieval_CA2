On the contrary, it decided to continue mediation efforts of EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek. That means the EU Commission yesterday decided to act strictly within a political framework against Greece, and allow time to search for a formula that will allow the dialogue between Athens and Skopje to resume. The EU Commission put aside, for the time being, the "penalties" and Greece's recourse to the European Court, thus greatly displeasing all those EU partners who are annoyingly in a hurry, pushy and openly pro-Skopje and who were certain that it would issue a condemnation against Greece. With yesterday's move, the European Union clearly indicated two specific things: - It had great difficulty in reaching a heavily condemnatory decision against a member state that also holds the presidency of the Union. Such a development would have been a severe blow to the European Union itself, something which EU Commission President Jacques Delors, as champion of the "European family," wants to avoid at all costs. - It was very unwilling to see the issue of Skopje move outside the EU's influence, something which could happen if the Commission's mediation effort and the issue of Skopje were to pass exclusively into Washington's hands and those of UN's American mediator Cyrus Vance. Yesterday's development gives Athens a brief respite and [adds] a note of optimism for the future of the issue of Skopje, following the overall international negative reaction to Greece's measures. Moreover, in reviewing the overall negative and/or offensive reaction, because actually there is some of that too, Athens has the assurance that its measures are now a part of the new reality and, as such, are receiving relevant consideration by all.
