Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, age 51, a Christian Democrat, was elected as head of the Chilean Republic on 11 December 1993, and will take office on 11 March. He is a civil engineer, and has worked for 20 years in private companies. Frei is linked to Italy through his study and work experience, having lived in Milan between 1967 and 1969. He worked on the construction of the "Autostrada dei Fiori" freeway and then at ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] under a study grant. Frei represents, compared with outgoing President Aylwin, a change of generation in politics in Chile, a country which has returned to democracy, but over which the shadow of former dictator Pinochet still hangs. [Bussi] President Frei, what are the main points of your government plan to broaden and strengthen Chilean democracy? [Frei] In recent years Chile has successfully laid the foundations for making growth and economic development compatible with a framework of justice and equity. It is said that developing countries first of all have to put their own economies in order and then concern themselves with their poor and marginalized populations. Thanks to the efforts that we have made in recent years, it is now possible to combat marginalization and extreme poverty without prejudicing economic development. One priority of my program is eliminating the poverty which today affects some 10 percent of the population. I believe that the country is in a position to do this. This means building a democracy on the bases of participation and solidarity, with particular emphasis on areas such as education, health, housing, and the environment. It also requires modernizing the state, and transferring power progressively to civilian society, a process which is identified with decentralization and regionalization. I would also like to ensure the integration of young people and women, offering them greater opportunities. For the first time, Chile has three women in government. [Bussi] How can one reconcile the private capitalism which has prevailed until now and the economics of solidarity which you are proposing? [Frei] In Chile, more than 75 percent of investment and production is carried out by the private sector. We have clearly stated that it is not the state's role to occupy the productive sector. The state's job, rather, is to concern itself with the good of the country. What is of concern to us is that public enterprises be efficient and productive. Obviously, unproductive companies will be privatized. [Bussi] President Frei, why ever did you appoint the Socialist German Correa to the head of a key ministry like that of the interior? [Frei] Chile's Government is a political coalition. It is the broadest alliance ever in our political history. It is this coalition which has allowed us to have a durable government, able to guarantee continuity to economic players. In this team there are the more important parties like the Socialist Party (PS), the Party for Democracy (PPD), the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) -- the main party -- and the Radical Party (PR), and smaller parties like the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the Center Alliance Party (PAC), and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). In a presidential system like ours, appointments are made by the president of the Republic, and I have always stated, starting in the electoral campaign, which selection criteria I would use for the appointments within my power: criteria of effectiveness and of respecting the political balances which the coalition represents, as is done in every democracy the world over. The Socialist Party merited a key post and German Correa offered all the human and professional qualities to make a good success of the job. [Bussi] Recently, the discovery of cases of corruption in the military government has created a scandal. Public companies were sold to members of government at prices which can today be said to be favorable. Court proceedings are still under way. What guarantees do you believe you can give in the case of new privatizations? [Frei] In Chile there is a tradition of probity in the public service. This is an historical constant and I insisted greatly in the election campaign on the fact that I wanted to give an important ethical-moral content to the management of the public administration. All the appointments which I will make and which I have made take this commitment into consideration. If a company is in future to be privatized, this will be done with total transparency, so that the country knows how things are going. [Bussi] There are still some accounts to be settled with the past. What is the situation of the political prisoners whom you will find when you take up the presidency of the Republic? [Frei] At the time President Aylwin took office, there were 400 to 500 political detainees. Today no more than 20. For me the problem is obviously much simpler. And I will face it. [Bussi] The problem of internal security appears to be taking an increasingly important central place in political debate? Is a reform of the police forces planned? [Frei] Chile's police is made up of the "Carabineros" and the "Investigaciones," which report to the minister of defense. I am considering changing this situation, and the extent to which responsibility for public order can be attributed to the Ministry of the Interior and he be given authority to govern the police forces. This residue of our past military regime ought also to disappear. [Bussi] During the dictatorship, many Chileans went into exile. Are you thinking of giving incentives for the return of those who left for political or economic reasons and to reintegrate them into the workforce? [Frei] During President Aylwin's government various laws, such as the "Return Law," were passed with a view to reintegrating persons abroad, along with a series of legislative provisions and facilities for their reintegration. But the true disaster for so many Chilean citizens who escaped abroad is economic growth, the development of a solid democratic system, and new jobs.
