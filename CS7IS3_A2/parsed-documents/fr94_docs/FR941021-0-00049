FR941021-0-00049 FR941021-0-00006 Under the proposed regulations, when payments are made on the basis of a daily pay period, the exempt amount is calculated on the basis of 360 days. The final regulations provide that the exempt amount is calculated on the basis of 260 days, the number of work days in a year (assuming a five day work week and 52 work weeks in a year). This change increases the exempt amount available to a taxpayer who works on a daily pay-period basis. The Service and Treasury believe that this change is consistent with the requirement of section 6334(d)(3) of the Code. Effective Date These regulations are effective for levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these final regulations is Jerome D. Sekula, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (General Litigation), IRS. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in their development.
