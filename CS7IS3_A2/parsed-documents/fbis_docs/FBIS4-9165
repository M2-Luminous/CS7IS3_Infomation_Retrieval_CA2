And that is not because the coalition is left-wing but, rather, because it is strong. I do not agree with the atmosphere of relief and the sense of success associated with the agreement between the coalition and the president, and with the alleged overcoming of the crisis. The conflict will return, and its impact will be double what it has been up to now, creating a danger for the principles of the state's functioning. The president gave us another portion of his political ideas and intentions, which are quite disturbing. The contents of this wave of conflicting ideas and incoherent statements are harmful and insulting, given that they were voiced by the head of state. What did Lech Walesa offer us? First, that he will adopt a constitution outside of parliament (even though this is nonsense), that he will personally dissolve parliament, and that he will undertake measures that are outside the law. Lech Walesa has made a decision that possible amendments to the Small Constitution amount to attempts to bring down the political regime, and everyone is supposed to hold his breath. Walesa wants to build some mystical force that will destroy the current arrangement, and he also thinks that people who say he destabilizes the state should be brought to justice. In a normal country, such views would mean the end of a political career. Public opinion would completely destroy such a politician. Well, I am going to take a chance and say this: Lech Walesa, not just over the past several weeks but throughout the majority of his term of office, has not only been destabilizing the state but has also been trying to blow it up. Under the pretext of maintaining some abstract kind of balance, he destructs every arrangement that is not to his liking, while ignoring the disastrous, long-term effects of his policies for Poland. He incites and initiates conflicts among parties and different groups that have managed to gain even the slightest balance. He demoralizes part of society by coming up with unrealistic ideas and promises, and he sets in motion some forces that he is not capable of controlling later on. All of this is done with just one purpose in mind: to gain and maintain for himself the widest possible powers not subject to anybody's control (the president makes the impression that only he, perhaps with the aid of the Holiest Virgin, is capable of ruling the country). It is only a question of time before a very major conflict between the coalition and the president will take place, and it is not because the coalition is left-wing. Even if it were right-wing or centrist, the situation would be the same. The reason the conflict will occur is because of the strength of the coalition, which not only can implement its policies without the president's permission and without his ideas but is also a direct threat to Walesa because it may come up with its own, strong candidate for the next president, and, in this way, it can take away from Walesa what he has been taking for granted up to now--that he will rule Poland for another five years. The coalition, by making threats to implement changes in the Small Constitution, is trying to limit the president's powers because, in reality, these powers paralyze the state's functioning. It is not an attempt to change the political system because the system itself has not been defined. In reality, the Small Constitution is a compromise solution--some say it is a rotten compromise, which the president imposed on the previous weak parliament and weak government in order to widen his powers. The Constitution is a provisional document that regulates the system until a regular constitution is adopted through the usual procedure. The Constitution is not a dogma. One can make amendments through lawful procedures in such a provisional document. Walesa himself thinks the Small Constitution is imperfect, and he wants to amend it, but the only direction of changes he wants is to widen his own powers and, in effect, to establish a purely presidential system that he would like. In that sense, we should be grateful to President Walesa for having himself led to a loss of face by a system he wants to introduce. I also think President Walesa has been demonstrating some very disturbing states of mind. He is convinced about his mission and about not making any mistakes. It is not hard to believe the latter because sometimes he pronounces completely contradictory views or forecasts on a given day, and one of them is bound to come true in the end. Walesa sometimes comes through as a mixture of Nikodem Dyzma and the gardener from Kosinski's novel Wystarczy Byc [Being There]. Many people will be bitter over such a statement, and for many reasons. He is such a terrible disappointment to all of us. Many of us voted for the man. "Historically speaking," Walesa deserved that. But was there an alternative? Did the majority of Walesa's voters not think that that they were choosing the lesser evil? In his good times, Walesa was famous for his sayings. In one of them, he compared people he was getting rid of to horses one selects, depending on the task. He would say: "You are a race horse and you are good, but right now we need draught horses," or "Right now we are crossing the great water, and we are looking for horses that can swim well and not those that jump over hedges and obstacles." Lech Walesa used to be good and he used to win. But we have a different type of race now. The style of executing the presidency by Lech Walesa has exhausted itself, and he should resign--whether at the end of the term or before is up to him. By leaving on his own, he will spare us the view of a fall and probably also of humiliation.
