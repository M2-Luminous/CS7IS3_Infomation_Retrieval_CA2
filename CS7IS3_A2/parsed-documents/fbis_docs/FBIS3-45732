While introducing any reform measure, we will fully take into account the bearing capacity of the state and the people and ensure that economic development and social stability will be promoted through reform. Rong Yiren gave an account of China's reform and opening up while meeting today with a Romanian Government delegation led by Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for Economy, Coordination, Strategy, and Reforms of Romania. Rong stated that development is the target while reform is the motive force and political and social stability serve as the guarantee. We hope to seek development through reform. When the economy has developed, the people's living standards will improve and political and social stability will be maintained, which in turn will promote reform. This is the experience China has gained through reform over the past decade or so. Another important factor of China's economic development over the past decade is opening up, Rong explained. In a large country like China, we must rely on our own efforts. We cannot rely on foreign countries for food and clothing. Nevertheless, we must implement an open policy and develop economic exchanges with other countries, which will be conducive to China's economic development. Sharing the same objective of China's, Cosea said, Romania is also undergoing economic development. Romania wants to develop economic exchanges and cooperation with China and hopes that China will offer assistance and support for its reform. Cosea and his entourage came to China at the invitation of China's State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. They will leave for Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai tomorrow to observe and explore the achievements and experience of China's reform and opening up.
