But this is not true. The explanation is simple -- two years ago, large organizations, such as the Communist Party of Belarus, the Slavic Assembly "White Russia," the Foundation of the Servicemen's Social Protection, and some others, decided to merge. As was reported at the time, the purpose of that move was to coordinate efforts intended to consolidate society. That unification went practically unnoticed for its opponents, who were then reveling in their victories in the battle for "restoration" [previous word in Belarusian]. The title "Belarusian Popular Movement" was certainly selected as an opposition to the Popular Front, which monopolized the right to speak on behalf of the people. Soon, other organizations joined the NDB. The movement gained in strength, while the Popular Front clearly disintegrated, letting go an increasing number of "factions" that joined small parties. The Popular Front's fate also befell other so called democratic organizations -- the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Christian Democratic Association, DDRB [Movement for Democratic Reforms in Belarus] -- debilitated as a result of internal strife. At present, the NDB is undoubtedly the largest and most influential political bloc. Our correspondent met with its leader, Sergey Gaydukevich. [Gukovskiy] Behind the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich, many see the efforts of the NDB... [Gaydukevich] This is not exactly true. There were a lot more votes against the legislative speaker than the NDB actually had (three factions -- "union," communists, and veterans). At the same time, I am not going to diminish the role of our organization, which consistently spoke for Shushkevich's resignation. [Gukovskiy] What was it that you did not like about him? [Gaydukevich] He made no resolute decisions over the past half a year. I would not like to speak about him as a person. However, as a politician, he proved very weak, dependent, and hesitant. He has not managed to establish his position on many issues -- the collective security treaty, economic integration with Russia, the ruble zone, or any other key issues. His haphazard policies led the parliament's operations to a deadlock. His continued service in office would have exacerbated the situation, creating more animosity among factions, groupings, etc. [passage omitted] [Gukovskiy] You accuse the former legislative speaker of seeking an illusory accord, vague directions, unclear positions. However, the present head of the legislature, right after his election to the post, declared that the previous course of Belarus will be continued and that he would seek support without giving preference to any grouping. [Gaydukevich] Nevertheless, the difference between Shushkevich and Hryb is profound. The latter has clearly and unequivocally stated that he is for close relations with Russia -- Shushkevich just timidly mentioned the need to maintain links with it -- for the ruble zone, expanding economic ties, the collective security treaty. He said that he supported the course of the Belarusian Government. In other words, the man determined his position and spoke out on it immediately after his election. In all his time as legislative speaker, Shushkevich never did anything like that. Nobody could understand him. At times, he declared that he is a strong supporter of close ties with Russia, and at other times, in an interview or during a conversation with some oppositionist, he would make assurances that he is a staunch advocate of Belarusian independence. When the collective security issue was debated, Stanislav Shushkevich gave plenty of interviews that did not help, however, to flesh out his true opinions. It was not by coincidence that even part of the opposition voted against him. Toward the end of his term, he lost support of not only the legislative majority but also that of the opposition. The most regrettable thing is that the people did not get a chance to know what kind of Belarus Shushkevich wanted to see. Like Gorbachev, Shushkevich attempted to sit on several chairs at a time. A seasoned card player, he wanted to play with everyone. But every game is played by its own rules and a clearly specified number of players. If Shushkevich had had political convictions, he would have certainly found allies in parliament. It takes some talent to find no support in a legislature swarming with numerous factions! [Gukovskiy] Do you think Shushkevich will return to big politics, as is predicted by many political observers, including Russian ones? [Gaydukevich] Never. That is the "Gorbachev-2" case. There were many predictions after the resignation of the first, and the last, Soviet president. Unfortunately, you will get nowhere in politics without a clear program and position. [Gukovskiy] The NDB, the largest legislative grouping, did not propose him as a candidate for president. Why? It was your best chance to come to power, which the Marxists said is the chief purpose of political struggle. [Gaydukevich] We had our candidates, but they declined their nominations. As for the struggle for power, we remain faithful to the fundamental idea of our movement -- consolidation. We were aware of the fact that a speaker from the NDB would have triggered a real explosion, which would be very divisive and distracting for the parliament. After discussing Hryb's candidacy, we came to a conclusion: This is the man who in this situation suits everyone. He does not want confrontation but is able to ensure efficient operations of our legislative body. [passage omitted] [Gukovskiy] What do you think about the opposition's proposal to form a coalition government before calling early elections? [Gaydukevich] We are against it. The opposition proposed to dissolve the Supreme Council and give power to a narrow group of like-minded politicians. The opposition's purpose is clear, which is to take advantage of the present state of confusion. Just look at what demands were trotted out by the Popular Front and the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BDSG]. In their opinion, the coalition government should consist of only the people who support their ideas. That is absurd! This would immediately put the parties standing for, say, bilingualism or collective security out the equation. In other words, the largest political forces, including the NDB, are automatically removed from the political scene. [Gukovskiy] Did NDB representatives meet with Mechyslaw Hryb after he was elected Supreme Soviet chairman? [Gaydukevich] No, they did not. I believe that the initiative to meet should come from Mechyslaw Ivanovich himself. We have made our move by sending him a telegram with congratulations on his new appointment. Hryb and Kebich made a good declaration calling for contacts with all political forces. All forces! The former speaker has never even thought about it. He kept saying "accord" [preceding word in Belarusian], but as far as I can remember, he met only with the BDSG and the United Democratic Party of Belarus. [Gukovskiy] You say that early elections are necessary. When do you think they should be called? Are you sure that they will take place at all? [Gaydukevich] I think they will actually take place. The Supreme Soviet made a relevant decision on this. When? Summertime is the time of vacations; it cannot be in March or early April, according to the law, which requires a two-month waiting period. They cannot be held in April and May, as people will be busy with the sowing campaign. The most convenient time would be early fall. [Gukovskiy] You have repeatedly said that the NDB stands for closer union with Russia. Just like in Belarus, a variety of political force are active in that country, including in the highest echelons of power. With which of them are you seeking a union? [Gaydukevich] I have always said: Politicians come and go, but the people remain. We will cooperate with all those who stand for the unity of the Slavic peoples. I would rather not be in position to name specific parties or individuals. Our position may clear after meetings with representatives of the entire political spectrum of Russia, which we are planning to hold as soon as possible.
