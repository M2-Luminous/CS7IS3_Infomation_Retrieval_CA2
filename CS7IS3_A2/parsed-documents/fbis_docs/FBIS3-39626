BERLINGSKE TIDENDE was able to report on Monday [14 February] that the Coordinating Council for Military Affairs in the CIS (the former Soviet Union) has asked Denmark to assume this leadership role. "It is probably wrong to envisage that Denmark or any other country should play a special role. The United Nations or the CSCE should play such a role; we have to say that it is international organizations that should play a special role in the resolution of conflicts between Russia and its new neighbors," Helveg Petersen told the TV-Avisen program last night. But he is positive to the idea that Denmark should make troops available. "Denmark has peacekeeping operations experience that is unique. We have been involved in many such operations, and we have trained personnel in the Danish defense forces and elsewhere to take on such operations. So if the United Nations and the CSCE become involved in these operations in the former Soviet Union, well, naturally Denmark must also give consideration to the role it should play."
