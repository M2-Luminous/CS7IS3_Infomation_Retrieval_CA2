Nigeria's military leader, General Sani Abacha told a French delegation that his country had always maintained a police post in the disputed area and conducted population census there. An official statement after a closed-door meeting in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, quoted Abacha as saying his government's concern is the security of Nigerians who form 96 percent of the residents of the area. The four-man French Government delegation was led by Bruno Delaye, special adviser to President Francois Mitterrand. The team met with Cameroonian President Paul Biya in Yaounde Monday. France has also sent 30 paratroopers to Cameroon under a defence pact following reported clashes between Nigerian and Cameroonian troops on 18 and 19 February. Abacha said that the presence of Nigerian soldiers in the area was to forestall communal clashes between Nigeria's communities in the south-eastern states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River. He said Nigeria has no territorial ambitions. He restated that the dispute could be resolved amicably without external assistance. "The two peoples are brothers from time immemorial and were only separated by colonial boundaries a few years ago," the statement quoted Abacha as saying. Abacha said a machinery had been put in place to implement a suggestion by the French delegation that Nigeria and Cameroon should discuss the problem during a scheduled meeting between their two leaders. The statement quoted Delaye as telling Abacha that French paratroopers were in Cameroon only to honour the defence pact between the two countries. He said that France wanted the two neighbours, both of whom have cordial relations with France, to resolve their differences amicably. Speaking to State House correspondents after a closed- door meeting, the French envoy said "we are here to help and not to create problems." Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, told reporters there was determination and commitment on both sides towards resolving the issue through dialogue. "We are looking forward to the proposed summit of the two heads of states. The sooner it takes place the sooner we find our way forward towards finding a solution", he said. He said the presence of French delegation here in Abuja is in no way an indication of their involvement in our on-going negotiation with Cameroon. Kingibe warned on Monday that French military intervention could escalate the conflict.
