Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], recently made an explicit response on those two issues. He indicated that the establishment of a committee on human rights in Hong Kong would obviously run counter to the Basic Law. Should such a committee be set up, that would turn out to be something "alien" in the future and would definitely be abolished after 1997. The parts of the two international pacts on human rights applicable to Hong Kong will be implemented through Hong Kong laws after 1997 in accordance with the stipulations in the Basic Law. China is not a signatory of the two human rights pacts and has no responsibility or obligation whatsoever to report to the UN Commission on Human Rights on Hong Kong human rights conditions. These words are convincing enough. What should Hong Kong rely on in protecting human rights after 1997? A law or an organization alone? Of course, we should rely on the Basic Law formulated with Hong Kong residents' hearts and souls and not an organization set up at the instigation of a handful of pro-British and anti-Chinese elements. During the Sino-British talks in 1984, the Chinese Government announced a series of basic principles and policies toward Hong Kong which included the stipulation that "the Hong Kong SAR Government will protect the rights and freedoms of the residents and other people in the Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the law. The Hong Kong SAR Government maintains the rights and freedoms stipulated in Hong Kong's existing laws...." Later, these policies were fixed in the form of the Basic Law and became solemn legal provisions which nobody can violate. The National People's Congress has endowed Hong Kong residents with a legal weapon to protect their own legitimate rights, interests, and freedoms. So long as we resolutely safeguard the Basic Law after 1997, the basic rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will be protected. If some people think that human rights can be guaranteed only in those countries and regions where committees on human rights are set up, is it not like saying that human rights do not exist in the many countries in the world where such committees are absent? Britain and the United States do not have committees on human rights. Does this prove that there are no human rights in Britain and the United States? In 1991, when some people in Hong Kong set out the need to establish a committee on human rights, the Hong Kong government stated explicitly that the issue would not be taken into consideration, saying that "having referred to the experiences of some countries which have set up committees on human rights, including Canada and Australia, the Hong Kong Authorities believe that the need to set up a committee on human rights does not exist." How will the British Hong Kong Government answer the question today? The organization for a committee on human rights does not exist in the Basic Law. Some people are going all out to advocate the establishment of such an organization. In fact, this is their attempt to sow the seed of instability after 1997 and make this a breakthrough for revising the Basic Law. Regarding the relevant clauses in the "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights" and the "International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights" which are applicable to Hong Kong, it is stipulated in the Basic Law that they "will continue to be effective" and will be "implemented through the law of the Hong Kong SAR." Here, it says that only those clauses "which are applicable to Hong Kong" in these two international covenants will be effective and does not mean they will be copied in their entirety. They must be implemented by Hong Kong SAR laws after 1997 and the British Hong Kong Government should not intervene by making any stipulations. Some people are clamoring for Hong Kong to adopt the two covenants before 1997 and cannot wait to use some of the clauses helpful to them to revise existing laws (such as legal documents on media operations and the government regulations on security and social security) and to serve their purpose of formulating the "law on freedom to seek information [zi xun 6327 6061]" and "draft regulations on the committee for human rights and equal opportunities." The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the existing Hong Kong laws will remain basically unchanged. The Basic Law stipulates that, with the founding of the SAR, the existing laws of Hong Kong will be adopted as the Hong Kong SAR laws with the exception of those nominated by the NPC Standing Committee as running counter to the Basic Law. Should any more of the existing laws be found to run counter to the Basic Law, they will be revised and terminated in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Basic Law. Should the British Hong Kong Government make any revisions of its existing laws running counter to the Basic Law before 1997, or formulate decrees and regulations in violation of the Basic Law, these will all be abolished after 1997. Some people are attempting to introduce the two international covenants on human rights before 1997 and compel the Chinese Government to bear the obligation to report Hong Kong human rights conditions to the UN Commission on Human Rights. Obviously, they want to make preparations to add international pressure to impeding the NPC Standing Committee from abolishing the decrees and regulations which run counter to the Basic Law. Nevertheless, that is just a one-sided wish. Some people think that, at the instigation of the British Foreign Affairs Select Committee report, the British Hong Kong Government and its followers have made a great fuss over the human rights issue in an attempt to push Hong Kong into the vortex of controversies over "human rights," confuse right and wrong, and achieve their ulterior motive. We really must be vigilant and guard against this.
