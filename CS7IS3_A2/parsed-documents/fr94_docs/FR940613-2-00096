FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melissa Wishy, Community Planner, Federal Aviation Administration, Chicago Airports District Office, 2300 East Devon Avenue; Des Plaines, Illinois, 60018, (708) 294&hyph;7524. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA approved the Mitigated FONSI/ROD for proposed development at Greater Rockford Airport. Below is a listing of major, associated and indirect development projects. This listing includes United Parcel Service's (UPS) recent announcement to initiate a cargo hub facility at the airport. 1. Develop the midfield area for aviation-related industrial users. 2. Expand the existing cargo apron and buildings west of the existing terminal building to accommodate a minimum of 26 cargo aircraft. 3. Extend Runway 7/25 to a length of 10,000 feet by constructing a 3,500-foot southwesterly extension with parallel and connecting taxiways and associated lighting and navigation aids. This would include the installation of a CAT II Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Runway 7. 4. Relocate approximately 12,000 feet of Belt Line Road and 9,300 feet of Kishwaukee Road. 5. Expand the existing terminal building and auto parking lot and upgrade the existing airport entrance roadway. 6. Construct a general aviation apron and T-hangars. 7. Close Runway 13/31. 8. Remove miscellaneous support buildings. 9. Construct a new 4,000-foot general aviation visual approach runway, parallel to and 5,100 feet southeast of existing Runway 7/25, with associated taxiways and instrumentation. 10. Construct and realign various taxiways parallel to Runway 1/19. The majority of the realignment work proposed is adjacent to and west of the approach end of Runway 19. 11. Implement actions recommended in the 1993 Master Drainage/Stormwater Management Plan. 12. Implement actions recommended in the updated Noise Compatibility Plan. 13. Acquire approximately 1,100 acres of land for airfield development. In addition to this acquisition, is the relocation of up to 28 residential dwellings (for noise and floodway mitigation), of which only eleven are considered to be noise impacted and must be acquired and residents relocated prior to the start of any operation resulting from the Proposed Action Alternative. The remaining residential dwellings would be acquired for purposes of airfield development and floodway mitigation. Those dwellings identified as floodway mitigation can be acquired either in fee-simple or through restrictive covenant. (Updated) 14. Compensate for wetland impacts caused by the development of the Proposed Action Alternative through the creation of approximately 25 acres of new wetlands. 15. An additional 1,500 flights annually beyond those originally forecasted but with an greater number of stage three aircraft. This is based on UPS's proposal to initiate an air cargo operation at Greater Rockford Airport.
