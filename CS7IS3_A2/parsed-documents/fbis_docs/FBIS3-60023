In addition, eight other suspects of the same case were also arrested. The two culprits, surnamed Gong and Tang, often carrying guns with them, have been engaging in drug trafficking from Burma to mainland China for a long time. The case was tracked down and solved by the Enping County Public Security Bureau, which took as a clue the rumor among the drug addicts in the county that the "rice" (meaning drugs) there was both cheap and fine. Further investigations are now under way for this case.
