C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said that Taiwan's intellectual property rights (IPR) protection efforts should help avert possible trade sanctions from the United States. Chiang made the remark late Wednesday [2 March] following the conclusion of three days of IPR talks between Taiwan and the United States. Taiwan attached great importance to the negotiations as results of the meeting will help determine whether Taiwan will be removed from the "Special 301 Priority Watch List" and no longer be targeted by the United States for trade retaliation. The US will make a final decision on the issue in late April. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a statement that the US side "will conduct a review as soon as possible to assess Taiwan's progress in providing adequate and effective protection of IPR." The statement noted that the US delegation "recognized the considerable accomplishments of the Executive and Legislative Yuans, especially in the passage of the very important cable TV law, approval and signing of the bilateral copyright agreement and the passage of the amendments to the patent and trademark laws." AIT represents American interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries. During the talks, both sides agreed to enter into a reciprocal patent protection agreement, which will ensure better protection for inventions by people of the two countries. The United States will be the first country to sign such a reciprocity accord with Taiwan, details of which will be worked out later in the year. In addition, Taiwan pledged to work for an integrated circuit display protection law and to make rules on industrial design part of the amended patent law by the end of July. Taiwan, however, has yet to decide whether to enact a law to protect business secrets. American delegates, who had expressed deep concern about the reduction of jail terms for violations of the trademark law from five to three years, reluctantly accepted the provision after Taiwan's explanations that the prison sentence will not be convertible to fines. The US side also accepted Taiwan's current ban on foreign investment in the domestic cable television business and the 20 percent ceiling on foreign stakes in cable TV programs, while Taiwan agreed to the US request that broadcast of foreign satellite programs without authorization would be considered an IPR violation. Taiwan's computer software export inspection system will remain in place after repeated US demands, although Taiwan hopes to end the inspection soon because of its expense and inconvenience. Meanwhile, US negotiators said they were satisfied with Taiwan's protective measures for patented pharmaceuticals and copyrights, saying Taiwan has done a good job in this regard.
