Kokoshin took part in a nationwide conference on the development of avionics in St. Petersburg Wednesday. Kokoshin told Interfax that the budget proposed by the State Duma would not only fail to lead the defense industries out of the standstill, but would completely ruin them. Pointing out that Russia could still trade arms, including warships, Kokoshin said that the problem was to find a buyer rather than to sell the equipment at a profit. During his stay in St. Petersburg, Kokoshin visited the holding company Leninets, developing military electronic products, and the dock Severnye Verfi to see the construction of several warships. Kokoshin is leaving for Minsk to meet Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich on June 16.
