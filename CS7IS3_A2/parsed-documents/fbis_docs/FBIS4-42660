Rear Admiral Sakari Visa, the naval commander, indicated in an interview on Sunday [8 May] with TURUN SANOMAT that the new sea regions cannot be monitored effectively without additional resources. According to Visa, the Navy's greatest need is for four or five new patrol boats and new fixed materiel. Finland must also acquire submarines. Visa believes that if Finland had a submarine flotilla of its own, it would be much easier to patrol sea areas and to raise the threshold for border violations. But submarines are not at the top of the Navy's wish list, according to Visa. Several weeks ago, in one of its evening sessions, the government decided in principle to expand the territorial boundary from the present 4 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. According to plans, the parliament will be presented with a proposal on this matter as early as this month. Rear Adm. Visa points out that, despite this decision, the Navy has not been promised any more ships or personnel. In the TURUN SANOMAT interview, Visa also pointed out that Finnish membership in the European Union [EU] would place new demands on border monitoring and on the defense in general, since Finland's boundaries would then be the outer boundaries of the Union, as well.
