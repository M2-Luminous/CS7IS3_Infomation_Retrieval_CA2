ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], granted an interview to the Bratislava correspondent of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. [Zabojnik] With what feelings did you, as the only worker in the Slovak parliament, receive the contemptuous reaction of deputies when you recently spoke about the difficult social situation of people who live by the work of their own hands? [Luptak] I was not surprised because it was not the first such reaction. I have been to 245 factories and know exactly what people in production take an interest in and what their problems and worries are. It is their language I speak in parliament. [Zabojnik] How do these people respond to the declining living standards and growing social tension? [Luptak] Their stands are very harsh, and I cannot even interpret them here. Workers at Hnust said to me, for example: Remind Meciar of the promises he made when he was here and how it all ended. We are now 600, out of an original work force of 2,600, and we are all worried about our jobs. The previous management had salaries of 18,000 [currency not specified], and their successors made themselves a gift of 22,000 and bought themselves another posh limousine, in a situation in which the factory has no money to pay wages. I think, therefore, that transformation can hardly be made only on the backs of the people below. This situation cannot last forever, in our country or anywhere else. The Czech trade unions have also already made that clear. [Zabojnik] In the last public opinion survey in Slovakia, your ZRS remained only 0.2 percent below the 5-percent threshold necessary to get into parliament. Are you planning to go into the elections on your own or as some kind of SDL reserves? [Luptak] We are not reserves of the SDL; we are an independent party. Workers must have a clear position in the left-wing spectrum. They must exist as an organized opposition. Of course, our aim is not a government of workers or some kind of a dusted-down version of Bolshevism. [Zabojnik] How many members does the ZRS muster, and from where does it get funds? [Luptak] After achieving a membership of 13,000, we have stopped providing any more figures. Inasmuch as we are about to go into the elections, we naturally do not want to abet other parties in any way. Our funds come from collections organized by workers in Martin, Ziar, and elsewhere among themselves. In the ZRS headquarters in Banska Bystrica, we are also preparing the publication of our own newspaper. [Zabojnik] On what will your program be built? [Luptak] On the fact that there exists no wealth greater than people's work and skills. The situation must not be tolerated, for example, of a society as poor as ours affording the luxury of 360,000 unemployed who collect money produced by the belt-tightening of others. It is necessary to separate those who really do not have a chance [of finding a job] at the moment from those who do not want to work and do not deserve more than some 300-400 korunas in social support. Where shall we end up with masses of people receiving 2,000-2,200 korunas without moving a finger!? [Zabojnik] What causes would your parliamentary deputies pursue? [Luptak] They would see to it that no laws are passed that are directed against the interests of workers and the working intelligentsia. Not only is the Labor Code directed against workers, but also privatization as a whole, in the course of which millions of people have been deprived of values they themselves created. It is scandalous when rogues, cheats, and criminal elements live at our expense. Workers have been deceived many times since November [1989], and they have come to understand that they must have their own party if they do not want to become extinct as a social group.
