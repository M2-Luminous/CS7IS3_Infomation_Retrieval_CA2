The appeal was adopted today at a meeting of the officers of the fleets headquarters and administration. The message says that despite the complicated situation, especially after the blast at the fleet's ammunition storage facilities, Admiral Gurinov during his brief term of office succeeded in stopping the worsening of combat capability of the fleet's ships and units, stabilising the training, lowering the incidence of traumas and the rate of death among the servicemen. The appeal stresses that Admiral Gurinov was attentive to the needs and interests of the servicemen while demanding discipline at all levels. This is why the officers and admirals of the Russian Pacific Fleet are sure that the fleet needs Admiral Gurinov as its commander, whose moral and professional authority is recognised by the force. Admiral Gurinov was relieved of his duties on Tuesday, and Vice- Admiral Igor Khmelnov was appointed acting commander of the fleet. According to sources in the Russian Defence Ministry, the sacking came after President Boris Yeltsin's unwritten order.
