"Our program is based on the simple realization that work makes more of a contribution to economic and social progress than does unemployment," Allan Larsson said at a conference in Brussels. Before the parliamentary elections in June a final version of the social democratic jobs manifesto will be put before Europe's voters. But, before then, the European socialists want to broaden the discussion surrounding the program. That is why heavyweight representatives of both the trade unions and employers were taking part in yesterday's conference. At the conference Allan Larsson made public new figures which "for probably the first time" view West Europe's economy as a whole. And the figures which have been produced by two Danish trade union economists show that West Europe's economic crisis is homemade. Trade with countries outside Europe made a positive contribution to West Europe's growth in 1993. It was reduced consumption, a growth in stockpiles of goods, and a decrease in investments which produced economic recession. Also, West Europe's profits from trade with the rest of the world are limited; only 7 percent of consumption and investment is created by business with countries outside Europe. "We cannot blame our growth problems on countries where wages are low, whether these be countries in East Europe or developing countries. Trade is not the problem. Protectionism is not the solution. The causes are to be found within Europe," Allan Larsson said. "The fact is that Europe has slowed down its economy by restricting demand." Once again the former finance minister pointed to the "investment gap," the gulf between investments and savings: "This gap is 6 percent of West Europe's GNP and corresponds to 8 to 9 million jobs. The most important explanation for this is monetary policy in Europe which strangles investment and hampers growth and employment," said Allan Larsson who thinks that the EU's [European Union] finance ministers must take the lead to bring down interest rates. Allan Larsson pointed to "four cornerstones" in a program for increased employment: - Education and training to produce better qualified labor. - "Put money to work" by creating investment opportunities and a better investment climate. - An active labor market policy which can match new jobs to the right labor. - A new understanding between governments and the two sides of industry in Europe. And both Emilio Gabaglio, the secretary general of the European Trade Union Association, and Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the secretary general of the European Employers' Association, Unice, spoke appreciatively of the European social democrats'jobs manifesto: "It is very interesting, very rich, and shows that the antagonisms are not as great as they are sometimes portrayed," said Tyszkiewicz, who did, however, call for greater emphasis on the task of creating a climate more favorable to enterprise and investment. Emilio Gabaglio said that European employers must demonstrate a greater understanding of the fact that a "social Europe" is needed before it will be possible to create a new consensus: "Employers' organizations must realize that the social dimension is indispensable. But we have not gotten there yet. On the contrary, they view us as a nuisance. They think that unemployment is our fault because workers are still stomping about demanding rights," the secretary general of the European trade unions association said.
