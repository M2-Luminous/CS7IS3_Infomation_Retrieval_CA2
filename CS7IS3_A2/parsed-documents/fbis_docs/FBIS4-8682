[Unidentified spokesman] A Slovak Television editor will ask President Kovac a question. [Correspondent, in Slovak] Much has been written about Slovakia regarding relations between Slovakia and Hungary in the context of Central European countries. From the outside these relations might indeed appear rather dramatic, but the reality is a little different. What, in your view, is the outlook for the new coalition government being able to solve this problem? I have in mind the resolution of Slovak-Hungarian relations. [Kovac] As you know, questions of a general nature were raised during the discussions so far. This does not mean, however, that in this group of states we would underestimate questions related to the minorities. As far as relations between the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Slovakia are concerned, after the passage of some time, I am able to say better times are in the offing. At the same time, it transpires that the issue of national minorities, or perhaps the debate -- or rather the insufficient debate -- between the Hungarian and Slovak Republics on this issue has made it possible to exaggerate and dramatize the existing problem. I firmly believe that given our efforts aimed at becoming incorporated into the European integration, the issue of national minorities in the Central European region will not be an issue presenting a problem, and that we will manage to successfully resolve it among ourselves, and that by doing so we will, at the same time, demonstrate that we are capable of a partnership coexistence in the Central European region. We will thus secure for ourselves some kind of a passport for entering the European integration. [passage omitted] [Moderator] A question for President Kovac from an editor of the Bratislava-based PRACA daily. [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Foreign commentaries voice views casting doubt on Slovakia's intention to integrate into European economic, democratic, or security structures. As if by chance, Slovakia is being left out regarding the Central European Initiative. Do you think that there is any justification for doing this? [Kovac] On the whole I am not convinced that responsible West European state officials are intentionally leaving Slovakia out as one of the possible candidates for West European integration. [passage omitted] The other thing is that the Slovakia's internal policy might have provoked a certain lack of confidence as to whether the political situation in the Slovak Republic was sufficiently stable, whether political entities and governments linked to them were a reliable guarantor of what was being declared. I used every occasion, also when speaking with the gentlemen present here, to stress that the internal instability caused by the lack of a clear picture of individual political entities is one thing, while the stability of the pluralistic system which has been adopted and the Slovak Republic's foreign policy trends are a different matter. Following certain changes that have taken place, this issue has now been clarified. I believe that all doubts will disappear and that our partners will show trust in us and an understanding of certain problems we have so far suffered, being a new state. [passage omitted]
