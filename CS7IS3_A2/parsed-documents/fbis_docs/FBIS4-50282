The new achievements, involving machinery and electronics, chemical industry, energy, agriculture, new materials, bio- engineering and other industries, represent China's latest progress in these fields. CAS vice-president Wang Fusong said today that the technologies are chosen from among those developed by its 123 research institutes nationwide. The offer is part of CAS's efforts to make better use of technological achievements and provide new technologies for enterprises. In order to meet the country's increasing demand for technology, CAS changed its research strategy in 1992 by concentrating a considerable number of its scientists on applied technological research and application or commercialization of their technological achievements. The vice-president said that during the past two years, about 500 enterprises have been set up by CAS, utilizing their research achievements and establishing technological cooperation with about 3,000 other enterprises over the country, which has produced huge economic benefits. "All 144 achievements have been compiled in one CAS reference guide, and in the future CAS will regularly publish such a book containing its technological achievements, which will serve as a bridge for technological transfer between the research institutes and enterprises," said Wang.
