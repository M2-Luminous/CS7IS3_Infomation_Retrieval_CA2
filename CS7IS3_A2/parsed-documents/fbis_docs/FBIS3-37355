Another breakaway region, that of Dniestr, has eased its negative attitude to elections. President of Gagauz region Stepan Topal agreed to hold elections to Moldovan parliament on the territory of the region after talks with Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli late on Tuesday [15 February]. Earlier the Gagauz leadership conditioned the holding of elections by receiving the status of autonomy, while Moldovan President Mircea Snegur urged the Gagauz region to drop preliminary conditions, join the new parliament which would then solve the problem of the status. It was agreed that polling stations will be open across the whole of the Gagauz region, Sangheli told TASS on Wednesday. "This will undoubtedly result in a stabilisation of the situation, will strengthen mutual understanding bewteen various nationalities in Moldova", Sangheli commented adding that the final decision on the Gagauz participation in elections will be adopted by the local parliament on Thursday. Also on Wednesday authorities of the Dniester region said they would not obstruct citizens wishing to take part in the parliamentary elections in Moldova, but reiterated there would be no election on the teritory of the region. The press service of Igor Smirnov, the president of the unrecognised Dniester Republic, issued a statement saying that the Tiraspol authorities would continue to boycott the elections and would not open any voting stations on their territory. Nevertheless, they will not prevent citizens from crossing over to the other side of the Dniester River on the day of the elections in order to cast their ballots at voting stations there. The Dniester leader invited observers from foreign states, including CIS countries, to come to the Dniester Republic and see on the spot that this assurance is fulfilled.
