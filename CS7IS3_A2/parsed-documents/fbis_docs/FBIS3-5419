A celebration meeting was held at the Zimbabwe Talian Millet state farm on February 23. The general manager of the farm said in his speech that the rural theses published by the great leader President Kim Il-song is a programme which indicates a shortcut to the ultimate solution of the rural question and a true textbook which makes clear the way of freeing peasants from hard work and helping them lead a rich and civilized life. Seminars on the work of President Kim Il-song "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" were held by the group for the study of the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Enmoe, Guyana, and the Nepal Institute for Chuche Studies and in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania on February 24 and 25. Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Nepal Institute for Chuche Studies, in his report said: President Kim Il-song flawlessly indicated the fundamental principle, tasks and ways for the solution of the rural question. The brilliant achievements in the countryside of Korea today are a proud fruition of the rural theses. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK said in a statement on February 22 that the application of the chuche farming method brings a bumper harvest in the countryside of North Korea every year, but South Korea, same territory, which was once called a granary has been devastated and farming ruined every year for lack of water.
