In the Bosnian town under Muslim control, it is to pave the way for accommodating a larger group of observers called on to monitor consignments arriving at the local airport. Russian observers are being sent to Tuzla in line with an understanding reached with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs in Moscow recently. Radovan Karadzic, their leader, agreed that Tuzla airport should be opened to receive humanitarian consignments provided they are monitored by observers from Russia. Tuzla airport is in a frontline zone and normally can operate only with the agreement of the Serbian side. According to estimates by the UN headquarters, flights may begin to Tuzla airport as early as 18 March. Dozens of observer-monitors will become operational to inspect and check the consignments with a view to banning anything of a military nature. Experts from other countries will be here along with their Russian colleagues.
