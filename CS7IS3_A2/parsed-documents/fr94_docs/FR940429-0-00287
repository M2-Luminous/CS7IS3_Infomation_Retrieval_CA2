SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Secretary is amending 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by Public Law 102&hyph;325, enacted July 23, 1992, as well as certain changes added by Public Law 103&hyph;66, enacted August 10, 1993 and Public Law 103&hyph;208, enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. On January 14, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 682 in the Federal Register (59 FR 2486). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion of those issues may be found: •Amendment to §682.208 to provide for borrower notification when there is a servicing change (page 2488); •Addition to §682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student could not complete the educational program because the school closed (page 2491); •Addition to §682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student's eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school (pages 2488&hyph;2490); •Addition to §682.410 to implement administrative wage garnishment of borrowers who owe defaulted loans (page 2491). Executive Order 12866 These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. Substantive revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Section 682.202␣Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers •The Secretary has incorporated into the regulations the changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;66 and Public Law 103&hyph;208 to origination fees and insurance premiums. Section 682.202(a)(6) of the proposed regulations, which discussed the refund of excess interest paid on Stafford loans, has been deleted. Those refund provisions were substantially amended by Public Law 103&hyph;208, and will be the subject of future proposed regulations. Section 682.208␣Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan •The Secretary has incorporated into the regulations the changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;208 to the notification requirements that apply to the sale or transfer of a loan. Section 682.402␣Death, Disability, Closed School, False Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments •The Secretary has expanded the definition of what constitutes a school's ``false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow'' to include cases where a school signed a putative borrower's name on the loan application or the promissory note. The Secretary will also provide relief under these procedures to borrowers who demonstrate that the school, without authorization by the borrower, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, if the student did not receive the loan proceeds, either by actual delivery of the funds or by application of the loan proceeds to institutional charges owed to the school. •The Secretary has partially deleted the requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for a closed school or false certification discharge, a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any public fund. However, a borrower will still be required to assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party. •The Secretary has deleted the requirement for the student to certify that, as a condition of eligibility for a false certification discharge, he or she was certified by the school on the application for the loan as an eligible student. Section 682.410␣Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements •The regulations have been revised to incorporate the Secretary's guidance sent to guaranty agencies in July 1993 concerning (Pub. L. 102&hyph;589). That guidance explained that a guaranty agency was no longer required to assign loans to the Secretary for federal income tax refund offsets. •The Secretary has deleted the provision of the proposed regulations that would have made a self-employed borrower subject to wage garnishment.
