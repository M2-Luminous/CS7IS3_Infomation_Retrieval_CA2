The brain-drain to the private sector has gutted the pool of experienced talent. There are at most 10 diplomats able to negotiate at international levels, the ministry's Deputy Permanent Secretary Pratyathan Dawi Tawethikun, told THE NATION. "We now lack officials who are eligible to represent Thailand at global-level negotiations." "The permanent secretary is very concerned about the matter," he said. During the fiscal year Oct 1992 to Sept 1993, four C-10 diplomats left the Foreign Ministry, including the former ambassador to Brussels Danai Dulalumpha, one of the few Thais well acquainted with the European Community market. Three C-10 diplomats resigned the preceding three years. Senior officials are urgently seeking a way to reverse the drain of talent, and to train promising middle-ranking and junior staff. Officials trace the start of the brain-drain back to 1990, when the private sector's high pay strategy first began to influence Thai society. The number of qualified applicants for the annual intake of staff has also dropped. Not all ministry officials, however, regard the situation as critical and say it is only to be expected that the most experienced people, having already fulfilled their ambitions within the ministry, should look elsewhere for a fresh challenge. "They have fulfilled their career goals. Now that they have honour money and connections they can go into businesses or even take a rest," a mid-level official said. Another senior official also said the resignation rate amongst senior officials, although high, was not of too much concern. "The situation is not worrying when compared to resignation levels at other ministries," he said. He admitted, though, that the number of resignations had also increased at the lower and middle levels. During the past three years, about 20 C-4 to C-8 grade employees had resigned from the ministry, which now had a staff of less than 1,200 and war, the smallest in the government. However, he was not too worried and insisted the Foreign Ministry was still an attractive career option. "A career here is promising for people who want to be diplomats, to travel and live overseas," he said. There were about 70 C-10 positions in the ministry, and ample opportunities for people with ambition. Another ministry source said there had also been a dramatic decrease in the number of applicants for junior openings, at the C-3 and C-4 levels, during the annual recruitment. A decade ago when there were more than 4,000 applications for the approximately 40 openings each year, this year there had only been 1,200. However, Pratyathan Dawi said the drop in applications was not a problem as most of the new recruits were highly qualified. "It's not only the Foreign Ministry which attracts fewer applicants. But we can take comfort that those entering the ministry are capable," he said. However, in order to keep experienced staff and attract quality recruits the ministry had to compete increasingly with the private sector. The ministry recently gave government scholarships to 60 people to continue their studies, some to PhD levels. "This way we can ensure that these people will come back and join the ministry," he said. A C-6 official told THE NATION he was proud to work at the Foreign Ministry and had no plans to quit. "I am satisfied with what I am doing here, despite the low income," he said. "Most of us here don't have any financial problems. But if I was offered a salary of, say, Bt [baht] 50,000 by a private company, I might go," he said. A C-4 staffer said she would not leave the ministry since she was accustomed to being part of the bureaucratic system, in addition to the pride she had in her career. She said not all of her colleagues shared her thinking. Several junior officials had left the ministry during her three years there. "The most popular reasons for resigning are the low wages and the boredom of working in a bureaucracy," she said.
