The prime minister has given approval to this plan at the Prime Minister House this week during the task force meeting. The operation clean up will be first started in federal tribal areas as opium is grown in these areas and the largest heroin factories in Asia where the most expensive heroin in the world, the Golden Heroin, is grown are also situated here. [sentence as published] A high-level meeting of officials of various agencies involved in drug control was hold on Sunday at the ministry of drug control. This meeting was attended by Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control ministry; M.I. Muhasan, chairman of Narcotics Control Board; Ghulam Ali, secretary of Narcotics Control Board; and other high-level officials of the home ministry. According to informed sources, the decision to start operation clean up first in tribal areas was made because major drug smugglers are hiding here and the law enforcement agencies have a difficult time in arresting them. It was decided in the meeting to ask for the cooperation of the Frontier Constabulary. It was also decided that the political agents will be used to start the operation because these areas are under FRC laws which cannot be challenged in any Pakistani court. Only the political agents can arrest persons under these laws. The decision to strengthen the security on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to stop smuggling of narcotics from Afghanistan to Pakistan was also made in this meeting. All related officials have been informed in this context. Mr. Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control ministry, is going to meet with the home secretary and governor of Sarhad to get cooperation from Sarhad state.
