Therefore, it cannot in any way commit the institution in its consultations or in any plans or proposals for a solution to the crisis, assert the legislators from the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, notably Senators Dejean Belizaire, Ebrane Cadet, and Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Neither can this delegation discuss the country's future, according to Senators Belizaire, Cadet, and Dupiton. Daly Valet filed a report: [Begin recording] [Valet, in Creole] The parliamentary delegation which is holding negotiations in the United States on Haiti's political crisis, has no mandate to negotiate on behalf of the parliament. This is the position of some senators of the ACP, who indicate that the Senate never met in a formal session to give a mandate to some senators to negotiate for the purpose of making a commitment on the nation's future. Furthermore, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis is no longer the Senate's president, according to Engineer Dejean Belizaire. Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton maintains the same thing. According to him, it is on their own behalf and not on behalf of the parliament that the legislators went to discuss national politics in Washington. [Dupiton, in Creole] I am reacting once more regarding the delegation. In the parliamentary practices that we observe here, any delegation traveling receives a mission from the assembly. Several times, even in the case of President Sansaricq, when you asked if he traveled on an official trip, we said no, he traveled on private visit. That means there can be no formal decisions that commit the parliament, because the assembly had no knowledge of the trip. [In French] The entire assembly had no knowledge of the trip. The senator spoke with some other senators, telling them that he was traveling. We recognize that he is an eminent political personality who has the right to establish some political contacts during this trip abroad, some contacts that could be beneficial for the Senate and Haiti. But he will return to share that with the parliament before any deeper commitment. One should believe the same thing for the other delegations. They cannot return with a solution that commits Haitian sovereignty. [Valet, in Creole] Ebrane Cadet, first secretary in the office of Firmin Jean-Louis office and also first secretary in that of Bernard Sansaricq, goes further in his thoughts. Along with the fact that no one was mandated to negotiate on behalf of the parliament, he adds that those talks and travels here and there will not bring any positive results for Haiti. Senator Ebrane Cadet cited as examples the failure in Cartagena, the failure of the Washington agreement, and the failure of the negotiations resulting in the Governors Island accord. The senator is very pessimistic. [passage omitted]. [end recording]
