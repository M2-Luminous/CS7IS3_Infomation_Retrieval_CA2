These reports include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews, commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI, AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and most of the issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B. SHAYKH 'ABD-AL-KAFI BANNED FROM PREACHING A 150-word front-page report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im notes that ``the security services have banned Shaykh Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching in his Asad Ibn-al-Furat Mosque in al-Duqqi and from giving religious lessons. The mosque has been placed under the control of the Awqaf Ministry.'' ISLAMIST DETAINEES GO ON HUNGER STRIKE A brief 30-word report on page 1 says that ``the imprisoned Islamist detainees have declared a hunger strike in protest against ill-treatment, denial of visitation rights, confiscation of blankets and clothing, and the torture of some detainees on a regular basis in the Abu-Za'bal Prison. The strike began a few days ago in the al-'Aqrab, Abu-Za'bal, and Turah prisons.'' RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR WARNS AGAINST CULTURAL INVASION In a 300-word article on page 12, religious scholar Muhammad al- Ghazali warns against the West's cultural invasion, which he says has created bands of apostates who are destroying the religious heritage. He says that these ``apostate bands are deliberately mixing freedom of thought and freedom of disbelief.'' He concludes: ``We must confront these apostate bands with the necessary contempt and hostility, and unveil the parties for which they work so that the people can beware of them.''
