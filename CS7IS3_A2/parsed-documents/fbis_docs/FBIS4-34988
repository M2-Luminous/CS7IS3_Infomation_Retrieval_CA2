Perry. Paz Aguilar made that remark after the top Clinton Administration official boarded the airplane that flew him to Puerto Rico. "We discussed matters of common interest only," the foreign minister said after listing the points that, according to him, were discussed during the approximately 20-minute meeting. "We broached the future of the U.S. military presence in the country, strengthening civil-military action programs, establishing a regional center to combat drug trafficking, and the situation Haitians are experiencing." Perry categorically noted that only U.S. Air Force units stationed in the Southern Command could be moved to Honduran territory. He noted that the U.S. military presence in Panama concludes on 31 December 1999 and that Palmerola will remain a center where U.S. troops have access facilities. "At no time was there any mention of turning Honduras into a platform for regional operations. The U.S. policy worldwide is to close bases and reduce the number of soldiers, and I do not think they are interested in increasing their military presence here," Paz Aguilar indicated. He added that there are troops in Panama to guarantee the permanent and definite neutrality of the Panama Canal and that there are barely 1,000 U.S. soldiers in Honduras, who are operating within the framework of reciprocal assistance. "I reiterate that that topic was not discussed, but it is clear and definite that Honduras has to refine its relations with the United States based on dignity and respect for national sovereignty," Paz Aguilar noted. The official said that the bilateral military assistance treaty is the product of an era that ended with the Cold War. He added that the 1990's face totally different challenges, such as drug trafficking. "We would like Palmerola to serve as a regional base to fight drug trafficking," he stated, as he explained that U.S. specialized agencies are waging the war on drug trafficking. When asked to comment on Perry's visit, Presidential Designate Walter Lopez Reyes said it was a courtesy visit and that they discussed general topics of mutual interest.
