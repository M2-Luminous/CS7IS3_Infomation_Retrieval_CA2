FR941012-1-00065 FR941012-1-00012 As noted above, the Agency listed phosphorus pentoxide based upon an abstract (Ballantyne (1981)). The Agency now believes that this abstract should not be used as the basis for listing. The title of the abstract reported the toxicity of phosphorus pentoxide smoke. However, the study was actually performed using the smoke generated by burning red phosphorus. In burning red phosphorus, two studies (Tarnov (1980) and Burton et. al (1982)) have shown that the major product is phosphorus pentoxide. However, the Ballantyne abstract does not establish that the toxicity found was attributable to the phosphorous pentoxide in the smoke, or other chemicals in lower concentrations. Since there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the animals in Ballantyne's study were primarily exposed to phosphorus pentoxide, the available data from Ballantyne's findings are insufficient to prove or disprove that the LC 50 values in guinea pigs and mice satisfy the criteria for listing phosphorous pentoxide on the EHS list. Information submitted by the Elemental Phosphorus Ad Hoc Solid Waste Group showed that the direct tests on phosphorous pentoxide show an LC 50 value higher than the criteria for listing. In an unpublished Monsanto report (1987), rats were exposed to aerosolized phosphorous pentoxide for 4 hours, at levels up to 0.99 mg/liter. (It should be noted that although the analytical standards used in the analysis conducted for this study were phosphorous pentoxide, no information was obtained regarding the actual chemical species present in the chamber atmosphere.) This is the only available study in the literature that provides direct evidence of the toxic potential of phosphorous pentoxide. The LC 50 for phosphorous pentoxide was found to be greater than 0.99 mg/liter, which does not meet the criteria for listing for listing substances as an extremely hazardous substance. Since the Agency now believes that the abstract used as the basis for listing is invalid (the Agency was unable to obtain the actual report) and the only direct studies available to the Agency show that phosphorus pentoxide does not meet the listing criteria, the Agency is proposing to remove the chemical from the EHS list. Diethylcarbamazine citrate was listed on the basis of a report in a Russian data compilation showing an LC 50 inhalation value of 0.309 mg/liter/4 hours in rats. The citation number listed in the United Nations sponsored translation is incorrect, and additional details about the original study are unavailable. Methods used for this inhalation toxicity study could not be found to determine if they meet international standards, therefore, the toxicity values could not be verified. An inhalation study sponsored by SmithKline Beecham indicated that a 1-hour exposure of rats to Diethylcarbamazine citrate at concentration of 1.63 mg per liter or 2.38 mg per liter produced no fatalities. Since the only studies available to EPA show that this chemical does not meet the listing criteria for inhalation (LC 50 less than 0.5 mg per liter), the Agency is proposing to remove it from the EHS list. Fenitrothion was initially listed because it appeared to meet the extremely hazardous substance criteria, based upon a study showing an LC 50 of 0.378 mg/liter/4 hours (NIOSH/RTECS 1985). The delisting petition charged that this study was deficient in that the material tested contained a toxic impurity of unknown potency, and that the study overestimated the toxicity of fenitrothion itself, because the test material contained surfactants that would have made the test animal's skin and cell membranes more permeable to the test substance. Examination of a study submitted by the petitioner (Kohda et. al (1986)) reports an LC 50 of above 2.210 mg/liter. In studying the report provided by the petitioner, the Agency agrees that the data by which the listing is based may have been in error for the reasons stated by the petitioner. Since the only other study available to the Agency shows that fenitrothion does not meet the listing criteria, EPA is proposing to remove this substance from the EHS list.
