The president of the Chamber of Deputies has stood in favor of the office presided over by Firmin Jean-Louis. Frantz Robert Monde, who leads the debates in the Lower Chamber, has called the senators to their senses. While reminding them that the deputies are willing to work for a solution to the political crisis, Frantz Robert Monde invited the senators to join the deputies in their position. Frantz Robert Monde is interviewed by Edner Jean: [Begin recording] [Monde] The deputies have risen above it. If a solution is still being blocked, the fault does not lie with the deputies who knew how to rise to the aspirations, expectations, of trust vested in them by the people. Despite divergences in political and ideological opinion, the deputies found a common denominator for the interest of the nation and voted strategies for alleviation of the crisis. [In Creole] It is an opportunity for me to thank the great men of this Chamber of Deputies, while calling on the wisdom of the senators so they can understand [back to French] that the others, those who are before us, have every interest in widening the gulf within our institutions to prove that we Haitians cannot do well. There is one office, plus a group of dissident senators. [Jean] Which office is that? [Monde] The office of Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis. I received a letter from Ebrane Cadet, who is the first secretary of both offices -- he is the only winner. He is first secretary in Jean-Louis' office, and first secretary of my colleague, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq, with whom I have some deep geographical ties and a certain similar political view. I do not think it is up to the president to take a stand on this matter, but rather it is up to the assembly, despite the fact that I represent the majority in this chamber. I think that the 18 January senators have a chance with their plan, which provides for a prime minister not from Aristide's ranks, who will be a more-or-less neutral prime minister. We will not find him. [as heard] However, he will have influence on the arbitration committee. [end recording]
