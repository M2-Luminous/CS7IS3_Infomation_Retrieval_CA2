This morning UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye left the Zambian capital for Huambo and will later leave for Luanda. A source close to the mediator told Radio Nacional that Alioune Blondin Beye will take this opportunity to hold talks with President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The source said the UN official will discuss two issues linked to war in Angola: distribution of humanitarian aid and the Angolan peace talks underway in Lusaka. The UNITA negotiating team has also left for Huambo and it is presumed that this trip in within the framework of the usual consultations with its leadership at a time when the Lusaka talks are apparently at a standstill due to the intransigent positions defended by Savimbi's team on the issue regarding the installation of UNITA and its senior officials and the retention of 76 foreign nationals by UNITA in Huambo, which over the past two days has caused intense diplomatic movement. Taking the advantage of the temporary suspension of the talks, the government representatives left for Luanda and are scheduled to return to Lusaka tomorrow.
