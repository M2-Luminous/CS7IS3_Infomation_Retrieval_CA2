"Paradoxically the tragedy leaves Israel and the PLO no alternative but to accelerate the peace negotiations so that the PLO can take control in the territories as soon as possible," an Israeli minister, who asked not to be named, told AFP. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat agreed to U.S. President Bill Clinton's appeal not to allow the massacre to undermine recent achievements and to hold new negotiations that will continue in Washington until a resolution is reached. The minister said "damage control" contacts over the last 24 hours between Israel and the PLO as well as with the Americans and Europeans had proved positive. "Everyone agrees that we have to push ahead with peace," the minister said. "The negotiations could go very fast now." There is no problem with the Palestinian leadership, what we fear is the Palestinian street. "The coming days will be crucial. Things could get out of control in the territories." For that reason, on top of international condemnation, Israel was under great pressure to come up with some real gestures such as an early release of Palestinian prisoners, to keep a lid on the violence, he said. Rabin was weighing his next move on Saturday, the minister added. "The decision to punish the settlers by closing off Qiryat Arba' and to compensate Palestinian families is important. Symbolic measures such as closing off the killer's house or even blowing it up, as happens with the Palestinians, are under consideration," he revealed. He said he hoped that ultimately the massacre could reduce the period of autonomy to under five years, allowing an early transition to a final settlement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] Rabin pledged the killing would not halt the peace train. "The crazy act of a pyschopath will not prevent the reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians and will not stop the peace process," he vowed. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres added: "If anyone thinks such criminal acts will slow the peace efforts, they are sorely mistaken." [passage omitted]
