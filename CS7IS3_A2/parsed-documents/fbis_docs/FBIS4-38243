Yemeni political sources told INA's correspondent in Sanaa that the three helicopters were brought under control recently upon landing at one of the airports in Shabwah Governorate, north of Aden. The sources said the three helicopters were commanded by Yemeni pilots who had recently fled the control of the secessionists, along with their families, to seek refuge with the forces of legitimacy. Diplomatic sources in Sanaa said the Kuwaiti helicopter deal is one of the arms supply deals between the Saudi and Kuwaiti regimes and the secessionists in Yemen.
