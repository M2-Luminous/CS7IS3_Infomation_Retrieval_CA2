This array, shown schematically in Figure 1 below, integrates three directional couplers on a LiNbO[.sub]3[/] substrate. The directional couplers employ a step _D__b_ modulation method; directional coupler gap is 5 �m, waveguide width is 7 �m, and interaction length L is 7mm. The input and output waveguides require butt splicing with a 1.3-�m single-mode fiber; spacing P between the input and output waveguides should exceed 125 �m, with 150 �m chosen as the design value. Circular arc radius R is greater than or equal to 40mm, circular arc waveguide length L[.sub]R[/] is 4mm, bend-angle straight waveguide length L[.sub]S[/] is 3mm, device overall length is less than 3 cm, and bend angle _th_ is 0.5 degree. Ti film thickness is 600 angstroms, and diffusion conditions are 1050� C for 7 hours. Figure 1. Practical Structure for 1x4 Optical Switch Array. Device fabrication process is as follows: z-cut LiNbO[.sub]3[/] crystal surface sputtering of Ti film, etching of Ti lines, diffusion in high-temperature wet argon and wet oxygen gases to form the waveguides, waveguide surface deposition of SiO[.sub]2[/] film, end-face collimation and polishing, clear testing, evaporation of Al film, electrode alignment, ultrasonic pressure welding of electrode leads, fiber-optic waveguide butt splicing in a V-groove, and performance testing. Measured performance parameters are: device insertion loss = -7 dB to -9 dB, crosstalk = approx. -20 dB, switch response time is less than 1.4 ns, switch drive voltage = 15-20 V. The TDM analysis for the entire switching array is shown in Figure 2 below (in which SW refers to directional coupler). There are no tables. Figure 2.
