In an interview with DE STANDAARD, Van Miert said: "I will be pleased when he gets it." He also thinks that if Dehaene does become EC president, the Christian People's Party should relinquish a ministerial position in the federal government to the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party. In the meantime Dehaene seems to be gaining ever more support abroad. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Dehaene's cabinet confirmed that the premier had talks with his Italian colleague Silvio Berlusconi in Rome on Friday evening [17 June], after talks with the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Berlusconi will receive British candidate Sir Leon Brittan in the near future. From a German source, it was reported that Italy preferred Dehaene to his Netherlands counterpart Lubbers. German Chancellor Kohl is reported to have informed Dehaene of this preference. On the basis of this information, the Belgian prime minister is said to have publicly announced his candidacy to succeed Jacques Delors and visit his Italian colleague. Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez let it be known via his foreign minister that he would not veto Dehaene's appointment.
