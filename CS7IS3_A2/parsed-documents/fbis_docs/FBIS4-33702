FBIS4-33702 "drlat112_h_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Honduras Bank Announces Controls To Stabilize Currency Bank Announces Controls To Stabilize Currency PA0906222994 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1726 GMT 9 Jun 94 PA0906222994 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central Bank of Honduras [BCH] today announced strong control measures on the U.S. dollar exchange system so as to stabilize the value of the lempira, which has dropped by 13.5 percent in relation to the official exchange rate of 7.27 lempiras per dollar in the past few weeks. BCH President Hugo Noe Pino said that the pressure on the local currency and the economy is caused by "speculation" by private exchange brokers, and that these brokers "are a source of exchange instability." The BCH keeps the official exchange rate at 7.27 lempiras per dollar as a means of taxing imports, but the dollar is sold at the rate of 8.41 lempiras on the black market, making it impossible "to estimate a balanced average," Pino said. He said "strong" measures will be taken to control the foreign currency market. He declined to mention the regulations that will be added to other monetary decisions. The government implemented control in late May on 50 percent of the U.S. dollars the exchange system accumulated. The government forces exchange brokers to sell 40 percent of their dollars to the BCH, according to experts, so as to bolster international reserves and to be prepared to face foreign debt amortizations. Pino said the BCH will announce next week the new monetary measures that will effect stability and an inflow of Honduran exporters' dollars presently deposited in foreign banks. Authorities estimate approximately $1.5 billion belong to Hondurans who are waiting for monetary stability before transferring the money to Honduras are deposited in U.S. banks. The assembly plant industry, which brings between $70 million and $100 million annually from exports, will have to report its dollars to the BCH, Pino said. Honduran dollars are transacted through the formal banking system, the exchange brokers, who buy and sell dollars exclusively, and the black market, which the central banking system does not regulate.
