Vitez is going through one of the most devastating Muslim artillery attacks since the aggression began on 15 April last year. The usual afternoon mortar provocations this evening turned into artillery barrage fire directed at the center of Vitez, the Croatian Defense Council's [HVO's] Vitez operational zone reports. Tank-fired missiles and 122-mm howitzer shells are landing on residential areas and other civilian facilities. The attacks from the direction of Preocica and Poculica and other positions along the Zenica line have been coupled by 60-mm mortar shells from the direction of Mahala, the part of Stari Vitez under the control of the Muslim army. The command of the Vitez operational zone reports that two children have already died in this infernal shelling. Nobody bothers to estimate the extent of the material damage any longer. The population has been warned by the local radio station and in other appropriate ways to descend into bomb shelters. The general alert sounded on 15 April last year is still in force. It is 1800 hours and the pounding goes on. HVO units are responding to the hostile fire with the means at their disposal, the Vitez operational zone command said.
