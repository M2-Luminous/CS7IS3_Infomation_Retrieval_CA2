He said: "Saudi banks operating in Saudi Arabia undertook an important basic role in financing the national private sector in order that its projects be carried out during previous development plan periods. Total financing offered by them to borrowers increased from about 5 billion riyals [R] during the first five-year plan to R82 billion in May of 1992. Most of this financing was offered to the national private sector. This financing was in addition to the enormous financing programs offered by the state in the form of long-term loans via special funds." He added: "The commercial banks, in order to attract citizens' savings and encourage them to make investments, created various investment funds that have met with a steadily increasing response on the part of investors. Furthermore, the commercial banks' methods of operation and the level of services they offer to the public have become more advanced in order to keep up with international progress in this field. All this is in addition to the volume of financing offered by these banks and the creation of new instruments to attract citizens' savings. These banks have benefited from modern banking technology and the introduction of automated teller machines, permitting them to offer basic banking services to customers both during the regular bank hours and when the banks are closed." Al-Sayyari went on to say: "The commercial banks benefit from the Saudi payments network established by SAMA. By means of this network, customers can use the automated teller machines of other banks. Also, in order to develop the Saudi financial market and improve the procedures for the circulation of shares, SAMA has implemented a plan that links the banks' central circulation units to the central computer of SAMA itself, where these units receive all the offers, orders, and information relevant to the circulation of shares. In addition to all of this, SAMA and the banks are participating in the international electronic communications network that links more than 2,600 banks and international financial establishments to each other." When referring to the banking sector, he said: "Historically it has been one of the oldest sectors that has played an important role in the development of the economies of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations. This sector has been subjected to a degree of supervision and control, but this has been necessary because the banking operations have expanded and branched out. This was the reason for the decision by the minister of finance and national economy, on 16 Safar 1402 A.H. [1981], to regulate the banking profession, and this task was entrusted to SAMA. A whole division of SAMA undertakes the supervision and regulation of the banking operations." The subject of the Saudi banks was brought up in a Saudi Economics Association conference held in Riyadh, which dealt with the topic of the challenges faced by the banking sector in Saudi Arabia. One person who spoke at the conference was Sulayman al-Mandil, general manager of the Riyadh Bank, and he presented a brief history of Saudi banking since its beginnings in 1926. "Actually the history of Saudi banking goes back to the year 1345 A.H. (15 November 1926), when the Dutch Commercial Company opened a branch in Jeddah for the purpose of exchanging currencies carried by pilgrims from Indonesia, which at that time was under Dutch colonial rule. After that, a branch of the Indochina Bank was also opened in Jeddah on 18 Jumada I 1367 A.H. (March of 1949), then a branch of the British Middle East Bank opened in Jeddah in the month of Rajab in 1370 A.H. (22 April 1950), as well as a branch of the Pakistani National Bank in the month of Ramadan in 1370. Also, in the early fifties, a quasi-banking corporation and some bankers [started operations]. These were the beginnings of the Saudi banking sector, which by now has become a giant." Al-Mandil said: "The Saudi banking sector, including both its domestic and foreign operations, was not able, during the oil boom period of the seventies, to meet the demands of development in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries. This provided a great incentive for the emergence of the off-shore banks, among which a great many were established in Bahrain." After referring to the period all during the seventies when foreign banks such as the Dutch, French, British, Arab National, and Cairo banks flourished, he said: "The process of Saudiization of the capital of these banks began, and this was the source of a great incentive for them to begin important steps of development. Consequently, there began the processes of modernization of methods of administration and the utilization of modern technology. When the seventies came to an end, the Saudi banking sector had already become strong and profitable, in spite of the fact that international establishments continued to participate, to a considerable degree, in the financing of the development projects." After having dealt with the period of the eighties, the stumbling debt crisis due to clients' inability to honor their obligations, and the fact that Saudi banks were able to successfully overcome this crisis due to their high degree of solvency at that time, al-Mandil went on to say: "The present situation of the Saudi banks is good, and the banking sector as a whole possesses clear elements of strength, which are the following: "1. A high degree of financial solvency. The assets of these banks have increased from R5.86 billion in 1973 to R318 billion in 1993 (about $84.2 billion), and this is twenty times what the banks had twenty years ago. Also, shareholder equities have increased from R243 million in 1973 to R30.2 billion in 1993. It has been shown that [a bank's] degree of solvency, according to criteria set by the World Bank, should be not less than 8 percent of its total assets as shareholder equities. The solvency of Saudi banks as a whole during 1992 was 13 percent, and this is higher than the solvency of banks in Japan (9 percent), Britain (10.6 percent), and France (8.8 percent). Total assets of the Saudi banking sector amounted to R318 billion. "2. Diversification of the Saudi banking sector. It includes all of the national banks and joint banks. This is a source of strength since it is a source of enrichment and diversification for banking operations. "3. The dynamic nature and capability of the Saudi private sector has constituted an element of strength for the Saudi banking sector. "4. The fourth element of strength of the Saudi banking sector is the existence of SAMA, because in its work it has gone beyond the traditional role of central banks in the world today as a high bank commissioner in case of crises, and it has taken on the job of developing the Saudi banking sector and impelling it to utilize the world's most modern banking methods." The general manager of the Riyadh Bank went on to say: "Saudi banks face several challenges, such as the acquisition of technological development, the development of the Saudi banking sector, the improvement of conditions of the work force, and expansion of loan activities." He then pointed out: "Saudi banks are in the process of facing these challenges concerning the acquisition of technology or development of the Saudi private economic sector. As far as the work force is concerned, there are requirements for them to be trained and to improve their qualifications. These banks currently have 25,600 employees, 55 percent of whom are Saudis. Total Saudiization will require a few more years, since it is proceeding at a rate of 5 percent per year, and the Saudiization of the jobs has to proceed gradually in view of the specialized positions that are occupied by foreign employees. "The last challenge is that of loans, and this is something that the Saudi banks can increase. The volume of loans as compared with the banks' total assets at the present time is R104 billion out of a total of R318 billion, that is, they constitute 33 percent of these assets. This is an indication of the fact that loans can be increased." The Basel Committee has classified Saudi banks as being in the same category as those of the advanced industrial nations. In spite of this fact, most of the Saudi banks have increased their capital. The solvency and sufficiency of their capital have reached a percentage higher than that set by the Basel Committee. Al-Sayyari said: "The percentage of sufficiency of the capital of the Saudi banks, by the end of April of 1992, and according to the Basel Committee's criteria for "probable dangers," totalled 9.6 percent, as compared with the figure of 8 percent, which is required by the committee." The fact is that Saudi banks are a reflection of the Saudi economy itself in terms of its stability and ability to achieve development when faced by crises. In this regard, the newspaper IRISH TIMES says that Saudi Arabia has followed the policy of a free market economy, diversified production and the sources thereof, encouraged industrial and agricultural development in the private sector, developed its work force personnel, increased economic cooperation on all levels, and utilized its wealth and revenues in development programs on the national level in order to hasten the rates of growth in the industrial and agricultural sectors after having provided them with the appropriate infrastructural support.
