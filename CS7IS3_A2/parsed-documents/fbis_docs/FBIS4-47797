First situation. A South African traditional chief accompanied by ranch farmers from that country deliberately crossed the border into our country, allegedly searching for cattle stolen by Mozambicans. A number of people told DOMINGO that it was not the first time that the incident has taken place. South African farmers often enter Mozambique in search of cattle allegedly stolen. This is extremely worrisome, since it is a gross violation of the Mozambican border. More than that, it is a violation of our country's sovereignty. There is no proof that in fact Mozambicans have stolen South African cattle, at least the traditional chief did not give any evidence. But even if there was proof, the issue should not be solved by South Africans crossing the border to come and "fetch" what is alleged to have been stolen from them. To have a country as a neighbor, is not like having a family as neighbors. There are appropriate channels for dealing with state matters. Second Situation. Allegedly to halt the exodus of Mozambicans to that country, and to block the flow of smugglers of assorted goods, South African soldiers deliberately made a unilateral decision: They dropped leaflets over the Mozambican territory threatening to electrify the border. Once more, this is a very worrisome situation. Probably there is to be an exodus of Mozambicans into South Africa. We say probably because we have no figures to confirm it. Likewise, there could probably be a flow of smugglers. But since one is dealing with a border issue, there are procedures to be followed. The South African authorities -- military, political, or others -- cannot make unilateral decisions. The measures to be taken should be discussed by the two states, according to international norms. Returning to the early issue. Mozambique has a vast border area with a number of countries: South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania. One cannot completely rule out the assumption that in future yet another of these states will take similar measures or even more serious ones. It will be recalled that the "Young Pioneers" issue has not yet been resolved. Among other issues... To say that 7,500 men are enough to defend Mozambique, is something one cannot understand in the least. It is difficult to understand the basis for such a proposal. The same can be said if the number is doubled. A total of 15,000 men is not enough to defend a third of the Mozambican territory. Even the 30,000 men that have been mentioned only serve to make the Mozambican state fragile and very vulnerable. The fact that Mozambique is poor, or the poorest in the world cannot by any means mean that the country should not have the minimum capacity to defend itself. If one is willing to help the country then one should not make the country fragile and without capacity to defend itself.
