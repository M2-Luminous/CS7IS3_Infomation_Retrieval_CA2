Yao said that he had been to Shenzhen and had made on-the-spot inspections on several occasions. Rather than following a feasible development plan, he insisted that Shenzhen has merely relied on foreign investment and backing from the central authorities and other localities. In addition, it depends on land sales. As foreign investment has slowed down, the city is now in a predicament. Yao Yilin said that many problems have been piling up in Shenzhen's social situation, the ranks of cadres, and urban construction. The central authorities are aware of the major problems, but solving them poses many difficulties.
