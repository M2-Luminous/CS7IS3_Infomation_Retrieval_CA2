Setting aside the differences that have brought Japan's political machine in Tokyo to a virtual standstill, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ex-cabinet ministers of different political stripes were busy contacting each other to keep abreast of developments in the air disaster. At a hastily arranged emergency cabinet session, Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP), was appointed head of a special task force to oversee the government's handling of the plane crash, government officials said. Ito and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, also of the SDP, will arrive in Nagoya Airport early Wednesday by helicopter. The SDP said early Tuesday it was quitting the post-Hosokawa coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata due to the sudden formation by five parties of an intraparliamentary group of which it was not informed. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary under the Hosokawa cabinet, was also involved in the China Airlines plane case, telling reporters, "politics is in an unusual stage, but we want to deal with (the issue) without delay." Under the Japanese Constitution, the departing cabinet has the responsibility to handle major day-to-day operations until the incoming administration is fully in place.
