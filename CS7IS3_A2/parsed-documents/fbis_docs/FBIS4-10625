Carles will be touring Chitre and Herrera Province tomorrow. After the networks ended, we asked presidential candidate Carles for his views on tonight's network. [Begin recording] [Carles] What can I say. It was the first time I saw it, and I am flabbergasted [words indistinct]. [Alvarado] Do you believe this is a political strategy by President Endara? [Carles] I am telling you [words indistinct]. [Alvarado] Do you think there should be an agreement.... [Carles, interrupting] Damn it, didn't you hear me? [end recording] [Alvarado] That was all Mr. Ruben Dario Carles told RPC Radio. We were shoved and pushed by Carles' bodyguards, who did not allow us to complete our job at the hotel; we had to leave the hotel. They did not let anyone else in. Mr. Carles remained sitting and meditating on a sofa. We were able to see tears running down his cheeks. We must stress, however, how poorly they are treating the members of the press who are trying to interview Carles, who is here in Chitre. If there is a question you would like to ask, please do. [Unidentified announcer] You said there were tears in Carles' eyes. Why? Is there any reason for this? [Alvarado] We were not allowed to do our job. Mr. Carles seemed to be angry after watching, on television, Mr. Endara's presentation. Mr. Carles was unable to answer our questions. We also saw other reporters try to interview him, but they were also turned away. We do not know if the tears and anger are the result of what he saw on television, or whether he felt something else against the president for showing this via a national network.
