A statement by the Defence Ministry carried by the press service of the Abkhazian parliament expressed determination of Abkhazia "to destroy all flying craft which violate the border". Russian experts fear that the situation in Abkhazia may aggravate in case any of the conflicting sides resorts to provocations. Tensions may spiral up, they believe, because both Georgia and Abkhazia occupy tough positions at the current talks in Moscow and often ignore reached agreements.
