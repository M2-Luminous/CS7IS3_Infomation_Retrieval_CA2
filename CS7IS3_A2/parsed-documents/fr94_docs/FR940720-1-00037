FR940720-1-00037 FR940720-1-00009 * * * * * 7.0␣ISSUES * * * * * 7.3␣Contents Issues may include annual reports, directories, lists, and similar material prepared as supplements (see C200). * * * * * 9.0␣BACK NUMBERS AND REPRINTS Second-class rates may be paid on mailings of back issues (if the publication's second-class entry is in effect); reprint copies of daily publications printed within 1 week of the issue date; and reprint copies of other than daily publications printed before the next issue is printed. Other mailings of reprint or back issues, including permanently bound reprint or back issues, are subject to the applicable First-, third-, or fourth-class rates. * * * * * 11.0␣ADVERTISING STANDARDS * * * * * 11.2␣Public Service Public service announcements are announcements for which no valuable consideration is received by the publisher, which do not include any matter related to the business interests of the publisher, and which promote programs, activities or services of federal, state, or local governments or of nonprofit organizations, or matters generally regarded as in the public interest. Public service announcements are not treated as advertising. * * * * * 5. Revise Domestic Mail Manual P070, Mixed Classes, to read as follows: P070␣Mixed Classes * * * * * 2.0␣ENCLOSURES IN SECOND-CLASS PUBLICATIONS * * * * * [Delete existing 2.4; renumber succeeding sections accordingly.] * * * * * 2.8␣Computing Permit Imprint Postage [Renumber as 2.7 and insert the following after the first sentence:] The enclosure is eligible for the rate for its class of mail that is most comparable to the presort, automation, and destination discounts that apply to the second-class host piece. For example, a third-class enclosure is eligible for the SCF entry discount if the publication is deposited at the destinating SCF. When more than one enclosure of the same class of mail is enclosed with a publication, they are treated as a single enclosure for computing postage. * * * * * 6. In Domestic Mail Manual P200, Second-Class Mail, renumber existing 1.7 through 1.11 as 1.8 through 1.12, respectively; delete existing 2.3; renumber 2.4 and 2.5 as 2.3 and 2.4, respectively; add new 1.7 to read as follows: P200␣Second-Class Mail 1.0␣BASIC INFORMATION * * * * * 1.7␣Measuring Advertising The total advertising and nonadvertising portions may be determined by column inches, square inches, pages, or by another recognized unit of measure, if the same unit of measure is used for both. One full page of advertising must equal one full page of nonadvertising regardless of the amount of blank space between each advertisement or nonadvertising article on a page. If measured in column inches, nonadvertising inches are determined by subtracting the total measured advertising inches from the total column inches of the publication. A blank page, portion of a page, or blank border or margin is counted as advertising if consideration was received for the whole page, the blank portion, or the blank border or margin. The border of a page is otherwise considered neither advertising nor nonadvertising and is not measured, but it is included in the total weight of the publication for purposes of postage calculation. When measuring nonrectangular sheets, the measurement is based on the smallest rectangle that could contain the irregular sheet; exact measurement is not attempted. When two or more sheets or parts thereof are glued together, the surface area of each sheet (front and back) is included when measuring the advertising or nonadvertising portion. * * * * * An appropriate amendment to 39 CFR 111.3 to reflect these changes will be published if the proposal is adopted.
