According to the tentative idea, both sides will reduce the number of their troops and weapons within 100 km all along the Sino-Russian border. Antiaircraft missiles and naval vessels are not included in the disarmament list, however. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov said that, if mainland China and Russia reach an agreement, then it will be the first disarmament accord in the Asian region, which will symbolize another peak of friendship between the two countries. Panov and the Russian General Staff Department addressed the issue of the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border and the level of armament there. If mainland China reaches a disarmament agreement with Russia in the north, it will redeploy its armed forces, which will, in turn, affect its southward development and the security of the Taiwan Strait. Panov pointed out: The Sino-Russian border is 4,300 km long, of which 3,700 km is delimited by rivers. Because the rivers frequently change course, territorial disputes have arisen. For example, each the two countries is still sticking to its own views on the ownership of three small islands in Heilongjiang and cannot reach a final conclusion. The Russian Government has proposed a "joint development" program and wishes to use economic means to solve the political problem. Beijing has shown interest in the proposal and both sides will discuss it further. In discussing the issue of border troops, Panov said: Mainland China and Russia are vigorously discussing border disarmament. If we reach an agreement, it will be a historic precedent. The Russian General Staff Department said: When Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visits Beijing in late May, it is hoped that the two countries will hold the 12th round of the disarmament conference and will reach a final agreement of disarmament so as to present it to Chernomyrdin as a gift for his visit to mainland China.
