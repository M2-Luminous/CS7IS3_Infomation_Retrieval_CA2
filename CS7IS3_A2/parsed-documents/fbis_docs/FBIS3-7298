Speaking at a working group meeting on steps to boost imports and improve market access, the third such meeting to be held under the administrative reform promotion headquarters led by the premier, Hosokawa said, "we need to establish an economically open society." "Our efforts should contribute to shrinking the differences in prices in Japan and abroad," he added, calling for active discussion of ways to rectify price differentials. Previous meetings focused on housing and real estate issues, and also conferred on information and telecommunications. The Japanese Government is planning to draw up market-liberalizing measures based on the discussions of the three working groups by late June, ahead of July's Group of Seven (G-7) summit. At the working group meeting, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said "drastic measures, not abstract ones," should be implemented. Experts from the private sector said that regulations should be revised to be more in line with international standards.
