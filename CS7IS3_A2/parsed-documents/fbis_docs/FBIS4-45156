They were certainly particularly remarkable in that they put into question several quite prevalent stereotypes in our society with respect to the elimination of chemical weapons. Thus, it can frequently be heard that the adoption in 1993 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons [CWC] and on their disposal may be viewed as a rather major victory of Russian diplomacy. As you know, this convention was personally signed by Andrey Kozyrev in January 1993 but has not yet been ratified by Russia. The appearances of experts involuntarily gave rise to the idea that by definition complete and comprehensive chemical disarmament, although desirable, is simply an unattainable dream. Indeed, any work in the field of chemistry may lead to the development of highly toxic substances and there is no way to prohibit this in advance. In principle, the production of toxic chemical agents is similar to the manufacture of many quite peaceful chemicals. This means that there will always be a production base that can be reoriented to military needs. By mixing some completely harmless substances whose production also cannot be prohibited, a powerful toxic agent arises. This principle, as you know, is the basis of binary weapons. All of this was reflected in the convention of 1993--it does not directly prohibit binary weapons and removes the laboratory production of toxic agents from international control. In other words, despite its name, the convention does not include a comprehensive prohibition of the production of toxic agents. Of course this defect in the convention stems from the very nature of chemical weapons. But this agreement also has other special features that are more difficult to explain through objective reasons. Under the convention, for example, the inspection trips of other countries are paid for by the state in whose territory the corresponding inspections are carried out. Considering that Russia has the largest stocks of chemical weapons in the world, it is not difficult to assume that we may simply be subjected to an invasion of inspectors. And is all of this supposed to be at our own expense? The convention will go into effect when it has been ratified by 65 states. Why not 90 and why not 130? After all, the elimination of chemical weapons would make sense if most of the countries of the world were participating in the convention, primarily those 25 that according to American assessments already have these weapons or are potentially capable of producing them. But, as you know, a quarter of these 25 countries did not even sign the convention and no one knows how many will ratify it. Some Arab states are waivering, referring to the fact that Israel does not want to take part in the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty. Italy has some doubts. It is worth noting that many of these 25 countries are located along the borders of Russia. So how many states really intend to participate in the treaty? Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation are proposing: "Let Russia be among the first to ratify the convention and then its example will induce other countries to join it." But are such calculations justified? The convention provides that its participants must introduce sanctions against states not participating in it by restricting their trade in various chemical materials. It is thereby supposed that by establishing a kind of chemical COCOM they can be induced to join the convention. This means that Russia together with the United States will introduce sanctions against some of their neighbors. And if Russia refuses to participate in the convention, then it cannot be ruled out that it itself will fall victim to such sanctions. Was it worth it to agree to include in the convention such double-edged conditions for Russia? A new international organization is being established to verify the execution of the convention. Russia will duly pay about 6 percent of its considerable budget but the convention does not give any guarantees that the possessor of the largest potential of toxic agents will be included in its governing bodies. Why were our diplomats unable to achieve this? The convention provides that all participants must eliminate their toxic agents within 10 years after it goes into effect. In the event that a threat to national interests can be proven, which itself is not a simple matter, this period can be extended by another 5 years. Hearings have shown that the United States will meet this deadline but if Russia is able to do so it will only be through a drastic increase in material expenditures. As a result of such haste, moreover, there will be a great increase in the risk of accidents with the most severe consequences, because the corresponding technologies are still far from being well developed. Why were deadlines accepted that are problematical for us but correspond with the planned time for the disposal of American toxic agents? Repesentatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs assert that if Russia refuses to participate in the convention, then no one will. But if Russia's role in this question is so great, why are they trying to convince us that all of the shortcomings enumerated above are the result of a compromise without which there would be no convention? Does this mean that in the course of the negotiations Russia was able to make conditions that other participants in the talks would have to consider? In general, all things considered, this is how it was until the end of the 1990's [as published]. In any event, until this time the Americans thought that there would be no convention and were particularly active in carrying out a program for the creation of binary weapons. And was it here that Russia changed its position? In general, there were many such "whys" in the hearings. It was also possible to find out one quite incredible thing. It turns out that neither at the moment of our signing the convention nor to this date has Russia had a confirmed national program for the disposal of its own stocks of toxic agents. This means that disposal technologies have not been selected, the sites for such disposal have not been determined, deadlines are unclear, and there is no coordination with the regions. It is also worth mentioning that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation solicited consent "at the top" for the signing of the convention, not considering the substantial reservations of very important ministries. Under these conditions, how can we take on international obligations? And in principle are we capable of meeting them? Judging by the opinion of specialists, this is more than problematical. Is it possible that all of the plans are already prepared and that they must merely be confirmed? Nothing of the sort. There is not even a single plan in the state program (or concept) but two, although they are similar to each other. It is still necessary to reach agreement with the regions and as a result conditions may be made (most likely fair conditions) that make it necessary to choose only particular technologies and to carry out a series of complex studies, which in principle may change the entire approach to the problem. All of this will take time. The necessary legislation is lacking. The main thing is that there is no funding and a great deal of it is required. It is interesting to compare the position of Russia with the approach of the United States to this convention. There they adopted the corresponding national program many years ago, when it became clear that the kinds of toxic agents that the Americans had were obsolete and the time of their guaranteed storage was passing. They appropriated money and determined the technologies and disposal sites. At the same time, the United States also initiated the elaboration of the mentioned convention. Its objectives were defined quite openly and clearly in the U.S. Congress: Since we are disposing of our chemical weapons, it is necessary to induce the USSR and other countries to do the same (the U.S. Embassy was kind enough to provide the corresponding materials on this to the Duma). As they say, commentary is superfluous here. What is it all about and where did such a strange policy of Russia come from? Why were our diplomats so conciliatory in the negotiations? Was it only because world public opinion condemns chemical weapons? The hearings, of course, did not provide an answer to this question. Nevertheless, one can try to offer the following partial explanation. The fact is that participation in the convention is the basis for demands for the necessary financing from the government and Federal Assembly and it is also a unique weapon to break down the resistance of the regions. The convention will induce acceptance of the state program without any particular objections, it may eliminate the need to perform an overly detailed national ecological study, and will facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws. It is probable that the supporters of Russian participation in the convention truly calculated everything correctly. The existence of international obligations will doubtless be a major stimulus. Moreover the convention may become a means for the receipt of endless above-plan financing. Indeed, the United States, with stocks of 30 million tonnes of toxic agents [corrected to 30,000 tonnes in 10 June NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA], initially planned to spend about $2 billion for their disposal. Subsequently this figure increased to $5 billion and it is now almost $10 billion. And if the technology of incineration is rejected, then expenditures will amount to $15 billion. We have 40 million tonnes [corrected to 40,000 tonnes in 10 June NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] of toxic agents. For their disposal, they are also asking for a little over $2 billion. Is this figure realistic? It is hard to say. The largest share of the expenditures will go to construction and a significant share will be for operation of the facilities. The prices in Russia for construction, complex equipment, and the payment of qualified specialists are now approaching world prices and in some cases they have already exceeded them. This means that our expenditures for the disposal of toxic agents will also be close to those of the Americans and may also rise to $15 billion. It seems that a similar situation developed with respect to the START-1 treaty. As far as the author knows, the money allocated for its realization has already been spent and the treaty is far from being completed. But the corresponding departments are not concerned, knowing that as much as they ask for will be given for the treaty. Of course this is only a conjecture but it may be that it is precisely for this reason that all of our draft concepts and programs for the disposal of chemical weapons are oriented to the 1993 convention rather than the question of ratification being oriented to the existence of money and the technical means and to public opinion. What should be done now? The Committee for International Affairs first of all recommended that in the resolution of questions involving the disposal of toxic agents one should proceed not so much from the requirements of the 1993 convention as from our real and physical possiblities and also that consideration be given to precisely Russian public opinion, especially in the regions. This certainly suggests that because of the lack of adequate financial and physical resources Russia will take the course of disposing of its toxic substances at a slower pace than was foreseen by the 1993 convention, especially since no substantial foreign assistance is expected. Of course to do so it will be necessary to overcome a certain amount of pressure from countries of the West. It is also important to consider the fact that the risk of ecological disasters, which judging by everything cannot be ruled out anyway (there are simply no absolutely safe technologies at this time, even in the West) will increase enormously because of the utilization of undeveloped methods in the hasty disposal of chemical weapons. By the way, this circumstance caused some deputies to doubt: Are there not some people in the West who, in "giving" us their technologies, are actually getting an opportunity to work them out on the Russians? Only a small part of the Russian toxic agents need to be destroyed rather quickly--about 6,000 tonnes of quite old munitions--and this requires the allocation of funds in any case. The remaining stocks of toxic agents can be stored for a long time yet, spending only about $5 million a year for this. Independent experts stated at the hearings that careful checks of many cases showed that the "chemical diseases" of local inhabitants are actually the result of the action of sometimes unnoticeable but absolutely uncontrolled civilian production rather than leaks from military facilities. In the course of a year in the country as a whole, the military registers just one or two cases of acute contamination and this, as a rule, does not happen at facilities for the storage of toxic agents. Another matter is the declassification of the sites where toxic agents were disposed of during all the years of Soviet authority. Here it is indeed probable that people are living in dangerous places without even suspecting this. The participants in the hearings gave a direct recommendation to carry out such declassification. One should also consider the fact that the quantity of toxic agents destroyed in the USSR is not so great in relative terms. The well-known Vil Mirzayanov speaks of 400,000 tonnes but it appears that he has exaggerated this figure by a factor of four, although he probably did not intend to do so. Apparently this data should also be declassified to avoid inflaming passions. By the way, the position of Mirzayanov in the hearings is worthy of mention in more detail. He understands very well the shortcomings of the convention, which were addressed above, and states frankly that it "does not correspond to the national interests of the Russian Federation" (I quote from the verbatim account--V.T.), because it does not prohibit the West from continuing the development of the latest types of toxic agents. It is useful also to pay atention to the military aspect of the possession of chemical weapons. Of course they are inhumane and will effect primarily the civilian population. At the same time, however, they are a significant deterrent factor, especially in their latest modifications, and it is also by no means wise to ignore this circumstance. It is clear that less than a dozen saboteurs armed with the latest binary toxic agent are capable of delivering such a retaliatory strike against any state (against military facilities, of course) and that this will certainly take away even the desire to think about carrying out "peacemaking" actions such as those in Somalia on the territory of Russia. Under conditions of the total collapse of our army, the disappearance of a unified air defense system for the country, and the unconsidered elimination of nuclear weapons, one probably ought to think once again whether or not it is right to renounce such an effective and relatively inexpensive weapon, especially unilaterally. By the way, it is also worth mentioning that there are chemical compounds that do not kill people but are capable of paralyzing them temporarily. There are substances that disable engines and destroy tires. In connection with the events in the Balkans, the United States issued the public reminder that it has such possibilities. It is also well known that although the United States is demanding that we destroy all of our military production, they themselves do not want to do this. There are several reasons for this. The American production systems are more "flexible" and can easily be reorganized for the execution of peaceful tasks. By the way, the reverse transformation is not complicated. It will doubtless be interesting to the readers to learn that if necessary the United States is capable of beginning the industrial production of combat toxic agents, including binary, within two (two!) months, performing several necessary stages in their outfitting. This would also be useful information to the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, who at the hearings fiercely sought to convince those present that the 1993 convention prohibits binary toxic agents precisely because their industrial production can be begun only after a number of intermediate experimental stages, which are not permitted by the convention. According to a notice from the U.S. Embassy sent to the Duma in connection with the hearings, the United States is ceasing only those activities that are prohibited by the convention of 1993. And which ones are not prohibited? The Americans also reported that a number of countries are continuing to produce not only chemical weapons but are even working on bacteriological weapons. It seems that it is worthwhile to give thought to this information. After all, we are being told that it is a matter of the prohibition of weapons that have become outdated. Are they really outdated? In conclusion, it is also interesting to note that not a single one of the many agreements in the area of chemical disarmament that Russia has signed recently with other countries provides for a ratification procedure. And in one of them, for example, the Russian side directly promised to become a participant in the convention of 1993. So are they trying to present the Duma with a fait accompli and deprive it of the opportunity to choose? This is not ruled out, for it is not permitted to make stipulations in the treaty. For the time being, the deputies of the Duma are recommending to the president and government at least to maintain the personnel and scientific base involved with chemical weapons, without which within several years it will not be possible to dispose of toxic agents safely with any technologies. And it is precisely then that something irreparable may happen.
