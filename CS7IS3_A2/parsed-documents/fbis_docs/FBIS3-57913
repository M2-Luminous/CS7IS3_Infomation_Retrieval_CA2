As economy minister, it is he who has guided the reform. He explained its main outlines. [LIBERATION] Why give the Bank of France its independence so quickly? [Alphandery] At first, there was a desire to improve the monetary environment of the French economy: French interest rates had hitherto incorporated a major risk premium because the medium-term monetary strategy was not sufficiently readable. However, one of the ways of reducing this risk premium -- costly for the economy, because it affects the interest rate level -- is to guarantee the independence of the issuing institution in the conduct of monetary policy so as to increase the currency's credibility. Moreover, it is common knowledge that the Beregovoy government considered this at the beginning of 1993. [LIBERATION] The promised independence of the Bank of France is not the only factor that has contributed to the reduction of this risk premium.... [Alphandery] No, but it has contributed to it. On 29 March, on the eve of the parliamentary election, when we announced the plan, the difference between French and German three-month interest rates was 2.81 percent to France's detriment. It is now only 0.38 percent. In the same period of time, the risk premium has virtually disappeared for 10-year rates. [LIBERATION] It must also be said that the controversies within the majority on monetary policy have disappeared. [Alphandery] It is true that we now enjoy a broad consensus. [LIBERATION] Surely the reduction in rates is not the only justification for the independence of the Bank of France? [Alphandery] Naturally not. Several fundamental reasons justify this reform. The first that comes to mind is the implementation of the Treaty on European Union. However, the idea for the independence of the Bank of France is an older one, at least for the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and the RPR [Rally for the Republic]. It comes from the unhappy memory of the 1981 recovery: Then, the budget deficit was financed by increasing the money supply. At the time, the independence of the Bank of France could have played the role of safeguard. That is why prominent figures like Balladur, Barre, Giscard d'Estaing, and even Pasqua very quickly defended this reform in turn. [LIBERATION] And yet there was no need for France to move so quickly... [Alphandery] Perhaps not. But in addition to the reasons already given, there is another, deeper reason: The eighties were characterized throughout the world, including the formerly socialist countries, by a speeding up of the decentralization of decisionmaking. People realized that this is the best method of managing modern economies. This is the meaning of the policies pursued almost everywhere: privatizations, return to market mechanisms, or even the independence of issuing institutions. By this legislation, France has adopted a modern approach. [LIBERATION] The modern approach to which you refer nonetheless raises several essential political questions. What happens to the pilot? The independence of monetary policy -- like privatization -- reduces the economy minister's powers. What purpose will your successor serve? [Alphandery] This question of the pilot is not limited to France. We are not taking an untrodden path. We are not implementing a reform which has no reference point in the world: Where is the pilot in the United States, in Germany, in Switzerland? Nobody asks that. The real question is the distribution of powers between a central bank and the minister in charge of the economy. Hitherto in France there was a close association between the governor of the Bank of France and the minister for the administration of monetary policy. But the ultimate responsibility for that policy rested with the government. Today, the ultimate responsibility for the decisions to cut or increase interest rates will rest with the Monetary Policy Council. But the bridges to the minister will not be cut: Consultation and discussion will obviously be maintained as is the case in the United States or in Germany. And, moreover, dialogue means democracy. [LIBERATION] Democracy can also mean conflict. A situation of antagonism can be imagined. [Alphandery] There may be differences of opinion and, in that case, each will shoulder the responsibilities stipulated by the law. You know, the Monetary Policy Council will not live in secret in rue de La Vrilliere: Independence does not mean irresponsibility. There will be regular hearings at which the governor will address the Parliamentary Finance Commissions, there will be public reports, and press comment. The Bank of France will be forced to take public positions on subjects which go beyond monetary policy proper. It already does so, read for instance the annual reports addressed to the president of the republic. Monetary policy and economic policy cannot be conducted in isolation. [LIBERATION] The central bank will also have to have a dialogue with the other European central banks within the European Monetary Institute [EMI] which has just been established in Frankfurt. Do you think that between now and the creation of the single European currency, a concerted monetary policy is possible within this institute? [Alphandery] Consultation among the central banks existed already within the Council of Governors. The EMI, which replaces it, will go further, because it must think about what form the future Central European Bank will take. The EMI must prepare the third and final phase of the union process and answer some fundamental questions: How to pursue a monetary policy at European level, how to harmonize interventions on the money markets among the various European central banks? [LIBERATION] But do you think it is conceivable that under EMI auspices concerted monetary policy decisions will be made: a cut in rates, for instance? [Alphandery] It is not expected at all, because the central banks are independent until the start of the third phase. The EMI must not replace the central banks. Consultation has never meant joint decision. [LIBERATION] What philosophy governed the choice of members of the Monetary Policy Council? [Alphandery] We tried to form a credible council at national and international level: The people chosen had to have real influence. The other concern was to guarantee that the various council members had pursued different careers.
