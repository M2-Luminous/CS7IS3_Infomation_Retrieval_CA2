The expression of this Belgian concern comes after the announcement on Saturday of the "resignation" of the Constitutional Court following an earlier announcement -- ten days ago -- of the cancellation "until a later date" of the investiture ceremony for the new Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira, observers report. Problems continue to beset Burundi where a "ghost town day" action was observed in the capital Bujumbura on Monday with all shops and offices remaining closed, a number of concordant sources confirmed. Three members of the Tutsi ethnic group were also apparently killed on Monday by other civilians when a coach was attacked on the road between Mware (in the center of the country) and Bujumbura, the same sources report. Five members of the now resigned Constitutional Court -- including its president Mr. Gerard Nyungeko -- also protested on Monday in a joint communique signed by the parties concerned and received in Brussels, in which they condemn the "illegal nature of this measure" which they consider to be "null and void." They claim this is due to "abnormalities of form" and "pretexts." The communique signatories state that the joint dismissal of certain members of the Court was solely motivated by the desire to "avoid at all costs the remaining danger of the Court declaring the presidential election of 13 January last as invalid." In any event, the Belgian Government has restated its support for the government of the prime minister, Sylvie Kinigi, and elected President Ntaryamira, and calls upon "all forces in the Burundian nation to cooperate in the national reconciliation." Belgium had supported the process of democratization which resulted in free elections and the founding of democratic institutions, recalls the communique from the Belgian Foreign Ministry.
