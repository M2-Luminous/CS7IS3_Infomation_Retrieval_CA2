But greater openness is required if only to dispel the rumors that two islands near Khabarovsk in the Amur River and Bolshoy Island in the Argun River will soon share the fate of Damanskiy; that is, they will be transferred to the Chinese. In actual fact Russia does not intend to give these three islands away. An informed source has reported that our Border Troops subunit, military base, and recreation center are located on the islands near Khabarovsk and that we regard them as Russian soil. At the same time Moscow is prepared to continue holding talks on these islands. Because abandoning the talks could lead only to an escalation of tension. In fact, the same happened at the time the USSR existed, when M.S. Gorbachev stated that the problem of the islands had been solved once and for all. This provoked a strong reaction in Beijing. Not long before the last round of talks, which ended a few days ago in the PRC capital, Chinese representatives hinted that they were prepared to concede Bolshoy Island if Russia took the same step in relation to the two islands in the Amur. From Moscow's viewpoint this is an unacceptable idea. Therefore at the meeting in Beijing all the sides could do was to again recognize the existence of radical differences and postpone a solution to the question of the islands to an unspecified time in the future. The talks on the line of the border between China and Tajikistan were also deadlocked. It is a question of control of part of the Pamir. The scale of the differences is indicated by the fact that China is laying claim to approximately one-third of the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast. But bearing in mind that this is an area in which Tajik armed opposition forces are especially active, it will be understood why Beijing is not trying to force a settlement of this dispute. It too has been postponed until a better time. It should not be concluded from the foregoing that the Beijing meeting ended in failure. Far from it. With the exception of the islands in the two rivers and the Pamir, the differences concerning other sectors of the border between the PRC and the CIS, which is over 7,000 km long, are being successfully overcome. In the sector to the east of Mongolia a border line has already been drawn on the map, and on-site demarcation work is now under way. Nor should complications arise over the western sector of the Russian-Chinese border, which is 54 km long. As regards relations between China and Kazakhstan, a border agreement between them is expected to be signed this spring, during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Almaty. In addition, a source considers it a positive feature that the representatives of the three Asiatic CIS states are collaborating closely with Russia and are relying on the informational material accumulated by our diplomacy. The next round of talks will take place in one of the CIS states.
