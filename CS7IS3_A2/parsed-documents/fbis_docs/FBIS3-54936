In the statement dated December 31 but conveyed to TASS only today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ultranationalist party describes its motion as "a new year gift" and expresses hope that this decree will be "a step towards consolidation of society". The draft decree also suggests that the trial over the August 1991 pro-communist coup plotters be terminated "for lack of corpus delicti", as well as that all people mixed up in the October 1993 events on both sides "be relieved from any responsibility". The authors of the draft decree propose placing the jailed masterminders of the October uprising under home arrest and then banning them, as well as some of the August coup leaders, from going in for politics for three years.
