In a statement in Pretoria, the council said senior administrative members had left for De Brug to urge striking trainee peacekeepers to return to work. NPKF members refused training on Tuesday when they discovered they were being paid at the lowest rate for their particular rank, instead of at the highest rate which they had been promised. The highest rates had been recommended by the NPKF Command Council to the Transitional Executive Council Sub-Council on Defence. However, the sub-council had only approved the lowest rates. A TEC management committee delegation would also visit the base soon, the statement said.
