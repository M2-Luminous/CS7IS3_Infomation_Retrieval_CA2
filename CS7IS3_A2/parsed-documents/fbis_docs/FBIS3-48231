There must be only one Cambodian territory within the territorial integrity recognized since 1962. It is indivisible. However, as all of you know, I came here on my provincial tour to look at the overall situation and especially to see if there is potential for boosting our economy, because up to the present our national budget has proved to be insufficient if we are to rely only on taxes. The national income in 1994 is just $280 million and that is not enough. The tax money will run out soon. The bulk of our budget comes from international aid. So, if we Cambodians only rely on taxes and international aid, we will experience great difficulties one day. As I said, the budget of 1994 is not sufficient. We need to attract as much foreign investment as possible. I and His Excellency Second Prime Minister Hun Sen together with the government delegation recently visited China. We saw great prosperity in China. China claims to be a communist state but in reality it is communist only because it still adorns itself with red flags. Besides that, there is nothing communist about China. It is very, very prosperous. For this reason, my wish is to see our people's living standard improve. We are poor but we have so much natural resources. We should let others come in to exploit them. To attract investors into our country, there must be four main factors, as the Chinese have just told me. First, there must be political stability and security. We could form our royal coalition government because all major parties listened to the correct advice of our venerated king. So, we have been united and this has led to a degree of political stability. As for the Khmer Rouge problem, I have already said that we must settle it peacefully. However, if the Khmer Rouge refuse, what can I do? One day the national assembly and the royal government would blame me, Ranariddh, for that. But I have tried and I must continue to try. There is another kind of stability. I would like to take this opportunity to deal with the important issue of staging demonstrations. This issue is closely related to human rights. The government, the constitution strictly stipulates respect for human rights. At the same time we all recognize that the Kingdom of Cambodia is a legal state, a state that abides by the law. Everything must be undertaken within the legal framework. For example, there is the press law, the law on holding demonstrations, and the law on staging strikes. These laws are respected in all developed countries, such as the French Republic which has professed democracy since 1789, the United States, and Germany. As far as democracy is concerned, these countries are very developed. Still, they are under the law. Having laws does not mean that freedom and human rights are stunted. Guarantees for democracy and human rights can be made through laws. Respect for laws guarantees democracy and legality. Therefore, the people are asked to please be more understanding. We do not forbid you from staging demonstrations and strikes. Before reaching the stage of demonstrations and strikes, however, there are many other solutions. The royal government is here to help you solve your problems. Moreover, everything should be made within the legal framework. If we stray from the legal framework, I am afraid the Khmer Rouge might take the opportunity to instigate unrest. I am not going to detail the possible dangers of staging demonstrations, but if there are some disturbances, what should our authorities, our royal government do? They would have to react. If this happens, one thing that you want -- that is, democracy -- will surely be hurt. So, I beg you to have pity for the nation. It does not mean that we are not trying to solve these problems for you. The royal government has the duty and obligation to solve all kinds of problems. Second, if there are endless demonstrations, those who want to invest in our country, and there are many who do, would be frightened away. The investors have made me understand that they are most afraid of endless demonstrations in our country. They do not believe we have achieved political stability. If we do not have political stability, they will not come to invest in our country. We would remain poor and then where would we get the money to improve our lot? Therefore, if we want to have sufficient schools, hospitals, and medicine and prosperity for the people, we should make them come in to invest, to open many factories, and to create as many jobs for our people as possible. Thus, we must never frighten them away. They are very afraid of the volatile situation in Cambodia. They are afraid of the unrest in our society more than the Khmer Rouge. This is a fact. Since we are talking about social stability, let us also mention the issue of contracts with the former State of Cambodia. If there is perpetual revision of these contracts, no one will have any trust in the future ones. They have said that just a few demonstrations were sufficient for us to revise contracts. I am not saying that we must not improve on them. We must make arrangements to improve on them, but let us not give potential investors the feeling of uncertainty about the future of contracts. Do not make them live in doubt about whether we are going to revise their contracts. The investors are most worried about the safety of their investment of hundreds of millions of dollars. I also would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the Olympic market problem. In my capacity as the first prime minister, I would like to promise that I will do my best to solve this problem without harming the interests of both the businessmen and the poor. Nevertheless, to solve problems one needs to be understanding and compromising. It is not possible to let one side win 100 percent and another side to lose 100 percent. We cannot permit one side to make excessive profit at the expense of the other, and vice versa. Statemanship, his majesty the king told me, is different from demagogy. I am a statesman and not a demagogue. I would prefer not to compete with demagogues. I would rather resign. Those who advocate statesmanship cannot compete with those who advocate demagogy. The people are asked to please understand that. Our government is not even three months old yet. That is what China called political and social stability. The second factor, according to the Chinese, is cheap labor. We have plenty of labor in Cambodia. At least 2,000 young students graduate every year and they have nowhere to go. The problem is brewing here too. We must find jobs for them. So, we have plenty of labor and our labor is as cheap, if not cheaper than China's. The third factor is real estate. Our land is still cheap compared to Hong Kong. We can solve this land problem despite the fact that there are many land speculators. We must correct this land situation. No one should be allowed to grab land at will. The state should impound state land. If we do not do this, we will not have land for foreign investors to come in and invest their money. This does not mean that we sell land to them. This does not mean that we Cambodians are less nationalistic than the likes of Messrs. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Li Peng. The Chinese are doing what they are doing for the common interest of their nation. We must imitate them. Therefore, I beg those who are occupying land illegally to please return it to the state so that the state can grant it to investors for them to build factories on. The brothers who are living in poverty will then be given land to live elsewhere by the state and they will have jobs. They will therefore enjoy a better future. The fourth factor is profit sharing. Investors should be given at least a 20 percent profit. That is in China. In our country a 20 percent profit seems very small because investors are not certain of their future here. Only when they see that they might gain more than 20 percent will they invest in our country. It is simple. We have no money at all and we want them to come in with their investment money. If they do not make profits they will not come. You might want to ask me what our state will get out of it. The other day, I was told by the Chinese that our state would get a lot. We would have factories, for one thing. If they build factories in our country, where will these factories go? Where will the machinery in these factories go? In 10 years, 15 years, or 20 years they will become ours. And to say that we have not built them ourselves. We now have no jobs and we are so miserable but we will have jobs and will be better off. Workers in Chinese factories are paid much better than state officials. What I wish to have most is jobs. We will be able to levy taxes and collect rents. The big profits we will make will be in 15, 20, or 30-year contracts. A hotel named [words indistinct] from Hong Kong and America built in Guangdong where I and His Excellency Hun Sen were staying was under a 50-year contract with China. The Chinese are not afraid to go into a 50-year contract and will you say that the Chinese are less patriotic than we are? Not at all. They do virtually everything for the survival of their nation and for their economic development. China's economy is the hottest in the world and I wish Cambodia's is like that. Just going around saying that we need to take from the rich and give to the poor is make believe. It is like Zorro in the movie. You know Zorro with the black mask in the movie. That kind of economy goes nowhere. So, I would refuse if I am asked to go into a contest for demagogy. Statesmanship has a different language from that of demagogy. Four or five years from now, maybe, it will be alright for us to practice demagogy for the elections. But now our problems are that we have no rice to eat and our people have no medicine and no schools. The same thing can be said of the call for pay raises. I would like to ask those who have demanded pay raises whether the budget of our Economy and Finance Ministry can absorb all those adjustments? We have only $280 million now. When we no longer get international aid, where will we get the money for the raises? There can be raises only when our national budget amounts to $1 billion, $2 billion, or $3 billion and not $280 million as it is now. Where can we get the extra money? [Words indistinct] but what we need is social and political stability so that other countries can come in and invest in tourism, where our ancestors left us with the world's unique wonder of Angkor Wat; in agriculture such as rubber, of which we can exploit only 50,000 hectares and need to plant an additional 150,000 hectares, and also in new crops. In the past, under Sangklum Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's pre-1970 ruling party], we exported as much as 800,000 metric tons of rice. We exported 800,000 metric tons of rice in 1970. Ironically, we are short of rice now. Those of you who are patriots are begged to please stay around the royal government and help it solve the agricultural problem which is a major issue, an issue of our livelihood. We all must work to get investments and factories. As you know, in 1997 Hong Kong will be closed. Many countries around us want to come here. If we are not careful, let me tell you, investors will surely flock to Vietnam instead. Vietnam is enjoying stability and it is badmouthing us by telling everybody not to come to Cambodia because there are demonstrations everyday and the Khmer Rouge continue to be intractable. Why do you want to go to Cambodia, they say. Come to Vietnam where there are neither demonstrations nor the Khmer Rouge. Come and invest in Vietnam. In Cambodia you have to pay 30 percent in taxes, but in Vietnam you only pay 10 percent. I beg all of you to be understanding. Some have claimed that they cannot sleep. Me too, I cannot sleep at night. We are poor and we need to find ways to get money. We are getting very little aid. Do you know that when I went to China, that China gave us an interest-free loan of only $8 million? That is not much. Besides that, China only asked us to go into joint ventures in the PRC. There is neither much bilateral aid nor much multilateral aid. So, we must seek ways to increase our own resources so that we will earn important national capital. In the meantime we must allow other countries to invest here. As I have said, the main factor needed in our country is stability. So, in conclusion I beg of all of you for pity and understanding. This does not mean that Ranariddh forbids demonstrations. I would like to stress again and again that so long as I remain first prime minister of the royal government, I pledge that I will always respect human rights and your right to stage demonstrations and strikes. The first thing I ask from you is that you should stay within the legal framework and behave yourselves like those in developed, civilized, countries. The second thing is that you should kindly rely on the royal government and let it take care of your problems first. You can stage demonstrations within the legal framework only after it fails. You should not forget that people are watching us. Since 23 October 1991, since the general elections, and since the formation of the royal government and the return of the constitutional monarchy, as his majesty has said, we have entered a new era, an era of independence, territorial integrity, and full sovereignty and an era in which we are making efforts to develop the nation in all fields. That is all. I come here with all their excellencies and not just for rest and recreation at Kep. I have to take a look there because it is a tourist site we must promote. It is not for tourism only because I know that China needs coconuts. Their coconut factories are extremely successful. They are selling coconut milk all over the world but they need 300 million coconuts every year. Their Hainan island can produce only 100 million coconuts and they have to import 200 million from Vietnam. I came here to see whether Kampot Province could sell coconuts to China. [applause] I would like to inform you that Thailand is very successful in raising shrimp for export. I came here also to see whether we can be like the Thais. If they can do it, we can do it. There should not be much difference between us. Thank you.
