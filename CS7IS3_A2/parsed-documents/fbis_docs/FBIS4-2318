Since mainland China expanded opening and allowed reporters outside the mainland to cover news on the mainland, Xi Yang is the first to be sentenced to a stern prison term for offending criminal law. Although he is not a permanent resident of Hong Kong, because he was working with a mass media institution in Hong Kong when he violated the law, his case attracted close attention among journalistic circles and the public of Hong Kong. On 27 September, China's official news media dispatched a report saying that Xi Yang was suspected of being involved in the illegal activities of stealing and prying into state monetary secrets in violation of the "PRC State Security Law," and was detained by the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau for investigation that day. On 7 October, another report said that the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate approved the arrest of Xi Yang, and before that, Tian Ye, another accused person in the same case and a cadre of the State Administration of Exchange Control, had also been arrested according to law. The report said: "The monetary secrets stolen by Xi and Tian included the secret plan of the People's Bank of China for adjusting interest rates of deposits and loans, the secret decision of the same bank on participating in international gold trading, and other major monetary secrets. This caused serious consequences." The same report also quoted a responsible official of the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau as saying that "the behavior of Xi and Tian violated PRC criminal law and was not relevant to a reporter's normal news coverage." After investigation, the procuratorate filed an indictment against Xi Yang on 14 December, and the case was handled by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court. Because the case was related to state secrets, according to the relevant provisions of criminal law procedure, it was decided that the trial would not be an open one. The court completed the first trial and passed sentence in late March. Xi Yang refused to accept the sentence and lodged an appeal to the higher level court. So far, the court verdict has not been officially made public. Because the process of the trial was not open, people on the outside knew very little about the case. Upon finding out that Xi Yang was sentenced to 12 years in prison several days ago, many people were shocked. Although the Chinese authorities repeatedly stated that Xi Yang's case had no relation to reporters' normal news coverage activities and repeatedly stressed that the Chinese Government would guarantee the rights of reporters from outside the mainland to engage in activities related to their trade, journalists in Hong Kong still expressed strong misgivings. There were various conjectures as people were unaware of the facts. Members of the "Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in China," who are always trying to stir up trouble, took advantage of this event to instigate unrest among the people. In fact, they tried to seek a pretext to undermine the confidence of Hong Kong people in the policy of "one country, two systems." From the very beginning, Xi Yang's case attracted extensive and close attention, and Chinese judicial authorities also obviously attached great importance to the handling of this case and did not treat it recklessly. A responsible person of China's Supreme People's Court answered the relevant inquiries of the Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC], and Chinese government officials also answered relevant questions raised by overseas Chinese and foreign visitors. However, the court had to independently conducted the trial without being influenced by administrative organs and external forces. In his work report to the NPC session last month, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, stressed that "people's courts at all levels must consistently base their trials and sentences on facts and strictly take law as the yardstick; and they must strictly follow specific and procedural laws when handling cases, and properly handle every case in the spirit of being highly responsible to the people's interests and state laws." They "must persistently exercise the right of independent trial and judgment according to law." He also said: "Maintain the system of open trials, and put the activities of trial and judgment under supervision of the people through open investigations, open debates, and open announcement of sentences and court judgments." Although Xi Yang's case could not be dealt with in an open hearing because of its special conditions, it is still necessary to let the public see the correctness of the judicial decision. In the details of Xi Yang's case, the most noticeable point for journalistic circles in Hong Kong was whether the major secrets were all used for news reporting. Some Hong Kong NPC deputies, some Hong Kong affairs advisers, and some political organizations have urged the Beijing authorities to appropriately make public the details of the case as long as this does not affect the fairness of the judicial proceedings in order to remove people's misgivings. In order to safeguard state interests, China enacted the State Security Law and the Law on Protecting State Secrets. Public security and procuratorial authorities are on the alert against the sabotage and secret-stealing activities of internal and external hostile forces. On the other hand, the mainland of China needs to introduce modernization, reform, and opening to Hong Kong and overseas areas, and Hong Kong also needs to learn more about the real situation on the mainland. Journalists in Hong Kong are thus performing important duties of covering and reporting news. The Chinese Government has also indicated many times that it attaches great importance to the positive role of the mass media in Hong Kong.
