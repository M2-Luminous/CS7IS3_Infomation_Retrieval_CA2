As always on Monday, we present to you a traditional radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of parliament and head of state. Batono Eduard, in connection with President Yeltsin's visit [to Georgia on 3 and 4 February], you said the following: This is the most important event in the hundreds of years of history of relations between Russia and Georgia. Before, Russia's Soviet leaders would be visiting a periphery, while today the leader of one of the world's greatest countries is coming to an independent country. The president of a friendly neighboring country is visiting us as equal partners. What are the grounds for such a statement? Is it a Russian foreign policy as regards Georgia? Is it that the world is different today? Or is it Georgia's status, the fact that Georgia is, at least de jure, an independent state? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The grounds for what I stated are in the law which has not yet been passed, but which will become the rule of life on our planet at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. What is unacceptable for and incompatible with the new rules of cohabitation, the new principles -- I mean former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, including Abkhazia, Samachablo [South Ossetia], and some others...[pauses] In my opinion this is an anomaly, a vestige of the old reactionary and obsolete thinking and practice. The epoch of violence, the epoch of the rule of arms as they say, must end, and I am sure it will end. The next century must be a century of universal ideals taking root. The foundation of this is now being laid. We can see and feel that that time is coming. However, these new relations have to be built. The new century, the new order, this new construction consists of bricks and [word indistinct]. One of such bricks is the new relations between Russia and Georgia. These new relations should heal our sores, be it Abkhazia, the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, economic hardship, or something else which accompanies the birth of an independent country. The birth process is painful by itself. I am sure that these pains will go away and a new time will come. Speaking in general and without going into detail, this is how I see relations between Russia and Georgia and their prospects. These are my hopes. One more thing. I think that such an approach to these problems and issues -- the building of relations among the countries of the former Soviet Union on the model of relations between Russia and Georgia, and enshrined in the documents we are now preparing -- is in Russia's interests. Not only Georgia's own interests are involved in this but also Russia's interests. One can talk about Russia's new role at this complex and tense time on our planet. [Oniani] Such relations must develop between Georgia and Russia. However, the most important subject of discussion at present, during these talks, will be the problem of Abkhazia. I will remind the listeners about something you said last week. Georgia has a lot to say [at the Russo-Georgian summit]. We need a lot which cannot be solved without Russia. First of all, this relates to Abkhazia. On 10 February the Georgian refugees are to return, initially to Gali rayon. Who can give guarantees to the population of Abkhazia, the refugees, especially in the light of recent events in the Kodori gorge? [Shevardnadze] Speaking about the old Soviet space, in relation to Georgia in particular, we must pay attention to the fact that a new model for settling conflicts is emerging -- a UN effort combined with a Russian peace mission. I do not want to explain this in detail because everybody can see what we are dealing with. Such an approach will be important for the modern world, for Georgia and maybe for other countries as well. The UN potential is limited at present. Everybody can see this. My experience tells me that the UN is simply unable to cope with all conflicts. Realistically speaking, I think that in the example of our conflict the UN can act as a facilitator in settling the conflict. It can deal with issues relating to the creation of a legal foundation. [Oniani] So, in general, it could be a mediator but not a doer. [Shevardnadze] Becoming a doer is a difficult process. Today a UN Security Council meeting is to be held. I know approximately what kind of resolution the Security Council will adopt. This again will not be a direct participation in settling and solving the conflict. Therefore, I think that combining the UN potential and Russia's new role and approach -- a model which is to be tested on our example -- is rather promising. I attach a certain degree of hope and optimism to that. As for the return from 10 February, it is difficult to talk about it now because, speaking of real guarantees, the results of the talks between Russia and Georgia should produce such guarantees. That is because, physically and practically, UN forces will not have time to enter the area [before the 10 February deadline]. I understand people who feel that we should start to return [to Abkhazia] from 10 February. I think it is right to look at the issue this way. [Oniani] Your statements regarding new relations between Russia and Georgia must have irritated the Abkhazian side. I remind you of their recent statements. They gave a negative assessment of Russia's role. The Abkhazian authorities are irritated by new Georgian-Russian relations; for example, Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In their opinion, Russia is biased in our favor in its involvement in Abkhazia. Are there any grounds to justify this? Can one say that this is a result of steps taken by Georgian diplomacy? [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we can speak now about our successful steps. You know that a lot has irritated us in this conflict. A lot has been said. However, irritation is a bad symptom when one speaks about high-level politics, big national interests, be it Abkhazian, Georgian, or Russian interests. Therefore, we must all reconcile ourselves to the fact that there are certain principles which should be obeyed by all nations, large and small. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week you met representatives of law enforcement bodies. Among other things, the meeting heard that it is necessary to finally establish and make public who is behind the gangs which have been arrested. It was also said at the meeting that the state apparatus would be examined for drug addiction. You said that you could be the first to take a blood test. There is talk that many persons were arrested but later released, and that these measures stop at a certain level. [Shevardnadze] I was more specific in my address which was broadcast. Now I would put it this way. Every week and day of our life has its own features. Last week we summed up the results of the state of emergency, discussing what the state of emergency gives us in practice. I would say that despite everyday difficulties the results are impressive. I will list some results. The situation in the west [of Georgia] has improved. There are no words to describe this. Perhaps it can be said that we extinguished an incipient inferno of civil war. Work at the Security and Interior Ministries has changed. In practice, one can talk about a completely new approach toward work at these power ministries. Their improved style of work is aimed at meeting current demands. A campaign against the criminal world and the mafiosi has been launched. A tax system has been created. There is also much more which was mentioned at the meeting. When I said that the whole truth must be said and a spade must be called a spade, I meant that unless this happened, the process of establishing order would be painful and long. This must happen by all means. I am not in favor of punishing everyone and sending everyone to prison. [Oniani] Assessments must be made. [Shevardnadze] Assessments must be made and people should know the truth about everyone. [Words indistinct] That I will be the first to take a blood test. I meant that drug addiction is a scourge of modern times, which threatens the country and future generation with an explosion. An anti-drug campaign should be initiated by the state. People who do not have the moral right to do it should not lead a struggle against drug addiction. Therefore, state organizations and power ministries, such as the Interior, Defense, Security Ministries, and so on, must be purged of such elements. When I say purged, I do not mean that these people should be cast out on to the street. Some of them should be treated, while others should be given assistance as soon as possible. However, such cleansing is certainly necessary. I do know about the legal aspects of such a matter. Some people may regard the blood test as a human rights violation. Some people may be unwilling to take a test. That is why I decided -- I think no one has any doubt that I am not afraid of taking a blood test [Shevardnadze laughs] -- that this process should start with me and the head of state's office. My office will be told about it today and I think that this work will be completed today or tomorrow. [Oniani] You mentioned your meeting with law enforcement bodies. It is common knowledge that good order and economic performance are interlinked. As soon as there are even small signs of stabilization, the country will be able to breathe more easily. However, the inflation of the coupon is continuing at a terrible pace. At a parliament meeting, the prime minister requested 10 days for a program aimed at strengthening the coupon. Two options are suggested. The first one is to leave the coupon as a sole legal form of tender. The second option is to introduce an alternative currency. What do you think will save the Georgian coupon today? To what extent will the coupon be supported with the notorious 200 million [currency not specified], which, in the former premier's opinion -- I am sorry to say this -- you have concealed? [Shevardnadze] We are dealing with the most serious question here. I would like again to remind our listeners, our citizens, that when, at the Cabinet of Minister's proposal, a decision was made to introduce the coupon, I immediately said that the coupon would lose its value. Nothing else could have happened. Perhaps this process was speeded up by a bad credit policy or some other subjective factors, but sooner or later this process would have started anyway. Those who consider the coupon issue separately from economic matters are wrong and are not familiar with the subject. There are also suggestions that it is time to think about the lari, and that perhaps the lari can help us. Neither the lari nor any other new currency will save the country unless the economy starts to improve. This is one of the reasons why I think that President Yeltsin's visit, during which many economic treaties are to be signed, will be an historic event. In addition to what has already been done to strengthen our economic ties, this will be one of the ways to adopt [word indistinct] as soon as possible. If ties are quickly restored and if new ties are established, the economy will be revitalized, which will allow the coupon to become stronger and will allow us to think about a new currency, the lari. The second option is to obtain large credits. If we receive say, 200 million or 300 million [currency not specified] -- which to be honest is not much -- it will still not be enough to revitalize the economy and strengthen the coupon, for which at least $1 billion is needed. However, even $100 million or $200 million could help us to a certain extent. I have not taken the allegations [by Sigua] seriously. Some materials have already been published in the SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA. I want to say now with total honesty that the public should know everything. What are we dealing with? It was a very important letter from the International Monetary Fund which, although it did not contain assurances, gave Georgia prospects for receiving a certain amount of credit and economic assistance. This letter was concealed. It was concealed from us. How did a copy of it end up with Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua? The original is said to have been lost. Meanwhile, he kept a copy of it at home. He was prime minister twice. Would he keep copies of all documents at home? I believe that our citizens should think about it. There was another letter. The first letter has been published in the press and I demand that the second letter be published as well -- the one which I (?referred) to Roman Gotsiridze [former Georgian deputy premier in charge of economic reform], asking him to study it urgently and to put forward his proposals. He has left the Cabinet and [words indistinct]. [Oniani] Excuse me, Batono Eduard, let me ask you to return to the notorious letter which Tengiz Sigua spoke about. Did he ever tell you that this letter existed, and was he ever interested in hearing your opinion about it. Has there ever been any conversation between you two about it? [Shevardnadze] My morals do not allow me respond to an allegation with a counter-allegation. However, let us take into account my correspondence with and my requests to the IMF regarding credits. How did we get the 70 million ECU [European Currency Unit] credit from the European Community? How many personal requests and appeals have I made? These include my letters to the G-7 which, I would say, man would not be able to read without tears in the eyes, and which were full of pleas for help; my visit to Germany, as a result of which we received 30 million German marks [DM] as an interest-free long-term credit and DM20 million in humanitarian assistance; my requests to the Turkish leadership, which gave us 50 million dollars [not further specified] in credit, and much more. Could a man who has travelled the world begging for a few pennies in credit have left such a promising (?letter) unnoticed? I think that it is very good that the press has reacted to this, but there is still more to be established. The letter should be published. I wonder why Mr. Gotsiridze did not act [words indistinct]. I am not saying this in order to settle scores [words indistinct] but to explain that if we are able to get more loans, credits, and assistance, then the coupon may become stronger more quickly. If there is no assistance -- I will be able to speak about it in more detail after my visit to Washington, during which I will meet the Monetary Fund and others -- then it will be a more painful process which will solely be linked with revitilizing and improving the economy. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week saw the creation of a youth organization within the Citizens' Union of Georgia. What is the significance of this event? Has the Citizens' Union split up? [Shevardnadze] No, it has not. [passage omitted] Why should the creation of a youth organization within the Citizens' Union surprise anybody? I know that some people say that the Citizens' Union has created a version of the Komsomol, [word indistinct] organization, and so on. They do not know the history of international movements.
