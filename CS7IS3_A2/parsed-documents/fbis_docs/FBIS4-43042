What is your summary on election night? [Kohl] I have not used the term trial election. I have always pointed out that the turnout in the European election is of necessity quite markedly lower, and that we will quite certainly have a turnout of 79 to 80 percent in the federal elections in October. Of course, I am very happy with the result here tonight. My slogan has proven its truth: We sow the seeds in April and May, and the harvest comes in summer and autumn. And that is what has happened. [applause] [Lueg] Herr Chancellor, the economic situation and development is good. Was that an advantage for you and your party in this election, and -- it is a while yet until the federal elections, but one could perhaps speak of a trial election? [Kohl] I would like first to speak about the European elections, and then about the federal elections. Well, many people think it is a ritual -- I do not think so. I have walked a lot of streets and squares and I can only stand here as the chairman of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] of Germany, because I was helped by my political friends in the CDU and the CSU [Christian Social Union] with great efforts in a massive election campaign. I thank my friends who helped, and also the voters. Because if you read the forecasts a couple of weeks ago, they forecast quite a disaster for today. Now I stand here with great satisfaction; I am enjoying it, that is my style and that's why I am pleased. [ARD reporter] But Herr Chancellor, the showing of the FDP [Free Democratic Party] cannot be satisfactory for you, for you are still dependent on the FDP as coalition partner. [Kohl] Well, first of all, I think this is a European election. And in the last European elections, the FDP made quite a tight showing. Anyone who makes predictions tonight for the October elections with regard to the FDP is certainly quite wrong. It is quite certain that the FDP will be represented in the German Lower House in October. I have no doubt about that. That is something the FDP has seen on many occasions over the years. And that will happen again this time. I personally am sorry about this election result, but I say just as clearly that the FDP is not represented in the European parliament [sentence as heard]. I am particularly sorry for Frau Uta Wuerfel, who had an excellent campaign. Why should I not say that on this occasion? But that is the way things are, and we will work well with this result within the coalition, looking forward to the federal elections. [ARD reporter] I'd like to follow up that question. Are there those in the FDP who do not support Herr Kinkel's course of remaining close to the CDU/CSU? Will that not become more difficult for you. Have you already phoned Herr Kinkel? [Kohl] No, I have not yet had an opportunity to telephone. I have been devoting great attention to the election results. Whoever within the FDP draws the conclusion from this result that this is a reason to question the coalition -- nobody will reasonably do this -- will discover very quickly that is just what the voters will not respect. The voters -- I am firmly convinced tonight -- will clearly confirm the coalition in October. For us in the CDU/CSU, at least, today is an important step toward this development. [Lueg] Do you see these elections as the voters' assent -- no matter what party they belong to -- to the Maastricht Treaty? [Kohl] Yes, I think it is. It is very difficult for an ordinary person, with the very distant problems which are concealed within a treaty, to see clearly what it means. But I believe there is a clear majority in Germany in all democratic parties that Germany's future can only be assured within the European Union, that the old Adenauer saying from 1950 is still valid today: German unity and European unification are two sides of the same coin. To that extent, I am very pleased with it. It is more difficult when there is such a distance -- Strasbourg is much farther away -- and there is above all no European government for or against which one can vote. People have to change their thinking, and that takes time. [ARD reporter] If one looks at the former East Germany, particularly with the local election results, the showing of the PDS is quite remarkable, irrespective of how one evaluates that. In many forthcoming state parliament elections, can it be that only grand coalitions will be able to be formed? Will that not have repercussions on Bonn? [Kohl] Well, first I would suggest we do not apply today this famous method, understandable among reporters... [ARD reporter, interrupting] You say we must look to the future, so let's do that. [Kohl] ...of predicting the next result, even on the election night. I have heard a lot of forecasts from famous journalists in the last few months, all of which were wrong -- for example, the prediction that the large parties would fray at the edges, that the age of the great popular parties is past. There can be no question of this. There is a groundswell to the large democratic parties, and even the FDP's result does nothing to change this, because this groundswell still exists for the FDP. I am firmly convinced of that. [Lueg] Why are you so sure that the Free Democrats, who seemed very depressed on television tonight, will make the running on 16 October? [Kohl] For the same reason I have for months been saying the CDU/CSU will win the elections. CDU/CSU will win the elections. Everyone thought I was just repeating myself like a clockwork model running down. The model is very practicable and very successful. [applause]
