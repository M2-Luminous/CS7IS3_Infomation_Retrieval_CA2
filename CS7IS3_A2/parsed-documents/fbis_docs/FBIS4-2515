Shanghai's Civil Affairs Bureau told leaders of the Chinese Human Rights Association that its application to register had been rejected because it was not a "mass organisation" according to the law. Association leaders were told that the new body had to be affiliated with official organisations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions if it wants to become legal. Association spokesman Yang Zhou, a leading Shanghai dissident, said: "This evidently contradicts the constitution, which guarantees people's rights to organise." Mr Yang was detained during French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's brief visit to Shanghai last weekend. "Only the Communist Party can say who is lawful and who is not. And no genuinely independent mass organisation is allowed, although there are regulations allowing such associations," Mr Yang said. "You are illegal and may have to face criminal charges if you do not register. But when you try to do so, there is no way that you will succeed," he said. Officially submitted in March 1993, the association's application for legal status has been pending for more than a year. The group is so far the first non-government mainland organisation with no official link whatsoever to seek legal recognition. "They are handling it very carefully because there is no precedent. And they know that if it is approved, it will be a gateway for underground democratic activities to go public," Mr Yang said. If the association became legal, similar groups could then affiliate with it and register with the Government which is something the authorities would rather avoid, he said. Civil Affairs Bureau officials have agreed to reconsider the association's application in the future, but Mr Yang said it was unlikely that approval would be granted this year. Unless there were big changes in Beijing, the case would just be left hanging in the air, he said. But the activist said efforts to legalise the group would not be abandoned. "At the moment, we can only learn bits and pieces about the situation of political prisoners through friends. There is no way that we can visit prisoners, monitor works of the judiciary, procuratorate and public security departments, or make proposals unless we are officially recognised."
