However, the same source reported that Azerbaijani Air Force planes again violated Armenia's airspace during the daytime yesterday. Two bombers appeared over the borders of Vardenisskiy Rayon at noon and then flew south at a considerable height over Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. One of them violated Armenia's airspace in Gorisskiy Rayon at around 1500 and dropped three cluster bombs in the border zone. The other flew toward Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. Four Azerbaijani aircraft carried out reconnaissance flights over the border regions of Gorisskiy Rayon at 1700 on the same day. They immediately left the region when faced with measures taken by the Armenian air-defense forces. Though a relative calm is being maintained along most of the war front in Karabakh, Azerbaijani troops are still attacking the Karabakh positions in certain sectors. NKR Defense Army press service reported that following an artillery barrage this morning, the enemy resumed the offensive against the southeastern sector. According to information received at noon, the Karabakh army formations were managing to halt the Azerbaijani attacks. Only positional exchange of fire is taking place in the rest of the conflict zone.
