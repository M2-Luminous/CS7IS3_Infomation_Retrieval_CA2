Wu Yi said that this year, China's foreign trade has been developing rapidly, healthily, and in a coordinated manner. It mainly has the following four characteristics: --Import and export trade grew significantly. According to statistics from the customs department, total import and export value reached $57.84 billion, an increase of 21.1 percent over the same period of last year, and this speed was quite high compared with the same periods of recent years. --Exports accelerated. In the first 4 months of this year, export value reached $28.04 billion, a 22 percent increase over the same period of last year. What is noteworthy is that the general trade export, which had not performed well in recent years, grew rapidly, with an increase of 30.5 percent, surpassing the 22.1 percent growth in the processing trade exports. This was a good trend not seen in the past few years. --Imports slowed down. In the first 4 months of this year, the import value was $29.79 billion, 20.3 percent increase over the same period of last year. Judged from absolute value, import and export volumes were very close, and judged by development trends, a balance between import and export is feasible. --Settlement of exchange is bigger than sale of exchange, the foreign trade situation in the whole country is quite good, and the state's foreign exchange reserve is bigger than earlier this year. Wu Yi said frankly that China's foreign trade and economic work is also faced with some difficulties and problems, and the more acute ones are: Enterprises still have a tight supply of circulation funds, purchase price of export commodities are increasingly too rapidly, and foreign trade and export lack staying power.
