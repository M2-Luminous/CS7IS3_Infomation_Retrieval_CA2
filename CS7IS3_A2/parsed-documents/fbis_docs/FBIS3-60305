Chairman of the Belarus Republic State Committee on Ecology States His Views on Environmental Problems"; date and place not given] [Text] We are not living well today, and we are treating the environment even worse. We note, moreover, that almost everybody sincerely blames everybody else for the crisis--while presuming, of course, to be the forests' and rivers' best friend and protector. One suspects, however, that the long suffering environment might wish to submit some bills to many decent citizens. In this regard, we have a question for the republic's chief ecologist: Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, excuse my bluntness, but in matters of ecology we are barbarians and ignoramuses. You know more examples than I. Here is one: last year in Pukhavitski Rayon, during a hot dry spell, some blackened firemen were putting out a fire in a peat bog, while literally a kilometer away from there some healthy youngsters were arrogantly "having some fun" with a routine bonfire. Common logic protests against such barbarism; admonishment is not enough, punishment is needed! Darafeyew: I don't need to argue something that is so obvious; in past years not enough was done to protect the environment and create a healthy habitat for human beings. I will emphasize that conditions today are even worse and, in many cases, simply critical. People's treatment of the environment? Your Pukhavitski example is just one small typical event. Almost 99 percent of fires, including forest fires, are due to individuals who destroy the environment and yet consider themselves decent citizens. Recent events all over the CIS have shown the barbaric depths people can sink to in relations with one another, so why not take out their wrath on the environment, which cannot answer back?! Politics, the ideology of confrontation, the ruined economy, and skyrocketing prices are also factors. Food is such a problem that poachers of all stripes have launched, so to speak, a "massive assault" on the forests, rivers, and lakes. And if state and civic organizations responsible for the protection of wildlife and fish resources don't take appropriate measures, in two or three years we won't have any forests or wildlife, and the only rabbit we'll see is on banknotes.... Charnyawski: And then the very existence of homo sapiens will be in question.... Darafeyew: I say that in order to prevent this frightful occurrence we need to exert massive influence on the people's consciousness and enhance human reason--naturally, along with new laws and state measures designed to impose more liability for damaging the environment. By the way, for the most active segment of society new environmental laws have done practically everything needed to make them feel like they really are the masters in this matter. For the first time in our history, ordinary citizens and individuals have the right to demand and receive detailed information from state organizations and officials. They have the right to propose bans on the construction of ecologically hazardous facilities, and to institute suit in court to recover damages done to their health or property as a result of violations of environmental laws. Charnyawski: But so far, what you call the "active segment" is decidedly in the minority. I am not a pessimist, but I regret to say that our "ecological barbarians," whose name is legion, couldn't care less about these new rights of theirs. All they care about is the "right" to plunder nature and damage it. That's why enterprise directors (who are all "men of the people") largely behave that way, and their ability to "conquer" nature has grown a hundredfold. Let's recall, incidently, the relatively recent amounts of fines levied, which are ridiculous: 10 rubles for an individual, 100 rubles for an executive. And how are we to "pressure" the numerous violators now, if nobody fears God, the Devil, or the law? Darafeyew: Never mind; everybody looks after his own pocket. Fines today are not what they were once, neither is the principle of exacting them. In connection with the passing of the Law "On Protection of the Environment," the question of economic regulation of the exploitation of natural resources and environmental protection has taken a brand new turn--the economic mechanism has come into play. A harsher system of fines, court actions, and penalties for dumping harmful wastes in the environment has been created, applicable both to enterprises and to individuals. Penalties now are more than a slap on the wrist. The starting point is the minimum salary, followed by higher rates. If our agencies or, for example, the foresters of the Ministry of Forestry, gets their hands on somebody, it is going to go very hard on them. What's sad is that we have long had a working example right next door in Europe, and other places besides. In our country, as you know, we spent decades indulging in ideological self-glorification, saying that the capitalists were rapaciously plundering the environment; we never wrote that they were protecting it. To be sure, we also have started to fight the despoilers of nature, but only since the "new era," I'd say. I'm referring to a case in the late spring of 1990 in which, due to the criminal negligence of an operator in the Navapolatski Palimir Association, 90 tonnes of acetone cyanohydrin--a powerful poison--were dumped into the Western Dvina. The chief engineer was fired, while the operator wound up in court. So that one way or another we do have some experience "putting scoundrels in their place." Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, I notice you have mentioned the new "Law on Environmental Protection" several times. For good reason, I think. I propose, therefore, having commented on the deplorable state of society today and the fact that under such conditions environmental protection cannot be much better, you give some thought to what that protection ought to be in fact and how everything new is to be instilled in human consciousness and actual practice. There is plenty of doubt, and all of it real. One article in the Law states that enterprises are to provide your committee with information about accidents, emissions, and other negative phenomena--and all "free of charge!" As if I would work against myself if I were the director! If I did that, where would I wind up in a day or two?! Darafeyew: A businessman's personal ambitions are one thing, the interests of the state are quite another. What is at issue here is the overall monitoring of the environment. The republic is creating an ecology monitoring system which will be implemented by the State Committee on Ecology and other agencies empowered to do so. Like it or not, anyone involved in the production process is obliged by law to submit detailed information in order to create a general ecology information bank. Are you saying people will cheat? That's quite possible. In addition to departmental control our own control will be on hand in the enterprises; organs of the State Committee on Ecology keep track of production conditions using their own instruments, and discrepancies show up quite often. Let me remind would-be conspirators that they will be liable--perhaps even criminally liable--for submitting false information or failing to submit information. You have said that the departmental control service often takes violators under its wing to protect them from liability. We know that, and that's why our relations with them are critical. Because our State Committee is now a supra-departmental body, we have the right to check up on everybody, on any ministry or department. If we find any cheating, it will be punished. Let everyone keep in mind that users of natural resources themselves bear responsibility for improper use of resources and treatment of the environment. This is only civilized and fair; the principle is stipulated by the laws of all developed countries. The trouble is that we are in the clutches of the "wild" market and the economic crisis. In such conditions, I agree, implementing the new legislation is going to be painful to production collectives. Charnyawski: Let me get back to the mentality of business executives, because some of them are really in a fix. Just how, if you please, can a man tell the world that everything in his plant is leaking and smoking, the plumbing is shot, yet production has been met? What if the enterprise has to be closed as a polluter? What then, thousands of people on the sidewalk out of work? On the other hand, there are lots of monopoly plants whose collectives are coddled too much. All the profits and considerable state subsidies are plowed into wages, and nobody thinks about the ecology or perfecting the technology. Overall, there is a slide into truly savage capitalism and rapacious exploitation of resources. Darafeyew: There's real food for thought. There are many enterprises where salaries are high and they are spending hard currency for--excuse the expression--glad rags and Toyotas in the West, but as for investing to improve the ecological situation, no way. The new law proposes a new approach: make them pay big for improper use of resources. Unhappy with the big payments? Then fix your technology. That's it. Remember that under the command economy, enormous investments were made in new technologies, but hardly anybody thought about technological progress, and ecological spending was nowhere. The economic policy of the Law "On Protection of the Environment" will definitely change this mentality. No one will be allowed anymore to profit at the expense of others and poison the environment while not investing a ruble to renovate it. Consider this fact, which has not had much play here in Belarus. At the conference on environmental problems and development, which was held in Brazil under the auspices of the UN, the whole world proclaimed the priority of the ecology. We do, after all, live in a civilized world. But if we don't civilize ourselves on the plane of ecology, we will remain isolated "savages"--and it will be reflected both in our standard of living and in relations toward us. When it comes to our aging industries, how can we shut them all down? There's just one way--by using economic levers and ecology laws, to pressure their collectives so that they will at least start to gradually change their technologies. Consider the West: do you think they've closed all the heating and power facilities that run on coal? They could have, because the cost of smoke scrubbing technologies comes to about 70 percent of the cost of the enterprises. What they did was redesign them the way they should be. Charnyawski: With a bit of fantasy we might imagine that in time we might make industrial and other enterprises act "polite." But what about having the military pay for the damage done to the environment and human health? Anybody who knows those unapproachable and unassailable gods the generals will probably never believe it. In Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, claims are literally pouring in against former Soviet military installations for environmental damages. But in our case.... If anybody is going to pay a fine, it will come from the budget, which means from the taxpayer's pockets. Isn't that right? Darafeyew: You're mistaken there. Times are different now, the old taboos are gone that used to keep people outside the gates of the military. As far back as two years ago, there were cases in which military units were severely punished for damages to the environment and ecological accidents. We now have operating a special group to service military facilities and grant them ecological certification. Now, military commanders are ranked the same as civilian executives--the same approach applies to all: if you do damage you can just pay the penalty. You refuse? There are environmental and military procuracies to take care of that. To be sure, they do keep a "cut" for themselves, for their military cost--and it all comes from the state budget. Now, however, commanders also bear individual responsibility for ecological violations. In the new amended Administrative Code (as amendments to the law), all this will be stipulated legislatively. Relations between the State Committee and the Defense Ministry are generally good, and whenever some commander violates ecological regulations--maliciously--we can complain about him to the ministry, and the next time you look he'll have one less star on his epaulet. Charnyawski: Once everything is on a civilized footing, in the future, society will be able to boast that the "military impact" on the ecology has been reduced to a minimum. But who will protect us from depredations against the environment by the local Soviets which have been given such expanded powers by this legislation? I believe that many local leaders are ecologically ignorant. They might, for example, put up a hazardous asphalt plant in a summer residential area or commit some other unpardonable stupidity for hard currency. Do you know, Anatol Maksimavich, where rayon bosses sometimes put monies from the ecology tax and non-budget environmental funds? Darafeyew: Now I agree with you there. Officials of rayons where there are big industrial polluters will do anything to see to it that the latters' fees for the use of resources go into their own coffers and stay there. What the other rayons get is the pollution plume. In such cases, no funds remain to form ecology programs in the oblasts and the republic. But such rayon bosses, even when they do get the money, are not overly concerned with creating any "ecological paradise" in their area. Their aspirations are much more primitive--first, of course, to make a lot of money along with their apparatus; next, to acquire various prestigious "toys." In other words, they act on the principle "After us the deluge; who cares about the ecology?" To a certain extent, of course, the local Soviets have to be independent, but they are also supposed to comply with general laws. The alternative is legal nihilism and anything-goes, with all the consequences. The Supreme Soviet should guarantee compliance, along with our State Committee within the limits stimulated by the Law. I say that because there is a dangerous tendency to bring hazardous and polluting technologies into our country from the West. Consider this: someone has even proposed bringing contaminated soil into Belarus for processing, for which they would pay us in hard currency. As if we didn't have enough contaminated land after Chernobyl! Again, one German firm proposed that Belarus buy (!) briquettes made from the sludge of treatment plants for use as... fertilizer. They don't rate us very highly in the West if they're trying to foist things off on us that even poor Africans would refuse. But we have to remember that we have plenty of local-yokel anti-ecologists who would make a deal like that for dollars or marks. Naturally, agencies of the State Committee are standing guard over the state's interests, but how can you keep track of every wheeler-dealer in the market? Remember, then, that whenever such a scheme is uncovered, its perpetrators will be severely punished. Charnyawski: And so, Anatol Maksimavich, we come to where we started from: We have to have penalties, especially in such a neglected sector as the ecology. It is clear that our society is not yet prepared, either spiritually or mentally, to pass the needed ecological legislation. Will we ever overcome this block in the general consciousness? Darafeyew: I'm not inclined to be a rosy optimist either by position or experience. And I won't predict that we are soon going to have English-style gardens and lawns everywhere and that the air will become crystal clear. Our optimism must be pointed toward the realization that through concerted efforts we can survive and not slide into ecological catastrophe. That is our chief problem of survival as a nation. All it takes is for each one of us, to some extent, to be the patriotic master of our land and a wise human being.
