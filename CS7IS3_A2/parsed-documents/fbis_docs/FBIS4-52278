Schedule for deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, for example, will proceed as planned, and so will South Korea-U.S. military maneuver "Team Spirit" and arms improvement projects, they said. These plans would change, as Seoul said, if North Korea returns to negotiations with South Korean Government and if the negotiations make progress. But Seoul will separate these plans from the ongoing nuclear talks, the sources said. South Korea announced in March that it will no longer demand inter-Korean dialogue as a condition to high-level talks between North Korea and the United States. It was then that the government decided to sever the link between the military plans and the nuclear problem, they said. "It's true that we did try to avoid provoking North Korea as much as possible," said one official, "But despite such efforts, North Korea hasn't given up its nuclear program. It's our policy to pursue necessary security measures without linkage to the nuclear negotiations. [no closing quotation mark as received]
