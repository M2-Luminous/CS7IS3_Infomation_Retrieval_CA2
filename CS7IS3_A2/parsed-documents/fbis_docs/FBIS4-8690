Gyula Horn said that the parties winning the elections will be able to form a government because there are no big differences between the various programs and many people would like to get into power and even more people want a change. Speaking about persons, Gyula Horn said that they would welcome non-party members Ferenc Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the government. [Szombathy] Although the comparison of various party programs would make it possible to form coalitions, the attitude of political forces in the election campaign is weakening the chances of agreement. For example, the chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a party you called unacceptable to the MSZP, called cooperation with the Socialists "the kiss of death." Can these contradictions be still bridged? [Horn] One should not attribute exaggerated importance to declarations made during the election campaign: One can find a wide gap between the promises of the 1990 election campaign and the implementation of these promises. There are no major differences between the programs of leading political parties: Almost without exception, everyone wants to continues privatization and agrees with the importance of agriculture. The difference lies in who wants to do what in reality. We do not react to various declarations; we only reply to blatant statements. We treat the accusations in accordance with our style prevailing so far, and I only react to unfounded accusations. However, it is a particular development that the right-wing conservatives and the liberal forces regard the left as their main opponent. The probable reason for this is that the socialists are regarded as having the biggest chance of winning. [Szombathy] However, there is an interesting harmony between your opinion and that of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross according to which both of you count on a conservative-left-wing competition.... [Horn] With the exception of a few hundred people, no one is interested in these speculations. Citizens will not vote on the basis of party suggestions. I never said that that the liberal parties might not have a weight in the 1994 elections although, in the long term, I imagine a role similar to that prevailing in Western Europe for them. To find the common contact points is much more important than this, because people want change, and the main goal of this change is to replace the current coalition. [Szombathy] Together with yourself, several MSZP leaders expressed their openness toward a coalition made up of the MSZP, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Do you think that this is increasingly strange, given the growing rejection of the Fidesz? [Horn] I would rather say that all this is manifested on the part of some Fidesz leaders. I do not attribute particular importance to these declarations, because Viktor Orban and his followers change their opinions frequently. However, we will also stick to our guidelines and ideas after May. Hungary needs a predictable political activity; I am sorry for the Fidesz because they gave up their earlier rational and calm policy. It is difficult to find out why the Fidesz changed their earlier popular attitude. [Szombathy] What is your opinion about the chances of forming a government? It seems that the current system of political parties in Hungary is still pliable and, thus, it is no accident that Peter Boross said that the government can still function as an executive for a long time and that parliamentary cycle shorter than four years cannot be excluded either. [Horn] Every day spent in power is obviously important for the present government. It is terrible to think what can still happen in the remaining weeks. It is enough to mention that it was precisely the KDNP that asked that the privatization be stopped. Coalition talks lasted more than five weeks in 1990 and, presumably, this period of time will not be shorter this time either. However, a new government can be formed, and the victorious parties will be able to come to an agreement. Many people would like to get into the executive power, and even more people want to get rid of the present style. Thus, individual and social interests are equal. However, there is a danger, namely the one predicted by Peter Boross: The new government will be facing a very difficult period. Stability will require social dialogue and agreement. [Szombathy] The party system has partially lost the citizens' confidence since 1990. Do you think that, after the current promises, the new government will continue to be faced with further loss of confidence? [Horn] The citizens will display confidence and patience if professional and honest people form the new government. On our part, we would like to see nonparty-affililated experts in the next government like Ferenc Glatz or Kalman Kulcsar, people who stand comparison with their current colleagues. The MSZP will continue to maintain a social dialogue. The new government will not have room for maneuver without such a dialogue. [Szombathy] Do you continue to regard yourself as the number one target among the opposition politicians? [Horn] Yes, especially among the client journalists of the government parties, who are trying to discredit me with every possible means. One thing is certain: If we have anything to do with the next government, we will not allow any kind of government party press around us.
