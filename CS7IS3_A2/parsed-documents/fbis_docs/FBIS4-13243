Prayers and peace be upon His faithful Arab Hashemite Prophet and all his companions. Dear brothers, Arabs and Muslims everywhere: God's peace, compassion and blessings be upon all of you. Praise be to Allah, the Almighty, who sustains the glory of Islam and who, verily, makes the future belong to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, who has no compeers, and that Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the votary and messenger of Allah, who took him on a night journey from the al-Haram Mosque to the al-Aqsa Mosque from where he ascended to the Lotus tree in the Seventh Heaven. Also, I praise God for all His kindness to me, especially since he blessed me with a special favor to be associated with the first qiblah [direction of Muslim prayer] and the third sacred mosque. This association goes back to the early days of the first great message and the day when God brought the light of Islam to Jerusalem. Ever since then, the holy city thrived in glory, piety and tolerance. It also goes back to the day when the body of the great revolutionary al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, was finally laid to rest in the sacred grounds of al-Aqsa. It was he who had set an example for historical leaders of how to choose between attaining glory of the transient moment and immortality in the life hereafter. It was the very same association that was consolidated when I witnessed 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn as he fell a martyr on the sacred grounds of al-Aqsa Mosque as he stood upright in dignity, like all Hashemites who pass away while still firmly adhering to time-honored principles [applause] and determined to attain their goals against all odds. Little wonder that they have been immortalized in the annals of history. Islam was in point of fact the message of all God's prophets and messengers whose missions had been sealed by that of Muhammad, peace be upon him. Over and above that, my relationship with Jerusalem is similar to that of any Muslim who believes in God, His angels, holy books, messengers, and the Day of Judgment, and who strives, along with the patient tiny minority of the faithful, to defend his nation, inspired by what the holy koran says: Remember when you were few and powerless in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful. [Koranic verse] Dear brethren, The accomplishment we celebrate today is one of my dearest achievements, namely, the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. It was by God's grace that I was able to fulfill my obligations seeking only the reward of the exalted Lord. As I take special pride in, and feel happy about, this blessing conferred upon me and all Jordanians by the Lord, I must admit that this joyous occasion is soured by the current state of affairs of this nation and the suffering of its peoples, especially the people of Jerusalem and Palestine. At this moment, my memory takes me back to the morning of Thursday, the 28th of Rabi' al-'Awwal, 1384 Hegira, corresponding to 6 August, 1964, when we celebrated in the city of Jerusalem the completion of the first phase of the renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. May I recall the very same words I addressed to the nation 30 years ago. The appeal I made on that morning in the distant past was quite timely then as it is now, for it was intended to alert the entire nation to the dangers of fragmentation. My exact words then were as follows: As we celebrate today, we look beyond our immediate scope of vision towards the millions of Arab and Muslims in Asia and Africa who, at this moment, collectively set their eyes on Palestine. Let me emphasize that the actual renovation of the Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock assumes significance far beyond the physical repair work on their actual site to include, in addition to the salvation of the rock, the preservation of its mosque and the maintenance of its dome, the complete restoration of our full rights in our usurped land, the dear Arab land [of Palestine]. [applause] I also said that this country, my dear brethren, has for years been pursuing development efforts at the same time when we were also defending our homeland and nation. Palestine has always been the essence of Jordan's pan-Arab message, figured prominently in our national construction and defense efforts because Jordan lives for Palestine and for its sake stands ready to sacrifice itself. This was our plea then which was inspired by the eternal and historic positions of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali on Palestine and its holy shrines, positions which settled deep in our hearts and came forth on our lips. They were later reinforced by Faysal Bin-al-Husayn's battle cry, "Let us embrace death, brethren Arabs." [applause] It was also impressively demonstrated by the sincerity of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn in defending the holy places and his comprehension of the dynamics of our age. It was indeed his sense of duty which prompted him to accept the supervision of the renovation work at al- Haram al-Sharif under the patronage of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, as clearly documented in the letter addressed to him in 1924 by the late Hajj Amin al-Husayni, the then head of the supreme Islamic council, may his soul rest in peace. It was 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn himself who personally ascended to the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher to direct efforts to fight a fire that threatened the structure of the church in 1949. Later, he offered the funds needed for complete repair of damage to the church. Our position toward all the sons of the nation today is no different. It is the same position demonstrated by our soldiers as they put up legendary resistance in defending the walls, alleys and streets of Jerusalem in the June 1967 war. They were the same brave servicemen who kept faith as they fought the al-Karamah Battle as a perpetuation of their struggle for Jerusalem. They were the ones who neither compromised Arab rights nor did they waver in their determination to defend those rights or face up to the oppression of the usurpers. The rights I have in mind are the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine, including the restoration of peace to al-Aqsa Mosque and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque so that no worshiper there would ever be terrorized by a murderer; so that Salah-al-Din's pulpit would never be set ablaze by a bigot; so that children would never be sprayed at point blank with gunfire by a usurper. Brothers and Sisters of the noble nation: Thanks to our firm belief in Almighty God and by virtue of faith and determination of the righteous people, we have been able to maintain our resolve. Our martyrs' blood was the light guiding us to Jerusalem, the dear and precious city, the symbol of steadfastness and the gem of peace. To us, the Hashemites, Jerusalem has been an eternal trust of religious tolerance we cherish in accordance with Caliph 'Umar's Covenant, consecrated by Jordanian blood and a symbol of Arab and Muslim struggle. Thus, our association with Jerusalem stands above the fray of political ploys and earthly greed [applause] since it has been anchored in the faith, prophethood, history, and martyrdom. We will keep our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's rights in it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city [applause] in accordance with the international legitimacy and so that sovereignty over its holy sites will only be for God. In the name of God, the Almighty, the nation will be entitled to religious jurisdiction in a manner that will be determined by consensus. In this fashion, a link between the past and the present will be maintained and [Caliph] 'Umar's Covenant will continue to be a beacon lighting the road of relationship with Jerusalem--the symbol, history, and holy shrines. What trust could be dearer and more precious than our holy places in it! Hence, in the name of the martyrs of Al al-Bayt [the House of the Prophet] and all the nation's martyrs, headed by the martyrs of this dear Arab homeland, we appeal to the nation to rise in order to rescue Jerusalem [applause] and to be able to confront all forms of blockade, oppression, and estrangement. This nation is worthy of freedom, glory, and life. Our grandfathers chose to leave Hejaz earlier in this century in order to spearhead its revolution. They carried the banners of freedom, unity, and tolerance and shouldered the trust of the revolution together--Muslims and Christians, Arabs and non-Arabs--united by the banner of the Great Arab Revolt and the noble goals of defending human rights and dignity. [applause] For the sake of securing the peoples' right to self-determination, al-Husayn Bin-'Ali said no to all forms of colonization and usurpation. 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, too, said no to all forms of division and loss. And today, we say no to any solution that does not restore Arab sovereignty to Arab Jerusalem [applause] so that the whole city would eventually become a token and symbol of peace for all the faithful children of Abraham, peace be upon him. In the same breath, we say no to any solution that does not secure the historical and legitimate rights of the people of Palestine on their sacred national soil [applause]. And we say no to any peace the next generations do not accept, safeguard, or defend because it does not represent right, justice, and human dignity. [applause] Dear brothers, distinguished guests: Today, we celebrate the completion of renovation work at the Dome of the Rock and our brethren in Jerusalem are observing the same occasion. We are one and the same family. This event is just another reminder of a long history of common heritage marked by patience, cherished memories, and satisfaction. I pray God to enable us to fulfill our obligation to the cause of Islam. To this end, we have started construction work in this country on the mausoleums of the Prophet's companions, may God be pleased with them, since they were the first Muslims to set foot on this land and elsewhere in the Muslim world. More so, because they were either from the House of the Prophet or his associates. This honor will include the other mujahidin who followed in their steps. These mausoleums should be designed and constructed as architectural masterpieces that display to the generations to come the splendor of their achievements as well as to serve as a source of inspiration to them. For this land was the gate to the Islamic conquest through Mu'tah and al-Yarmuk, and the passage to Muslim cavalier battalions to Hittin and 'Ayn Jalut. In the name of upright Islam, we also initiated work to establish the 'Al al-Bayt [The House of the Prophet] University which will be the gift of all members of the House of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the entire Islamic nation. The institution is conceived to be an Islamic forum that encompasses the glorious past history while it seeks to cope with the challenges of the present and the future. Our ultimate goal is to meet the Lord's wish that this nation will remain the most favored among communities raised on this earth. In the same vein, we have reached out to our brethren in the newly independent Islamic republics. A team of our experts is engaged now in providing assistance to those republics in a number of areas, including education, construction, and culture. We intended to help in the restoration of the Mausoleum of al-Qutham Ibn-al-'Abbass in Samarkand to its original magnificence, splendor, and beauty. We have also commissioned the restoration of the splendid pulpit of Salah-al-Din at its original site in the al-Aqsa Mosque. If anything, this is our response to the malicious bigots who set it ablaze [in 1968]. We have engaged ourselves in this exercise secure in our knowledge that history will ultimately do justice to this nation. It was Nur-al-Din Zinki, the renowned Muslim martyr, who ordered the artisans of Aleppo to perfect its manufacture, and it was Salah-al-Din himself who moved it to Jerusalem 20 years after it had been built. It is my fervent hope now to see it back in place one day and to attend a sermon there in which a preacher would congratulate the nation on restoring Jerusalem to the nation, free, dignified, and proud. Dear brothers and sisters, the current plight of our nation is a very severe one and the prognosis is grim indeed. I can see no salvation except by ensuring genuine freedoms and making sacrifices, in addition to enlightenment and clear vision. Only then can we comprehend the evolution of history with a fresh outlook which would enable us to instill into the younger generation a sense of new hope to attain rejuvenation, revival, scientific know-how and strength. This would also help us in shaking ourselves loose from the sins of the current epoch of weakness, the colonial designs, the oil curse, and oppressive practices. Down this road, we would perhaps see an end to our senseless hostilities and to the meaningless loss of our resources and blood which are given away in the service of foreign interests. Then, the whole nation would emerge free of ethnic intolerance, religious extremism, or cultural introversion. To Jerusalem, the omnipresent city in our minds and hearts, we send our greetings. Without Jerusalem, our lives will always be lacking in harmony. For Jerusalem represents our collective memory and common faith. It stands for our epicenter of knowledge, vision, and religious tolerance as exemplified in the Covenant of 'Umar [Ibn-al-Khattab, the second caliph in early Islam]. It is the focal point of our cherished freedom and dignified peace. We will continue to warn against and then resist all attempts at tampering with our Islamic holy shrines, at the first of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim addresses his prayers] and the third holiest mosque, in particular, and throughout the Islamic world. We shall oppose any change in the physical features of these shrines that might be effected under false pretexts or repair, expansion, or renovation, or under any other slogan. For such attempts might strip the nation of its historical legacy to safeguard and maintain them. These endeavors of ours will be mounted on behalf of and in coordination with the entire Islamic nation with a view to ensuring the preservation of its sacred common heritage. Here, we must emphasize that the means to repair our holy places in Jerusalem are known. They are the committees in charge of this. I mean the Jordanian Awqaf Ministry and the Commission on the Renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock, which have been assuming their responsibilities for decades. Palestine is determined to restore its right to freedom. It enjoys an enlightened awareness that it will triumph, God willing. We beseech God to have mercy on the souls of its martyrs, from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam to the worshipers at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque, [applause] and to make us to always remember them and to be faithful to them. O beloved ones who maintain their steadfastness on the land of Palestine and those in fraternal Iraq who are courageously, patiently facing the blockade. O those who are defending the unity of your land, people, and spirit in beloved Yemen. O Arabs and Muslims everywhere. Let me seize this moment to renew the pledge initially undertaken by our forefathers that they will bow their heads in submission to no one except to God, the Almighty. They committed themselves to combating injustice and oppression in a manner that behooves their lineage to Hamzah of 'Uhud, Ja'afar of Mu'ta, and al-Husayn of Karbala'. Many a Hashemite martyr uttered in soliloquy: O Lord, I have control over none but myself, which I offer in duty to their cause. And many of them swore an oath to each other that they would fight till death rather than retreat, surrender or disgrace themselves. No wonder that their tombs are still recognized throughout the larger homeland and their names are held in high esteem by the nation. Their memories are associated with holy events and places that are subject to no authority other than that of the one united nation. Their souls seek no permission for prayer at this mosque or that. After all, they were the ones who in their deeds demonstrated to the world the real difference between freedom and bondage, between justice and oppression, between dignity and submission. In the face of a sever crisis, their reaction has always been: overwhelming stress demands overwhelming determination. That is because their consuming dream was to see one united nation living in justice and dignity; a nation that draws its strength from its glorious past, despite all obstacles on the road, severe limitations and dim prospects. And since our spirit of challenge will never wane, we shall remain loyal to their mission until the nation gains victory or we meet our Lord, the Creator, as martyrs, for martyrdom would make up for victory in the life hereafter if we failed to achieve it in our life. If the response of the nation to the challenge on hand appeared sometimes to be weak or limited, or if destruction, fragmentation, poverty and hunger seemed to be spreading out of control, then we should not feel despondent. Rather, we should respond with resolve and determination to rise to the challenge in order to develop a modern Islamic discourse and an integrated model for civilized communal life which revives hope that the whole nation could indeed be rebuilt from within in terms of its thinking, orientation, vision and way of life, bearing always in mind the need to safeguard freedoms, the purist of knowledge, tolerance, and justice. Dear brothers and sisters, From this platform in Amman, which stands for the Arab cause, freedom and steadfastness, I say: Peace be upon Jerusalem and greetings of peace from Jordanians to their kinsfolk there. These are the Jordanians who never failed to respond to the call of duty dictated by blood ties and their sense of morality. These are the Jordanians who never lost vision of al-Aqsa Mosque with all the sentiments of worship, martyrdom, and pride it evokes in their souls. Peace be upon Jerusalem of al-Faruk [Caliph 'Umar], of Salah-al-Din, and of al-Husayn bin-'Ali. Peace be upon its rock, and the First Qiblah, the site of the Prophet's night journey and his ascension therefrom to heavens. Peace be upon the church of the Holy Sepulcher. Peace goes from Jordan, who takes pride as its mantle, the nation as its beloved one, and freedom as its wish. [applause] Peace from the Jordanians whose spirit cannot be broken during the time of apostasy, whose heads are not bound during the siege, and whose steps do not go astray in times of darkness. We send greetings of peace to the jewel of all the cities of the nation. We pray for the rest of souls of all martyrs who fell on its soil, of all worshipers who said their prayers in its mosque and churches, of all scholars who went through its schools. We salute all its inhabitants who are enduring the oppression of the occupier while struggling for its freedom and glory. My dear brothers and sisters, In closing, let me salute all of you and welcome once again our guests who came from several places in the large homeland of our nation. I should also like to pay tribute to all those who contributed to the renovation effort, especially the supervisors, designers, builders and artisans. I pray to Allah, the Almighty, to guide us all along the right path to win His satisfaction. May God bring upon you one and all peace, compassion, and blessings.
