Residents living near the U.S. base held talks with the government over the court's compromise proposal but the two sides failed to reach agreement. Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said he had decided to give up seeking a compromise and will deliver the court's judgment on the case on March 30. Some 600 residents are demanding the Japanese Government ban flights from the base between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., and pay compensation for their suffering both in the past and in the future. In March 1989, the Tokyo District Court rejected the demand for a ban on the night flights and compensation for future annoyance but ordered the government to pay 330 million yen in compensation for past victimization. In November 1993, the high court presented a compromise to the two sides including a proposal that flights not be permitted between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Although the residents expressed acceptance of the compromise, the government put forward an alternative offer made up of other reconciliatory conditions. The residents were dissatisfied with the government's new offer and called on the government to state clearly that it will make an effort to reduce noise levels in future. The two sides held a total of seven rounds of talks at the court in order to try and reach a compromise before finally breaking off the discussions.
