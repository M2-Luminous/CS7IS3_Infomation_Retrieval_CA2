That is what the Bundesbank's March monthly report maintains in its preamble to an analysis of the balance of payments situation, which, with regard to long-term capital movements, has registered a record net influx of 198 billion German marks [DM] -- four times as much as in 1992. It reflects expectations surrounding interest rate reductions, a more favorable return on the German mark compared to U.S. dollar investments, currency speculation considerations, as well investments motivated by tax considerations on the part of German investors. In the case of trade in goods, despite "a poor situation for exports that carried on well into the year," there was an improved export surplus of DM59 billion (DM33.7 billion in 1992), which stemmed from a relatively steep drop in imports. The deficit in services fell only slightly to DM36.2 (39.4) billion. This was also linked to the decline in registered net capital yields of DM10 billion, writes the Bundesbank. Because of services deficits, German net asset holdings abroad have fallen by DM100 billion to DM435 billion over the period from the end of 1990 until the middle of 1993. It was also noted that as a result of the transfer of domestic savings to foreign capital centers prompted by the withholding tax on interest, there was a significant increase in capital payments "abroad," which are actually attributable to domestic investors. Over the past few years, German net capital yield receipts "have been too low by several billion German marks." Purchases of securities from abroad rose to a record gross sum of DM246 billion. Demand was above all for public authority bonds (DM165 billion). At the end of 1993, DM500 billion worth of securities issued by public bodies were held abroad, that is, almost half of such securities in circulation. German investments abroad totalled DM91 billion gross and thus were below last year's level (DM114 billion). The reason for the decline was reduced interest on the part of German savers in foreign investment certificates: Only DM11 billion (DM58 billion in 1992) were invested in such securities. "The tax considerations that were to a large extent behind these investments appear to have largely come to an end in the early part of the summer," stressed the central bank. A "veritable sales boom" occurred at the end of the year (taxation of half-year profits) resulting in the total of Luxembourg-based fund certificates held by Germans between August and the end of the year falling by almost a third to DM80 billion.
