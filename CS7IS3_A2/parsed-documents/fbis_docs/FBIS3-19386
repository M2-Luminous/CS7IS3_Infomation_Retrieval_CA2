"Important measures which had been agreed were refused at the radio-chemical laboratory in Yongbyon," the IAEA said in a statement issued after a March 3-15 trip to North Korea by IAEA inspectors. "As a result of this rejection...the Agency was not in a position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear material at the facility where the relevant measures were rejected," it added. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said earlier that the matter could possibly be referred to the UN Security Council. Yongbyon, called a "radio-chemical laboratory" by North Korea, is one of seven sites that Pyongyang agreed could be inspected by the IAEA after months of stalling. The IAEA suspects it is used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. The statement was issued after nuclear inspectors briefed IAEA chief Hans Blix on their less than successful trip. The briefing was followed by a meeting of IAEA ambassadors who considered the findings of the seven-man team, prevented by North Korean officials from fully carrying out inspections at seven nuclear sites. Meyer earlier also confirmed reports that North Korea blocked the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but refused to name them. [passage omitted]
