At a Ministry of Internal Affairs news conference a week ago, we received a hint that officers from the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, in cooperation with DEA agents, were preparing operations such as the following: Good cooperation among the Vienna branch of the DEA, the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, and the Koper police resulted in a successful operation when 1.5 kg of cocaine was seized in Koper on 21 April. Martin Vrancic, chief of the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, said the drugs had come through Brnik airport and that this was not the first time something like this had happened. He believes that an extremely well-organized group is behind the cocaine-smuggling operation, that it is organized in a pyramid structure, and that it uses computer technology. The drugs were hidden in two computer magnetic-tape boxes. The Koper police turned three persons over to the local prosecutor's office. They are citizens of Colombia, Italy, and Slovenia. The Slovene citizen lives in Colombia. One of the foreigners was taken into custody. The investigation has not been concluded. Just today at noon, that is Wednesday, another suspect belonging to this group was arrested in Ljubljana. He is a Croatian citizen. He was also turned over to the Koper prosecutor. The cocaine seized has a market value of approximately 200,000 German marks. [passage omitted]
