They labeled the current administration "incapable" of solving the problems confronting the country. Party leaders on 16 June held a plenary session convened by the Political Action Committee presided over by Cordoba Governor Eduardo Cesar Angeloz. They issued a document on 17 June in which they stated that "the UCR faces two challenges -- to reorganize the party and achieve its unity, and to become an alternative within the opposition. [no closing quotation marks as received] They stressed that the establishment of the Political Action Committee "is a signal to society and to the party itself that the UCR is capable of overcoming differences." The document went on to say that "we are seeking to reestablish unity within the party, a party in which different styles and leanings may coexist with one another, but which presents a united front when it has to define a course of action, measures, and a national model." Each of the 24 party district chairmen took the floor at the plenary session to present an analysis of each province's economic, political, and social situation. Commenting on these presentations, Angeloz said that some of them "painted pictures that made one's hair stand on end." Having analyzed the social, economic, and political situation of each province, as well as the party situation in each district, the document underscored that the UCR "is poised to once again become a government alternative." It contended that "the government, which offers stability, is incapable of offering Argentines a formula to meet the country's main necessities: genuine growth and active social policies." In conclusion, the document stated that "the UCR is again in a position to represent the dynamic forces of society, and is ready to transform and modernize Argentina."
