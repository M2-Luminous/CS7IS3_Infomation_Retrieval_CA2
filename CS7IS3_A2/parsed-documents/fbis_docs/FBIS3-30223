The politicians in Moscow are not going to abandon the influence on the course of events in Central and East Europe. Characteristic was the fact that Russia did not agree to Poland's admission to NATO, which, eventually, ended up in the "Partnership for Peace" initiative being approved at the NATO summit in Brussels. What is your evaluation of Boris Yeltsin's policy, of Russia's role, and what is your opinion on the attitude of Western states toward the countries liberated from Soviet hegemony? [Iliescu] We should look at all the transformation processes under way in our region objectively and without emotions. We must remember that Russia was established on the ruins of the Czarist state in 1917 and, even though with other slogans and with the ideology of internationalism, it pursued the same imperialist policy of the Czars. It strove to submit the world to itself. The USSR was nothing but a continuation of Russia as it looked before 1917. The artificially established republics were steered centrally; all power was concentrated in the Kremlin. What has changed now? The Russia of Yeltsin is reverting back to the old Russian traditions -- traditions going back to times before 1917: we have the Duma, we have the Czarist eagle as the emblem of today's Russia, there are also people who are referring to the past. There are conservative forces, which demand that the Russian state, in this way or another, control the neighboring states. I am thinking about our part of Europe and about our two neighbors. A return to the past, especially to the past associated with a given state's strength, could be observed in all fallen empires: in Great Britain after World War II; in France in the 1960's, when Algeria, which wanted independence, was looked upon as an overseas part of France. Therefore, I want to emphasize that what we are observing today in Russia is not really surprising. These are forces with which we must reckon; please note, however, that there are also progressive democratic forces, led by President Yeltsin. I hope that democracy will win; that new relations between Russia and its neighbors will develop in line with accepted rules of international politics, and that they will be friendly and will serve the interests of both sides. The historical process that is going on in today's world is very complex and we cannot really jump to any conclusions. I believe in the wisdom of politicians and assume that we all want a stable and peaceful Europe. The "Partnership for Peace" program seems to be a step in the right direction in this process. [Malik] Romania sees, then, a possibility of Russia's membership in NATO? [Iliescu] I hope that a certain general formula of partnership will be established which will in the future allow the Russian Federation to integrate with political and economic structures throughout Europe. I hope that Russia will find its niche in the community based on the rule of respecting the interests of all states. Today, a new international order is being constructed; this order is based on cooperation and understanding between all states and nations. It is a necessity, however, it is at the same time a guarantee of peace and stability. [Malik] You are one of the few politicians in former socialist countries who is still in power after all the changes that have taken place. Could you reveal the source of this success? [Iliescu] Once again we must go back to history. Romania was one of the states where the communist regime was very strict. However, at the time of intervention in Czechoslovakia and even earlier, Romania proved that it was not going to just passively follow the orders of the Kremlin. It was only the policy of the last decade, under the Nicolae Ceausescu regime, that led to an economic catastrophe, to unprecedented exclusion of the intellectual elites from political and economic life; in those years the elites were sentenced to a life of isolation. Building an autocratic economy and paying off the foreign debt at any cost were the most important achievements -- in the negative sense -- of the last communist leader of Romania. This is why the activities of the opposition were so radical; this is why we had a revolution that did not occur in any other former communist country. In the times of President Causescu, I was isolated for criticizing his policy in public. Because of that, I became a well-known personality -- one can even say that I became popular. I did many things that did not exactly fit the compulsory model. When the revolution broke out, in December 1989, I found myself in the center of all the events and, perhaps because of my past, the people trusted me. I was elected chairman of the National Salvation Front. Then in the 1990 elections, I was elected president; finally, two years ago, the people once again supported my candidacy for the head of state. It looks like I am still enjoying the trust of the people. [Malik] Mr. President, not long ago Romania was depicted as a country governed by former communists. The situation changed a little after a former communist leader won the elections in Lithuania and after a social-democratic party won the Polish elections. Did you not, at a certain point, get the impression that Western politicians wanted to force you, as it were, to leave the political scene? [Iliescu] I get the impression that not only in the case of Romania, but in all the states formerly governed by communists, there is a certain ideological flaw in the way the West perceives us. The very term ex-communist has in our case negative connotations. I will ask the following question: Should over 4 million members of the Romanian communist party now be isolated, excluded from the political and economic life? What should happen to the leaders of the opposition, such as Professor Emil Constantinescu (leader of the oppositional Democratic Convention comprised of 18 groupings -- R.M.), who was the [communist] party's ideological secretary in the university? Former communist party members are in all the groupings today. Almost the entire intellectual elite in Romania was in the party. This is not the only criterion for evaluating people. This is not acceptable; it is a Bolshevik evaluation. We must build a new Romanian society and evaluate people according to what they can do. One must see things and people as they really are, without looking into the dossier at any cost. [Malik] In Switzerland, in exile, lives former King Michael II. Why do you not want him to return to his fatherland? [Iliescu] We must look at this problem without any emotions. The problem is whether Romania is supposed to be a monarchy or a republic. The Romanian people have already expressed their opinions on this subject in a referendum; they accepted the republican constitution. Monarchy was a certain stage in the history of Romania; there is no raison d'etre for its role in a new society. Indeed, there are various forces and people in our country that for various reasons want to restore the monarchy. These people are living with illusions -- they want to return to the times before World War II. Today, that is simply impossible. Personally, I have nothing against the king. However, if he wants to return to Romania as a king, this is simply out of the question. Now, if he wants to come back here as an ordinary citizen, then he is welcome. Let me only add that it is not him that is the cause of all this commotion; he does not want to be a monarch any longer. Those who have caused it are people driven by nostalgia. [Malik] Is it true that Romania is being isolated, that there are opinions in Bucharest that the state has been relegated to the sidelines of regional initiatives, and that entrance into the Council of Europe was delayed? [Iliescu] Romania does not want to be isolated. It is true that we are being moved away. We wanted -- fruitlessly -- to become a member of the Visegrad Group and to join the Central European Initiative. We want to cooperate with all the states of Central and East Europe, including Poland. As far as the issue of admitting us to the Council of Europe is concerned, my evaluation is that it was the same ideological flaw -- perceiving us as former communists. However, also as a result of our internal disputes, they are transferred to the international level. It is one of our weaknesses in the period of change. We know all about it. The climate for Romania is now better. Everyone understands that including our country in the process of European integration will be in the interest of all Europe. [Malik] Since I am speaking with you as the Romanian president, I cannot help asking you a question about the Republic of Moldova, which was established from the debris of the USSR. Is it possible, and is it very real, that Romania and Moldova will become one state? There will be a referendum on this very soon. [Iliescu] Well, this is a very difficult issue given the present international situation. We must look at it objectively. We must respect international and interstate agreements that set the present borders in Europe. One cannot change the present status of borders in one point, because this would cause an avalanche of corrections; such an avalanche would be difficult to control and would place the stabilization of the entire continent in question. As for the Republic of Moldova, it is one of the many states that were established after the collapse of the Soviet Union; processes of political and economic transformations are under way there. However, it must be remembered that Moldova is a territory that historically belongs to Romania; that Romanian is spoken there; and that the country has the same culture. The Soviet Union's annexation of Moldova was the result of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact; however, Nikita Khrushchev was even smarter than Stalin and divided Moldova; as a result, today part of it belongs to Ukraine. Thus, now this concerns not only the Republic of Moldova, but also Ukraine. We have good relations with Moldova and we will develop them in all areas. The answer to the question of when the unification of these states will be possible remains pure guesswork. No one knows that. If we assume that in the future united Europe there will be no borders and that there will be one great European nation, this issue will not be so emotional. [Malik] Many national minorities live in Romania. Of these, the Hungarians are the most numerous. This is the cause of tensions in the relations between Romania and Hungary. What guarantees does Romania provide minorities? [Iliescu] In Romania lives a Hungarian minority that consists of 1.7 million people. Just like all the other minorities, of which there are 14, the Constitution guarantees them all rights, it can develop without any hindrances, in peace, and with the feeling of stability. The minorities have their own representatives in the parliament. Even the smallest national groups, in case their representatives are not elected to parliament, are guaranteed a seat there. The Romanian Government has acknowledged the rights of the minorities for free development, in accordance with their needs, in every area. No matter whether they are Germans or Hungarians, all of them have the same rights as Romanian citizens. The rule that our country is applying is that minority members must be loyal citizens of Romania and observe all binding laws. Now, as for our relations with Hungary. We have informed Budapest that we are alarmed at the extreme demonstrations of some political forces in Hungary which query the status quo in the region and demand extraordinary rights for the Hungarian minority in Romania, and not only here. We do not consent to the idea of territorial autonomy for any minority. For example, do the Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine in France have autonomy? We believe that these are issues that each state regulates in line with international law. Please bear in mind that one-third of Romanians live outside our borders. We are not trying to turn it into a problem; we are not bringing this issue up. We support the contacts of the Hungarians with their native country; however, we would also like them to be loyal citizens of Romania and to respect the law just like all the other citizens. I believe that our relations with Hungary are good. Our economic contacts are on a very good level, I would say. I do believe that if we take a real look at the problems that need to be resolved and that need cooperation, we will render these relations normal and friendly. Just like the relations with any other state. [Malik] Many economic problems of Romania have their origin in the war in former Yugoslavia. Does Romania, which has good relations with the new Yugoslavia, have any influence on this conflict? Is it doing anything to help end this conflict? [Iliescu] Romania has never had any conflicts with former Yugoslavia. On the contrary, our relations are very good. As I see it, the disintegration of Yugoslavia was a positive event. After World War I, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established which functioned very well; it settled disputes between various nations and various religions, the Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Church members. In World War II, the nations of Yugoslavia fought jointly against the German invaders. The disintegration of Yugoslavia is the result of the ending of the Cold War; it is the play of the interests of various states, such as Germany, which contributed to what happened. Romania today has good relations with the new Yugoslavia, with Slovenia, and with Croatia. We would like the conflict in Bosnia to be settled quickly and peacefully. We are trying to help this cause as much as we can. We have historical, political, economic, and cultural relations with this region. It is also in our interest to finally settle this dramatic conflict. [Malik] Mr. President, Polish-Romanian relations have a long tradition. They have always been friendly. How do you evaluate them today? [Iliescu] I would first of all like to emphasize that we attach great importance to our relations with Poland and their development. First, because we cooperated many times in the past and many times we were on the same side of the barricade. We were linked by the same problems. Our neighbors were great empires which attempted to submit us to themselves. Right now we are facing a great challenge related to the process of democratic transformation and the introduction of a market economy. Therefore, it is with sorrow that I speak about the unfriendly treatment of Romania; you write about our state being a country of Gypsies; your mass media, including the newspaper that you represent, present only a negative picture of Romania. Why is that? Is it because Poland is enjoying great sympathy in Romania and because the Romanians admire Polish culture? We are both surprised and alarmed at this reservedness on the part of Poland toward Romania. However, I am an optimist and I hope that in the immediate future better times for Polish-Romanian relations will come. Using your newspaper, I would like to inform all your readers about my optimism and about the great sentiment that the Romanian people have for Poland and Poles.
