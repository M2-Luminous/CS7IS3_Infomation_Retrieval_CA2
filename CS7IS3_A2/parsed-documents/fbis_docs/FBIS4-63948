The Seimas did not pass today the whole law on local elections, but established during the voting on individual articles of the law that the elections will be valid when 25 percent of the electors participate. Local elections should take place this autumn or winter. The candidates for the elections may be nominated by political parties and political organizations. This rule is opposed by the Union of Lithuanian Poles, which organized a picket at the Seimas building today. The picketers demanded that public organizations of the national minorities be allowed to take part in the Seimas and local elections. They said in a statement that no national minority in Lithuania has its political party but takes part in political life through its public organization.
