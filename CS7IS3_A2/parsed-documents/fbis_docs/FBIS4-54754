According to the monetary analysis of the Slovak National Bank [SNB] with preliminary data for December 1993, the GDP, which in the first and second quarters of 1993 reduced its lag behind the comparable periods in 1992 from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, cut this difference in the third quarter to 4.3 percent and in the last quarter to 4.1 percent. Of the total yearly inflation of 25.1 percent, the largest portion--more than two-fifths--originated in the first quarter (11.7 percent), whereas, in the last three months, only one-eighth did (monthly values declined from 1.4 percent to 0.6 percent). Semiannual comparisons of quarterly and monthly values of industrial production showed a slowing down of the decline from 16.6 percent in the first quarter to 13.5 percent in the third quarter, and to 12.6 percent in October, 8.8 percent in November, and 7.9 percent in December. In the course of the year, unemployment has been increasing roughly by 0.5 percent per quarter. The balance of foreign trade went from a surplus of hundreds of millions of Slovak korunas [Sk] to a deficit of billions, while turnover increased (Sk66.3 billion in the first quarter, 85.4 billion in the second, 100.7 billion in the third, and 67.7 billion in October and November). Foreign currency reserves of the banking system doubled to $1.4 billion, while the NSB reserves increased from 0.2 to 0.5 billion. Gross foreign debt kept growing until the third quarter (from $2.4 to $3 billion) but has remained steady since then. The deficit of the state budget deepened especially in the first quarter (debit balance Sk11 billion) and last month (difference of 7 billion), and during 1993 registered a total of Sk23 billion. The total debt of the government (excluding foreign loans) thus approached Sk60 billion toward the end of the year.
