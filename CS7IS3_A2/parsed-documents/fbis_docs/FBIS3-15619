According to the agreement that was signed by Belarusian and Russian prime ministers on 8 September 1993, along with the agreement on the unification of their monetary systems, Belarus receives valuables of the "BELTRANSHAZ," the entire property of which is handed over to the statute capital of the Russian Joint Stock Association "GAZPROM." The cost of the "BELTRANSHAZ" property was assessed at 1.2 billion rubles [R] as of 1 January 1993. Land belonging to the Belarusian gas industry is being leased to Russian "GAZPROM" for 99 years. The agreement also states: "The Republic of Belarus guarantees that the property -- which is being handed over to Russia on the basis of the agreement -- and "GAZPROM" investments on the territory of Belarus will not undergo confiscation, nationalization, or requisition. The Republic of Belarus guarantees free transit of Russian natural gas for export." On the other hand, Russia promises to support "GAZPROM" by increasing its yearly gas deliveries to Belarusian consumers up to 21 billion cubic meters in 1995, 26 billion cubic meters in 2000, and 33 billion cubic meters in 2010. The government's note ratifying this agreement enumerates the following advantages, which certify the necessity for its ratification: Belarus will be guaranteed gas deliveries in the amounts required for the national economy; the issues of supplying the Belarusian gas industry with spares, pipes, insulation and operational materials will be resolved; in connection with the increased transit of gas deliveries through the Belarusian territory, the state budget of Belarus will receive more assets; Belarus will enjoy dividends from the activities of "GAZPROM"; the Belarusian construction branch will receive orders for $300 million. However, not all were satisfied with the arguments of the government. The Supreme Soviet commission for economic reform opposed the ratification of this document and demanded additional information on the conditions of this deal. This is what People's Deputy Leanid Kozik, chairman of the commission, said: "I oppose the ratification of this agreement. This is my and our commission's opinion. We do not see anything beneficial from this agreement: Neither what the costs of the main "BELTRANSHAZ" funds are, nor how many securities the Belarusian party will receive. According to the figures cited in the press, I calculated that Belarus will have 0.5 percent. The cost of Belarusian gas pipelines and pumping stations were assessed at R1.2 billion. I calculated that the cost of the metal for these pipelines alone is much higher. I wrote a resolution that as long as we have no exact figures, and as long as I do not see what this means for the Republic, I am not going to initial this document." Could you propose any alternative to cooperation between the "BELTRANSHAZ" and the "GAZPROM?" "In principle, I am not against the setting up of a joint stock company. However, the documents should be properly formulated, so that one party would not take everything away from the other. Because after joining the joint stock company, we will have only securities while the property will belong to the other party. According to the Russian and Belarusian laws on joint stock companies, in case of withdrawing from a joint stock company, we cannot claim back our property, it will be possible to sell only the securities. I do not oppose the joint stock companies, but it is necessary to properly assess the property and the expenses of the Republic, because later, Russia will continue exporting its gas to the West, however, free of charge. Poland chose to set up a joint stock company with the "GAZPROM...." "There could be other variants if the property belongs to us. The main aim is that Belarus does not lose." What do you think? Will the legislature ratify this agreement? "I will categorically oppose it. I do not think that deputies will believe this note without seeing the figures, and will distribute our property without any reasons for doing this." Other deputies also spoke about their negative attitude toward this agreement. The issue is not only that of the low costs of the "BELTRANSHAZ." According to some assessments, if we sell the state property based on its balance costs, then one U.S. billionaire could buy all the property of the Republic of Belarus. It is not worth selling such strategic objects as pipelines at their real, market price because the Republic will lose not only its property forever, but its opportunity to affect Russia through the market. It is a very dangerous step if we take into consideration that Belarus depends on Russia in many aspects.
