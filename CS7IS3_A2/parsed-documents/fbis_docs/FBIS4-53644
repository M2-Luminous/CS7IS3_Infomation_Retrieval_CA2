In a commemorative speech delivered on the occasion of World Red Cross Day, he said that the North's call for the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- unconverted long-term prisoners -- as well as the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the northern half of the Republic is foolish, and that the North is responsible for preventing the exchange of visits by old parents between the North and South from being held, and for the lack of progress in the settlement of the issue of separated families. He also maintained that talks between the North and South Red Coss Societies should be resumed, insisting that the North send the so-called detainees, including crews of Tongjin No. 27, to the South. Such remarks by the South Korean Red Cross president are inappropriate for a man of the Red Cross who should regard humanity as sacred and saving mankind from misfortune, as a basic mission. Therefore, we cannot but regard his remarks as unreasonable and preposterous. He even opened himself up to criticism with public opinion at home and abroad by making absurd remarks in his 22 April telephone message sent to our side. Nevertheless, he made such remarks this time again. Regarding the exchange of visits by old parents and the issue of settling separated families, he talked as though we had broken a North-South agreement. This is not true. His remarks distorting the truth can never be understood in today's bright world. Since an agreement was reached between the North and South Red Cross Societies regarding the establishment of a Panmunjom meeting place for separated family members and the exchange of visits by old parents between the North and South, the South Korean authorities have early on forged cunning strategies with the backing of gangsters of the Agency for the National Security Planning and have aggravated tension extremely [kuktoro] on the Korean peninsula by conducting powder-reeking, [hwayangnae nanun] large-scale war exercises against us. It is already well-known that they are responsible for preventing the above-mentioned works from being carried out. We, therefore, are not responsible for its failure, but instead South Korea is totally responsible for it. Regarding our proposal for the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who refused to convert from communism, and the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the northern half of the Republic, he said that the North interprets the humanity of the Red Cross Society and international humanitarian law in its own way. However, it is the South Korean authorities who interpret it in their own way, running counter to the regulation on war and international law. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 regarding the treatment for the prisoners of war defines that the prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after a hostile action ends. Therefore, old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan should have been repatriated to the northern half of the Republic after the conclusion of an Armistice Agreement. This is an obligation of international law, as well as moral responsibility which South Korea should assume responsibility for. That the South is stubbornly insisting that they are not prisoners is merely an unreasonable obstinacy aimed to avoid the criminal responsibility of unfairly detaining and suppressing them and to keep them in South Korea to the last. So is the issue of nationality obtained by old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. Under the condition that South Korean authorities did not return them but kept them under detention, they had to do so to live on. If they had wished to live in South Korea, why would they ask the International Committee of the Red Cross to help them be repatriated to the North? The South Korean Red Cross is charging old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan with violating the National Security Law, which is being strongly denounced and refuted by the international community, and pin unreasonable crimes on them by labeling them with so-called activities and operations to trample the government. This is indeed an unfair treatment ignoring the international law on war and postwar measures and interpreting it at its convenience. The demand regarding the crew of the Tongjin No. 27 is also unreasonable babblings. The Tongjin No. 27, which had infiltrated deep into our side's territorial water in the West Sea, was thoroughly a spy boat. The head fisherman and captain on board confessed that it was a spy boat. The crew on board cursed the South Korean authorities who used them for espionage and said they would never return to South Korea. We never promised anyone that we would return the boat and that could never have happened. The president of the South Korean Red Cross said the detainees should be returned but there are none in our Republic. What we have are defectors who chose our social system according to their own faith and who came with their longing for the northern half of the Republic. It is the meanest act without any human moral or conscience to keep finding fault with us reversing black and white despite the facts. Today, the acting chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, in a telephone message sent to the South Korean Red Cross, once again strongly urged the South side's Red Cross to immediately return old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, and Kim Chi-yon in conformity with international law. The South Korean Red Cross should stop trying to keep old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, and Kim Chi-yon, daughter of unconverted prisoner Kim Pyong-chu, under detention while playing servant to the South Korean authorities, but take steps to immediately return them to the northern half of the Republic according to their own demand and fair public opinion. This is the duty of the Red Cross. If the South Korean Red Cross continues to refuse to return them and use them for insidious political purposes, it will be more condemned by the international community.
