The particle size, specific surface, and mean pore diameter of silicate carriers for solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis are summarized, and the factors which determine their effectiveness are outlined. The carrier has sufficient mechanical strength and can be successfully used in automatic synthesizers. The specific requirements imposed on the spacers are discussed, and it is noted that spacer groups containing longer aliphatic fragments bend more easily and ``stick'' to the polymer's hydrophobic surface, thus shortening the distance between the oligonucleotide and the carrier and decreasing its effectiveness. Consequently, a spacer group with a shorter fragment--ehtylenediamine--and a carrier synthesis method are developed, and the aerosilica gel amination procedure is outlined. The resulting carriers have a close-to-optimum 25-35 ï¿½mole/g capacity resulting in a condensation reaction yield of 97.5-99%. The performance of the proposed carrier fully corresponds to best known carriers on the basis of the CPG porous glass, yet the new material is much cheaper and more easily available. The proposed spacer design also ensures high yields and purity. The authors are grateful to G. Panasenko for proving a Silochrome-2 sample. Figures 1; tables 1; references 11: 2 Russian, 9 Western.
