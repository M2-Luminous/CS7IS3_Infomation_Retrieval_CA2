FR940712-2-00040 FR940712-2-00034 If the proposed methodology is adopted and PRP energy is no longer sold to the CRSP, it will be necessary to collect the PRP's share of transmission costs in Utah under contract No. 2436 with PacifiCorp. Assigning proportional shares of Western's Tier 1 and Tier 2 costs will result in an annual transmission expense of approximately $30,348. This amount also will be included as an annual expense of the PRP. The annual revenue requirement of the PRP, as determined by the PRS, will then be prorated between ICPA and UMPA and divided by 12 for monthly billing to the customers. The rate methodology used to determine the annual revenue requirement will be recalculated each year during the 5-year period that the methodology is proposed to be in effect. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PRP rate methodology is established pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq. ) and the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 U.S.C. ยง388 et seq., as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments, particularly ยง9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, 43 U.S.C. ยง485h(c). By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, published November 10, 1993 (58 FR 58716), the Secretary of Energy delegated (1) The authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates on a nonexclusive basis to the Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, and place such rates into effect on an interim basis to the Deputy Secretary; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, and place into effect on a final basis, to remand, or to disapprove such rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Existing DOE procedures for public participation in power rate adjustments (10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37835). Availability of Information All brochures, studies, comments, letters, memorandums, and other documents made or kept by Western for the purpose of developing the proposed rate methodology for capacity and energy are and will be made available for inspection and copying at the Salt Lake City Area Office located at 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publish a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities. In this instance, the initiation of the PRP rate proposal is related to nonregulatory services provided by Western at a particular rate. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), rules of particular applicability relating to rates or services are not considered rules within the meaning of the act. Since the PRP capacity and energy rate methodology is of limited applicability, no flexibility analysis is required. Determination Under Executive Order 12866 DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by Office of Management and Budget is required. Environmental Evaluation In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ; Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part 1021), Western has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Issued in Golden, Colorado, June 24, 1994. William H. Clagett, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16844 Filed 7&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
