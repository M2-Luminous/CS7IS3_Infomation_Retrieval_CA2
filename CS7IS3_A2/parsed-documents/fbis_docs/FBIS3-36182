The general has already had a meeting with the chief of the Russian Federation General Staff, the commander in chief of the land forces, and the command of the Moscow military district and paid a visit to the Kantemir Tank Division. Henning von Ondarza was more interested in the soldiers' welfare and their attitude to the service as well as in the principles underpinning manpower acquisition for subunits than in their combat proficiency or modern equipment. The general emphasized that armed forces organizational development in Russia and Germany, which are land-based powers, is different from that in the United States and the main thing is that universal military service obligation should be retained in Russia and Germany alike, so that armies do not become closed societies and so that high mobilization reserves are preserved. [Begin Von Ondarza, recording in German fading to Russian translation] The fact that each person is doing something useful for their country is the decisive factor in favor of military service obligation.
