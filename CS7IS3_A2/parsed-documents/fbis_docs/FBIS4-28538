The statement came as the largest opposition LDP is going to send a small group of its legislators, headed by former Defense Agency Director General Taku Yamasaki, to North Korea on Tuesday in an effort to find a solution to the nuclear row. In the statement, the party's study group on Asian security called on North Korea to return fully to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) at the earliest possible date. Japan's largest political party, which up until last August had held a 38-year reign, also demanded that North Korea cooperate with the IAEA's request for inspections of its nuclear sites, including two undeclared facilities. North Korea is suspected of secretly converting plutonium obtained from its plants for development of nuclear weapons, and has refused to accept full inspections by the IAEA. The Japanese coalition government, repeatedly expressing its regret over the issue, is maintaining close contact with the United States and South Korea on how to deal with the north's nuclear problem.
