As he has reported at a meeting with refugees from that region, "consultations are underway with CSCE and Russian leaders on a reliable ceasefire and measures to eliminate the aftermaths of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict." On the opposition's reaction to Azerbaijan's signing of the Bishkek protocol, Aliyev declared: "The leadership did the right thing, having signed the accord. For Baku, the protocol meant only one thing -- a ceasefire." At the same time, he criticized opposition lawmakers for deserting parliament a few days ago and for trying to hold a rally in Baku on Saturday. "Instead of organizing rallies and other mass protests, political parties should consult authorities and be in close touch with them," he stressed. IF Note: Azerbaijan's National Resistance Movement, which includes 14 opposition parties, planned a rally on the Freedom Square in Baku on Saturday in protest against a possible introduction of Russian or CIS troops in Azerbaijan as a force that would disengage the Armenian and Azerbaijani troops. Nearly one hour before the start of the gathering, the whole square was sealed off by up to 1000 policemen, who beat people who were on their way to the square with truncheons. By eye witnesses accounts, scores of protesters were detained and driven by police vans away to an unknown destination. Aliyev reported that lots of cables and telephone calls had been coming in the last few days from people across the republic, mainly in areas near the front, asking to let them come to Baku to crush the opposition. He said the opposition should not fear Russian military presence in the republic. "Russian troops will not be introduced in Azerbaijan", he assured. IF Note: The deployment of a peace force in Karabakh is envisaged by a protocol, discussed at a meeting in Moscow last week by the Karabakh Army Commander, the defence ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and their Russian opposite number who acted as a mediator at that conference. All but the Azerbaijani ministers signed the document. Baku links its signing to the conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement in Karabakh, providing for the liberation of the captured Azerbaijan lands, the return of refugees, and regional economy reconstruction. Talking to an Interfax correspondent, a spokesman for the National Independence Party (led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf Mirgadyrov suggested that "by his statement Aliyev has in fact made it impossible to come to terms with the opposition."
