This was the message which Organisation of African Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and roleplayers. Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25 February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the process. "No stone should be left unturned to see even at this 11th hour if a solution can be found." He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. "This is a challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be successful," he said. Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in Ulundi earlier on Friday had been "very interesting and candid". The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all parties took part. Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in any negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make compromises. The government and the ANC had made some "significant" concessions, he said. Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's [National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to decide. The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the democratic process, like respecting and understanding the country's cultural diversity, he said. Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic process, he said. During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.
