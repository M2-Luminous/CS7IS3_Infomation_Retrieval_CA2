In that sense, the following things are suggested: the transformation of the CDR into a strong alliance of political parties able to make political and postelectoral offers on the basis of a joint political platform; the separation of non-party associations and their transformation into a civil forum supporting the CDR by undertaking specific actions; the structuring of the CDR into central political leading bodies, working bodies, and local bodies; the making of decisions within the CDR solely on the basis of consensus; the working out of a protocol on the ways to participate in elections; the working out of terms regarding postelectoral cooperation; and the establishing of ethical rules referring to interparty relations within the CDR. The declaration also states that the sole way to solve certain tensions that have emerged among the democratic opposition is to sincerely and responsibly approach the ways in which the CDR could be reorganized, reports our correspondent, Iulia Gherman.
