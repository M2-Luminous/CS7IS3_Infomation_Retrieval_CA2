However, he said that unconditional cease-fire should precede any such talks. Saakyan said that unlike Azerbaijan which insists on the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azeri lands as a condition for cease-fire, Nagorno-Karabakh demands an end to the fighting and definition of its status first. In his words, Yerevan is laying great hopes on Russia's peace effort in the region. In the meantime, the continued differences between Yerevan and Baku had prevented the CIS interparliamentary assembly meeting in St. Petersburg over the weekend from adopting an appeal on CIS states not to resort to transport or energy blockade against each other. Leader of the Azeri parliamentary delegation Afiyaddin Jalilov spoke of 20 percent of Azeri territory being annexed by Karabakh Armenians calling to include into the final paper a provision for Armenian pullout and the return of more than a million Azeri refugees to their homes.
