FBIS4-23240 "drafr105_d_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Lusaka Talks Reportedly Still Deadlocked Lusaka Talks Reportedly Still Deadlocked MB3105140494 Luanda Radio Nacional Network in Portuguese 1200 GMT 31 May 94 MB3105140494 Luanda Radio Nacional Network Portuguese BFN [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] [Text] Good afternoon. The Lusaka talks are still at a standstill. A few changes have occurred over the past few hours although Alioune Blondin Beye has stepped up his contacts with government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] representatives. This morning Beye received in separate audiences the leaders of the government and UNITA negotiating teams. Nothing concrete is known about the outcome of the meetings. Sources close to the mediators say the meeting discussed issues linked to the resumption of the talks and the peace process which have led to the present impasse. It can be concluded that members of the UNITA team are still indisposed because of the latest military operations in Angola. To confirm this, today's edition of the TIMES OF ZAMBIA carries an accusation by UNITA about the operations. Political circles in Lusaka noted that those who sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. They questioned who has been shelling the city of Cuito and other areas in Angola. Meanwhile, [name indistinct], head of the UN Office of Public Information, arrived in Lusaka today on a two-day visit. He will assess what progress has been made at the talks, and then will go to Luanda to meet Angolan officials. This morning, the government and UNITA negotiating teams held separate meetings to discuss their own strategies. It is likely that the negotiators will return to the negotiating table at any moment in view of the urgent need for peace in Angola.
