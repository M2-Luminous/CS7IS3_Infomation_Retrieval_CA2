According to statistics of ten major labor exporting provinces (prefectures) such as Sichuan and Henan, the number of laborers emigrating under organized labor department sponsorship reached some 6 million persons; but based on sampling studies and statistical analyses, the number of laborers emigrating individually or without organized labor department sponsorship is estimated to be more than twice that number, i.e. some 12 million persons; thus combining both categories, the total amounts to 18 million persons. When the number of laborers migrating from other provinces (prefectures) were included, the number of migrant laborers in China totals about 20 million. In recent years, the direction of labor migration has concentrated on those areas considered to be the economic "hot spots." Based on preliminary analyses, the Zhujiang River Delta area has taken in about 6.5 million laborers from other provinces, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area approximately 1.2 million, the two municipalities of Beijing-Tianjin approximately 1.5 million and the Fujian coastal areas about 800,000 persons; therefore, the number of migrant laborers from other provinces who were drawn to the various economic hot-spot areas totalled some 10 million persons, accounting for about one-half of total migrant laborers. The projection is that during the Spring Festival period, the momentum of labor migration will not slacken, and causes which lead to the "labor tide" remain operative: First, the several highly productive areas of the Zhujiang River Delta, the Changjiang River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin area are still China's economic "hot spots," and when the economies in other areas are cooling down, the former's attraction to laborers from other provinces not only has not diminished but has become stronger. Second, it will take some time before the effect of measures taken to stabilize the rural areas and strengthen agriculture will be felt, and the peasants, influenced by the signals and relatively better economic benefits of the market, are therefore turning toward the economically developed areas, and this is a trend that cannot be reversed in the short term. Third, in the interior area, some provinces have already used the exporting of surplus laborers as a "core enterprise" to invigorate the rural economy and help realize the goal of becoming "moderately well- off." That being the case, the number of surplus laborers exported is likely to increase. This situation is certainly going to create even greater pressure on the already over-burdened railway transportation system. At present, the Guangdong Province's Labor and Railway Departments are making projections based on studies that in the period before and after next year's Spring Festival, more than 2 million persons will be returning home in other provinces to visit relatives, an increase of 70 percent over this year's. If a 15 percent factor were added (to account for the new migrant laborers who will follow the old-timers when they return to Guangdong), then during the 30 days spanning the Spring Festival, the rail system will have to handle an estimated 4.3 million travelers (2 million on the outbound and 2.3 million inbound). Besides, even if only 50 percent of seasonal laborers were to travel home from the Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou and Fujian Province coastal areas, their total number will be some 2 million persons, and their roundtrip travels will add some 4 million travelers to the rail system. Adding migrant laborers from other areas, it is estimated that in the period before and after the 1994 Spring Festival, a total of more than 10 million migrant laborers will be traveling on the road.
