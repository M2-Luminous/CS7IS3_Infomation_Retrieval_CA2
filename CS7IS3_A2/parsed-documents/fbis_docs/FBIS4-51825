"I'm convinced that our city is eligible because the Asian Development Bank's policy of contributing to development in the Asia-Pacific region matches Fukuoka city's policy," Fukuoka Mayor Keiichi Kuwahara said. Kuwahara made the statement after Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii proposed the holding of the 30th annual meeting of the ADB in 1997 in Fukuoka at an ADB annual meeting in Nice, France Wednesday. Fukuoka is located in the northern part of Kyushu, the most southwestern main island of Japan. "It's a great pleasure. It will help make not only Fukuoka but also Kyushu better known" said Tatsuo Kawai, chairman of the Kyushu-Yamaguchi Economic Federation, a local business group. The Fukuoka business community hopes that by holding the ADB meeting in their city, it will enhance its image as a city open to Asia.
