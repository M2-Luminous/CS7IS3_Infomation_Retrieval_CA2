Thorvald Stoltenberg, another representative of this forum, is expected to arrive in the Russian capital tomorrow. The two diplomats will have talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The question of Russia's participation in political decisionmaking on Bosnia-Herzegovina will be at the center of their talks. Russia should take part not only in drawing up the map of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the talks regarding sanctions against Yugoslavia, but also in adopting resolutions on the military actions that the international community should be taking in this region, Lord Owen said to journalists before his departure for Moscow. The Russians understand that we need to use force, he noted, and our key task is to get them on our side. What we cannot afford is to allow the UN Security Council to be split.
