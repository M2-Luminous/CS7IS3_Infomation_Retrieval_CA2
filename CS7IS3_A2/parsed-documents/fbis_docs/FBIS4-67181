The bill, which was debated by the Justice Committee based on a draft submitted 2 months ago by the executive branch, establishes a prison sentence of no less that 2 and no more than 8 years for those who commercialize poppy seeds that would produce less than 100 plants. The bill also indicates that the poppy plantations that are destroyed "by any means, as long as they do not affect the preservation of the environment, must be done so under the control and responsibility of the provincial prosecutor, who must draft the appropriate document explaining the action." The land used for cultivation, the equipment, and others things used directly to commit the crime will be seized, and as soon as the court hands down its sentence they will become the property of the Agricultural Ministry. Referring to the land, this will preferably be awarded to campesinos without land, according to a clause of the bill that the president sent to Congress for approval. Those who have committed this crime will not be eligible to take advantage of penitentiary benefits such as sentence reductions for work carried out or for helping in the educational sector; pardons; or semi-conditional or conditional release. This bill is the first of its kind in scope, as it is a frontal attack against the proliferation of poppy plantations within the national territory. At the beginning of the week EL COMERCIO revealed a report on the magnitude of illegal poppy cultivation, which is especially attractive for the drug traffickers because its derivatives (opium and heroin) fetch a much higher price than the illegal derivatives of the coca leaf.
