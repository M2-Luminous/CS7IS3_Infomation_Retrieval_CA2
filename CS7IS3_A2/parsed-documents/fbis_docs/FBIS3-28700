The spending, included among the additional outlays for public works projects, is aimed primarily at improving the foundation of agriculture and expanding the scale of farms, they said. The decision is a follow-up to a new global trade agreement reached last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round accord calls for opening Japan's rice market to imports. Of the total expenditures for beefing up agriculture, 145 billion yen will be allocated by the government itself, officials said. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata had high marks for the decision, saying, "The stage has been set (for dealing adequately with the effect of the Uruguay Round agreement on domestic farmers)."
