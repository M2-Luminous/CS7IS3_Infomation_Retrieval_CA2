FR940118-2-00067 FR940118-2-00047 III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States brought this action because the effect of the proposed merger of Dresser and Baroid may be substantially to lessen competition, in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, in the United States for the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale of diamond bits. The risk to competition posed by this transaction, however, would be substantially eliminated were defendants to divest either Baroid Drilling or Dresser's interest in M&hyph;I, and Baroid's diamond bit business, as defined in the proposed Final Judgment, to a purchaser or purchasers that would operate the businesses as active, independent, and financially viable United States competitors in the respective product markets. To this end, the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment are designed to accomplish the sale of a drilling fluid business as well as the sale of Baroid's diamond bit business and to prevent the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition. Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest the ``drilling fluid business'' by June 1, 1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States. The ``drilling fluid business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment as either Dresser's 64 percent interest in M&hyph;I, or all assets of Baroid Drilling and any other assets that Baroid owns or has an interest in that are used to research, develop, test, produce, manufacture, service or market, domestically or internationally, drilling fluids. If the divestiture has not occurred by June 1, 1994, the United States may, in its sole discretion, extent the time period up to one month. The proposed Final Judgment prohibits the sale by the defendants of the drilling fluid business to their major competitors in the drilling fluid market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., and Anchor Drilling Fluids. This prohibition lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of the drilling fluid business is also prohibited from combining that business with the drilling operations of any of those three companies or Dresser. Section V of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' by July 1, 1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and sale of diamond bits in the United States. ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment as the assets owned or controlled by Baroid that are or have been used in the United States to research, develop, test, manufacture, service or market its diamond drill bits. The assets to be divested include Baroid's diamond bit manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, all equipment in that plant, and all equipment owned or controlled by Baroid that was used to manufacture matrix diamond bits. 2 Baroid's diamond bit business also includes a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in the United States and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond bits anywhere in the world, except The People's Republic of China, using all patents and other intellectual property owned or controlled by Baroid. These licenses will allow the purchaser to be an effective competitor in the United States diamond drill bit market. The business divested will additionally include research and development equipment in the Houston plant and access for two years to certain pieces of research and development equipment in Baroid's Belgium facility, as well as data from almost all research and development projects relating to matrix or steel-bodied drill bits undertaken by Baroid up to and including the date of the divestiture. Research and development of diamond drill bits includes, but is not limited to, engineering support relating to the analysis and testing of a diamond drill bit's design, application, and components in order to enhance the bit's performance or to create a new diamond bit. In addition, Baroid's diamond bit business includes all data recording diamond bit performance in Baroid's possession at the date of divestiture. The purchaser also has the right for two years to market its diamond bits as being manufactured pursuant to a license from DBS but will not have the right to use the trade names of ``Stratabit,'' ``DB Stratabit, Inc.,'' ``Diamont Boart,'' ``DBS,'' or any derivative thereof. The licenses granted need not be transferable, and thus remain with the original purchaser in perpetuity unless transferred in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of Baroid's diamond bit business. 2 There are two basic designs of diamond drill bits: Matrix diamond bits and steel-bodied diamond bits. Baroid currently manufactures only steel-bodied diamond bits, at the Houston facility. In the past it also manufactured matrix diamond bits at the plant. Some equipment that was used for manufacturing matrix diamond bits is in storage.
