In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for NAFTA&hyph;TAA the following group eligibility requirements of Section 250 of the Trade Act must be met: (1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof, (including workers in any agricultural firm or appropriate subdivision thereof) have become totally or partially separated from employment and either_ (A) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, (B) that imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision have increased. (c) that the increase in imports contributed importantly to such workers' separations or threat of separation and to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or (2) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision. Negative Determinations NAFTA&hyph;TAA NAFTA&hyph;TAA&hyph;000164; Lipe-Rollway Corp., Rollway Bearing Div., Liverpool, NY The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. U.S. imports of cylindrical roller bearings from Canada and Mexico declined in the twelve month period of May 1993 through April 1994 compared to the same period one year earlier. A survey of major customers revealed that customers did not import roller bearings from Canada or Mexico in 1992, 1993 or during January-June 1994. NAFTA&hyph;TAA&hyph;00166; Lockheed Fort Worth Co., Fort Worth, TX The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met.

NAFTA&hyph;TAA&hyph;00116; Fisher-Price, Inc., Brownsville, TX (Matamoros, MX) The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. Worker separations at the subject plant are a result of a company decision to move production from Matamoros to other locations in Mexico and to the Orient. A shift in production from one location in Mexico to another location in that country cannot be used as a basis for certification under the terms of Title V of the North American Free Trade Implementation Act. NAFTA&hyph;TAA&hyph;00171; Coltec Industries, Inc., Burbank, CA The investigation revealed that the workers of the subject firm did not produce an article within the meaning of the Act.
