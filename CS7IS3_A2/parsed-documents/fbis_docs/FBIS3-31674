The term recommunization has a meaning only if applied to the return of cadres from the old nomenklatura to the organs of state power, he pointed out. The opposition is not behaving properly, according to President Zhelev. It could have overcome bitterness and mutual insults by restoring the old majority of the people who won the last elections and who should once more take over the executive power in order to promote the reforms. Elections under the current circumstances are likely to involve the risk of uncertain results, the president stressed. President Zhelev sees the Union of Democratic Forces as a democratic coalition rallying the democratic, antitotalitarian, and non-communist forces, namely all those who are really called upon to carry out the reforms in Bulgaria. This is what determines the future and fate of our country, President Zhelev stated at the end of his interview for the Khorizont Radio Network.
