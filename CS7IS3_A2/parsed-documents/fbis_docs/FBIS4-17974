INTERFAX's correspondent reported from Dushanbe citing department chief Zafar Saidov that according to the Foreign Ministry (!), "in March-April of this year a redeployment of armed groupings belonging to the Tajikistan Islamic Revival Movement has been reported on Afghan territory in the provinces of Qonduz and Tahar." The Foreign Ministry also learned that the opposition units have been supplied with food and transport by General Abdol Basir Haled, commander of the 29th Infantry Division of the Afghan Defense Ministry, and that in the Tajik province of Badakhshan an opposition armed grouping of up to 1500 hit-men has been massed under Khadzhi Abdulrashid Badakhshi, a confectioner (!). The same Zafar Saidov unveiled the opposition's plans, telling journalists that "the hit-men are going to reach the territory of the Gornyy Badakhshan autonomous oblast and to approach the area of the Khaburabad pass to carry out military operations against Tajikistan Government forces." INTERFAX's anonymous military source confirmed that a breakthrough across the border was planned in the Ishkashim district of Gornyy Badakhshan. At the command staff of the Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan it was confirmed that on 23 April guards clashed with three border violators, who were killed in the ensuing skirmish, in the 2d border post's zone of action in the Ishkashim district border. On 24 April, another two intruders were shot dead in the same zone. In the same breath, the INTERFAX report speaks about an active discussion of the new draft Constitution, although the text was published only 22 April. Apart from military information, reports about candidates for president should also be expected from Tajikistan. Now it is known at least that the election campaign has already started among the population: Names mentioned most commonly include Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov; his first deputy, Abdumadzhid Dostiyev; Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov, former prime minister and current ambassador to Russia; and also Major General Yakub Salimov, internal affairs minister. There are a number of inconsistencies in the latest reports of the Foreign Ministry information department. First, Makhmadsakhi Azizkhonov, chairman of the Ishkashim district, does not know anything about the armed clash; Badakhshan administration officials deny it, too. In reality, a resident of the Ishkashim district told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that on 23 April local residents held a rally outside the building of the district executive committee to protest bread shortages. Earlier they also complained about the catastrophic situation with food supplies by sending to Khorog a telegram, the text of which was published in the local ZINDAGI newspaper. Second, the Tajik Foreign Ministry information department did not know anything about a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publication on Saturday (23 April) that gives -- presumably citing military intelligence sources -- an absolutely different account of the strength of opposition hit-men and a different name of the armed group's commander. Third, the diplomatic ministry has put itself in a fairly awkward position by divulging unique information and showing that it is perfectly familiar not only with the situation in military circles, but also with detailed plans of the opposition. If this is really so, it turns out that the Foreign Ministry is engaged in intelligence and counterintelligence operations, thus assisting the Tajikistan Security Ministry and the Russian Main Intelligence Administration. During the talks between a government delegation and the opposition that were held in the first half of April in Moscow an oral agreement was reached that both sides should refrain from disseminating propaganda. Apparently, the Tajikistan Foreign Ministry information department has not acceded to the accord.
