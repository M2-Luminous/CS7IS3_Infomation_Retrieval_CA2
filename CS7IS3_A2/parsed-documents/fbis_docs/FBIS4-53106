At the same time, a group of people have distributed false letters calling on the public to join demonstrations or meetings on 17 May in the name of the two associations mentioned above. Venerable Monk (Vichea Ratanapannha Wilson) and (Sit Kosangsin) have rejected any undertaking that run counter to the wish and desire of the revered his majesty the king, who is the father of national peace. The Interior Ministry would like to stress also that until now, the ministry has not received any new requests for holding the demonstration. It is with the goal of ensuring security and public order that I would like your venerable personages and the public to please be informed. Thank you. Issued in Phnom Penh on 16 May 1994
