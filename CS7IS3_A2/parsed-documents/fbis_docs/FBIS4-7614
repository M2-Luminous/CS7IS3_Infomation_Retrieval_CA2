Czaczkowska and Marcin Dominik Zdort: "President Drives Coalition Politicians to Madness"] [Text] "President Walesa wants to drive the governing coalition politicians to madness, and he is being successful: Aleksander Kwasniewski uses a ladder and a window to get out, just like the count of Monte Cristo; the leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] should ask for an extended long sick leave," claims Stefan Niesiolowski, when asked to comment on recent activities by Lech Walesa--namely, the fight with the governing coalition, his refusal to approve the nomination of Dariusz Rosati, and the announcement of his plans to veto the Budget Law. According to the deputy president of the Christian-National Union [ZChN], Walesa has all along been implementing the same plan. He wants to be reelected for a second term. "Lech Walesa wants to destabilize the situation. He wants to rock the government coalition because... In a Stable System He Would Have No Chance of Winning ...in the elections," believes Niesiolowski; he also perceives the president's activities as an attempt to return to their roots and to regain the popularity of the anticommunist electorate. The ZChN leader believes that another move by the president may be overthrowing the government and forming an interim government, and, finally, a repeat of history: the return of Walesa to save Poland from communism. A diagnosis similar to this one was made by Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. "To achieve his strategic goal, the president must build a political camp, and right now he is demonstrating that only he, with his constitutional powers, is capable of stopping the center left. He claims that the alternative to the September winners is not the right wing, not the Democratic Union [UD] merging with the liberals, but himself--Lech Walesa. In this manner, he gives the Solidarity camp people to understand that, if they do not want to be defeated once again, he must again lead this camp, and only he himself is able to ensure efficiency and a victory for it," says the PSL deputy, who also noted that, while thinking about being reelected, the president is beginning to... Force His Opponents to the Floor "He says: Look, in only six months, I made the victorious Kwasniewski do such things as leave the Sejm premises with the help of a ladder. He is showing that he is active, that he is someone more than just the president. He confirms his importance." This is how Piechocinski evaluated Walesa's activities. Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD is also convinced that all of the president's moves and actions serve only one purpose: reelection in the 1995 presidential election. "All of his activities are dictated by the desire to gain better footing before the presidential campaign; this is why he so determinedly fought with the National Council of Radio and Television. When it turned out that, contrary to his expectations, the council became an independent body and even the people appointed by him demonstrated considerable independence, there came a fierce attack, criticism of the entire council; he did this just to have television, a powerful weapon, at his disposal during the presidential campaign," claims Siemiatkowski. "The other platform of the president's activities consists of criticizing his rivals. This is why... The Brunt of the Attack Was Directed at Aleksander Kwasniewski "In my opinion, the activities that aim at weakening the coalition are in fact caused by the desire to discredit the politician who seems to be his most important rival," says the SLD spokesman. He also says that the president is trying to win over new supporters before the next campaign. "This was supposed to be partially achieved by the people's constitutional initiative, which gave various extraparliamentary milieus the possibility of integration. Also, if the president does not sign the budget, it will be another attempt to find elements dissatisfied with the current economic policy; it will prove his desire to take over some of the social dissatisfaction that has been accompanying the economic reforms for years," believes Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. According to Piotr Nowina-Konopka of UD, Lech Walesa's next term will depend on his ability to stabilize the political situation in Poland. However, Nowina-Konopka can see that the president's activities do not serve stabilization. "The president is thinking about his reelection in terms of positive developments in Poland. He is convinced that his reelection will be for the good of Poland. However, I am now submitting certain doubts whether... Such a Manner of Approaching the Presidency ...serves the stability of the state," says the UD deputy. Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, of the Union for Real Politics [UPR], believes that the recent moves by Lech Walesa should not be looked upon as attempts to destabilize the situation but, rather, as part of the fight for the shape of the political system in Poland. The UPR leader recalls that the left wing supported the parliamentary-cabinet government system, whereas Walesa believes that the balance of power should be respected. "A constant element of Lech Walesa's game is the following: When someone rises too high, Walesa draws up someone else from political nonexistence. This is what happened with Bielecki and then with Pawlak, who has come to the first division owing to Walesa, and who is still there." This is how Stanislaw Michalkiewicz tries to explain the president's intentions. Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland believes that Lech Walesa, in all his activities, wants to maintain balance in the political scene and, in line with his constitutional powers, wants to represent the opinion of the people, deceived by the present governing coalition. "We should not look upon these activities as the presidential campaign." "It is still too early for the campaign," adds Krol. According to him, Walesa will either force the coalition to implement the preelection programs of the SLD and the PSL, or it will want to form and support a minority government headed by Waldemar Pawlak.
