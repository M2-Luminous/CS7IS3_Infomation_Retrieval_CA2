Because I also served as finance minister in the Hosokawa cabinet, this is my second appointment to the post, and I am ready to assume this post again. I would like to briefly review urgent issues first. As a result of the recent 15.25 trillion-yen economic package, bright spots can now be observed in the economy, although it is still in a very delicate stage. To achieve full economic recovery, it is necessary for the government to steadily implement this comprehensive economic package. The package includes a tax reduction plan worth 6 trillion yen, including 5.5 trillion-yen in income tax cuts. I am very grateful that Diet members have shown their understanding about this tax reduction plan, and have endorsed relevant bills. Now that the new government has been inaugurated, I will ask Diet members to start deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. This economic package also has to deal with bad assets owned by financial institutions because assets inflation is still causing distortions in the economy. Although we do not have figures for the period ending March, I think inflation has begun to abate. We will make further efforts to bring inflation to a halt. Next, as the new prime minister has said, we will promote economic reforms by inheriting reform measures from the former government. I think economic reforms are very important for the future society and economy. One of the important reforms is to establish an economic structure in which Japan can cooperate with other countries through promoting deregulation, market liberalization, the review of industrial structure, and other measures. As far as the Finance Ministry is concerned, we have to actively promote deregulation in the insurance and monetary markets. It is also very important that we establish an economic structure that helps smoothly integrate a society of longevity into Japan's society and economy. Of course, this is related to issues concerning employment, regional societies, lifetime education, and others. The Finance Ministry will promote welfare policies to cover medical care, pensions, and nursing. I think it is very important for the government to work out measures to put burdens equally on the people to promote the policies. Because it is no longer allowed to put heavier burdens on working people, the former government decided to cut an income tax, and considered increasing a consumption tax. It is important to establish a structure in which the nation can easily deal with the aging society while imposing light burdens on working people. Of course, in parallel with this issue, the government has to tackle such issues as promoting administrative reform, and revising inequalities in the tax system. That is all I want to say. [Reporter] Mr. Fujii, since you have been named the finance minister again, you continue to be in charge of the budget. Because the Hata cabinet is a minority ruling government, it will have rough going. What do you think of the new cabinet, which is said to be short-lived? [Fujii] As you said, the new cabinet is a minority ruling government. But because the 1994 budget was compiled by many people, including cabinet ministers who are not joining the new cabinet, I think the budget has many points the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party can agree on. We will exert utmost efforts to have the 1994 budget passed by seeking the cooperation of the opposition parties, including the Liberal Democratic Party. [Reporter] The office of former Prime Minister Hosokawa recently announced that the former premier had failed to declare 3 million-yen income. What do you think of Hosokawa's sense of obligation to pay taxes? Also, what do you think of the popular opinion that taxation on politicians is not severe? [Fujii] First, I would like to say that it is people's obligation to pay taxes. In particular, those who are engaged in politics have to strictly fulfill this obligation. Although I am entrusting the National Tax Administration Agency with taxation, I want to stress that we should never be lenient toward politicians. The ultimate and only goal for the Tax Administration Agency is to carry out taxation equally to everyone in accordance with the law. I want to stress this goal will not change in any instance. [Reporter] I would like to ask about the current economic situation. The yen surged to 102 today. You mentioned international cooperation, but do you think Japan can deal with this issue in cooperation with the United States? [Fujii] As I have repeatedly said in the Diet, I would like to refrain from mentioning a specific level of yen exchange rate. But at G-7 meetings in Washington last September and in Frankfurt in February this year, and at the recent meeting in Washington, I asserted that overly rapid foreign exchange movements in one country are not only undesirable for the nation's economy but also have negative effects on the world economy. I believe G-7 finance leaders have a common understanding about this. Therefore, we must respond to overly rapid foreign exchange movements. And the level of exchange rates should reflect the fundamentals of a nation's economy. As G-7 nations have repeatedly said, we must promote policy coordination in various fields. I think this is a common understanding. With this stand, I will deal with the issue you have mentioned. [Unidentified dean of press corps] Thank you very much. [Fujii] Thank you.
