[Kim Yong-sam] Russian Foreign Ministry officials had asked me many times not to raise serious issues since the dacha meeting was especially arranged for friendship. I said that anything could be discussed in a summit and asked them to leave it up to me. President Yeltsin seemed to have expected trivial subjects such as family or hobbies. He seemed to be surprised when I raised the pending issues right after the small talk. However, the atmosphere was very light. [Question] What was the background of the decision to suspend the supply and sales of Russian weapons and parts to North Korea? [Kim] President Yeltsin had been holding on to his difficult position. He said that at least the supply of parts for North Korea's defensive weapons should continue. I asked how could offensive and defensive weapons be differentiated and insisted that the supply should not continue, not even for the sake of money. I persuaded him not to provide parts or technology saying that even if North Korea possessed 100 weapons, those would be useless if Russia did not provide advanced military technology and arms. The same went with nuclear weapons. I insisted that no concessions could be made and we could not come to a conclusion that night. During the next day's tete-a-tete talks, we could not reach an agreement either until the last moment when President Yeltsin hit the table with both hands and abruptly stood up saying: "I will make the concession to President Kim" and concluded the talks. [Question] What did you talk about with U.S. President Clinton over the telephone on 3 June? [Kim] We talked about everything we wanted for 35 minutes. Although only two points were allowed to be announced, I think our people should not worry about anything. The United States has completely finished armed preparations for any contingency. An around-the-clock surveillance system on North Korean movements is in operation. Of course, a war should be prevented but our people may be relieved because all preparations have been completed for any contingency. Commander Gary Luck of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces is a very deliberate man. He was in the Gulf war and has an outstanding sense of modern warfare. It is very significant to have someone like him in the ROK. Everything is well prepared and arranged. [Question] Is it certain that Russia will participate in the UN Security Council's sanctions on North Korea? [Kim] Of course. Did President Yeltsin not say clearly in the joint news conference that Russia will participate? China is known to have great influence on North Korea but actually China gives North Korea nothing more than petroleum. Russia is the country that gives weapons to North Korea and its relations with North Korea are not simple. [Question] What will happen to the North Korean loggers issue? [Kim] The loggers are like people without a nation. They have had their passports seized by North Korean security officers. I told President Yeltsin that none of the loggers would be able to come to the ROK Embassy holding a passport and that Russia should check each of the loggers to see if they are holding a passport at the time of their entry to Russia. President Yeltsin firmly promised me that every logger should have a passport with him when they come to Russia or that they would not be allowed to enter the country. [Question] What was the discussion on reinforcing economic cooperation between the ROK and Russia? [Kim] Among the many discussions, Russia said it was confident that it could build gas pipelines through North Korea to provide the huge volume of gas consumed by the ROK. We agreed to equally share the feasibility study cost of $20 million. Russia has a plan to provide gas to the ROK on a long-term basis.
