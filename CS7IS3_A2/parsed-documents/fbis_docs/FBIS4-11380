FBIS4-11380 "drlat080_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Brazil Admiral: Sale of Enriched Uranium `Good Deal' Admiral: Sale of Enriched Uranium `Good Deal' PY2604020594 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 25 Apr 94 p 4 PY2604020594 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, head of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat [SAE], yesterday characterized as "foolishly absurd" allegations that the sale of Brazilian enriched uranium to the U.S. company Nuexco would endanger the reloading of the Angra-1 nuclear plant. In its latest edition, the magazine ISTOE reports that Nuclear Industries of Brazil (INB) has sold the enriched uranium at a cost of $1.7 million. Flores said: The transaction will not bring any problems to the Brazilian nuclear program. He added that he would release today all the figures concerning Brazilian uranium reserves. Flores said he learned about the transaction after the contract had been signed, as INB is empowered to make these sales on its own. He said this was a good deal for INB, as the money it has obtained through this sale will make it possible to reactivate already this year the uranium mine of Pocos de Caldas, in Minas Gerais State. Regarding the possibility that the Brazilian uranium could be diverted to countries like Iraq, Iran, or India -- to make bombs -- Flores was even more emphatic. He said: It would be paranoid to believe that Canada, one of the most active verifiers of the use of nuclear energy, could divert the material. Canada, Flores said, is the ultimate destination of the Brazilian uranium sold to Nuexco.
