Meri dismissed Maadis Uurike as finance minister and Trivimi Velliste as foreign minister, replacing the latter with Juri Luik, up till now defense minister. Luik was born in Tallinn in 1966 and is a member of the Isamaa-Pro Patria Party, the largest in the present government coalition. A journalist by profession, he has been in the present government since December 1, 1992, having held the posts of minister without portfolio and defense minister. Luik also heads the Estonian delegation at current Estonian-Russian negotiations. The post of defense minister has been given to Indrek Kannik, a member of parliament, born in Tallinn in 1961 and also a journalist by profession. Kannik is also a member of the Isamaa-Pro Patria Party. However, the president turned down Laar's proposals to replace Toomas Sildmae with another member of parliament, Toivo Jurgenson, as economics minister and to appoint Heiki Kranich, also a member of parliament, finance minister. For this reason, Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna has issued a statement accusing the president of violating the legislation. He said the head of state is authorized to appoint the prime minister alone but that the Constitution and the law on the government prohibit him from rejecting the government's proposals for the replacement of other ministers. The president's refusal to approve the appointment of some of the ministers means that "the renewal of the government will be postponed until the constitutional dispute is resolved by the chancellor of justice or, if necessary, by court," Saarna said. He said the new ministers would not be sworn in and take office before the issue was resolved. The press secretary quoted the prime minister as saying that the instability caused by the dispute might have negative consequences, especially with Estonia's present foreign-policy problems. "The prime minister has reaffirmed that Estonia is a parliamentary, not a presidential republic," Saarna said.
