Jasminka Bogdanic reports: [Bogdanic] At the news conference, Stjepan Mesic, chairman of the Croatian Independent Democrats, explained the reasons for forming this new party on the Croatian political scene and presented its guidelines. [Begin Mesic recording] What we want to achieve by forming this party is for a law-governed state to function, for Croatia to join Europe's processes of integration, for our system to become compatible as soon as possible with developed European democratic systems and, finally, to correct what has been wrong in policy, which is the attitude toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now there are attempts to block the implementation of the Washington agreement. We want that agreement to be honored and Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain a single country. [end recording] [Bogdanic] Stjepan Mesic said that with respect to foreign policy, the HND will contact and cooperate with all European parties which have the word democratic in their names.
