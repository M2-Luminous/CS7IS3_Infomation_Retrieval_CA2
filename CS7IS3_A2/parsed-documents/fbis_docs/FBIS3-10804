An agreement with the IMF is a precondition for signing an accord for rescheduling the debt that Brazil owes to private banks. An IMF mission that was in Brasilia discussing the Brazilian Government budget yesterday returned to the United States without having made a final decision. Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch said there is no more disagreement about figures. A Brazilian technical mission will just the same visit Washington over the weekend to arrange the final details. Brazilian accounts are not easy to understand, if nothing else because the inflation rate is never known. According to the foreign debt agreement timetable, the agreement with the IMF should have been ready on 10 March. The delay, which will be of approximately one week, was caused by the Brazilian Government's delay -- Congress is also responsible for it -- in voting on the Social Emergency Fund and the other measures for balancing public accounts. Furthermore, the accounts of a country with a high, chronic, and diversified inflation rate are a mess. Which inflation rate should be considered, that in cruzeiros -- which will disappear -- or that in reals -- the new currency? There are complex exchanges of funds between different government organs. The Central Bank, for example, makes profits through monetary correction of securities from the Treasury, which is the debtor. Yet the Central Banks returns this money to the Treasury, and the accounts are thus neutralized. In the middle of all these figures an IMF technician said during one of the sessions: "I am totally lost."
