The ongoing fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the government was detrimental to the Cambodian people, Son Sann, the leader of the small Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP), said in the statement. "The Cambodian people...strongly aspire towards peace, a widespread and lasting peace which would allow them benefit from the proper reconstruction of the country," he added. The BLDP and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party were allied with the radical Khmer Rouge fighting against the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime throughout the 13-year civil war brought to a formal end with the signing of the 1991 Paris peace accords. The peace accords paved the way for the UN-supervised elections last May which led to the formation of the current coalition government consisting of the Phnom Penh party, the royalists and the BLDP. But the Khmer Rouge boycotted the polls and continued their guerrilla struggle against the government. Son Sann said the victims of the current fighting were first of all Cambodian soldiers from both sides. "But it is the people who suffer the most," he said. "The inhabitants of combat zones are killed and wounded. The survivors have to flee their destroyed homes and abandon all their belongings. Many try in vain to seek refuge abroad." Son Sann called on all belligerent forces to declare a ceasefire in order "to end or diminish the suffering of the Cambodian people." He also called for talks to start as soon as possible to implement a peace proposal put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. The king suggested that "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge be given senior government posts in return for the radical faction opening up its zones, ceasing all guerrilla activities and merging its fighters with the government's royal armed forces. Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan recently said he supported the king's proposal but co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen accused him of being "insincere" and demanded that the Khmer Rouge obey a ceasefire first and then hold the peace talks. Government forces captured the Khmer Rouge's major headquarters and logistics base at Anlung Veng, near the Thai border in Siem Reap province on February 5, government officials said, adding that one of the main objectives of the attack was to push the guerrillas towards accepting a ceasefire. Troops were also moving on Khmer Rouge positions to the east of Anlung Veng, in remote northern Preah Vihear province, co-premier Prince Ranariddh said Monday. Some 2,000 villagers recently fled their homes in the Choam Khsan district of Preah Vihear to escape heavy guerrilla rocket and artillery attacks on government positions Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have also threatened to attack the Khmer Rouge's main headquarters at Pailin in Battambang province if the guerrillas did not agree to the ceasefire prior to negotiations. A western diplomat, however, said the government seemed to be losing patience with the guerrillas and to be shifting from a policy of fighting and talking, to just fighting.
