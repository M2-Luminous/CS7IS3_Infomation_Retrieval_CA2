He was conceivably satisfied, like the whole government, with the positive outcome of the ultimatum, but his message to the nation was far from triumphant. Thanks to a credible military threat from NATO, the situation has been "unlocked." Still, "nothing decisive has taken place yet." Nothing, especially with regard to what is deemed the primary goal: the restoration of peace in Sarajevo, in Bosnia, and throughout the former Yugoslavia. "Watchfulness" therefore remains the operative word. Even if that means adopting a different position from that of other Western capitals. Paris yesterday did not limit itself to merely acknowledging a "positive step." According to Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, it was important to "maintain pressure" and, as emphasized by presidential sources, "to garner the fruit of threat with a view to the future." What matters is determination, making sure that the vacillating glimmer of hope will not be extinguished -- this is also what Edouard Balladur repeatedly told his successive guests throughout the day: First Philippe Seguin and Rene Monory, the presidents of the two Houses of Parliament; then political party officials, whether or not they have representatives in the House or Senate. Flanked by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, the prime minister reviewed the local situation for each of his guests. Air and ground observation missions carried out yesterday confirmed that for the most part, heavy weapons had been moved at least 20 km from Sarajevo, regrouped, or -- for a number of immobilized weapons -- placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control. After providing this information, the prime minister mostly focused on future action -- that is, the political-diplomatic phase, which should be started "resolutely and rapidly." It is even a matter of "urgency." The president of the Republic and the prime minister, who are determined to keep dealing "in total harmony" with the Yugoslav issue, want French diplomacy to remain not only "active," but whenever possible a "driving force" ready to take initiatives or to promote those that may be submitted by other parties. Given past experiences, including the mired Geneva negotiations, the priorities are clear: to enhance American as well as Russian involvement in the peace process. It was noted yesterday that the arrival of Russian paratroops in Sarajevo had no negative impact on the Serbs' decision to observe the ultimatum. In the past hours, neither Francois Mitterrand nor Edouard Balladur appeared shocked, much less angered, by this arrival. Paris hopes that a Russian presence among the Sarajevo blue helmets will contribute to restoring a measure of security, which, Alain Juppe stressed yesterday morning, is a necessary step toward achieving the "goal for the next few days: placing greater Sarajevo under UN administration." Here too, "swift action" is essential inasmuch as Sarajevo is supposed to become "an example" for other safe havens "such as Tuzla, Srebrenica, or Gorazde." "We must act," insists Mr. Juppe. "In Tuzla, the airport must be reopened. This objective must be achieved as soon as possible." "Everything is ready," he indicated, even adding that the Russians were ready to participate in the operation meant to seize control of the airport. This "common discourse" of the president of the Republic and the prime minister was approved by a very large majority of the personalities the prime minister met with yesterday. United last week (with the exception of the National Front and the Communist Party) in their call for a very strict enforcement of the ultimatum, political leaders were once again united in asking that all "peace opportunities" be pursued. [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen stated he felt "a little heartened," while the new Communist Party leader -- who used to be so afraid of a NATO intervention -- finally adopted the same position as other political leaders, stating that "there is nothing more urgent than lowering tension, consolidating the ceasefire, and promoting political solutions."
