Six cabinet ministers, including Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency; Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry; Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and Hiroshi Fujii, minister of finance, met at the Diet building on 22 June to discuss ways to map out the package of deregulatory measures. During the meeting, Director General Ishida stressed the need to boldly relax the current regulations, but other cabinet ministers said only that the package of deregulatory measures can be mapped out on the basis of deregulatory measures that are incorporated in the budget bill and other deregulatory measures that are included in council recommendations. As a result, the meeting failed to produce any tangible results. The government has mapped out a package of deregulatory measures covering about 200 areas. The government, however, intends to increase the number of areas to be deregulated by urging each cabinet minister to make political decisions. The government plans to make a final decision on the package of deregulatory measures at a cabinet meeting on 29 June. Director General Ishida reported the results of the meeting to Prime Minister Hata at the end of the meeting. Upon receiving the report, the prime minister emphasized the need to flesh out the package of deregulatory measures, saying: "It is important to flesh out the package of deregulatory measures. I hope that each ministry and agency will work to increase the number of areas to be deregulated."
