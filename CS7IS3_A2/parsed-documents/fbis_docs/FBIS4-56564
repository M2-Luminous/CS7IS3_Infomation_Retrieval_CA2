Sanin described the meeting as frank, profound, and enriching for increased mutual understanding. [Sanin] "President Fidel Castro's appearance was the same as always, because I have always seen him as dynamic, energetic, and in perfect health. We also had a long conversation and I believe that after we finished, he went on to other matters. Therefore, his health is perfect. I bear a message of friendship from President Castro to President Gaviria, which was the same message I delivered, as two countries that have full diplomatic relations." During the news conference Minister Sanin responded to questions referring to the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba. [Sanin] "This is merely a commercial issue, and it is being treated in that manner by Colombia and Cuba. We are discussing methods of payment, guarantees, and the time period." Noemi Sanin spoke to reporters about her visit to Cuba during the news conference. [Sanin] "It has been a very successful visit because we have completed the entire agenda. We have exchanged opinions, and we reviewed our new relations because it has only been seven months since they were reestablished. Nevertheless, we must stress that the relations are dynamic."
