However, as long as they continued to refuse to do so, Israel must use the good services of the United States. The prime minister added he hoped that the secretary of state would visit the region in the middle of July. We must be convinced that we have done absolutely all we could to make progress and exhaust every opportunity to make peace with Syria, Yitzhaq Rabin said, noting however that such efforts should not be made under any conditions nor at any price. The prime minister was speaking at a ceremony at the president's residence. Reacting to the criticism that was leveled against the statements he made yesterday regarding an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the prime minister asserted that those who failed to keep even one thousandth of the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace had no right to put on an angry face and brazenly state that one could achieve peace in exchange for peace. That was total nonsense, Rabin said. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 23 June in a similar report adds that "Israel was to a large extent responsible whether the Middle East would move in the direction of peace and calm or toward violence and war. As for the proposals delivered to the Syrians, Rabin said that they pertained to the bilateral nature of the relations between the two countries. In the meantime, however, the gap between the parties' positions remained the same."] Foreign Minister Peres said that if the Syrians open the negotiations to meetings at higher levels and on additional tracks, then significant progress could be made. The foreign minister was speaking at a meeting with EU ambassadors in Israel. As for the agreement with the Palestinians, Peres said that its implementation was going smoothly and the Palestinians were organizing themselves in the field from all aspects. The foreign minister noted that Israel was preparing itself for the implementation of the second stage of the agreements.
