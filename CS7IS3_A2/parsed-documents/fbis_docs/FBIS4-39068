The resolution on the border guards was passed in September 1991, almost three years ago. Bacharow, speaking in Russian says: "The number of border guards has more than doubled since then. New formations and units have been created to carry out tasks in a new direction. The border guards acquired their own air force, which considerably raised the mobility and improved the manoeuvring potential of formations and units. The guards also changed in quality. Formations started appearing that were almost totally based on professional staffing. In this short period of time a material and social basis was created, which made it possible not in words, but in deeds, to tackle independently all of the tasks facing us." Bacharow continued: "The guards are sufficiently equipped with up-to-date weapons and hardware. We have good relations with the border guards of neighboring states: Russia, Ukraine Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. We are establishing relations with border guards in Germany and France. This is natural, for it is possible to solve the whole complex of border guard tasks properly today only with full mutual understanding and concise interaction of all services within this or that state and deep integration of analogous processes in all Europe." Bacharow says: "A few words about the operational situation. Today it is more complex than ever. Such negative phenomena as the drugs, illegal immigration, and weapons trading have moved to the number one spot. Although the border guards do not have a direct link with any of them, during everyday life and activity they constantly come up against them. The following figures show that the situation is become more complicated. During six months in 1993, 396 violaters of the state border were detained. Five months into 1994 the number is already 948, including over 200 detained according to information from the departmental service of active measures or by the service itself. Since its creation, this service--which is understaffed by 50 percent--is operating at the level of a good combat border detachment, although it has about 20 times less personnel. It has been proved possible to violate our republic's frontier with impunity. We make no secret of this. During six months in 1993 there were five cases. In 1994 there was only one case. Seventeen criminal cases resulted from violations of the state frontier. In 1993 there were only two criminal cases. Of these 17 cases, seven were organizers from the new legislation passed by the Supreme Soviet. In 1993 contraband worth 0.8 billion rubles was confiscated; in 1994 the amount was 11.5 billion. In 1993 170 weapons were confiscated, and in 1994 the figure was 286. In 1993 123 tonnes of nonferrous metals and in 1994 248 tonnes were confiscated. Narcotics: In 1993, 17.3 kg were confiscated, and in 1994 over 80 kg were confiscated. Border guards received hard currency amounting to over $780,000 from fees for detention and for visas. If all of this is converted into Belarusian rubles, in five months the border guards themselves paid 50 percent of their annual budget. We hope that by the end of this year, as in 1993, we will pay the entire 100 percent of our annual budget ourselves." [sentence as heard] Having stressed the difficulties of the job, Bacharow went on to say: "The fight against illegal immigration is the top priority because it is the source of all evils today. We do have the necessary legislative basis, but it has to be perfected. As commander and as a member of parliament, I am particularly concerned by the fact that the drugs business is moving to a qualitatively new basis. I am consciously making this statement; yes indeed, to a qualitatively new basis. Until now the republic was only a transshipment base, but there are now incidents that confirm that the republic is becoming a market for drug sales. This is a very dangerous point, a very dangerous sign. We were forced to fight the drugs business before now, but even today it is not too late. In the very near future a joint group must be created, a joint department, perhaps a joint administration of the KGB, MVD, border guards, and customs to deal with this issue directly. So far, our efforts are at the level of the stone age."
