FBIS4-13189 "drnes075yy_94001" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks PLO, Israeli Negotiators Continue Cairo Meetings PLO, Israeli Negotiators Continue Cairo Meetings Sha'th Assails Rabin Over Delays JN1804172894 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 14 Apr 94 p 6 JN1804172894 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Report by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo] [Text] Chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has warned that he who does respect the dates in the agreements that he has signed does not adhere to the texts of these agreements, and accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of going too far in his attempt to ignore the dates, saying this violates the commitments by which we are determined to abide. Sha'th told AL-HAYAH that any agreement takes place between two sides, and we should reach an agreement within two or three weeks at most. [sentence as published] He expressed the Palestinian side's fear that Rabin may delay the deadline from 15 May to a later date, and said: We are supposed to fix a date and to stick to it. Sha'th reiterated the call on the U.S. Administration to pay its role as a sponsor of the peace process, and to adhere to its stated positions, and said: We are determined to continue the negotiations. He described U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's expected visit to the region later this month as important. On the Hadera operation that took place yesterday, he said: It is painful that actions of killing in Gaza, Hebron, 'Afula, and Hadera continue and that innocents, whether they are Palestinians or Israelis, are killed without any reason other than that no applicable just peace has been reached. He said the operation should encourage an expedited peace agreement in order to protect the innocents on both sides. Answering a question on a statement by Military Intelligence Commander General Uri in which he said negotiating delegation members Muhammad Dahlan and Faysal al-Husayni, among others, are nominees to replace Palestinian President 'Arafat, Sha'th accused Israel of trying to instigate differences among the Palestinian personalities and said: This is no more than an attempt to instigate 'Arafat in an exposed and lowly manner against his men. Sha'th denied that there is agreement with Israel on supplying the Palestinian police with six helicopters, two of which will be placed at the disposal of President 'Arafat, and said: There is no such agreement. He denied that there is a plan to convene a meeting between 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Bucharest tomorrow.
