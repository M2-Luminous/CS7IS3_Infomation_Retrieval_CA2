This means that all such restrictions throughout the province have been lifted. In view of the fact that Yushu and Golog prefectures are located in remote areas, and that real difficulties of long transport line, slow turnover, and high costs have existed in the grain trade, the provincial government has decided that while lifting restrictions over grain trade and prices, some preferential policies are still applied to the above-mentioned two prefectures. These preferential policies are mainly: The provincial government's overall subsidies for the two prefectures' deficits in grain business will not be reduced, and will continue to be retained. These subsidies will mainly be used to establish grain supply funds, and to support grain enterprises to develop diversified business operations [words indistinct]. In accordance with the principle sharing transport expenses among the state, enterprises, and individuals, the provincial financial department will provide proper subsidies for grain freight of the two prefectures. After the lifting of control over grain prices, pensions of retirees in grain sector will be paid by the provincial financial authorities, and 70 percent of the wages of workers and staff members in the sector will also be subsidized by provincial financial authorities. In addition, to enhance the capacity of the two prefectural governments to exercise macroscopic regulation and control after the lifting of controls over grain prices, the amount of their provincial-level grain reserves will also be properly increased.
