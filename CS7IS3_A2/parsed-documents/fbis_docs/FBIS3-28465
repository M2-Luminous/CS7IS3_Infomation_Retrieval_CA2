FBIS3-28465 "dreas025_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 North Korea Daily Denounces U.S. for Reversing `Promise' SK0702051794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0502 GMT 7 Feb 94 SK0702051794 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["We Have No Intention To Negotiate With a Faithless Partner" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The United States has totally reversed its promise to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that it would seek only an inspection for the continuity of safeguards, and even raised the demand for a "special inspection" of two military sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this is a deliberate act of perfidy against the DPRK. In a commentary titled "We Have No Intention To Negotiate With a Faithless Partner" the analyst says: It is unequivocally stipulated in the agreement reached at the contact between the DPRK and the United States late last year that the DPRK was willing to accept an inspection purely for the continuity of safeguards. Such an inspection is clearly distinguished from routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the legal requirements of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. It is based on the special position of the DPRK which has temporarily suspended the effectiveness of its withdrawal from the NPT. Still less can the "special inspection" be a matter of argument. Nevertheless, the United States is urging the DPRK to accept a comprehensive inspection. This cannot be construed otherwise than an act to intentionally render the situation complicated and obstruct a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. No less grave is the fact that the United States has broken its promise to refrain from using all forces including nuclear weapons and threatening the DPRK with them. This is really the height of impudence, a mockery of the DPRK and the negation of dialogue itself. The United States seems to think that it can force upon others more than what they promised while it can break its promise, because it is a big power. But we can never accept such a notion. We will not entreat the United States to keep its faith. It is our will to answer faith with faith, and strong arm with a tough stance. The U.S. hardline conservatives must stop running riot, clearly seeing whom they are dealing with.
