He made the claim at a seminar in Lae for visiting Queensland businessmen, while outlining his plans to ban tropical log exports from PNG by the year 2000. Sean Dorney reports that Mr. Neville said these plans will include paying up to about $6 million a year for monitoring of exports. [Begin recording] Dorney: The forest minister said Papua New Guinea was about to engage the Swedish surveillance company, SGS, to monitor all PNG's log exports. Mr. Neville said SGS did similar work in 27 other countries and the cost would be more than covered by the revenue that he said was being currently stolen by unscrupulous foreign logging companies. He said the officials figured the log exports in 1992 accounted for only about two-thirds of what his department estimated was felled and shipped away. Neville: So in 1992 alone, we lost in the order of about 700,000 cubic meters of timber, which if we work that out on current log exports price, they are averaging 170 kina [PNG currency] per cubic meter. Dorney: That amounted to about US $120 million. [End recording]
