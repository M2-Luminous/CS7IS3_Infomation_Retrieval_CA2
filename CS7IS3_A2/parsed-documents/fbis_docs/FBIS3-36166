Nikolayev, V. Myznikov, M. Faytelberg; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Nikolayev over video of open-cut coal mine] The Borodinskiy open-cut coal mine in Krasnoyarsk Kray is operating "in a state of anxious anticipation," so to speak. The term "strike" is no longer used here, as it has been banned by law. But nobody can outlaw the fact that as of 1 February the dispatch of fuel to persistent debtors will be suspended. The Krasnoyarsk Kray leadership, in a bid to recover billions in outstanding debts, has obtained certain allowances for its own region. However, the consumers -- heat and electric power stations and boiler houses in Novosibirsk and Irkutsk Oblasts and in Altay and Khabarovsk Krays -- are faced with the choice of either paying up or going without. As of February that means cutting electricity and heat supplies to industrial enterprises first of all, and then to the domestic sector. A state commission visiting the Borodinskiy open-cut coal mine was convinced of the justice of the coal workers' basic demands: Payment arrears will ultimately bring extraction to a halt, because equipment is not being repaired and it is deteriorating. Coal sector workers believe that only Moscow can unravel this complex financial knot. [Video shows work at the open-cut mine, machinery, production processes]
