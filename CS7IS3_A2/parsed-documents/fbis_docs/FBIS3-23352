Lima and El Callao houses more than one third of Peru's total population of 22 million inhabitants. The measure suspends personal guarantees contained in the Constitution and delegates political and military control to the Armed Forces. The measure was published today in the official newspaper EL PERUANO. The newspaper also publishes another measure that extends the state of emergency for 60 days in the provinces of Yungay, Carhuaz, and Recuay in the northern Andes department of Ancash. On 16 March, the Defense Ministry extended for 60 days the state of emergency in four jungle provinces in the northern part of the country.
