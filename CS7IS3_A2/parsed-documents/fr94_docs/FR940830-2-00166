FR940830-2-00166 FR940830-2-00074 Research and Special Programs Administration Pipeline Safety User Fees AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration, (RSPA). ACTION: Notice of Pipeline User Fee Assessments. Section 60301 of Title 49, United States Code 1 , authorizes the assessment and collection of pipeline user fees to fund the pipeline safety activities conducted under 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) assesses each operator of regulated interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines (as defined in 49 CFR part 192), and hazardous liquid pipelines carrying petroleum, petroleum products, anhydrous ammonia and carbon dioxide (as defined in 49 CFR part 195), a share of the total Federal pipeline safety program costs in proportion to the number of miles of pipeline each operator has in service. Operators of liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities are assessed based on total storage capacity (as defined in 49 CFR part 193). 1 Formerly section 7005 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;272). The change in citation is the result of the enactment, on July 5, 1994, of Pub. L. 103&hyph;272, which codified various transportation laws. This notice announces that the fiscal year 1994 user fee assessments for pipeline facilities were mailed to operators on about July 29, 1994. The fees assessed for Natural Gas Transmission, Hazardous Liquid and LNG are as indicated below: Natural gas transmission pipelines: $44.49 per mile (based on 289,674 miles of pipeline). Hazardous liquid pipelines: $32.33 per mile (based on 157,671 miles of pipeline). LNG is based on the number of plants and total storage capacity: ␣ 1Total storage capacity BBLS 1= 1Assessment/plant <10,000 $1,250 10,000&hyph;100,000 $2,500 100,000&hyph;250,000 $3,750 250,000&hyph;500,000 $5,000 >500,000 $7,500 In accordance with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. §60301, Departmental resources were taken into consideration for determining total program costs. The apportionment ratio between gas and liquid, as shown below, is a result of the increased program resources dedicated to the hazardous liquid program due to: (1) environmental requirements following passage of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508); and (2) the Secretary's environmental action plan instituted following a serious hazardous liquid spill in Fairfax County, Virginia in March 1993. ␣ 1Year(s) 1General program costs (Gas) 1General program costs (liquid) 1986&hyph;1990 80% 20% 1991&hyph;1992 75% 25% 1993 75% (3/4 yr.) 60% (1/4 yr.) 25% (3/4 yr.) 40% (1/4 yr.) 1994 60% 40% In accordance with the regulations of the Department of the Treasury, user fees are due 30 days after the date of the assessment. Interest, penalties, and administrative charges will be assessed on delinquent debts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Issued in Washington, DC on August 24, 1994. George W.
