FR940516-1-00022 FR940516-1-00001 Under the proposal, current Rules 4.21(a)(1)(viii) and 4.21(a)(9) would be consolidated into Rule 4.24(h) under the caption ``Use of Proceeds'' 59 and revised to better reflect changes in the nature of funds management. Proposed Rule 4.24(h) would require the description of the pool's trading 60 to include not only transactions in commodity interests but also any other types of interests in which the pool is expected to trade. With respect to pool funds that are not deposited as margin or held in cash or cash equivalents, the proposed rule would require disclosure of the nature of such property, for example, whether it consists of securities listed on a national securities exchange, bonds, commercial paper or interests in commodity pools, whether such property is subject to state or federal regulation or to regulation by a foreign government, and any investment rating applicable to such property. The proposed rule also would require the CPO to indicate the type of custodian, e.g., bank, broker-dealer or other entity, which will hold property not deposited as margin or option premiums and the jurisdiction where held, if other than the United States. The Commission believes that the proposed use of proceeds provision should provide a more coherent statement of the matters called for by current requirements in a manner that is consistent with current practice. 59 Captions are proposed to be added to increase ease of reference to the rules. 60 The proposed rule would also call specifically for a description of the trading program that will be followed. 8. Fees and Expenses Rule 4.21(a)(7) currently requires a description of the expenses that the CPO knows or should know have been incurred in the past year or will be incurred in the current year. Expenses required to be disclosed include, without limitation, fees for management, trading advice, brokerage commissions, legal advice, accounting and organizational services. Rule 4.21(a)(14) requires disclosure of fees and commissions paid in connection with solicitations for the pool. Proposed new Rule 4.24(i) would combine the requirements of Rule 4.21 (a)(7) and (a)(14) to provide in a single section of the disclosure document a complete discussion of costs incurred by the pool for all purposes. The proposed provision relating to fees and expenses (Rule 4.24(i)) requires a detailed description of fees and expenses, including certain fees and expenses that are not specifically enumerated in current Rule 4.21 but that constitute material disclosures and are thus required to be disclosed. 61 Thus, clearance fees and fees paid to national exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, incentive fees, including any disproportionate share of profits allocated to the CPO, i.e., a right of the CPO to receive a greater than pro-rata share of the pool's profits, and fees and expenses incurred as a result of investments in investee pools and other investment vehicles or to fund the guarantee of a limited risk pool, would be required to be set forth specifically in the table. In addition, the proposed rule would clarify that disclosure of fees paid in connection with solicitations for the pool must include trailing commissions as well as any type of benefit that may accrue to persons engaged in such solicitations. 61 See note 48. Expenses, fees and commissions are assessed based on various factors. For example, brokerage fees are assessed based on a round-turn commission, management fees may be based on the net asset value of the pool's assets, incentive fees on trading profits, and sales commissions may be charged as a percentage of the proceeds of the offering. A description of each separate fee and expense may not, however, convey a clear understanding of the actual portion of each pool participation absorbed by fees and expenses. As the risk disclosure statement required by current Rule 4.21(a)(17) indicates, ``in some cases, commodity pools are subject to substantial charges for management, advisory and brokerage fees,'' and ``it may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets.'' To foster a better understanding of the nature of those costs and their impact upon the investment, the proposal would require, in addition to a narrative description, a tabular presentation of fees and expenses from all sources setting forth how the break-even point for the pool is calculated (``break-even analysis''). As noted supra, the ``break-even point'' for the pool, i.e., the trading profit that a pool or trading program must realize in its first year to equal all fees and expenses such that a participant or client will recoup its initial investment, 62 would be required to be set forth as a single figure in the forepart of the pool disclosure document, expressed as a percentage of a unit of initial investment. The break-even analysis would provide an explanation, in tabular form, of how the break-even point is calculated, taking into account all fees, expenses and commissions applicable to the pool. The proposal would require the break-even analysis to be prepared in accordance with rules promulgated by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. As noted above, NFA has filed with the Commission a proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 which would set forth how a break-even point must be calculated and the format in which such calculation must be disclosed. 63 The Commission believes that these proposed requirements with respect to fees and expenses will serve to better codify disclosures required under existing rules and assist readers of disclosure documents in understanding the nature and effect upon investment returns of costs incidental to the offering and operation of the pool. The Commission requests comment as to whether a description of fees and expenses should continue to be required or whether the break-even analysis is sufficient to accurately describe the costs of participation in a pool. 62 This definition would be set forth in Rule 4.10(n). 63 As set forth in NFA's proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13, to calculate the break-even point, the CPO would determine, per unit of participation, the amount of fees and expenses expected to be incurred by the pool during its first year of operation and subtract from that amount the amount of interest income expected to be earned by the pool in its first year, to obtain the pool's gross trading profit necessary for the pool to retain its initial net asset value per unit. The CPO would then determine the amount of additional trading profits necessary to offset the incentive fees which the CPO would charge for managing the pool. Finally, the CPO would calculate the total amount of trading income that the pool must earn to equal the initial selling price per unit after one year. This calculation would be required to be presented in tabular form.
