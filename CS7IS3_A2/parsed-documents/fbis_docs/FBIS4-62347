Federal Commission at Work in Saransk"] [Text] The Republic of Mordovia Supreme Soviet is dragging its feet on reforming organs of representative power in the republic in violation of President Boris Yeltsin's edict. In February 1994, the 17th session of the Supreme Soviet called elections for the State Assembly for 5 June, which is clearly beyond the president's deadline. The next session set 27 November as a new election date. Next the Supreme Soviet Presidium, clearly ignoring Boris Yeltsin's edict on reforming local self-government, passed a decision on resuming the operation of rayon and town Soviets of People's Deputies. Nor would Supreme Soviet deputies heed the opinion of the prosecutor's office and the government of the republic. A commission set up by Boris Yeltsin's directive is currently working in Mordovia. It is composed of officers of the Main State Legal Administration and of the president's staff administration for work with territories, the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs, and the Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission. Mr. Stepanov, Russian Federation deputy justice minister, has been appointed the commission's chairman. The commission is supposed to establish to what extent the legal acts passed by Mordovia's parliament correspond with the Russian Federation Constitution. The Commission has met with Supreme Soviet deputies, Mr. Guslyannikov and members of his former cabinet, heads of rayon administrations, leaders of parties and movements, and candidates nominated for Mordovia's State Assembly.
