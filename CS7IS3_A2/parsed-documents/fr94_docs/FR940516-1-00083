Statutory Authority and Background A. Statutory Authority Authority for the actions proposed in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215, 216, and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550, and 7601(a)). CAA section 213(a) directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone or CO concentrations in more than one area that has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of new nonroad engines and vehicles that, in EPA's judgment cause or contribute to such air pollution. Under CAA section 213(a)(4), EPA may also regulate emissions other than CO, NO X , and VOCs from new nonroad engines and vehicles if EPA determines that such other emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter, ``Nonroad Study'') required by section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991. The Nonroad Study is available in docket A&hyph;91&hyph;24. The determination of the significance of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles in more than one NAAQS nonattainment area, required by section 213(a)(2), was proposed on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809) and is incorporated by reference into this proposal. At the same time, the first set of regulations for a class or category of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution, required by section 213(a)(3), was proposed (58 FR 28809) for new nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW). Today's action continues to implement section 213(a)(3); it proposes emission standards for nonroad spark-ignition (SI) engines at ornd below 19 kW (25 horsepower) (hereafter, ``small SI engines''), another class or category of nonroad engines that contributes to air pollution.
