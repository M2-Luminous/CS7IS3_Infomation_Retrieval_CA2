As we understand, the executive intends at the same time to present a law on public indebtedness, to replace the current regulations on government bonds and state loans, to prevent further supplemental resolutions by the Legislative Yuan, so that the upper ceiling for the proportion of borrowing may not again be raised in the coming year, but it will on that occasion further raise the ceiling for indebtedness in order to increase the latitude for borrowing in the future. However, regardless of whether the government bond and state loan regulations will be changed or whether a separate law on public indebtedness will be promulgated, these kinds of actions can only solve the legality question of state borrowing, but cannot erase the financial deficit. Legislative modifications may for a time, but not in the long run prevent the inflation of the financial deficit. Not only that, but allowing the financial deficit to further inflate is bound to incur disaster for state and society for a long period of time. Is this situation not cause for anxiety? Referring again to statistical data: At the end of fiscal year 1989, the outstanding balance of bonds issued by the central government was still less than 200 billion yuan, while at that time the government's surplus accumulated over the years was as high as over 230 billion yuan. In other words, the central government has had no net indebtedness at all, but rather a fiscal surplus, while in only five, six years not only was the surplus accumulated over the years completely wiped out, but the outstanding balance of indebtedness in the 1995 fiscal year budget was allowed to rise to as high as around 1,200 billion yuan. These specific figures are indeed frightening and startling by revealing the urgency and seriousness of the problem of how to balance fiscal income and expenditure. Be that as it may, the executive sector is apparently without power to control the expansionist trend in the government budget. Even though the Executive Yuan says that the scale of the 1995 fiscal year budget shows negative growth when compared with fiscal year 1994, so that the expansionist trend in expenditures seems to have been controlled, the result of this control is nothing but a presentation of fictitious figures. That is so because at the start of fiscal year 1995, the Executive Yuan decided to no more include the transfer of capital increases of government enterprises in the general budget, thereby omitting 160 billion yuan from the budget of the said year. If that amount would be included, there would still be over 10 percent growth in budget expansion. This shows that the problem of the central government's increasing fiscal deficits is not a problem of insufficient tax revenue, but a problem of too fast a growth of expenditure. During the last few years, the increase in tax revenue has on the average been still higher than the economic growth rate, so that proposals for further tax increases to balance out the fiscal deficit will not at all truly solve the problem. The only realistic way is to reduce public expenditure. How can public expenditure be reduced and the financial crisis that will follow on the continuously expanding budgetary deficit be averted? The answer is very simple, let us just look at the many European and U.S. states that are saddled with financial deficits, then we will know. The method to reduce public expenditure is extremely common, it is only that there are no tricky shortcuts to it. It requires paying a painful price, and that is all that is needed for success. The problem with it is therefore only whether there is strong enough determination; it is not a matter whether the method is or is not appropriate to the time. Judging by Taiwan's present condition, how much of a determination is necessary and how much hardship is there to be faced in reducing public expenditure? First, we have to face the social pain of government departments adopting zero-based budgets, cutting down and merging organizations, and canceling certain operations. Second, in the privatization of public enterprises we have to face the social pain caused by public enterprises no more being allowed to shift investments, having to meet open competition in the market, and staff and workers having to transfer to other work places. Third, government should remove its controls, allowing civilian participation in the free development of education and the development of communications, and in such activities as investments in the information industry, in transportation, and in public utilities, thus creating the "pain" of reducing investment possibilities for government departments. Beyond that, after establishing a system of assessing public investment plans, we shall have to face the pain of not being able to voluntarily put forward further construction plans. Furthermore, in order to establish the system of intermediate-range and long-range capital budgeting, organs and units engaged in public investment will have to face the pain of having to submit in advance detailed plans by year, by periods, and for the whole range of public investments, as they could otherwise not be included in the budget. Finally, to reduce the wasteful expenditure of subsidies from the central government to the local governments, it will also be necessary to establish a system of subsidies to local governments that is based on law, and thereby having to face the pain of reducing administrative intervention by the central government in local governments. All these social pains are related to the renovation of the governmental system. For a long time, government departments have not been able to keep up with the economic progress in the private sector and have not been able to pursue the modernization of the system. These are in particular the main reasons that have created the present situation of inefficiency of government administration and inflated public expenditure. To resolve the inherent danger of the fiscal deficits, we therefore fervently hope that the authorities in charge of policy decisions will take due note, will also show firm determination, and by starting out with a reform of the system, be also able to tackle the problem of effectively reducing the increase in public expenditures.
