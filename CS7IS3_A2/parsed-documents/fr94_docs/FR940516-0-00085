FR940516-0-00085 FR940516-0-00027 (3) Direct pickup interference. The direct pickup (DPU) of a co-channel interfering ambient field by a cable ready device shall not exceed the following criteria. The ratio of the desired to undesired signal levels at the IF passband on each channel shall be at least 45 dB. The average ratio over the six channels shall be at least 50 dB. The desired input signal shall be an NTSC signal having a visual carrier level of 0 dBmV. The equipment under test (EUT) shall be placed on a rotatable table that is one meter in height. Any excess length of the power cord and other connecting leads shall be coiled on the floor under the table. The EUT shall be immersed in a horizontally polarized uniform CW field of 100 mV/m at a frequency 2.55 MHz above the visual carrier of the EUT tuned channel. Measurements shall be made with the EUT tuned to six EIA IS&hyph;132 channels, two each in the low VHF, high VHF and UHF broadcast bands. On each channel, the levels at the IF passband due to the desired and interfering signals are to be measured. (4) Tuner overload. Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 55 dB from 54 to 806 MHz below the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input with each signal individually set at +15 dBmV. Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced EIA IS&hyph;132 channels. (5) Cable input conducted emissions. Conducted spurious emissions that appear at the cable input to the device must meet the following criteria. The input shall be an NTSC video carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field at a level of 0 dBmV and with a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The aural carrier shall be unmodulated. The peak level of the spurious signals will be measured using a spectrum analyzer connected by a directional coupler to the cable input of the equipment under test. Spurious signal levels must not exceed the limits in the following table: From 54 MHz up to and including 300 MHz&hyph;26 dBmV From 300 MHz up to and including 450 MHz&hyph;20 dBmV From 450 MHz up to and including 806 MHz&hyph;15 dBmV The average of the measurements on multiple channels from 450 MHz up to and including 806 MHz shall be no greater than ^20 dBmV. Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least four EIA IS&hyph;132 channels in each of the above bands. The test channels are to be evenly distributed across each of the bands. Measurements for conducted emissions caused by sources internal to the device are to be made in a shielded room. Measurements for conducted emissions caused by external signal sources shall be made in an ambient RF field whose field strength is 100 mV/m, following the same test conditions as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (d) The field strength of radiated emissions from cable ready consumer electronics equipment shall not exceed the limits in §15.109(a) when measured in accordance with the applicable procedures specified in §15.31 and §15.35 for unintentional radiators, with the following modifications. During testing the NTSC input signal level is to be +15 dBmV, with a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The visual carrier is to be modulated by a 10 IRE flat field; the aural carrier is to be unmodulated. Measurements are to be taken on six EIA IS&hyph;132 channels evenly spaced across the required RF input range of the equipment under test. Note: The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are applicable as of June 30, 1997. PART 76_CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE 7. The authority citation for part 76 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 2, 3, 4, 301, 303, 307, 308, 309, 324A 48 Stat., as amended, 1064, 1065, 1066, 1081, 1082, 1083, 1084, 1085, 1101; 47 U.S.C. Secs. 152, 153, 154, 301, 303, 307, 308, 309, 532, 533, 535, 542, 543, 544A, 552 as amended, 106 Stat. 1460. 8. Section 76.605 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(12) as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(12) as paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(13), and adding a new paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: §76.605 Technical standards. (a) *␣*␣* (2) Cable systems shall transmit channels to subscriber premises equipment on frequencies in accordance with the channel allocation plan set forth in the Electronic Industries Association's Cable Television Channel Identification Plan, EIA IS&hyph;132, May 1994'' (EIA IS&hyph;132). This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Cable systems are required to sue this channel allocation plan for signals transmitted in the frequency range 54 MHz to 1002 MHz. Copies of EIA IS&hyph;132 may be obtained from: Global Engineering Documents, 2805 McGraw Ave., Irvine CA 92714. Copies of EIA IS&hyph;132 may be inspected during normal business hours at the following locations: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Dockets Branch (Room 239), Washington, DC, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. This requirement is applicable as of June 30, 1995, for new and re-built cable systems, and on June 30, 1997, for all cable systems. * * * * *
