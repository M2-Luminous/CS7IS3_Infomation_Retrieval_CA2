"Around the end of the year," the economic development "did not show a unified picture; however, the basic economic trend seems to go generally upward," Rexrodt's ministry now notes. The economists in Bonn are more worried about the situation in the west German industry. "Orders received and production once again declined there during the fourth quarter, following an upswing that was observed during the third quarter." All in all, the adjusted GDP, as a comprehensive expression of the overall economic performance, "may have declined a bit" during the last quarter of 1993. As a positive element, the ministry notes "improved" business expectations in the processing industry. On 21 January, the ministry said: "The slow climb out of the deep valley of the economic development had already begun in the old laender last year. During the second and third quarter, the GDP increased slightly and probably stayed at the achieved level also during the last quarter of 1993."
