FBIS4-52274 "dreas089_d_94031" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 South Korea Trade Ministry Reports on Export Increases Trade Ministry Reports on Export Increases SK0905025394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0239 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905025394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's total exports are likely to surpass Taiwan's this year for the first time in six years with Korea recording relatively stable export increases over the past years, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Monday. South Korea exported 19.95 billion dollars worth of goods during the first quarter this year while Taiwanese exports hit 20.1 billion dollars, according to the Ministry. Ministry records, however, show that South Korea recorded a 9.8- percent increase in exports during the period while Taiwan posted a mere 0.4-percent rise. South Korea has recorded export increase rates exceeding 7 percent since 1991. In particular, it has posted increase rates of more than 10 percent every month this year except for February, according to the Ministry. The growth rate of Taiwan's exports, in the meantime, has leveled off, declining from a high of 13.3 percent in 1991 to 7 percent in 1992, 4.3 percent in 1993 and then to just 0.4 percent during the first three months of this year, the Ministry said. South Korea has lagged behind Taiwan in exports since the 1980s. The only exception was 1988, when South Korea shipped out 60.7 billion dollars worth of goods compared with Taiwan's 60.5 billion dollars. "The Taiwanese export structure, composed mainly of light- industry products, faces limitations due to the stiff wage increases nowadays," said one Ministry official. "The situation will reverse toward the end of this year unless something happens because South Korea shows brisk export increases in the heavy and chemical industries where Taiwan is weak," said the official. South Korea took second place in the first-quarter export increase rate competition among the four newly industrializing economies, with a rate of 9.8 percent followed by Hong Kong (8.6 percent) and Taiwan (0.4 percent), according to the Ministry. Singapore came first with 15.3 percent.
