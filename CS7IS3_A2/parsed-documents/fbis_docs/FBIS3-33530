During an impromptu news conference following a three-day tour of Central Cuba with members of the diplomatic corps, Robaina said last night that the first nations he will visit on the Asian continent are Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. He added that at present certain aspects of his visits to India, Malaysia, and Indonesia are being arranged. This tour of Asia is very important to us because of what these countries represent and because several of their foreign ministers have paid official visits to Cuba, Robaina said.
