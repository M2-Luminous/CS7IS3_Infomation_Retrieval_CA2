Do you have an explanation for this? [Schroeder] I have two. The SPD did not manage to mobilize all the voters who are within its reach and failed to make it clear what the issues of work and social justice have to do with Europe. Moreover, the election campaign left a lot to be desired on substance and even more so aesthetically. [DER SPIEGEL] What was it that you did not like? [Schroeder] The election posters and the motifs were too dull. [DER SPIEGEL] You are probably referring to the man who.... [Schroeder] .... is sleeping in a boat, and who, when you look at him, creates the impression: "Socialists do not really want to work hard." I did not like the "mafia" poster, either. After all, we cannot compete with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] as far as law-and-order slogans are concerned, let alone -- thank God -- win the election. [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping has decided that the SPD would support a law that permits the bugging of private homes in specific cases. He is obviously taking a different view on this issue from you. [Schroeder] I supported Scharping's positions on the bugging issue and the asylum law. Yet I find it hard to understand that the SPD should make a classic CDU topic its number one issue in an election campaign. This criticism is not directed against the person and the position of the chairman. We all made a mistake here that we should have avoided. [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you referring to in particular? After all, you are also a member of the Presidium, the highest leadership circle. [Schroeder] So they say. So what I have said can also be understood as self-criticism. However, these decisions were not made in the Presidium. Had I known about the posters, I would have said: They are not good enough. [DER SPIEGEL] You were speaking of the voters whom the SPD could not "mobilize." How big a percent can the SPD win? [Schroeder] Clearly more than 40 percent. [DER SPIEGEL] So how do you explain that the SPD remained below this level even in Lower Saxony and fell behind the CDU? Were you not active enough in the election campaign? [Schroeder] I did my job, but only 52 percent of the voters turned out in Lower Saxony. Nevertheless, the SPD achieved 39 percent. Under the circumstances "also a nice result." [DER SPIEGEL] With his focus on "work, work, work," will Scharping be able to reach new groups of voters? [Schroeder] Work and protecting jobs are government issues. Only as head of government can one be present and helpful when things are bad at the enterprise level. At the abstract level of demands these issues are only very difficult to represent in a credible way. [DER SPIEGEL] So is this topic not suitable for the Bundestag elections? [Schroeder] For the presentation of the opposition in the Bundestag the topic of jobs is appropriate only to a limited degree. This is why the SPD must point to the successful work done in this sphere by all its minister-presidents and use it as proof of its specific authority in industrial policy. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, in all seriousness, think that this group of land leaders could beat Kohl? [Schroeder] The fact that with Oskar Lafontaine a most successful minister-president is responsible for the economy and finances has certainly increased our competence. Everything is fine in the Saarland.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...apart from the magisterial press law.... [Schroeder] ...apart from the press law -- and Lafontaine only lost marginally in the election. It may make sense if we treat the issue of "work" in the election campaign as concretely as we minister-presidents are dealing with it. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you insinuating that the SPD has so far focused too much on Scharping and not presented itself as a team? [Schroeder] I cannot put it like this because, owing to my commitments in Lower Saxony, I am not available for the team. Yet, maybe the SPD could make it clear that, although it has a chairman and a candidate, there are a number of people next to or behind him who also know a thing or two. In all modesty, I do count myself among this group of people. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, maybe, have the feeling that you are not sufficiently respected by Scharping, who defeated you in the poll held among SPD members a year ago? [Schroeder] It is not a question of vanity. He who wants to get more from me than I did -- with my people I won an election in Lower Saxony -- has to tell me so. I want Scharping to win the election because of the party and because of his person. We used to be rivals, but we are not now. [DER SPIEGEL] Many people do not quite believe you on that. [Schroeder] The SPD decided about its leadership at the grass-roots level in an exemplary way. To start a debate on the leadership now would be the silliest thing that the SPD could do. I will certainly not take part in such a debate, out of my own understanding but also out of fear of a threat from my friend Oskar, who said he would give anyone a thrashing who started such a debate. [DER SPIEGEL] Would you think it a good idea if the SPD were to depict you together with Scharping and Lafontaine on one poster? [Schroeder] I would have absolutely no problem. [DER SPIEGEL] What slogan would you recommend? [Schroeder] "The Magnificent Three" I would write cheekily. [DER SPIEGEL] "Negligence in our own club" is what Scharping partly blamed the defeat on in the European elections. Do you feel that this refers to you, too? [Schroeder] Not at all. I have been most discreet, even on issues -- such as the question of a statement in favor of an SPD-Greens coalition -- where everybody knows that I am of a different opinion. [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have to pretend to appear to be more harmless than you are. After all, you must have known that your cheeky remark that the SPD should not constantly invent new contenders -- you mentioned Federal President Herzog; Stihl, head of the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT]; and the coach of the national soccer team, Vogts -- was exactly aimed at your superior, Scharping. [Schroeder] We do not have superiors, only a chairman. It was not intended as criticism of him. After all, I could have added a fourth one, who is not a contender either, namely myself. I wanted to give an informal ad hoc interview. I am sorry if the wrong impression was created. Still, we should not make the mistake now of hiding the real problems behind the irritation created by my interview, which was the only interview that I had given in many months. [DER SPIEGEL] The real problem: Despite the almost 4 million unemployed and extremely high state debt, the SPD has not managed to strip the government coalition of its majority. Can you still win the Bundestag elections? [Schroeder] Yes. If Kohl had reacted in as cowardly a way to setbacks in the last two years as my party has now, he would long since be gone. [DER SPIEGEL] So should Scharping defy all setbacks? [Schroeder] Our message must remain the same. There is no doubt that an upswing has set in. Yet, it is much too miserable to say that this upswing has had an effect on the labor market. We must become more precise and make it clear that only an ecologically acceptable production of goods can create additional jobs. We must make it clear to the people that, now as then, the lowest third of wage-earners are financing the costs related to unity in a ratio of 4:1. These messages, combined with the results of the achievements of the minister-presidents and an attractive election campaign team, are the recipe for success. [DER SPIEGEL] Even with a man at the top who has been so badly damaged? [Schroeder] It is most remarkable and it can terrify even a man with a skin as thick as I have how quickly the "Hosanna!" has turned into a "Crucify him!" The praise for our party chairman is still ringing in my ears. Now it is painful to hear how the same man is being turned into the opposite within a few days or even hours, even though he has not changed his policy. I cannot be had by such games. I do not think that we cannot win the Bundestag election with Rudolf Scharping. On the contrary. [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping is seeking voters from the center. Can they be filled with enthusiasm for ecological thinking? [Schroeder] Certainly. [DER SPIEGEL] Should Scharping now change to Schroeder's course and come out in favor of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens? [Schroeder] No. It would have been fatal for Scharping had he followed such public advice. The candidate must determine the strategy to a great extent. Otherwise he cannot fight and "campaign on the streets and squares...." [DER SPIEGEL] ...You are now quoting Helmut Kohl.... [Schroeder] ...Those who now feel that they have to advise Scharping to change his course to the one that Schroeder pursued in Lower Saxony and endorsed last year are giving him bad advice. A political strategy must fit a person and must show continuity, even in the moment of defeat. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, all of a sudden, also regard the SPD-Green coalition as an inadequate perspective for power to succeed the CDU/CSU/FDP [Christian Social Union/Free Democratic Party] coalition? [Schroeder] Not me. Yet the SPD has more than one option. As is demanded by our federal party manager, Guenter Verheugen, it can rely on several opportunities. [DER SPIEGEL] Could you please explain what has so far been the one option of your party? [Schroeder] The SPD had the option to work in a coalition with the FDP. After all, there is one constant factor in German policy, namely the relentless opportunism of the FDP. If they cannot avoid it, they will come crawling on their stomachs into our hut to enter into a coalition with the SPD. The SPD's strategy has tacitly built on this assumption. [DER SPIEGEL] Was that the strategy of the SPD or Scharping, who, in Rhineland-Palatinate, rules together with the FDP. [Schroeder] These strategies are identical. [DER SPIEGEL] But it was never your option, and you are SPD, too. [Schroeder] It is right that he who has been defeated with his strategy sometimes keeps his mouth shut. After the election we will opt for the one coalition with which we will most likely be able to implement our reform program. For me the answer is not difficult, while for others it is more difficult. [DER SPIEGEL] At the party congress in Halle on Wednesday [22 June], Scharping is to be nominated as the official candidate -- in a secret ballot. Is that not somewhat risky? [Schroeder] I thought that it was correct and noble of Scharping to ask for a secret ballot. The SPD's collective common sense will certainly be enough -- at least in Halle. The delegates will realize that Scharping must not simply give in to all these demands for change that he is now being confronted with. Yet, the concept for victory also includes that we now discuss in public what we can do better. [DER SPIEGEL] Many people within the SPD suspect that Gerhard Schroeder is only waiting for his chance to replace Scharping at the very last minute. What answer have you prepared for this interview to deny this? [Schroeder] I do not have to deny anything, because I have had one experience: Regardless of what I do or fail to do, people will always interpret it as if I wanted something. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, thank you very much for this interview.
