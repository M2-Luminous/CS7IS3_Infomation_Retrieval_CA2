[Begin recording] [Pachano] Gustavo Roosen also said President-elect Rafael Caldera's team of advisers has advised him of Petroven's budget for next year and its guidelines. Roosen pointed out that he fully approves of the plans our main oil company will execute. [Roosen] In fact, Caldera's adviser Julio Cesar Rodriguez attended the 30 December meeting, and we have met several times since that meeting. He fully approves of the budget guidelines. He also told me he approves of the 10-year plan, which encompasses all the objectives to significantly increase the supply of oil products. In fact, as a multifaceted company, about 75 percent of our total sales, including cyclical sales, consist of oil products, and only 25 percent consist of crude oil sales. Since 1982, Petroven has been replacing crude oil exports for oil product exports in international markets. [end recording]
