Even so, he described as positive the preparation, patriotism, and courage of the armies, Armed Forces in general, the militias, and the people of the island, who are capable of facing an enemy that is superior in forces and defeating it. During a meeting to assess the Central Army, a meeting that concluded yesterday in Cienfuegos Province, in central Cuba, the commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) praised the stability of that command and the effort made in 1993 preparing to defend the national territory. He referred to the progress made by the troops in that part of the nation with regard to the maintenance and esprit de corps of combat techniques and weapons, with more than 1.8 million items being maintained (tanks and all kinds of weapons, including gas masks). He recommended that a similar effort be made with farm, construction, and other equipment, equipment that cost millions of dollars. He added that this equipment is now idle due of the lack of fuel or spare parts resulting from the economic crisis Cuba is experiencing. Castro praised the progress made in the plans to build people's tunnels, set up caves and other engineering projects whose implementation respond to a Cuban military theory of "war by the entire people" which involves the training of the population and the creation of conditions to defend each piece of land. He also praised the plan to plant trees, a plan that reached 122 million trees following a program on river basins, energy forests, fruit trees, and reforestation for defense purposes; together with farming and fishing activities so that troops can procure their own supplies. The FAR minister also presided over the ceremony to start this year's defense preparations by the central army. The military organization has three armies -- the Western, Central, and Eastern Armies -- and various types of armed forces.
