The current SPA session discussed the issue on successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] and adopted appropriate decisions. It also summed up the execution of last year's state budget and deliberated and decided on this year's state budget. The current SPA session also deliberated and approved the Law on Protecting Cultural Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the revised and replenished Joint-Venture Law adopted by the SPA Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA. The discussions on the issue on successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the WPK as the SPA primary agenda item and the adoption of appropriate decisions will further encourage the revolutionary zeal of our people who are accelerating the general onward march to create a new upsurge in the revolution and construction, upholding the wise leadership of the party and the leader, and will serve as an important momentum in vigorously organizing and mobilizing them to implement the imminent economic tasks in the period of adjustment. [applause] In the current SPA session, the State Administration Council [SAC] gave the great leader its pledge of loyalty to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategies. Also, responsible functionaries in charge of major fronts in the period of adjustment and deputies of sectors concerned made a firm resolution to fulfill their heavy and honorable tasks without fail. This will further enhance the responsibility and role of administrative and economic organizations, including the SAC, and of functionaries in national economic activities and will effect a great change in our people's worthwhile struggle to fulfill the imminent economic tasks in the period of adjustment. [applause] The 1994 state budget adopted at the current SPA session is a concrete budget based on the solid socialist independent economic foundation that ensures finance required for fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the first year of the adjustment period set forth by the WPK with our own financial resources. It is also a dynamic and people-oriented budget that is correctly formulated so as to elevate the people's material and cultural living standard, to strengthen the country's might, and to further advance the superiority of the popular masses-oriented socialism of our own style. [applause] By deliberating and approving the Law on Protecting Cultural Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the Joint Venture Law adopted by the SPA Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA, the current SPA session has provided a firm legal guarantee for well protecting, properly managing, and correctly inheriting and developing our nation's excellent cultural legacy through the embodiment of our party's chuche-based policy on the nation's cultural legacy, for displaying the superiority of the legal system in socialism of our own style, and for defending and ensuring the country's economic and technological development and its economic interests. [applause] The whole course of the current SPA session's successful discussions on the agenda items clearly demonstrated the superiority and vitality of our country's socialist system, which has been further consolidated and developed as days go by, and under which the imperialists' and reactionaries' antirepublic maneuvers becoming more vicious have been smashed sternly under the wise leadership of the WPK headed by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It also vigorously demonstrated our people's firm faith and invincible will to resolutely protect, defend, and brilliantly consummate the chuche socialist cause to the end with the might of single-hearted unity around the party and the leader. [applause] I now declare the closing of the seventh session of the Ninth SPA, expressing my firm belief that all comrade deputies will excellently repay the party's great confidence and expectations with their successful fulfillment of economic tasks assigned to each sector and unit for the adjustment period, at the front of the masses by greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and fortitude, upholding the leadership of the party and the leader.
