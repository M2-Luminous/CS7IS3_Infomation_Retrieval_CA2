Under Albanian law, Nano faced a maximum 25-year prison term or capital punishment. Nano, 42, refused to make any statements or answer questions during the trial which he said was political. Bashkim Zeneli, spokesman for Nano's former communist Socialist Party, said the sentence was "the most serious violation of democracy and opposition rights in Albania." The Socialists would fight for Nano's release, he said, adding that Nano would continue to be party leader even while in prison. The ruling Democratic Party said Nano's activities had to be judged in court. Nano who was arrested in July last year was prime minister in February-June 1991. The court heard 51 witnesses including former Communist Party officials Ramiz Alia and Adil Carcani during the trial. Several co-defendants arrested on charges of graft were sentenced to lesser prison terms. Sokrat Plaka, a former deputy foreign minister, was given a one-year suspended sentence because of bad health, Robert Gjimi, a former deputy food minister, was jailed for three years and humanitarian aid expert Hasan Hallkja for one year. Nexhmije Hoxha, the widow of Albania's post-war communist leader, was jailed for 11 years late last year. A warrant for the arrest of Alben Alia, the son of the former communist leader, has also been issued.
