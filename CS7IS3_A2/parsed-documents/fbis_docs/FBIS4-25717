Lateral exchanges at different levels and in all domains have helped Tibet usher in a market economy. According to incomplete statistics, from 1985 to 1993, Tibet and inland provinces and regions reached agreement on over 600 economic and technical cooperation projects, which involved 700 million yuan in cooperation funds, the transfer of nearly 2,000 skilled personnel to Tibet, and the import of materials worth over 500 million yuan. With annual profits of 70 million yuan, these projects have produced rather good economic returns. [passage omitted] Tibet has imported equipment, technology, and management know-how to upgrade existing enterprises. From 1985 to 1993, the autonomous regional economic cooperation office approved over 100 technical cooperation projects, of which over 50 have been implemented. This has helped upgrade the level of Tibet's manufactured goods. Thanks to the barter of materials in connection with economic cooperation, steel products, automobiles, color televisions, cigarettes, brown sugar, tea, and butter have been brought into Tibet. This has improved market supply and made life easier for the people. Credit funds have been utilized to expand cooperation. With the approval of the People's Bank's head office, in 1988 Tibet set up special credits totaling 200 million yuan for lateral cooperation. Close to 100 funding-cooperation projects involving over 500 million yuan in cooperation funds were implemented from 1988 to 1991, yielding an annual profit of 80 million yuan, of which 10 million yuan went to the enterprises. Since the first forum of the CPC Central Committee on work in Tibet in 1980, state ministries and commissions and over 20 provinces and regions have offered assistance to Tibet in terms of know-how, finance, and materials. While jointly developing resources, they have passed on technology, provided technical training, and helped Tibetan enterprises raise management levels. Following the second forum on work in Tibet, nine provinces and municipalities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong helped Tibet build another 43 projects.
