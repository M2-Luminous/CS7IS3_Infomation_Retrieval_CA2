[passage omitted] The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and components as those used in Egypt, he added. Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who join these organizations explains why particular individuals carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these terrorist groups.
