The special envoys would also discuss problems related to implementation of the basic inter-Korean accords reached in December 1992, government sources said Monday. The government plans to tell North Korea when working-level officials of the two sides meet at the truce village of Panmunjom on Tuesday that Seoul could show flexibility by sending a special envoy to Pyongyang first, around March 15, they said. These decisions were made at a meeting Sunday morning of government leaders concerned with unification, who agreed to send an official letter in the name of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang Song-san. Seoul's decisions would help break the impasse between the two Koreas since a series of three working-level contacts last October, they said. In the previous contacts, Seoul proposed discussion of the nuclear question and implementation of the basic inter-Korean accords. But the North Korean side insisted on discussing Kim Il- song's "10-point" proposals for unification and an inter-Korean summit meeting. With regard to the special envoy exchange, South Korea maintained that since it was initially proposed by the North, Pyongyang should be the first to send its envoy to Seoul while the North asked the South to send its envoy first to Pyongyang. "Taking the date for a third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea into consideration, the (Seoul) Government position is that an exchange of inter-Korean special envoys will have to be realized around March 15," one government official said. At Tuesday's meeting, problems with exchanging special envoys would be discussed, the official added. The official said there has been no change in the U.S.-South Korean position that the envoy exchange must take place before a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. As long as that basic position was maintained, the official hinted, other issues such as whose special envoy should visit first could be flexible.
