Rate-setting approaches to expenditure control involve imposing a payment per unit of service. These rates could be used by all or some payers and could be applied to a range of services and providers. Rate setting would force institutions to gain control over the cost of producing individual services by improving production efficiency. If rates were imposed only for some services or provider types, or only by some payers, shifts among types of services and across settings would continue as a way to avoid cost-containment pressure. Hospitals may also respond to these efforts by focusing on providing those services that are relatively better paid. This could put some services or populations at risk. A system of global budgets or insurance premium caps could accelerate the movement of hospitals to gain control over the continuum of care. Global budgets are expenditure limits or targets that could be applied to types of providers or services. Premium caps are similar limits that would be enforced by insurers. Hospitals may respond by forming health care networks to control expenditures for an episode of care. Alternatively, hospitals may concentrate on providing a narrow range of services efficiently and marketing these to established networks or payers. Hospitals that fail to coordinate their services with those offered by other providers would be the most vulnerable under this scenario. Unless quality of care is carefully considered, however, needed services could be eliminated in order to stay within the limits. Under any type of reform, less stringent cost-control efforts would not be as disruptive to health care delivery patterns. Besides having a greater impact on spending growth, intense expenditure control efforts would likely alter institutional arrangements and service delivery patterns. The sources of pressure to control expenditures may also affect the outcome of reform initiatives, as demonstrated by the responses to the implementation of PPS. Cost shifting from less generous payers (including most public ones) to more generous (largely private) payers has had two major results. First, the gains from private-pay patients have enabled the hospital sector to alleviate the pressure to control costs that public programs have attempted to create. Second, the ability to cost shift has, for many patients, maintained access to services they overwise might not have received.
