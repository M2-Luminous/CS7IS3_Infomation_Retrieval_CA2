That's an increase of 7.8 percent once inflation is taken into account, said officials from the Beijing Statistical Bureau. The rise was a further indication of the benefits brought by the reforms of the last decade. And this was illustrated more strongly by the fact that every 100 urban families in Beijing owned 107.2 colour TV sets last year, 5.7 percent more than 1992. They also owned 45.6 video recorders and 82.4 cameras, 9.4 and 6.7 percent more than the previous year. The living standards of the local farmers also improved. There were roughly 50 television and 50 refrigerators and 76 washing machines for every 100 rural households. They were all higher than the relative figures of 1992. However, the income gap between the city and the rural suburbs also grew to 1080 yuan ($124) from 744 yuan ($86) in 1992. And more than 300,000 people, 6.2 percent of the city's people, were living below the poverty line which was set at 161 yuan ($18.5) month. Most of the people on low pay were from loss-making enterprises and so were unable to receive their full pay but many others had been laid off as companies restructured. Various municipal departments were taking measures to help the poor people. For instance, Beijing Trade Union was offering them handouts and some enterprises were encouraging laid-off workers to go into service industries. Beijing Labour Bureau is working out a minimum wage to protect workers' rights. And all the the low earners and redundant workers get welfare payments. Most welfare payments are below 100 yuan ($11). But they are to be raised after the minimum wage is worked out later this year, said Beijing Labour Bureau.
