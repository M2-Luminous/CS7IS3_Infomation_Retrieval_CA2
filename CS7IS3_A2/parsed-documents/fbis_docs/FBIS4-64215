This was confirmed by a Defense Ministry spokesman on Friday [29 April]. The transport helicopter, which takes inspectors and other UN personnel to operation sites, was to pick up two Austrian blue helmets in Mossul and evacuate them to Kuwait. On the landing field next to Mossul hospital, some 20 UN blue helmets securing the area were overrun by an angry crowd. The crew and the two Austrians saved themselves with a speedy takeoff, but they had to touch down in Baghdad, where three windows were found to be cracked and one of the two engines and the rotor blades damaged. As there was no imminent danger, the matter was treated as a technical accident at the time and thus the incident was not reported to the public, the spokesman said. He pointed out that every UN flight is agreed upon by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
