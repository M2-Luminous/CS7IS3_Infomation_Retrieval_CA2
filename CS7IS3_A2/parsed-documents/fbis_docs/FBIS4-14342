The three sides discussed the resumption of the Middle East peace talks and the implementation of the Gaza-Ariha Accord. According to most observers, before being effective in overcoming the present differences, the meeting has merely been a show for indicating the three sides' interest in reaching an agreement. The analysts say that the main goal being pursued by Mr. Christopher during his Middle East tour, which began on Wednesday, is nothing except persuading the Arabs to resume compromise talks with Israel. Despite this, in view of the outcome of Christopher's Wednesday meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with the foreign ministers of the southern Persian Gulf countries, some political observers say that, as before, the U.S. secretary of state, during his meetings with the foreign ministers of the regional countries, besides increasing the interregional countries' differences, is persuading the Arab countries of the Middle East to lift economic sanctions against Israel. The United States has been basically pursuing the same very goal for the past year, which is also part of its strategy that, on the one hand, the pro-U.S. Arab countries are brought closer to Israel and, on the other, on various pretexts, any country opposing the U.S. imperialist policies in the Middle East is projected as a new enemy of the Arabs instead of Israel and their old enemy, that is Israel itself, is projected as the apparent friend of the Arabs. However, during his Middle East tour, Mr. Christopher while continuing his strategy, is seeking to remove the factors that have halted the compromise talks. But it is already evident that he will have no success in this goal because Arab states have now discerned that the Zionist regime is trying to get maximum concessions while giving minimum concessions in return. Therefore any plan being pursued by the Americans eventually falls within this framework. This matter has already been established over the past three years when the compromise talks opened in Madrid. Some Arab allies of America in the region, without paying any attention to the events taking place behind the scene, are adopting their political stance as agents of Washington and Tel Aviv solely for the sake of holding on to their rule for some more time. This has prevented the Arab states to form a united front in the face of the Zionist regime. It is even more painful to note that these Arab states are distancing themselves further from their own Muslim masses. Under such conditions, Washington and Tel Aviv, without any concern about the future, are trying to gain maximum concessions from the governments which are a party to negotiations with the Zionist regime by exploiting the differences among them and through creating a rift among the Arab and non-Arab Islamic states.
