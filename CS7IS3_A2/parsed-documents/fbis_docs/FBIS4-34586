FBIS4-34586 "drlat120_l_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-120 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Bolivia $21 Million Budgeted for Coca Eradication $21 Million Budgeted for Coca Eradication PY2206010494 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p A1 PY2206010494 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS Spanish BFN [Text] La Paz, 12 Jun (ANF) -- Minister of Government German Quiroga has stated that the administration has $21 million to replace with other crops the coca plantations on 35,200 hectares in the subtropical region of Cochabamba Department. He explained that this investment is included in this year's budget, and will be implemented provided the peasant leaders allow it and do not oppose the voluntary eradication of coca. Quiroga admitted that peasant union leaders are one of the main obstacles for the Alternative Development Program, as they are urging union members to oppose voluntary eradication in order to obtain more benefits. Government sources have explained that through alternative development the Chapare -- Bolivia's top coca-producing region, and the world's second largest -- will benefit from agricultural development that will eventually replace the drug-driven underground economy. According to the sources, the products that will replace coca will be: bananas, pineapple, heart of palm, fodder, crafts, and other profitable items. According to information obtained from the "First Itinerant Show: Bolivia Free from Drugs," at the end of November 1993 the country had 47,200 hectares of coca plantations, that is, 35,200 hectares in excess of the 11,725 hectares needed to supply traditional uses. At that time the nation's overall production of coca leaves from these 47,200 hectares was 82,800 tons, of which 71,075 tons went to drug traffickers. These figures will decline once the voluntary eradication program is under way. The U.S. Government has offered to contribute $20 million to the program if Bolivia complies with the eradication target of 5,000 hectares.
