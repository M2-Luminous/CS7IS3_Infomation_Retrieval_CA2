The Angi-III, 21 metres in length, with a take-off weight of 19 tonnes, is a substantially modified version of Agni-I, featuring a new stage separation system as well as an advanced design manoeuvering-type warhead. The Agni project was sanctioned in July 1983 at a cost of Rs 35 crores for testing three launch vehicles. Now that the series has ended, the government must decide what to do. Does it accept the Western diktat and abandon efforts to deploy long-range missiles? Or does it continue ``testing'' and ``technology demonstration'' of some more different kinds of missiles ad infinitum? The other logical option is to instruct the DRDO and sanction funds to fabricate prototypes of missiles that will be deployed in a specific time frame. Given the existing deployments in China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, India will not be pre-empting anyone, only reacting, somewhat belatedly, to existing capabilities in our region. The first of the Agni series were launched after six years of efforts by 5,000 engineers and staff. The 600 sec. duration of the flight tested a re-entry vehicle structure as well as a control and guidance package. In addition a multi-node, automatic checkout system was also proved. The test was successful in fulfilling the requirements in all the parameters. The second test took place on 29 May 1992, but proved to be a failure when two seconds after launch Agni-II began to veer off-course and came apart, plunging into the sea hundreds of miles away from the planned point of descent near the Car Nicobar islands. The reason for the failure was beguilingly simple. Agni-II was modified by extending its length to 21m from the 19m. length of Agni-I. Its weight was increased from 14 to 16 tonnes. This change altered the vehicle's vibration characteristics which are measured by sensors and which report to an on-board computer which orders the various instruments to correct the trajectory. Amazingly the scientists failed to adjust the sensors following the modification of the weight and length of the vehicle. Last year, upon a Russian consultant's advice the problem was resolved in one day. The first attempt to launch Agni-III was made earlier this year and it failed when the launch had to be aborted seconds before ignition. Agni-III, which looks like Agni-II, has been sent up to test a new re-entry vehicle (warhead container). This RV has fins which allow it to manoeuver and hence attain greater accuracy. Another aspect that the test is designed to prove a more advanced stage separation process. Agni-I used ullage motors which powered the vehicle for the fraction of a second when stage one burnt out and stage two ignited. In the case of Agni-III, there is a split-second period in which stage two ignites even before stage one has burnt out. This is a complex business but it must be mastered to make any modern missile. What happens now? The record of tests is not a happy one. Technically four tests have taken place (including the aborted one earlier in the year) in a span of five years of which two have been failures. Notwithstanding the current success, Agni is a technology test-bed too fragile and complex for becoming a rugged transportable weapons system. The question that comes to mind is: Has the DRDO been too ambitious with the Agni project? The level of innovation between Agni-I and Agni-II was quite substantial. But there is the basic question of the vehicle itself which has an SLV-3 first stage and a modified Prithvi as the second. This is all right as a test-bed but with two different propellents it would be too cumbersome a missile. The DRDO could have gone for a single-stage liquid propelled missile, something not very modern and fashionable, but useful with its existing technology. Building a solid-propelled multi-stage missile means going to the ISRO for technology and that is not the easiest of processes given the jealousy with which that organisation guards its technology. These and other issues need to be looked at in the coming months. A programme which has been delayed some four years already requires urgent attention now.
