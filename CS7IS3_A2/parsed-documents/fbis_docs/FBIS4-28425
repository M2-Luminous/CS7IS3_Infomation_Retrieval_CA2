Noting that it, part of the hostile policy for stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was perpetrated by the Japanese reactionaries in a premeditated way to destroy Chongnyon and check its patriotic activities, the analyst says: The search cannot be construed to have been done by the Kyoto prefectural police at its discretion or an accidental incident. It is a grave suppression for a sinister political purpose and a never-to-be-condoned illegal act. The Japanese authorities must admit their mistake in the unjustifiable search of the Kyoto organization of Chongnyon, apologize for it and immediately return what they confiscated. The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, clearly mindful that no matter how desperately they may try, they have nothing to get in their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.
