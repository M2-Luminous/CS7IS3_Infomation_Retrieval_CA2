After ousting Vladimir Meciar, Jozef Moravcik's team has set to work to settle, in a European spirit, the fate of 1 million Hungarians, Ukrainians, and gypsies who share Slovak citizenship with the 4.5 million Slovaks of the young Danube republic. "Relations between Slovakia and Hungary have recently relaxed," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to note yesterday. He sees in this the early "influence" of the Conference on Stability in Europe, which opens in Paris tomorrow for two days. The objectives of this "summit" seem fairly clear: Inspired by the Madrid Conference, which at the end of 1991 provided the impetus for the Middle East peace process, France decided to help the Central European countries to settle "their problems between neighbors." Organized around general and bilateral issues, the UNESCO Palace meeting is aimed at producing a "pact for stability" by 1995. Superfluous Initiatives According to Mr. Juppe, this conference is addressed exclusively at the countries which want to join the European Union [EU], although the 53 CSCE member states are also invited. Clearly, only the "new democracies," i.e., Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, to which little Slovenia was added at the last minute, will really be involved. "It is legitimate for the EU to establish not entry conditions, but rules of good conduct for them," Mr. Juppe said. "It is natural that they should put their house in order as we succeeded in doing with Saarland and Alsace," European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said at a news conference at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] yesterday. The reservations of the countries concerned are well known: Prague is surprised to have been placed in the same category as other more turbulent capitals, while the Czech-Slovak partition served as a model. In Central Europe people are questioning the need to increase the number of superfluous initiatives in the security sphere. Have the Czech Republic, Poland, or the Baltic countries not all applied to join NATO? Of course, the Balladur pact is a diplomatic first by the EU but, seen from East Europe, it looks very like a means of making the candidates wait patiently in the waiting room of the EU. The foreign minister answered its critics rather bluntly: First, "we are not the applicants," he said. Second, "if a country participates in the conference, it is not necessarily because it has problems (minority or border problems), but because it has concerns with regard to these issues." Europe will have to rely on mediators, Mr. Juppe pointed out. The "good students" of the pact will be able to play this role, in his view. So will the United States, which is still wondering what it will do in this new group. Russia has declared its support. Andrey Kozyrev, its foreign minister, confirmed to Alain Juppe during his visit to Moscow his country's explicit support for the conference. This gives a considerable boost to a rather heavily criticized initiative. The Russian attitude is not free of ulterior motives. Indeed, the Kremlin categorically refuses to allow NATO to be automatically expanded to the former USSR satellites. It continues to give preference to the broadest possible European circles. For want of anything better, the Central European countries and the former Soviet republics are obliged to cling to what they are being offered. Especially because the conference was officially stamped "European" at the Twelve's summit in December. Smallest Common Denominator "Poland's acceptance of the project, presented by France and Germany in Warsaw (last November), shows that after being accused of being overambitious or not ambitious enough, the Conference on Stability has found an equilibrium," Alain Juppe commented optimistically. In reality, the Balladur initiative has been based from the start on the smallest diplomatic common denominator. Discouraged by the fiasco of their policy in the former Yugoslavia, the Twelve, who have become Sixteen, deliberately excluded from the process the areas of greatest tension: the Caucasus, Bosnia, and now Crimea. There is another important question: How can the Sixteen aspire to play a mediating role when some of them are directly involved in border and minority conflicts? This is true of Greece with regard to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, and Cyprus. Nowhere in the plan is Turkey mentioned, although it has long been a candidate for EC membership. "Other bodies are dealing with these problems," Alain Juppe pointed out. At best, the problem of the Slovak-Hungarian Gabcikovo dam will be settled; and perhaps the fate of the Hungarian minority in Romanian Transylvania. But the conference is likely to be powerless to ensure respect for the agreements resulting from it. "It is not a military pact, but a political exercise" the French foreign minister said, stalling again. The exercise is likely to be reduced to an attempt to protect the European club in seclusion -- "our six-month old baby" as Alain Juppe proudly calls it.
