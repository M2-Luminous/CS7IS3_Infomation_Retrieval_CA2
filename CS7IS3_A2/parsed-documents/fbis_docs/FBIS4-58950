With success from God and with broad popular support in the governorates of Aden, Lahij, and Abyan and other governorates of the Republic, and also with the resolve of the sincere men of our valiant Armed Forces' heroes, great victories were achieved today. The forces of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, the 2d Armored Brigade, and the 8th Special Forces Brigade managed to accomplish their combat missions successfully. Today, the al-'Amaliqah forces destroyed the Madram Brigade and seized all its equipment. The Brigade's chiefs of staff surrendered, and its commander fled. A large number of officers and soldiers from the Madram Brigade and the 5th Armored Brigade joined the forces of the constitutional legitimacy. These brigades are still waging decisive heroic battles against the remnants of the secessionist forces of apostasy. Also today, the forces of the 56th Brigade managed with great success to storm the defensive fortifications of the forces of apostasy and secession. The vanguards of these forces arrived in the area of Dar Sa'd, close to the Shaykh 'Uthman neighborhood, one of the outskirts of the governorate of Aden. They also closed the way to the supplies heading for the camps of the misled ones who are dominated by the forces of apostasy and secession in the governorate of Lahij. Our valiant forces are now continuing to wage a heroic battle against the forces of the Salah-al-Din camp, which are being misled by the rebellious secessionist gang, in order to force them into surrendering and yielding to both the people's will and legitimacy. This force is currently in the throes of death before the courageous heroic blows dealt by the heroes of our Armed Forces who continue to chase the remaining dens of the elements of the rebellious secessionist gang. On the southern axis, our courageous Armed Forces, the forces of the constitutional legitimacy, managed to storm and capture the third fortified defense line of the forces of the al-Buzah Brigade, and continued their advance to other fortifications. Today, Monday, 250 personnel of the al-Buzah Brigade surrendered with their full weapons and equipment, and declared that they joined the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. Large quantities of weapons, equipment, and vehicles were seized, including eight tanks and a number of guns and armored vehicles. Our forces are currently chasing the fleeing remnants of the secessionist forces of apostasy in that area. Also in the governorate of Lahij, the heroes of the 2d Armored Brigade continued to advance steadily and accomplish their combat missions successfully in terms of combing the district of al-Dali' for the remnants of the forces of apostasy and rebellion. Large numbers from the 'Abbud Brigade in the district of al-Dali' joined the forces of unity and legitimacy. During the combing campaigns being carried out along the collapsing positions of the forces of apostasy and secession, our forces found huge quantities of Marxist and Leninist books, through which the YSP was trying to obliterate the national identity and to distort the thought of the sons of our Yemeni people, and to psychologically and ideologically indoctrinate the fighters of the military units that used to be under its control. The heroic al-Wahdah infantry, artillery, and armored brigades, today continued to wage battles of bravery and honor in defense of unity and legitimacy. In another development, our valiant Armed Forces' Air Force today, continued its successful air attacks, during which it has successfully bombarded the set targets. Our aircraft returned safely to base. The antiaircraft defenses today downed an aircraft belonging to the secessionist gang near the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan Governorate. The source hailed the splendid and heroic performance of the personnel of our valiant Armed Forces and their great triumph for the will of the people and their option for unity, democracy, and the defense of their constitutional institutions. The source also lauded the high national morale, enthusiasm, and commitment to the national responsibility expressed by the masses of our Yemeni people against the secessionist gang, and their support for their sons in the valiant Armed Forces. It congratulated our people on the great victories over the secessionist gang, stressing that the victories that have been achieved over the gang of fragmentation, apostasy, and secession, are attributed to God's grace, and are the fruit of the steadfastness of the masses of our Yemeni people, their support for the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy, and their confrontation of the plans to dismember and destroy the homeland. The source said that the losses among the ranks of our valiant Armed Forces as a result of the fighting that has been raging against the forces of apostasy and secession since these forces ignited the fire of war last Wednesday and until now have reached 74 martyrs, and 314 wounded, in addition to 17 civilian martyrs as a result of the treacherous aggression of the forces of apostasy and secession. There was no immediate count available of the number of the martyrs and the wounded personnel of the Central Security, who were betrayed by the forces of apostasy and secession in Aden, who attacked their camp on the sad and bloody day of Wednesday. Up until the time this statement was being prepared, our valiant Armed Forces, have managed, on all axes of the fighting, to inflict heavy defeats on the forces of apostasy and secession, and to seize huge quantities of weapons, equipment, and serviceable vehicles. Large numbers of the troops who were misled by the rebelling secessionist gang have also joined the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, renewing their allegiance to the legitimacy, the constitutional institutions, and to the one Yemeni homeland, the homeland of freedom, justice, democracy, progress, and prosperity. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]
