Samples of blood from the sick animals are being tested for signs of a virus that is related to HIV, the cause of AIDS in humans. Experts on BIV (bovine immuno-deficiency virus) at the Institute for Animal Health in Berkshire were called in after a cattle herd from a farm in Cheshire developed breathing difficulties and other symptoms that resisted treatment. Joe Brownlie, head of the institute's BIV research team, confirmed that tests had been run to detect the virus or its antibodies. "We are actively investigating," he said. "There are no confirmed results as yet. At this stage, it is more of a look-see exercise." The Agriculture Ministry declined to disclose details of the disease on the farm or its exact whereabouts. Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, said the animals were being tested for other viruses as well as BIV. Scientists say they can see no threat from BIV to human health because lentiviruses (a group including BIV and HIV that is known to provoke slow-developing sickness in horses, goats, cats and sheep as well as humans) are highly specific to particular species. BIV was isolated in the United States in the early 1970's, though initially given a different name. It was only in the mid-1980's that scientists noticed the similarity between BIV and HIV.
