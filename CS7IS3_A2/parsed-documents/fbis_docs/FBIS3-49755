The UNHCR working meeting is taking place in Split. The letters sent by Izet Hadzic, Tuzla District governor, Prof. Dr. (Sean) Avdic, government official in charge of aid to the people of northeastern Bosnia, and Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic, specifically point to the possibility of a tragedy befalling the population in the Tuzla District. The top officials of the Tuzla District and Commune are asking the UNHCR whether 632,000 people, including 236,000 refugees and approximately the same number of social cases, can survive January with the 1,345 tonnes of food that is to be brought to the large free territory of Tuzla District in the form of humanitarian aid. Can one survive January with 3.26 kg of food including 2.5 kg of flour? And there is only one in three chances of that happening, people from Tuzla say. The UNHCR has recorded several cases of starvation in Tuzla District, as well as dozens of suicides as a consequence of mental derangement, exhaustion, poverty, and hunger. All this has prompted representatives of the 14 communes of the region of northeastern Bosnia to decide jointly to refuse the plan offered by the UNHCR, and to propose to the war presidencies of their respective communes that humanitarian aid be refused as of 18 January if the UNHCR fails to consider the possibility of increasing humanitarian aid to Tuzla District. At the same time, the peaceful protests, thus far, of refugees in front of the UNHCR (?agency) are more noticeable. According to district and communal authorities, the situation is being kept under control despite all the ordeals to which the population is exposed. In his letter, Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic also says that convoys are not arriving in Tuzla District this month; soup kitchens and refugee hostels have food for only five more days, hospitals and orphanages for only two more days. All of this signifies yet more political pressure on the Bosnian delegation on the eve the continuation of Geneva talks; we therefore demand that a decision on unrestrained movement of humanitarian convoys toward Tuzla be made, along with the establishment of UN entities that would guarantee the security of the convoys, state the Tuzla authorities.
