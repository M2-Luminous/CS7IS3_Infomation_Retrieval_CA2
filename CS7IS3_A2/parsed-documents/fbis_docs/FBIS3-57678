He took this step in connection with a referendum, scheduled for January 30, which should give an answer to the question: Can the president continue to discharge his duties or not? The reason for the referendum is that the Kyrgyz Constitution, adopted on May 5, made illegitimate all branches of power existing in the republic, which was used as a pretext by the forces opposing Akayev. As a politician, the president decided to resolve the problem with the help of a nationwide referendum. Akayev explained the essence of his policy in the appeal. He maintains that "now the majority of people in our republic and all political forces favour a market-based economy, economic freedom for the strong and social protection for the week." Despite a rather difficult economic situation in the republic and the continuing decline of living standards, the president believes that "solid economic preconditions have been created for the people to feel the first accomplishments, brought by our economic reform, in 1994, for us to start living just a little better." "If the Kyrgyz people support me at the popular referendum, I shall stick to the policy of reform, the policy which will ensure, in the long run, the well-being of our people and the prosperity of the republic," Akayev stressed in the appeal.
