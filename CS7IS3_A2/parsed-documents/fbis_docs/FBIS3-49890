At least to the United States, to which he promised everything, and has done a lot. His tax reforms, his agreement on free trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, his liberalization of abortion, his battle against unobstructed accumulation of private weapons, and his elaborate budget deficit cutdown have lead to the first real economic take-offs: In only 10 months, the private entrepreneurs have employed more people than in the past four years. His strength -- and not weakness -- is proven by the fact that, in the battle for new budgetary discipline, he won in Congress by only one vote that is needed to have the prescribed majority, while the unbiased experts have a lot of reason to claim that no president, since Lyndon Johnson left in 1969, has made the proverbially cautious American Congress so busy. However, the man who was, in the election battle, called "the great communicator", after Reagan, knows that both the U.S. and the international public judge him to be as a frightened compromiser, indecisive leader, and a very superficial expert. In an open interview for the famous ROLLING STONE Clinton himself admitted that he had turned from a favorite of the media into a subject of media ridicule. "I have done a lot," said he, "but, with all my attempts to change the American lifestyle, I have not received a single media award." The world thus survives in the shadow of the "Clinton paradox": an efficient president, but an unconvincing leader, a model of diligence, but almost provincially lonely. What is good for the United States is not good for the world, and it should be, at a time when it remains the only world superpower. The first reactions to the first Clinton "European speech" also fit into the above frame: The appearance was skillfully prepared, but there was nothing in it that will be remembered for very long. Regardless of the fact that Clinton also dared to bomb Iraq, seriously threatened North Korea, took a firm stand against the Japanese challenge, placed everything on the Yeltsin card, speeded up the Middle Eastern and South African peace talks, united the entire American continent, and bridged the Pacific again, Clinton's great European tour has been experienced only as a late routine. In Brussels he tried to save NATO by the inadequate formula `Partnership for Peace', in Prague he will try to restore trust in real U.S. support to the newly-established eastern democracies, in Moscow he will encourage Yeltsin -- and perhaps scorn him a little -- but this extensive itinerary does not promise key answers to three important questions: Who will the United States strategically protect and how, will it join the general efforts to curb the unimaginable Balkan war and how, how will it prevent the general decay of the most talked of Western principles with this sway of anachronic and anarchic nationalisms, and can it do that? Naturally: Under U.S. leadership, NATO will not run with their arms open to meet the new eastern European regimes that could, under the same strategic umbrella, get it into dangerous territorial or ethnic alignments. The remaining 14 members have already had enough of Greece and Turkey because of Cyprus, and what is again smoldering between Russia and Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, the Baltics and Moscow. This is why it should not be expected that the NATO summit will result in any specific decisions on the Balkan wars. It is generally claimed that air strike threats will be renewed, "because of the strangling of Sarajevo", but cynics claim that NATO will move only when the victim is dead. Karadzic has "ordered a unilateral ceasefire" in the battles for Sarajevo, in order to prevent this "indicative stutter". Zagreb has yet to digest the manifest admonition of Madeleine Albright, one of whose reasons for coming was obviously to calm down the overloquacious U.S. ambassador. Tudjman also knows that only in its most fantastic dreams could there be chances of "NATO applying force" if Izetbegovic does not agree to his most generous offers. At the moment it was still unknown whether the Bonn talks might change anything, the only reliable thing was the bitter message that Clinton is unequaled only at home.
