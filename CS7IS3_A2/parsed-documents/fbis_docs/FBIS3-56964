Commenting on the present balance of forces at the State Duma, TRUD newspaper notes that "the first voting results showed that three factions --the Russian Agrarian Party, the Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party (165 votes) -- cooperate at least in settling personnel issues." It is difficult to appraise the interests of the "New Regional Policy" group: they will emerge when political and economic issues are settled. In any case, reformist blocs (poorly united between themselves) which have only 133 votes, should be interested in cooperation with the above group and with the Women of Russia faction. Commenting on the regulations affecting the working and living conditions of State Duma members which were discussed by the Duma on Thursday, the same newspaper writes that "the debate on material maintenance of deputies graphically showed how strong the conviction is in our country that it is more convenient to care for people's interests, enjoying the salary of a federal minister and looking at the world through the window of a personal car." Referring to the calculations done by the experts from Russia's Choice group within the Duma, IZVESTIYA notes that in keeping with what the State Duma deputies are planning, the monthly upkeep of one people's deputy will cost the taxpayer 15 million rubles. The paper quotes the views of Russia's Choice on this issue: "If, despite everything, such a decision is finally taken, it must, in the current economic conditions, be regarded as irresponsible and not conducive to increasing the prestige of the highest body of legislative authority". IZVESTIYA also criticizes the personnel changes within the Russian government. "So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has made his choice: Soskovets, Zaveryukha, Chubays, and Yarov. He may, of course, be wrong," the paper writes. The paper says that the team of deputy prime ministers thus selected "bears witness, first and foremost, to the fact that the prime minister no longer wishes to listen to what the president has to say, laying claims to the role of not just an independent, but, possibly, a stronger political figure." Forecasting that the new government will to some extent distance itself from the previous reform course, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says that the main question is "the extent of this distancing and whether the government and its chairman are going to have enough will and common sense to halt this process before it passes the danger mark. There are serious grounds for alarm. For instance, Chernomyrdin's statement on the readiness to cooperate with the Duma has taken on an altogether new meaning after a majority of the lower chamber's committees dealing with the economy and economics turned out to be in the hands of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], all the more so if the Duma's intention to set aside a special hour once a week to examine the work of the government is taken into account." IZVESTIYA informs its readers that the Russian procurator- general's office is studying the possibility of instituting a criminal case against legislator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR. The newspaper writes that "the administration for the observance of laws on federal security and ethnic relations of the Russian procurator-general's office is completing its study of applications by citizens and mass organizations demanding that Zhirinovskiy be criminally prosecuted for war propaganda in his book `The Last Leap to the South' as well as in interviews and television statements." Newspapers report some particulars about a land-crash of an Antei military transport plane near the city of Tver (some 200 km northwest of Moscow) on 19 January. Noting that reasons for the crash were not fully investigated yet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and PRAVDA newspapers claim that there was no explosion aboard the plane. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection that "all three `black boxes' of the plane were found." Specialists affirm that the plane's control systems failed. Noting that today is the 70th commemoration day of Vladimir Lenin's death, PRAVDA carries an article entitled "What `Democrats' Are Like and How They Fight Leninism." The article criticizes the entire road covered by the Soviet Union and then by Russia, starting from the course for restructuring proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev and ending with the course for reforms pursued by the present Russian leadership.
