"It is premature to speak about an international conference on the nuclear programme of the Korean People's Democratic Republic [People's Democratic Republic of Korea]. Russia's initiative is yet in the state of examination," he told ITAR-TASS here on Tuesday [7 June]. The minister avoided further comments on this subject. He said that he would touch in greater detail on the problem during his rounding off press conference, which is to be held here on Wednesday afternoon. In light of the crisis on the Korean peninsula, Russia has moved to call an international conference with the participation of the two Korean states, the U.S.A., Japan, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Dwelling on the state of Ukrainian-Korean relations, Kim Yong-nam noted during his talk with First Vice-Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament Aleksandr Tkachenko that "the KPDR [DPRK] leadership was a dependable partner of Ukraine on the international arena. The Korean People's Democratic Republic wholly backs Ukraine's efforts to build up an independent and democratic state. It is sure that Ukraine will assume a worthy place in the world community." The North Korean foreign minister positively assessed the decision of the Ukrainian state to become a nuclear-free power. The minister highly praised Ukraine's foreign policy, because it "comes out for the solution of all the existing problems through negotiations and on the basis of international norms." He thanked the Ukrainian side for its "support to the plan to reunify North and South Korea by peaceful means." Tkachenko described the visit of the Korean delegation as "a continuation of the efforts to strengthen friendship between the two countries and to consolidate the legal foundation for further mutually advantageous cooperation between the two countries." Thanking the minister for the invitation to visit North Korea, he said that "the date of the trip would be decided shortly." Different aspects of cooperation between Ukraine and the Korean People's Democratic Republic were also discussed during Kim Yong- sam's meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. The latter noted that Ukraine was making important steps towards the implementation of its nuclear-free status. He said the internal situation in the country was stable.
