FBIS4-17930 "drsov083_v_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Lithuania Controversy Flares Over Treaty With Poland Controversy Flares Over Treaty With Poland WS2804145494 Tallinn BNS in English 1303 GMT 28 Apr 94 WS2804145494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 28, BNS - The Lithuanian-Polish agreement on friendship and cooperation that was signed in Vilnius April 26 caused controversial reaction among Lithuanian politicians, although they all agree that the signing is a positive step toward expanding relations between the two countries. The parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday [27 April] postponed discussion of the treaty. The committee's chairman, Kazys Bobelis, told reporters that committee members decided to get acquainted with agreement's text in Polish. Arvydas Bajoras, a member of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, said he sees no negative aspects in the accord. MP [member of parliament] Algirdas Kuncinas, vice chairman of the ruling LDLP faction in the parliament, said the agreement lacks a number of things, and shortcomings will come to light in the future. Social democrat Nikolai Medvedev told the RESPUBLIKA newspaper that he is fully satisfied with the treaty because it guarantees Lithuania's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. Conservative Gediminas Vagnorius said he misses an evaluation of recent history (1920 occupation of Vilnius), which would eliminate possibilities for speculations. Centrist Romualdas Ozolas, who sharply criticized the treaty while it was still in preparation, said the agreement means "a strategic defeat and a tactical victory." In his view, the parliament should adopt a statement on certain aspects that were left out along with the agreement's ratification. Saulius Peceliunas, leader of the Democratic Party, said he will vote for the treaty's ratification if the parliament adopts a statement saying that a different interpretation of history is not a pretext for Polish social organizations to claim the property that they owned in the occupied Vilnius and its region.
