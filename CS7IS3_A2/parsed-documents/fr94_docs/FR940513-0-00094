FR940513-0-00094 FR940513-0-00024 Only printed matter as defined in 241 and small packets as defined in 260 that meet all applicable mailing standards may be sent in this service. There is a minimum volume requirement of 50 pounds per shipment except for the direct shipment option, which requires a minimum of 750 pounds to a single country destination. Mailers may present sacks of pound-rate and piece-rate mail to meet minimum quantity requirements. Small packets may not be enclosed in M-Bags and do not qualify for the full service or gateway/direct shipment M-Bag rates. 246.3␣General 246.31␣Availability. ISAL service is available to the foreign countries listed in Exhibit 246.71, through designated U.S. acceptance cities. 246.32␣Designated Acceptance Cities. Exhibit 246.32 shows cities designated to accept ISAL. 246.4␣Special Services Special services provided for in Chapter 3 are not available for items sent by ISAL. 246.5␣Customs Documentation See 244.6 and 264.5 for the requirements for customs forms. 246.6␣Permit or Customer Identification Number Each mailer must have a 10-digit ISAL permit number or customer identification number. The first five digits are the ZIP Code of the post office where the permit or customer identification number is issued. The second five digits are separated from the first five by a hyphen and are either the customer's permit imprint number or a sequential number issued by the post office of account. If the permit imprint number has fewer than five digits, precede the permit number with enough zeros to make a five-digit number. For example, a mailer with a permit imprint number of 29 whose business location is in New York City (10010) is assigned an ISAL permit number of 10010&hyph;00029. This number must be used on Form 3650, Statement of Mailing-International Surface Air Lift. 246.7␣Postage 246.71␣Rates 246.711␣Items Weighing Over 2 Ounces.
