An interesting passage regarding the composition of [Jan] Luptak's Association of Workers of Slovakia [ZRS] was left in Julius Gembicky's notebook. It would be a pity not to print it. [Gembicky] What are the reactions to the growing distance between two related entities, the SDL and the ZRS, particularly in central Slovakia, which is the ZRS's stronghold? [Weiss] Everyone knows that the SDL has not given a final no to cooperation with the ZRS within the framework of a coalition, even though it was the SDL Executive Committee that had actually founded this party. We wanted it to be a professional civic organization that would analyze workers' problems and communicate them to parliament. ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak seems to have different ideas, however. What is the ZRS, actually, and what does it represent? According to a representative sociological survey of March 1994, as many as 30 percent of ZRS supporters had previously been Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] supporters; 12 percent had been SDL supporters; 6 percent had been Social Democratic Party in Slovakia supporters; 8 percent had previously supported the Slovak National Party, the Christian Democratic Movement, and the Hungarian parties; and 4 percent had been supporters of the Democratic Party. In other words, the ZRS is a manifestation of workers' discontent with all parties, and it is not just a problem for the SDL, as has sometimes being argued. After all, only 25 percent of ZRS members subscribe to left-wing values. We have never underestimated the importance of the workers movement, but we have always refused to follow the path of outdoing one another in unrealistic promises. Faced with glances full of expectations, whether it was in Spisska Nova Ves or at a meeting with female textile workers of the Lykotex Revuca company, we never yielded to the politician's temptation to proclaim in loud voice: We are going to resolve everything, we will guarantee your jobs. We want to do it, but not by means of cheap promises. But our offer of postelection cooperation with the ZRS is still on the table.
