The meeting was chaired by Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and Minister of the FAR. The meeting concluded with a solemn and moving ceremony to promote Enrique Carreras Rolas, a hero of the Republic of Cuba, to the rank of division general. The military council made the final assessment of all the activities of the FAR during 1993, which had already been previously analyzed in the last days of the mentioned year. The review demonstrated the gigantic and fruitful effort in the three armies with all the types of weapons that defend the national territory, which shows a strengthening of the combat capacity and readiness to successfully wage the people's war in case of enemy aggression. Significant progress was achieved in the combat readiness of the personnel, which in Cuba includes millions of men and women of the FAR and the reserves of the Territorial Troops Militia [MTT] and the production and defense brigades. Last year's maintenance and conservation of equipment and arms and preparation of the theater of military operations demanded arduous and intense labor that included several million weapons and war equipment and the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of men and women in the country to build the people's defense tunnels and other fortifications. These heroic deeds performed in 1993 are a continuation of the heroic deeds achieved in the two previous years. The results of the three years as a whole have elevated the vitality of the combat arms and equipment, and the protection of these by the combatants and the civil population in the face of eventual enemy aggression. All this was achieved in midst of the shortages of the special period. Another important point on the agenda was the FAR's activities in the agricultural-livestock areas, which are aimed at achieving self-sufficiency among the troops. As in the past year, the food production goals for 1994 represent a 30 percent increase, which would get the FAR closer to its goal of becoming completely self sufficient. Great emphasis was placed on all military agricultural-livestock enterprises working towards reducing costs and increasing productivity and yields, which is the only way to achieve affordability and profitability. It was mentioned that the Youth Labor Army [EJT] cares for 15,000 caballerias of land throughout the country and that they produce 632,000 tons of food annually for the national economy. The reduction of the military budget by 50 percent was another encouraging observation that the council session made. This contributes to reducing the deficit of the state budget. The elevated conduct of discipline and the moral and political state of the troops were described as satisfactory. The council was happy to verify that the work of the FAR's restructuring to adapt itself to the current conditions of the national economy was done as planned, while achieving the goal of maintaining the defensive power of the country and perfecting the FAR's efficiency and combat disposition, deepening even more the doctrinal and tactical concepts of the people's war. The homage to General Carreras, on the occasion of his 50th anniversary as a combat pilot, highlighted his clean record, his stand against the Nazi-fascist movement, Batista's dictatorship, and U.S. imperialism, and his elevated patriotism, and revolutionary spirit. These feelings successively made him a combat pilot during World War II and the struggle against the fascist aggressors. He joined the national army when its role was defined by the Constitution of 1940 as body for the defense of national sovereignty. He joined the conspiracy that emerged from the heart of that army, as a rejection to Batista's military coup and was jailed by the tyranny for refusing to bomb the insurgent population of Cienfuegos. In the unequal air combat against the mercenary aggression at the Bay of Pigs, Carreras had the opportunity he had hoped for since his youth: defend national independence in the most audacious and risky situation in the skies of the fatherland. He shot down two B-26 airplanes and made serious attacks on the enemy naval group. His heroism in those battles and his extensive record of service to the Revolution made him worthy of the title: hero of the Republic of Cuba. Carreras, who is 71 years old, continues to be an active member of the FAR. He is one of those generals that die with their boots on. Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first substitute to the Minister of the FAR and head of the General Staff, concluded the ceremony with these words: [Begin Rosales recording] I am sure that I speak for the Minister of the FAR and all those present when I say that together with the fearlessness and courage, honesty and firmness of principles, General Carreras has the virtue of modesty and trustworthiness of which he has become a true model and which has never been tarnished by the deserved promotions and recognitions, including the honorary title of Hero of the Republic of Cuba. For that reason, I would like to conclude my speech by expressing to Division General Enrique Carreras Solas that our party, the people, and their FAR are proud to have you among its generals. We, the officers of the FAR, are honored to be able to be your comrade in arms, and disciples of your personal example. Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording] Present at the ceremony were Retired Division General (Hector Rios Eregnu). (Rios), who is a retired officer of the sister Republic of Argentina, is in Cuba with his family on a private visit and was invited by the Minister of the FAR to attend the ceremony.
