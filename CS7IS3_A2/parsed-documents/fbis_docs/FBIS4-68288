This is understandable, for a soldier must be provided with shoes and clothing and given a full meal three times a day and tanks and aircraft will not move without fuel.... And it is not surprising that the lion's share of letters to the editor's office involve questions of rear services and the everyday needs of service personnel. After grouping the most important of them, we asked Col. Gen. Vladimir Churanov to respond to them. [Altunin] Vladimir Timofeyevich, about a year ago the newspapers were writing about some changes in the rear services of the armed forces. What has been done? [Churanov] Reforms are under way in accordance with the plan and stages of the development of the armed forces. But I want to emphasize that reforms in the rear are not a goal in themselves and especially are not aimed at demolishing the things of value that have been created--I am not afraid to say it--from the days to Peter to our own time. In the course of the year experiment in converting to a territorial system in support of the troops that is being carried out in the Moscow Military District, we were once again convinced of its prospects. Consideration of the special features of the stationing of troops and the economic possibilities of the region make it possible to optimize administrative-economic, transportation, information, and other ties. And accordingly, under the conditions of the decentralization of the supply process on the scale of the country, we will be able, in the first place, not "to lose" stability and autonomy in the support of the troops and, secondly, to organize and strengthen interaction with local authorities and, the main thing, with suppliers. In any case, we will be able to buy perishable food products and seasonable produce at relatively low prices, which is especially important at this time. As in any innovation, there are difficulties here. I would say that there is still much that needs to be smoothed out and made more logical. For this reason, we are expanding the base of the experiment and planning to carry it out in other regions of Russia this year. Recently, as a member of a commission under the leadership of the minister of defense, I had the occasion to work in Kaliningrad Special Defense Area. Under the conditions of its remoteness, precisely the territorial principle was made the basis of the material support of the troops and forces of the navy. Still another problem that one must pay attention to is the financing of the needs of the rear. In 1993, only 56 percent of these needs were met. Of course in the end they got by but at what a price! The reduction of the consumption of fuel and the extension of the time for the wearing of items of clothing went, as they say, to the extreme limits allowed. The only thing that they did not cut back was the food for the soldiers. One cannot save on this. In closely analyzing the existing system for the financing of the needs of the rear from the center to the military unit, we come to the conclusion that it must be changed. After all, we have such rigid expenditure items--food, clothing, material supplies, and fuel--essentially not subject to adjustment that the money for these needs ought not to be in some common pot somewhere but rather must come to us in special allocations. We do not yet have this. [Altunin] Our mail includes many letters from aviators. Planned flights were continually being disrupted because of a shortage of kerosene and various lubricating oils. What will happen this year? [Churanov] I have already touched on this question. It may be that they feel the shortage of fuel more acutely in aviation than elsewhere but unfortunately the picture is similar in other branches of the armed forces as well--in the navy, for example. Again, we are seeing the effects of our direct dependence upon the situation in the country's fuel and energy system. Judging by everything, this situation will not change this year either. What should be done here? There is just one answer, save wherever we can. We are also seeking other ways. We will soon begin to produce some kinds of oils and lubricants independently using our own capacities. A scientific research institute of the Ministry of Defense and industry are carrying out work to select critical oils. [Altunin] "In the enlisted mess, they often serve canned products instead of fresh meat and there is a shortage of other items. What is the explanation for this?" write our readers, soldiers in compulsory service in the Siberian Military District. [Churanov] That is a very important question and I would say that it is fundamental for us. After all, the food for the personnel largely determines not only the physical but also the psychological state of the soldiers. The main task here remains the same: The soldier's table must have a full complement of products corresponding to the established norms. What is the reason for this situation? Unfortunately, it lies in the country's reduced food potential. Last year the cost of the daily ration for the military as a whole increased from 140 to 1,200 rubles [R] and, as I have already said, the financing is limited. In the first three months of the year, we received less than half of the money needed for the purchase of food. We are borrowing with incredible assurances. We must recognize that our past reserves are still helping us out. We eat them and then we replenish them. The high duties recently introduced on the importation of foodstuffs have practically not affected us so far (imports are insignificant for us) but if they go into effect and extend to the countries of the near abroad, then we will doubtless feel their pressure, especially in the procurement period. The overwhelming majority of specialists in the food service are persistently assimilating market mechanisms and are striving to buy products more cheaply and to expand and diversify the assortment of dishes being prepared. Much is being done in this direction in the garrisons of Moscow, Siberian, Leningrad, and other military districts, where the preparation of two second dishes has already become the norm at enlisted mess halls. But it is not so everywhere. Checks are revealing cases of pilferage of products from warehouses and instances where the norm does not reach the individual soldier as it should. Decisive measures are being taken in such cases, even to the point of prosecuting those who are guilty. [Altunin] And this is from a letter by reserve officers who formerly worked in the rear services: "We see on television that agricultural equipment has broken down at many farms and is not prepared for the sowing season. What is happening at our military sovkhozes?" [Churanov] There can be only one answer to this question: Under difficult economic conditions, military sovkhozes and the subsidiary plots of military units act to some extent as the guarantor of stable production of agricultural output for the needs of the army and navy. Overall, things are getting better for them. As of 1 March, 70 percent of the tractors had been repaired for the spring sowing, most other farm equipment had been made ready for the sowing campaign, and the necessary quantity of seed material had been procured.... [Altunin] "New uniform. We in our unit see it primarily on television and in the newspapers. When will it be issued to us?" asks Warrant Officer [praporshchik] S. Gusev (Ural Military District). [Churanov] In accordance with the previously affirmed plan, the full conversion of the service personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to the new uniform is taking place in stages and is supposed to be concluded by the end of 1995. But those same disruptions in the financing of the rear services may also put into doubt the reality of this deadline. Thus, only a little more than half of the money needed for procurement of the new military clothing was allocated in 1993. Enterprises of light industry that have traditionally worked for us are in a critical situation. Because of our nonpayment, their inventories are piling up, they stand idle, they are failing to pay wages to workers, and some of them are closing. Of course, the clothing service is not idle and all possible measures are being taken to correct the situation. In our reciprocal accounts, we are forced to select the most necessary items: striped undershirts, camouflage, new model shoes, and the like, without which the service simply cannot function today, and to "borrow" sheets and pillowcases, for example, from our warehouses. First of all, as provided for by order of the minister of defense, we are now supplying service personnel in the Moscow and St. Petersburg garrisons, graduates of military schools and academies, soldiers at garrisons where staffs of military districts and fleets are located, and other military units taking into account the peculiarities and specific nature of their military service. [Altunin] "It was reported in the newspapers that in military trade, as a check revealed, there are many serious shortcomings of various kinds. What specifically is happening there? What measures are being taken?" This is the question of Captain S. Bogachev from St. Petersburg. [Churanov] Yes, recently there have indeed been less than flattering articles in the press about the work of military trade but from them one cannot draw the conclusion that there is nothing but crime there. After all, military trade is not just stores and warehouses. Its system includes more than 18,000 enterprises of various kinds located throughout the territory of Russia and beyond its borders and, finally, about 100,000 employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are working conscientiously despite the difficulties that are worsening every day--a shortage of working capital and rising prices. And as a result, the commodity turnover last year amounted to more than R600 billion, seven times what it was the previous year. Military trade contributed about R25 billion to the state budget. Overall, the agencies of military trade and its system are continuing to improve. The organizational staff structure is changing, parallel links and superfluous administrative agencies are being eliminated, wholesale-retail associations are being established, and domestic trade enterprises are being included in the territorial system of rear services. A new normative-legal base is being developed, with the adoption of which, in particular the "Statute on Military Trade," it will be possible to eliminate contraditions with existing legislation and to fulfill the corresponding statutes of the Law of the Russian Federation "On the Status of Service Personnel." I do not deny that the leadership of the rear services as well as local people have a lot of grievances against the work of military trade. And it is no secret that there are also people there with dirty hands and there is cheating and miscounting. Complaints about this are not ignored. The miscalculations made in 1991-92 continue to be eliminated, especially in external trade. Contracts made with insolvent firms by former managers of military trade at different levels are being canceled and the invested money is being returned to the account of the Main Trade Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. Criminal suits have been brought against liable persons who permitted unjustifiable trade deals.
