At the meeting the puppet traitor babbled that the nuclear issue of the North had reached an important point and gave an instruction to assume a complete military security posture against someone else's provocation Shortly before the presidential office meeting, U.S. President Clinton sent a personal letter to puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam through the U.S. ambassador. The letter reportedly noted that the United States reaffirmed its security commitment to South Korea and stated that it would strengthen the South Korea-U.S. joint defense posture. The puppets hastily convened a security-related ministers meeting and made a fuss as if they made a decision on an important issue. However, there is nothing new. They merely reiterated the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the early deployment of Patriot missiles in consultation with the United States, their master. The puppets' fuss at the presidential office is a reckless act to deliberately bring the situation to the phase of war after breaking up [kyollyol] the contact of working-level delegates for the exchange of top-level special envoys between the North and South. The puppets themselves broke up the contact of working-level delegates for the exchange of special envoys, hastily convened what is called a security-related ministers meeting as inspired by the United States, and made some decisions for confrontation with us. We cannot overlook the fact that these maneuvers by the puppets can destroy [pagoe] peace on the Korean peninsula and inflict a nuclear catastrophe on the nation. In consultation with the United States, the Kim Yong-sam ring declared they would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise against us, its fellow countrymen, and deploy Patriot missiles in a short time. This clearly shows the rascals [nomdul] are dirty national traitors who seek a way out in harming their fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. The puppets' act shows their antinational colors as those who break up North-South dialogue, harm their fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces, play a role in destroying the DPRK-U.S. talks [chomihoedamui pagoe chagyongul hago], and bring North-South relations to an unpredictable phase of confrontation. The reality again shows that if the Kim Yong-sam ring is left untouched, no dialogue or peace on the Korean peninsula can be achieved, but only confrontation and a catastrophe of nuclear war will result. As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war. We are not afraid [gomnalgussi opta] even if the South Korean puppets resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and deploy Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated [paetriotu misailbbunanira kuharaebirul] in a short time. We do not like empty talk. Our people and People's Army will severely punish the traitors who attempt to harm and stifle [mohae apsal] their fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces and will resolutely defend our socialist fatherland and the security of the nation. The Kim Yong-sam ring must know that its futile traitorous attempt to enter into confrontation with its fellow countrymen will bring its own destruction. The United States had better know that there is nothing to gain and nothing good for it even if it instigates and gives a shot in the arm [jumurugo ipkimul purononun] to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam, who is writhing because he was forsaken by the nation and became a target for overthrow.
