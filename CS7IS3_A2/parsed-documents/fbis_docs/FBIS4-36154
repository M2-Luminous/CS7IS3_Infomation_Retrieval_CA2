Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani told the press that Aden aircraft were bombarding all around since 6 AM this morning. Mr. al-Iryani declined to say whether the reported bombardment meant the government would now consider the open-ended cease-fire invalidated. He also declined to comment on reports from Aden that gunfire was heard coming from outside the city as early as 3 AM. All he said was that when jets fly over troops, they will have to fire back. The cease-fire declared by the Yemeni Government in coping with last week's UN Security Council resolution on Yemen went into effect at midnight last night. In announcing the unilateral cease-fire last night, the Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah warned that tacit support for the separatists could reignite the fighting.
