Kyd said inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting the radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon, 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of Pyongyang, last month had observed that a second plutonium separation line was being constructed, similar to the first line which was subject to IAEA monitoring. The new line meant that the North Korean programme could evade effective monitoring, Kyd said. "This is of concern to us," he said. "It means North Korea is pursuing an active programme, while the United States and the IAEA were hoping that it would put its nuclear activities on hold." [passage omitted] Kyd said IAEA chief Hans Blix had verbally notified the IAEA governors of the discovery at a council meeting on March 21, and had also informed the UN Security Council. The Security Council and IAEA officials were hoping a new mission could be sent to North Korea at the beginning of May, Kyd said. However there were currently no contacts between Pyongyang and the IAEA. [passage omitted]
