The decision was simultaneously announced in the Canadian capital by Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and in Havana by Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, who today concludes a two-day visit to the island. While Stewart was meeting a full agenda of interviews with ranking Cuban Government officials, in Ottawa, Foreign Minister Ouellet announced the resumption of official economic aid to the Caribbean island. "The Cold War is over. The time has come to turn a new page" in relations with Cuba, Ouellet said in reference to the resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 when Cuba provided military aid to Angola in response to South Africa's aggression. Despite that decision, ties between the two states continued to develop, and they were expanded in 1989 when the two countries decided to undertake a political dialogue with an exchange of official visits. According to the announcement, Canada will grant Cuba $360,000 to feed the children this year and $720,000 in 1995. Last night, Stewart inaugurated an international businessmen's conference on business opportunities in Cuba. The conference, which was sponsored by the magazine THE ECONOMIST, was attended by more than 120 executives from Canadian, British, U.S., European, and Latin American firms. Earlier, Stewart had discussed the development of bilateral relations, particularly economic relations, with Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage and other ranking officials, including Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for Finance. A source from the Canadian delegation also confirmed to PRENSA LATINA that the minister of state also held a special meeting with President Fidel Castro. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Eduardo del Rey, spokesman for the Canadian Foreign Ministry and a member of Stewart's entourage, stressed: "This is an important moment in the relationship between Cuba and Canada," which is based on "frequent and honest dialogue." Rey added that the goal of Stewart's visit is to broaden those ties and promote Canadian investments. At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also because Canada will benefit. Stewart expressed the Canadian authorities' resolve to encourage an even greater flow of capital to the island, where Canada currently carries considerable weight in foreign investments in the mining sector. Canada does not only exploit traditional nickel deposits, but it also has recently been involved in prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as exploring for oil deposits. Furthermore, Canada is the leading source of tourists to the island, where every year more than 120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations.
