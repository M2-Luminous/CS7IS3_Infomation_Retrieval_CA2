"Japan will be remembered as an irresponsible country in future (if it does not implement sanctions)," Saito told a lecture meeing attended by more than 100 defense experts and business people. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided March 21 to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the UN Security Council. Saito said Japan believes the Security Council will adopt a resolution next week calling on Pyongyang to accept full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA. Japan will implement sanctions in line with the UN resolution within the framework of the war-renouncing Constitution, Saito said, adding that it will amend legislation, if necessary. "It is the only way for Japan to take. Otherwise, Japan will not be able to dodge accusations that it is an irresponsible country," Saito said. He said Japan hopes North Korea will retract its refusal to allow the IAEA to carry out full inspections. He said China, a close ally of Pyongyang, wants the United States, South Korea and other countries concerned to resolve the issue through patient dialogue with North Korea. But Saito said "Japan does not think it is good to spend a long time."
