A spokesman for the Shanghai government said that nearly 400 returned students have signed up investment contracts or tentative agreements with the Shanghai Xinxin Investment Ltd, which oversees the park, located at Songjiang County near Shanghai. He said that returned students can enjoy preferential treatment on a range of aspects -- from paying tax to import of raw materials to use of land. The charge on use of land is less than half that of other development zones, he said. Currently, more returned students from Western Europe, Japan and the United States have expressed strong interest in investment here, he said.
