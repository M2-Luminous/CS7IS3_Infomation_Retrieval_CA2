After transfers to provinces and localities, and spending, the federal government was left with 139.9 billion schillings, which is 22.4 percent more than during the same quarter in 1993. This "record increase" in revenues is, however, deceptive: It only came about because the dates on which taxes are due were shifted from June to May and because deductible import turnover tax soared as a result of of rising imports. However, according to financial experts, now "prospects are better that we will get closer to the forecasts." Thus, this year tax losses will probably be lower than the feared 5 billion shillings. "It is at least true that we are not losing any more, but the improvement is weak," Wifo [Economic Research Institute] tax expert Gerhard Lehner says. Boom in Imports In the wake of tax reform, payroll tax revenues were rather weak with 52.5 billion schillings (minus 6.1 percent); on the other hand, value-added tax revenues increased by 13.4 percent, to 80.3 billion schillings. An Austrian buying spree is indicated by imports, which increased by 9.5 percent to 148.2 billion schillings during the first quarter. However, in view of the advance burdens associated with potential EU membership, in particular for agriculture, an "explosion" of the net deficit (80.7 billion schillings) can be prevented only if the federal government receives the planned billions in revenues from various sales (such as the federal share in Vienna airport, the Creditanstalt bank or Bank Austria). Unemployment remains high (6 percent of 4.5 percent according to the seasonally adjusted OECD model). The OECD is discussing this problem in Paris today. According to a Wifo study, the economy would have to grow by 2 percent to maintain the current number of jobs.
