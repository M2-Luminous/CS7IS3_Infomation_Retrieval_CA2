All the necessary prerequisites have been created in relations between the two states for ushering in a new stage of constructive partnership", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Chinese political scientists at the People's Diplomacy Institute of China here today. "Two 'continents' of modern civilisation -- Russia and China -- have firmly embarked upon the road of good-neighborliness and cooperation," he noted. "Traffic along this road was opened by President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to the People's Republic of China. Today, it is high time to consider the possibility of holding a second summit meeting, possibly already this year." The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry formulated several principles of Russia's "Eastern policy", which proceeds from the growing importance of the region for the country's future. The Russian Federation maintains stable and balanced relations with all the nations, realising that the system of inter-state relations in the region, as in the world as a whole, has always been and will remain multi-polar. The danger of major military conflicts is now lesser than ever since the end of the Second World War. "However, Kozyrev continued, there are quite significant sources of tension, not only inherited from the `Cold War', but also engendered by new problems. They include the problem of access to the resources of the Pacific ocean, including the sea bottom, and several border disputes. The upswing of religious and nationalistic extremism has found dramatic expression in Afghanistan, and is now threatening Tajikistan." [quotation marks as received] "If we fail to resolve these problems in Asia by joint efforts, we shall be risking to get a very `explosive mixture', indeed," he added. "The most important question of all is the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies. Such a turn of events is not in the interests of the security of the entire region, including Russia, China and India," the minister stressed. "The economic role of the Asia-Pacific region, which already accounts for 60 per cent of the world's industrial output, will apparently grow even further. In this sense, the XXI century will doubtlessly be known as the `Pacific age'. This growth of national might will not pose a threat to neighbours, but on the contrary, will create conditions for economic growth. In Asia, as in other parts of the world, economic progress contributes to progress in ensuring man's basic rights and liberties," Kozyrev stated. Touching on the phased formation of a joint security system, the minister noted that Russia moves to set up a centre for preventing conflicts, to found a regional institute for scientific research in this domain. At the same time, Kozyrev moved to draw up principles for weapons trade in the Asia-Pacific region, based on recommendations of the U.N. Security Council. Moreover, the Russian foreign minister believes that it is necessary to rule out attempts to interfere with normal commercial deals on the armaments market under trumped up excuses. Kozyrev believes that both countries could jointly make an important contribution to regional security and cooperation. Guided by its policy of good-neighborly relations with the People's Republic of China, Russia remains fully dedicated to the principles of the Declaration on the Principles of Mutual Relations, signed at summit level at the end of 1992. This includes the entire complex of commitments assumed by both sides not to use force against each other in any form whatsoever, including the commitment not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. This is in line with the spirit and defensive nature of Russia's new military doctrine," Kozyrev said. Kozyrev noted with satisfaction the Russo-Chinese cooperation in the U.N. Security Council. However, he said that peacekeeping and the implementation of peacekeeping operations remained among the most acute problems. He especially noted that Russia, together with other CIS nations, was now engaged in a peacekeeping operation in Tajikistan, "the purpose of which is to check the expansion of instability in this important region, which is close to China, too". Kozyrev expressed the hope that Russia would get more "comprehensive assistance" from the United Nations, the CSCE, and other international organisations. "This would be a better solution than the groundless statements on Russian neo-imperialism, made from time to time in the West," the minister stressed. The two states, as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, are also called upon to help solve the problem of nuclear weapon on the Korean peninsula on the basis of guarantees from the International Atomic Energy Agency," the minister added. Turning to economic cooperation with China, Kozyrev called for its "qualitative development". He exressed Russia's readiness to take part in large-scale projects on the territory of China, including the construction of the world's largest "three gorges" hydraulic power coplex and in the modernisation of Chinese plants, built with the help of the former Soviet Union. "It is absurd for Russia to counterpoise the 'Western' European and 'Eastern' Asian directions of its foreign policy. China has always been and will remain a reliable and good partner in the system of Russian global interests," Kozyrev stressed.
