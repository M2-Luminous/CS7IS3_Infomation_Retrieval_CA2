The registrant shall maintain the certificate of registration at the registered location in a readily retrievable manner and shall permit inspection of the certificate by any official, agent or employee of the Administration or of any Federal, State, or local agency engaged in enforcement of laws relating to List I chemicals or controlled substances. §1309.43 Suspension or revocation of registration. (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) for any period of time he determines. (b) The Administrator may revoke any registration pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)). (c) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to §1309.46 and, if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing pursuant to §1309.51. Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section, however, the Administrator may suspend any registration pending a final order pursuant to §1309.44. (d) Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately deliver his or her Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the Administration. §1309.44 Suspension of registration pending final order. (a) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously with or at any time subsequent to the service upon the registrant of an order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or suspended, in any case where he finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, he shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to §1309.46 an order of immediate suspension that shall contain a statement of his findings regarding the danger to public health or safety. (b) Upon service of the order of immediate suspension, the registrant shall promptly return his Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the Administration. (c) Any suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension, including any judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any registrant whose registration is suspended under this section may request a hearing on the revocation or suspension of his registration at a time earlier than specified in the order to show cause pursuant to §1309.46, which request shall be granted by the Administrator, who shall fix a date for such hearing as early as reasonably possible. §1309.45 Extension of registration pending final order. In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues his order. The Administrator may extend any other existing registration under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before expiration of the existing registration, with or without request by the registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not inconsistent with the public health and safety. §1309.46 Order to show cause. (a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from any applicant and other information gathered by the Administration regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the determinations required by the applicable provisions of section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) to register the applicant, the Administrator shall serve upon the applicant an order to show cause why the application for registration should not be denied. (b) If, upon information gathered by the Administration regarding any registrant, the Administrator determines that the registration of such registrant is subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to section 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824), the Administrator shall serve upon the registrant an order to show cause why the registration should not be revoked or suspended. (c) The order to show cause shall call upon the applicant or registrant to appear before the Administrator at a time and place stated in the order, which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of receipt of the order. The order to show cause shall also contain a statement of the legal basis for such hearing and for the denial, revocation, or suspension of registration and a summary of the matters of fact and law asserted. (d) Upon receipt of an order to show cause, the applicant or registrant must, if he desires a hearing, file a request for a hearing pursuant to §1309.54. If a hearing is requested, the Administrator shall hold a hearing at the time and place stated in the order, pursuant to §1309.51. (e) When authorized by the Administrator, any agent of the Administration may serve the order to show cause. Hearings §1309.51 Hearings generally. (a) In any case where the Administrator shall hold a hearing on any registration or application therefor, the procedures for such hearing shall be governed generally by the adjudication procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551&hyph;559) and specifically by sections 303 and 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823&hyph;824), by §§1309.51&hyph;1309.57, and by the procedure for administrative hearings under the Act set forth in §§1316.41&hyph;1316.67 of this chapter.
