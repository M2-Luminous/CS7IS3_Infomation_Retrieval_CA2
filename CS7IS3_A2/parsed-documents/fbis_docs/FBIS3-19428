Finnish trade politicians and Finnish industry can now look forward to resuming work within the mixed Finnish-Russian economic commission. One of the first tasks of the new commission will be to review the impact of possible Finnish EU membership on bilateral trade relations between Finland and Russia. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin assured journalists, however, that Russia's attitude to Finnish membership of the EU is frankly positive, but he stressed the importance of safeguarding bilateral relations in trade and industry despite possible Finnish membership. Economic issues also dominated talks between Prime Ministers Esko Aho and Chernomyrdin. Aho stated that he was pleased to see that the mixed economic committee can resume its work. This will make it possible to resolve several practical problems. Aho and Chernomyrdin also discussed Finnish participation in Russian industrial projects, especially in the raw-materials sector. Natural gas and cooperation in this area was a subject of great interest, according to Aho. The only incident at Friday's [11 March] news conference arose when a journalist asked whether Russia wishes to alter the border fixed by the Paris treaty after World War II. Russia's Ambassador to Finland Yuriy Deryabin had to stand up and explain to Chernomyrdin what he had meant by his statements about the Paris treaty, whereupon Chernomyrdin made the point that discussing cooperation in the neighboring border areas is more important than changing borders. Weapons as Partial Payment One of the agreements signed on Friday concerns supplies of Russian arms in payment for a debt of about 500 million Markka, which has been on a special Bank of Finland account since the time of the bilateral clearing trade. The account was established at a time when the trade imbalance was critical, with the intention of allowing the Soviet Union to amortize it by small installments. But the account is still there. Aho thinks that weapons supplies are an excellent idea and that they can also be discussed as a means of repaying other debts. At his meeting with the representatives of Finnish industry, Chernomyrdin stated that the worst crisis in trade was now over. The volume of trade has begun to rise, but there are still Finnish claims worth 6 billion Markka dating back to the bilateral clearing trade. Of that amount the industry has nearly 0.5 billion Markka worth of claims without any collateral. Russian foreign debts are great, Chernomyrdin said, but he pointed out that, although 6 billion Markka is a large amount, it is still only a fraction of the total Russian debt. This issue has therefore not been given priority treatment. "We have begun to pay back our debt through weapons supplies as a means of reimbursing the debt on the special account. This is a first step and Finland will get its money back, although negotiations for any remaining outstanding credits will be take place through other channels." Finland will negotiate state-guaranteed credits together with other Western countries at the so-called Paris Club, whereas Western banks will negotiate their claims jointly via the London Club. The New and Old Mixed Commission Participating in the meeting with representatives of industry was Russian Foreign Trade Minister Oleg Davidov, who has been appointed chairman of the Russian half of the mixed economic commission. The nature of the commission has changed since the Soviet period, but it is still regarded as an important discussion forum. It has, however, not been able to work effectively while being without a Russian chairman for a longer period. Prime Minister Aho hopes that the commission will now be able to resolve some open trade questions. Chernomyrdin assured journalists that economic reform in Russia will continue and that Russia is planning to modify and facilitate its foreign trade while safeguarding Russian interests in both import and export. The problems are still great, but the direction is right, the prime minister stated. He added that there are plans for several industrial projects in which a need for Finnish-Russian cooperation may arise. Many Plans Representatives of Finnish enterprises presented their own plans on cooperation during a meeting with Chernomyrdin lasting over an hour. Metra discussed its diesel engine plant in St. Petersburg, which is nearing completion and which the company wants to see operational as soon as possible. Rautaruukki touched on the prospects of delivering the remainder of Trabstech's special wagons to Russia, and Outokumpu put forward its views on metallurgical cooperation on the Kola peninsula. Valmet has new plans for cooperation in the vehicle component sector in St. Petersburg. Several Agreements During the first day of his visit, the Russian prime minister met with President Ahtisaari, whom he briefed on Russia's economic and political situation. Friday also saw the signing of four bilateral agreements. One of them is to allow frontier crossing at other than official crossing points for purposes of trade and transport. Then there is an agreement on cooperation between the two countries' customs administrations to prevent customs violations. Two other agreements concern fish and cooperation in post and telecommunication services. Today Chernomyrdin is to visit Neste, the state-owned energy company, to witness the signing of several natural gas agreements, including one on increased deliveries of natural gas to Finland.
