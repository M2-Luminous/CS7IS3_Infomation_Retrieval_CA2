UN military observers continued to patrol the Grbavica sector, and if the tank was found UNPROFOR would go and fetch it, Major Chaperon said. Another UN officer noted the Serbs were letting very few military observers into the area. The tank, probably a T-34, disappeared late on Friday while being transported on a truck from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale in violation of the 20-ki1ometre (12.5-mile) exclusion zone ordered by NATO to bar heavy weaponry around Sarajevo. Chaperon reported rising tension at Mostar in the south, and some mortar fire at Celic and Visoko in the north-east. He said several dozen armed Serb militiamen were still in position on the right bank of the river Drina in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in defiance of an exclusion zone order.
