The source said these reports are groundless. The source added that Jordan is primarily interested in the perpetuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and is eager to seek an appropriate negotiated solution to the Yemeni crisis within the framework of dialogue and understanding among the Yemeni leaders. The source emphasized that the Jordanian Arab Army will not hesitate to come to the brothers assistance if needed; that it is an army for all Arabs, and that it works only for Arabs interests. The source said: The issue at hand is that the Yemeni leaders have asked the Jordanian Arab Army's general command to offer its expertise and advice within the framework of a comprehensive plan to reorganize the Yemeni Army's units. Thus, during Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir's visit to Yemen last Monday, Staff Major General 'Id Kamil al-Rawdan, assistant chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for Operations and Training, accompanied al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir to study the Yemeni plan in this respect.
