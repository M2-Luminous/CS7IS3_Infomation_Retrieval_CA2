Speaking with CTK after the dinner he hosted for his counterparts from the Visegrad Group, which comprises besides the Czech Republic also Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, he said that "no one wants his border to be the border of confrontation." Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that Poland would not object to one Visegrad country entering NATO earlier than the others. "But if Poland were the first, this would not be in harmony with its security interests," he stressed. Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said he thought that all Visegrad Group countries had good reasons to closely cooperate and that they enjoyed similar conditions within the Partnership for Peace project. At a press conference following the dinner, Zieleniec said that in addition to technical-military measures, which are already being prepared by the Czech Defense Ministry, the political dimension of the Partnership for Peace should also be dealt with. He said that closer political cooperation must be established with the NATO countries. "This is the road that leads towards building a firm defense union in Europe," he stressed. Zieleniec and his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky said they gave priority to political consultations. Moravcik said that Slovakia favored a balanced course of action that would combine both the political and military aspects of the project. Polish Minister Andrzej Olechowski said he expected first missions of the U.S. Army and NATO to come to the Visegrad countries. Poland's partial dissatisfaction with the Partnership for Peace is due to the lack of specific prospects for admission into NATO, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said following a dinner of the Visegrad foreign ministers this evening. "We have many promises, political declarations, but we lack specific prospects," he said. The artificial border between the two parts of Europe that was created in 1945 will continue to divide Europe as long as those countries nearing the West politically, economically, and by their moral values are pushed aside, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky. Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec termed the Partnership for Peace an important step towards integrating the Visegrad countries with NATO and towards building a new security architecture in Europe. "If more partners are to agree, none of them will get 100 percent of what they want," he said. He stressed, however, that the project in its current form, as opposed to the original version, had extraordinarily significant political dimensions. Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said that it is important that the Partnership for Peace be followed quickly by further steps.
