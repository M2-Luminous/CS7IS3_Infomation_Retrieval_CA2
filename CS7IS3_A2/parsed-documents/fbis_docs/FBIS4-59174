In an attempt to describe the bad conditions the marshland dwellers are living in, the sources said that drying up the marshlands has pushed most of the people there to migrate to other areas. The terrorist regime in Baghdad has also transferred some of the marshland dwellers to unknown districts. In another report, an Iraqi mujahid said that the surprise attack the mujahidin forces carried out recently on the headquarters of the 10th Battalion in the north al-Qurnah led to the elimination of two platoons and the killing of the commander of the battalion. In these operations, the mujahidin seized a number of mortars, some communications equipment, and some military documents.
