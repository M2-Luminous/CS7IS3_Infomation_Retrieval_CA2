Party sources said on Tuesday [15 February] that more than 100 members of the Kurdish-based Democracy Party (DEP) had been detained in the troubled region and that those arrested included some of DEP's possible mayoral candidates. DEP deputy Sedat Yurttas said that although Turkey could claim that the elections were legal, it could no longer defend the legitimacy of the elections due to recent developments. The campaign on the DEP was launched late last week with possible--or rumored--mayoral candidates from the party being arrested by security forces. DEP spokesman Remzi Kartal told journalists on Monday that he suspected this was a systematic, organized campaign to prevent the DEP from entering the elections. Kartal explained that all three of the potential mayoral candidates of the DEP in Diyarbakir had already been detained. The same day, security forces cracked down on groups of DEP members in Urfa's township of Viransehir, Malazgirt, Malatya, Diyarbakir and Istanbul. Party officials said at least 30 people were detained in Diyarbakir while 60 more were taken into custody in Viransehir. Among those detained were four provincial party officials. Statements issued by DEP headquarters in these cities also claimed that a campaign was underway to prevent them from entering the elections. Several houses owned or rented by DEP executives were raided in Istanbul and their occupants were placed under arrest. Kartal claimed that "they are trying to put us in a situation where we cannot enter the elections." Meanwhile, attacks on the DEP, which a majority of Turks accuse of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have also increased. In the past months, several DEP buildings have been bombed. Monday night, the party's Ankara headquarters was also bombed. Last week, its general-secretary, Murat Bozlak was shot in Ankara. At least 50 DEP-affiliated activists, including a parliamentarian from Mardin, have been killed since 1991. The DEP believes the reason behind the recent campaign is to block its candidates and terrorize the people of the Southeast to prevent them from voting for this party. It also argues that raids on houses of its members in western parts of the country are due to Turkey's own concern that the party is strengthening. But security officials argue there is evidence to prove that, on many occasions, the DEP cadres under investigation have active links with the PKK and the party not only supports this organization but at times facilitates its activities. Many of the raids in Istanbul, for instance, are in areas in which the DEP claims to be strengthening its public support, but where armed activities of the PKK have been concentrated. On Tuesday, the mass circulation Turkish daily HURRIYET reported on its front page that security forces had monitored orders given by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to the DEP whereby he demanded that the party withdrew from the elections. There are currently claims that the DEP is preparing, under instruction from the PKK, to boycott the elections altogether and boost its propaganda drive in Europe to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the results. The DEP is seen as the most likely winner of local elections in the Southeast, not only due to popular support but to threats issued against the local population by PKK militants. Its major opponents appear to be the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) of Necmettin Erbakan and the paramilitary guards. Village guards are proposing their own tribal chiefs as candidates against the DEP--and the PKK. If the DEP boycotts the elections, the recent round of persecution of its members and executives is to be used for propaganda purposes. The party's deputies are currently campaigning in Europe to bring 200 foreign observers to Turkey in March. There are also unconfirmed reports that the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM newspaper, a supporter of the DEP, plans to close down at about the same time in order to give the image that Kurdish rights and activities are being systematically banned in Turkey. OZGUR GUNDEM, which had closed due to financial reasons in the past, is reportedly suffering financial problems again and has found it difficult to pay personnel salaries for the past three months.
