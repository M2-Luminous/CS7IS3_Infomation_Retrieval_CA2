He said the government had thoroughly reworked and regrouped the materials. The first part concerns general powers of higher administrative units while the second one defines which powers would be transferred to higher administrative units from central bodies, Klaus said. The third part specifies areas where the higher units would have the right to set up institutions. These would include social care, education, health care, transport, culture, and the environment, he said. Klaus said that the approved principles would "facilitate the next stage of the work on the future administrative arrangement of the state."
