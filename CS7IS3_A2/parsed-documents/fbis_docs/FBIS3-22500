Deputy Health Minister Farid Ariffin said this was due to the significant increase in public awareness of Acquired Immunity Defeciency Syndrome (AIDS) and HIV, among Malaysians. "Most people are now beginning to take precautions to avoid being infected as many are more aware about the disease now than they were a couple of years ago." To date, Farid said, the number of those tested positive for HIV was about 7,400. He said almost all Malaysians above the age of 15 were aware about the disease. He said this included those living in the rural and remote areas and even intravenous dadah [drug] addicts who were still by far the largest group identified as having AIDS or HIV. "Despite their awareness about the disease, most drug addicts continue to share hypodermic needles to inject themselves with dadah and seem to be more obsessed with getting a `kick' than fear of getting AIDS or dying." Farid was speaking after the opening of a counselling seminar organised by the Islah Counselling Unit of the Penang branch of the Malaysian Association of Jamaah Islah (JIM) here. [passage omitted]
