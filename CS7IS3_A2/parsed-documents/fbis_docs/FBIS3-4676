In this regard, Japan's neighboring countries -- including East Asian nations, Canada, and Australia -- are increasingly worried about the situation. They are concerned because their economic reliance on Japan and the United States is high and they will be affected significantly should the relations between two major economic superpowers fall into a critical situation. Japan and the United States should remain calm and consider the possible impact of their economic ties on wide ranging areas in the Asia-Pacific region. All of the neighboring countries are critical of the numeric target, which the United States is demanding Japan accept. They say that the establishment of such a target is linked to managed trade. They are also very cautious about the possibility that it may give a rise to bilateralism [nikokukan shugi]. Newspapers in Hong Kong and Australia are also critical of the United States. They say that "it was only recently that following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, the GATT member nations finally confirmed to maintain multilateralism [takokukan shugi]." They are not saying this to express sympathy toward Japan. The newspapers are sharing the same view that "Japan can certainly afford to open up its market and ease regulations a little more." Their true feeling is that "it is not enough to say no to the United States." However, these countries feel uneasy about the hard-line attitude of the United States toward Japan. East Asian nations heavily rely on the U.S. market. Many of them have huge amount of surplus trade with the United States. Therefore, the East Asian nations feel that the United States may assume the same hard-line attitude toward them. Of late, the U.S. Government, by using the issues of human rights and working conditions as an excuse, is trying to take a protectionist stand toward China and Indonesia. However, the newspapers (including ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL and FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW) are strongly criticizing this U.S. move. Some people think that the Clinton administration's hard-line stand toward Japan is the same as "brinkmanship," a strategy the United States assumed to deal with the Soviet Union during the Cold War period. This is a strategy designed to force an opponent to give in by assuming hard-line policies until the last minute while knowing that there is a high risk (in this case, an increase in anti-American sentiment in Japan). It is said that President Clinton is aiming to strengthen his stand at home. He "began to take psychological retaliation against Japan" to reverse the economic situation in which the United States "has always been beaten by Japan," and thereby ease American people's distorted feelings, (according to WASHINGTON POST reporter Hoagland). It was pointed out that such an attitude of the U.S. administration toward Japan indicates that, in the long run, the United States may take the same stand toward the entire East Asia in the future, (according to INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE reporter Bowling). Last fall, President Clinton hosted a summit, attended by Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Minister Conference members in Seattle. At that time, it was pointed out that mutual relations between Japan, China, and the United States were important to the Asia- Pacific region's stability and prosperity. The United States expressed its intention to attach importance to multilateralism. However, the Asia-Pacific region's future will become gloomy if Japan and the United States remain at loggerhead. We are certain that the neighboring countries will suffer hardship as a result of the dispute between Japan and the United States. Its impact may be felt in the security area too. We must not let the Japan-United States confrontation tear apart the Asia-Pacific region.
