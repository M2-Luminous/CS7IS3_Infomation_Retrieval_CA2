This was said in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine by member of the temporary presidium of parliament Vasiliy Durdynets who was commenting on Kravchuk's proposal. Durdynets noted that in the issue of elections "there are a number of questions which should be seriously discussed" in permanent parliamentary commissions and then the issue should be put to the vote. "I hope that the deputies will show enough responsibility and common sense," he said. Leader of the Ukrainian Conservative-Ukrainian Party Stepan Khmara believes that the deputies will not back the president's proposal to put off the elections. In his opinion, the president's appeal makes him "seem simply weak and helpless," "his unconvincing arguments are simply ridiculous." "We consider it necessary to postpone the elections until the end of the year, because the presidential campaign today could disturb peace in the country," chairman of the All-Ukrainian Society Prosvita Pavlo Movchan stated. However, that does not mean that Prosvita supports Kravchuk's candidacy, he added. "He has made enough mistakes and senseless actions." One of the leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party Boris Oleynik said that there is a certain sense in arguments in favor of the postponement. In his opinion, that may violate the balance in society. At the same time, Oleynik said, the faction of Communists believes that "there should be no violations of the law--the elections should take place." "In the president's proposal we don't see the main thing we are looking for--an explanation of what he is going to do before the elections if they are postponed," leader of the major faction of the old parliament Novaya Rada Ivan Zayets told INTERFAX-Ukraine. In his opinion, the elections will not be postponed.
