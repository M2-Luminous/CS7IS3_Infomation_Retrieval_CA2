The British Muslim youth is being radicalized by several organizations whose agenda includes a Jehad against disbelievers in many countries. They receive funds from abroad and, in Britain, seek to capture the control and management of mosques. Western counter-terrorism experts say that the past five years have seen an explosion in the number of Muslim charities, not dedicated to purely humanitarian aims. The Kashmir connection of two of these organizations has been disclosed in a report in THE GUARDIAN entitled, "The Young Muslims" and "Islamic Foundation" headed by Prof Kurshid Ahmed, known in Pakistan as the vice-president of Jamaat Islami, which has connections with extremists parties in Afghanistan and Kashmir. The Islamic Foundation gave nearly 90,000 pounds sterling to a fund for Kashmir, according to the last published accounts in 1990. Details of the expenditure were not given. Britain now has a law to curb the flow of charity money for terrorist activities abroad but its enforcement is not that easy. Jammat activists were said to be behind the original burning of Salman Rushdie's book in Bradford. At the political level, some British politicians take an unusual interest in the Kashmir problem even though currently they are all critical of the meddling by American politicians on the issue of Northern Ireland. These MPs [members of Parliament] are not even of Kashmiri origin but are guided by the anti-Indian lobbies active in their constituencies. Recently, both the Indian community as well as the Indian high commission intensified their efforts to present India's case on Kashmir with some notable results reflected in the last debate on the issue in the House of Lords. The Pakistani lobby has been able to enlist the services of a couple of academics also. At one time, very little reference material was circulated by the Indian side on the Kashmir issue among the political and media circles. The high commission has now circulated a series of backgrounders and brought out a compilation of articles on Kashmir in a book form. The task of the Indian lobby is growing while it is not certain whether the British government will extend the same cooperation to India in checking Kashmiri extremism as it did in the case of Sikh extremism in Britain. The attempts to mobilize British Muslims for holy wars in foreign lands are a wider issue because these also take the form of anti-semistic propaganda and an assault on multi-culturalism. The new fervor has a distinct West-Asian flavor. The active groups are funded from outside Britain. It is the point about outside funding that has become an additional irritant in the current controversy over the plans to establish a Hindu temple in Southall. The dispute involving the local council has divided the Asian community in the area on a religious basis. The controversy on buying a disused townhall continues to rage and the extent of bitterness about a provocative advertisement in a Pakistani newspaper here was revealed in a long phone-in program run by an ethnic radio station. That a mosque can become a center of political program has been highlighted by THE GUARDIAN report which says that some of the literature being distributed by Islamic groups openly outside mosques incites violence against disbelievers. The radical groups argue against integration, saying that British Muslims are part not of British society but of the Islamic Ummah or world community. The Commission for Racial Equality has warned that the radical groups are planting a time-bomb under harmony between Muslims and British society. *
