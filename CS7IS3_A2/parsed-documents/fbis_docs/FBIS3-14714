[Rabin] [passage omitted] I knew peace had Israeli enemies. I found it very hard to believe that an Israeli could commit a loathsome crime such as the one committed at the Cave of the Patriarchs, but can we say that we ruled it out altogether? After all, even today some politically mad person could go to some West Bank Arab marketplace, open fire, and kill people. There is no certainty that this can be prevented, just as I cannot guarantee that a terror squad will not open fire at a bus on one of the many roads on which Jews travel. At the time, I made a distinction between political and security settlements. The political settlements were set up in the heart of Judaea and Samaria, and the issue of providing security for the residents was not considered. They did not set up clusters of settlements such as the Qatif Bloc. The settlements are isolated, and in between them and on the roads there are Arab settlements. The Army escorts settler children to and from school, making 700 such escorts a day. A large part of the Army is tied down in guarding installations, routes, and escorting busses, instead of fighting terrorism. The only basic solution to this reality, if there is basic solution, is a political solution backed up with military might. [passage omitted] [Qadmon] Let us discuss one thing you may regret -- the Shamgar Commission of Inquiry. [Rabin] The commission exists and is made up of very distinguished members. It was set up by a government decision that I supported. I have a lot of respect for its work, despite the difficulties it adds to the work of Army commanders in the field. Naturally, they will consult legal advisers more than in the past, which may be good. I believe I will be called to testify before the committee, and I believe it is my duty to do so. [Qadmon] But you opposed it. Why did you surrender if you believed that it would cause damage? [Rabin] I thought that since such an offer was raised at the cabinet, and since it had support, it would be a mistake to bring it up for a vote. This would have started a public debate on whether or not to establish a committee. I do not fear the committee. Today, it exists. I am certain its distinguished members, mainly its chairman, will study the case, investigate it, and issue conclusions that will be recommendations for the government. [Qadmon] Did you not say the committee would cause damage to the Israel Defense Forces [IDF]? [Rabin] I never said that. In general, the press often carries quotes that are very far from the truth. What I said was that the committee would impose an additional burden on the work of IDF officers and others. They are preoccupied with the investigation, and each one fears for himself, mainly those directly involved. This is a very complex and sensitive matter. For the 1.8 million Palestinians living in the territories, we are an occupying army, an occupying government. On the one hand, we should provide for the security of that population; on the other hand, in their mind, we are an occupying force. As such, under international law, we should run life in the territories, Jewish as well as Arab. This is a very complex situation, further complicated by the political settlements. It is also complex from the aspect of security because it has created thousands spots of daily friction on the roads and in places where the two populations work together. Naturally, when emotions run high, there is no end to the areas of contact, friction, and possible confrontations of all kinds. Sometimes these things occur in the background of some incident, certainly in the wake of the Hebron massacre. This time, people who are not members of terror groups, swept up by national-religious-fundamentalist-Islamic zeal pull out knives and stab others. Since September, we have prepared for Jewish riots. Nevertheless, since this issue will be examined by the committee, please understand that I cannot elaborate. [Qadmon] And yet, the commission found there is an order prohibiting soldiers from shooting at settlers under any circumstances. [Rabin] I will not comment on that. This issue is being investigated by the commission. It remains to be seen in what context the order was issued and what orders are being referred to. Because this is what the state commission of inquiry is working on, I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this question in an open interview. [passage omitted] [Qadmon] Is the five-year long interim period necessary? Why should Goldsteins in both camps be given five more years to attempt to blow up the entire enterprise? After all, at the end of that period we are expecting a Palestinian state. [Rabin] We will make no progress without the interim period. The main achievement of the Declaration of Principles is the following: The issue of Jerusalem will not be dealt with during that period, and the opposition can chatter as much as it likes. No country in the world has recognized the unification of Jerusalem, but that has never prevented an Israeli Government from viewing united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty as the capital of the Jewish nation. Our problem is how to provide freedom of worship for other religions as well. To me, this is the Jewish test of the State of Israel. Not only guarding the integrity of Jerusalem, but also being tolerant to worshipers of other religions who really need Jerusalem to perform their religious rites. The second thing is maintaining the settlements, not uprooting them. The third, is the IDF's overall responsibility for the security of Israelis on the roads and in the settlements. The fourth thing is responsibility over external security along the Jordan River, international border with Egypt, and in the area between Nitzana and the Gaza Strip. If we have to deal with solving these problems without first creating a different reality -- without making the Palestinians realize what it means to be in charge of the fate of 1.5 million Palestinians, provide them with food, labor, housing, health, and education -- it would not have been possible. There is no doubt in my mind that this is what we should hope for -- creating a new reality that would facilitate dealing with a solution no later than two years after the implementation of Gaza and Jericho First. [Qadmon] But a Palestinian state will still be waiting at the end of the five years, will it not? [Rabin] Who said so? I do not want to deal with the solution to that now. I am against the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state west of Jordan. We will complete the agreement on Gaza and Jericho and secure its implementation and the next stage. This is very important: both reaching an agreement as well as implementing it. [passage omitted]
