The department's deputy head Khamid Dzhalmaldayev said that, according to the Chechen general staff, a Su-27 attack plane unit had flown to the air base in Mozdok, North Ossetia. He added that Russian Interior Ministry special troops whose fire power is equal to that of a wartime infantry division had moved into the Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia. Dzhalmaldayev thought that these troop movement had to do with the latest events such as the attempt on Dzhokhar Dudayev's life and efforts mounted by the Russian special services to destabilize Chechnya. Meanwhile, defense, interior and security chiefs told a conference chaired by Chechen President Dudayev that the situation in the republic was under control.
