With so many distinguished thinkers on this subject gathered together today, I feel that we cannot but make significant progress in the understanding of this complex area. I would like to set the tone by presenting an approach that could help achieve a viable framework for the areas to be discussed in the three other sessions today: the future of the Palestinian economy, the reconstruction challenge, and financing the peace. As all those involved with MEED are aware, the entire region has been shattered by decades of conflict. While the Middle East is potentially self-sustaining in every respect, the Arab-Israel conflict has left the economies of the region insular in orientation and stunted in development. Crippled by debt and the demands of massive military expenditure, not one of the countries of the region--including Israel--could at present claim to be self-supporting in any meaningful way. Only peace can redeem this state of affairs. The Middle East peace process has weathered changes of administration in Israel and the United States; it has survived political and military crises, and its negotiations have come through periods of difficulty to provide fresh hope. If the process is currently encountering a number of technical obstacles, it has also demonstrated unprecedented resilience. Jordan believes that this opportunity to resolve the conflict cannot be missed. The no-war, no-peace stasis that holds us in its thrall has benefited none of the parties. The accumulation of weapons in the region, particularly since the second Gulf war, means that the consequences of a future war are unthinkable. Peace is therefore the only viable path, and we in Jordan are pledged to do all in our power to pursue that path. The mutual recognition of the PLO and Israel last autumn was a significant breakthough in Arab-Israeli relations. The Conference to Support Middle East peace, held in Washington last October, provided guarantees of support and assistance from the international community to the Palestinians, to help translate the promise of peace into tangible reality. The Jordanian-Israeli common agenda was likewise a bold step on the road to peace. However, the substance of peace is infinitely more complex than its rhetoric. Peace-making has entered a new phase which requires an extensive investment in detail and technicalities. Soundbite diplomacy is no substitute for substantive negotiation. Jordan is engaged in serious and substantive discussions with its neighbours, with the aim of delineating areas of future cooperation in all spheres. We have just agreed with the Palestinians a cooperation agreement at the official bilateral level, at the private sector level, and at the Arab and international levels. We will explore the details of such fields as money and banking, trade, human resources development, tourism, investment promotion, taxation, health, agriculture, infrastructure: not the stuff of headlines, but the stuff of which true peace is made. For despite the 1988 severance of administrative links, the geographic, historic and demographic ties between Jordan and Palestine endure. Such factors lie behind our decision to reopen branches of Jordanian banks in the occupied territories and to encourage the Jordanian private sector to invest in the West Bank and Gaza: for these are designed to help the nascent Palestinian economy in its development. On the Jordanian-Israeli track, the Jordanian-Israeli-American economic committee will provide a valuable forum to address all aspects of human resource development, trade, finance, economic and monetary policy between Jordan and Israel. We now look forward to discussing other substantive issues, such as water, boundaries and refugees, on the basis of international law. It is possible that in the long term, an arrangement similar to that which exists between Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would give all parties the psychological and material sense of security that is vital to sustainable peace. Jordan's primary role in a Benelux-type arrangement would be to provide stability: a role for which it is well-qualified, having traditionally served as an island of moderation in an otherwise volatile region. In addition, Jordan's historic position at the crossroads of East and West, stretching back to antiquity, equips it well to be a window for the world on a new Middle East, one finally at peace. However, the disparties and distortions created by the conflict must be eliminated if such arrangements are to enjoy lasting success. Peace must be forged between partners, and the relationship that exists between Israel and the occupied territories is not one of partnerhsip, but of hegemony. The Israeli occupation has destroyed the economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, preventing the development and expansion of Palestinian enterprise, and prohibiting free trade within the area. A recent World Bank study shows that in a "normal" situation, Israel would account for a fifth of the occupied territories' exports and a third of their imports; instead, 85 per cent of their trade is with Israel. Whatever the nature of the Palestinian entity agreed upon for the occupied territories, it would not serve the interests of any party for it to be subject to a single set of incentives. Even under conditions of peace, the disparity between the Israeli economy and those of the other core parties to the conflict would demand appropriate measures to fashion a balanced relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of Spain and Portugal within the EU bear consideration in this regard. This is particularly vital as the Israeli economy has many restrictive features and is heavily subsidised. Given a negotiated peace, the complete removal of these features on both sides would be possible; but at the moment, when Israeli limits on our export to the occupied territories closely resemble boycott provisions, talk of lifting the Arab embargo is premature. A GATT-EU approach could be the best way to deal with the economic legacies of the conflict. Indeed, Jordan has decided to apply for membership of GATT; for we believe that in seeking to envolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The European Commission recently approved a communication on "Future Relations and Cooperation Between the Community and the Middle East," illustrating the importance of experience in other parts of the world. The communication stresses the need for a common regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East. It states: "Partnership requres balanced economic development. If cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive disparties in income levels between potential partners in the region." It adds that: "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of common capacities and the tackling of common problems ... implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and labour." If one thing is clear at this point, it is that peace cannot be piecemeal. All the peoples of the region have suffered through the conflict; and just as all have their part to play in its rebuilding and renewal, so must its fruits be distributed equitably. For it should never be forgotten that peace is ultimately not in the hands of governments, but of individuals; and unless peace can be made attractive to the man on the street, the best efforts of negotiators will come to nought. Jordan, nearest to the core of the conflict, has shouldered an enormous human load. We have given shelter to three waves of displaced Palestinians. These refugees--about 1.7 million individuals--account today for one third of Jordan's population. The demographic strain on my country is vast; and the conflict has also had consequences in terms of debt. We are grateful for President Clinton's public commitment on the part of the United States to debt relief for Jordan, as our $7bn. debt overhang is a real obstacle to the progressive policies which we wish to adopt. We seek to attract foreign investment, to upgrade infrastructure and to participate fully in regional projects. Jordan is committed to the peace process, to democratisation and economic liberation, to human rights, sustainable development and regional cooperation. But if we are to promote these policies effectively, exceptional efforts will be needed in respect of our debt burden. Ladies and Gentlemen: International investment in development projects that serve the region and its peoples is vital. it is equally important that such projects be founded upon sound concepts, and that they receive the support of international financial institutions, governments and multinational corporations alike. A basketing approach, covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and security, must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure that can tackle the 'over-arching' problems of economies of the region: disparities created by conflict, over-extended public sectors, addiction to aid on the one hand and oil revenues on the other. An economic framework is needed to deal with such problems. This must in turn be backed up by wide-ranging security and cooperation arrangements at the regional level, involving all players. The multilateral component of the peace process provides a possible framework for this enterprise. Given such arrangments, the reconstruction of the Middle East could proceed apace. In terms of economic development, a free-trade zone across the Middle East would be the ultimate goal. Arrangements for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a MEFTA along the lines of NAFTA--would allow the region to play a more creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this goal, it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement of all factors of production: labour, goods, capital and services. In this context, a dialogue on the rights of migrant labour emerges as a vital prerequisite; for the existence of surplus labour in the north, and capital in the south, immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime. Such a development would provide an impetus for a new relationship of hope in the Middle East. Many other instruments would back this up. First and foremost, there needs to be a commitment to arms control from the purchasers and suppliers of weaponary. Secondly, regional bodies and charters will help ensure equity in resource-related areas such as energy and water; while incentives for local sustainable development programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all. Finally, a regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle East reconstruction and development, will promote stable and open financial practices, improving the chances for the region to play a dynamic part in the world economy. For many of the problems of the Middle East stem from the fact that the climate of conflict has forced the diversion of funds away from long-term development and into the military. Generations have grown up in a region which has prioritised military security above health or education. In a Middle East established by a negotiated peace, and upheld by structures of collective security and cooperation, these funds could at last be channelled into building the social and economic foundations of peace, which are the surest foundations of all. In all these areas, the experience and assistance of the international community of nations, and the international business community, will be indispensable to the Middle East. I am sure that conferences of this sort will help to deepen international understanding of the tasks at hand. I would like to thank the organisers for all their efforts; and I would like to thank you all for your attention.
