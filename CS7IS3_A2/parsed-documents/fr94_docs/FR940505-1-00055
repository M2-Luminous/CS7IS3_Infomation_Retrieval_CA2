FR940505-1-00055 FR940505-1-00012 In the 1990 Amendments Congress also imposed specific and increasingly rigorous requirements for Part D SIPs, depending on the area's nonattainment classification, with new deadlines, ranging from immediately to six years from enactment, for submitting various components of the plans to EPA. Sections 181, 182, 186, and 187. In addition, the 1990 Amendments amended Section 110(c)(l), the principal provision governing EPA's FIP obligation. EPA concluded that these revisions, directing States to develop SIPs meeting new requirements and deadlines, and to submit SIPs to EPA on specific schedules, demonstrated that EPA's obligation to promulgate FIPs would arise only upon future disapprovals of those newly submitted SIPs. EPA appealed to the courts to determine whether the Amendments had relieved the Agency of its pre-existing FIP obligations. In Coalition for Clean Air, 971 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1992), a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that although Section 110(c)(l) had been revised by the 1990 Amendments, the language of section 110(c)(l)(B), which requires EPA to promulgate a FIP within two years after it ``disapproves'' a SIP, applies to pre-Amendment disapprovals. Thus, the court ruled that new section 110(c)(l)(B) operates retroactively to retain EPA's preexisting FIP obligation, even though the statutory provisions forming the basis for that obligation have been repealed. In reaching this conclusion, the court declined to indicate whether the requirements of the old law or the 1990 Amendments would govern the contents of this FIP. The Court acknowledged that ``the proper contents of FIPs for the South Coast are not before us,'' and that ``we need not decide whether EPA would be required to meet any additional requirement imposed by the 1990 Amendments in promulgating FIPs for the South Coast,'' 971 F.2d at 225. EPA sought, and was denied, a writ of certiorari (113 S.Ct. 1361 (1993)). (2) Applicable law. Thus, although the Ninth Circuit found that the passage of the Amendments did not release EPA from a FIP obligation arising from a pre-Amendment disapproval, it did not decide whether any requirement of the 1990 Amendments applies to this continuing obligation. In the absence of any guidance from the Court, this task falls to EPA. The threshold question, then, is what requirements govern the content of a FIP which will take effect after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments, but which is based on a plan failure and disapproval arising from pre-Amendment Clean Air Act provisions which have since been repealed. The greatly altered legal regime established by the 1990 Amendments creates a discontinuity between the plan contents required under the new and old acts. Thus, EPA is faced with a choice as to how to design the FIP. (3) New law applies. It is well settled that ``[c]ourts must apply new laws to pending cases, unless such application would result in manifest injustice or be contrary to statutory direction or legislative history.'' United States v. Ford, 737 F.2d 1508 (9th Cir. 1984). See Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711 (1974); DeGurules v. INS, 833 F.2d 861, 863 (9th Cir. 1987); California Cartage Co. v. United States, 802 F.2d 353, 357 (9th Cir. 1986). In accordance with the principle embodied in these cases, EPA believes that the 1990 Amendments should be applicable to the FIPs arising from EPA's pre-Amendment disapprovals. But an analysis of the new Act's provisions reveals that the new Act does not require this FIP to include each and every pollution control program required of States under the Amendments. The 1990 Amendments make explicit a principle that was implicit in the preceding Act_that a FIP corrects or fills a void in a deficient state plan. The amended Act defines a FIP as a plan to fill a gap or ``correct all or a portion of an inadequacy in a State implementation plan.'' 42 U.S.C. 7602(y) (Supp. II. 1990) (emphasis added). The California SIPs at issue here were rejected by EPA in 1988 because they were ``inadequa[te]'' to demonstrate attainment under the pre-Amendment deadlines, and thus EPA's obligation under the pre-1990 Act was to promulgate a FIP in order to correct that ``inadequacy.'' Thus EPA's FIP obligation is to fulfill the requirement to demonstrate attainment. Stated differently, what the Ninth Circuit's ruling preserved was EPA's existing FIP obligation to correct the state plan's failure to provide for attainment. That is the inadequacy that EPA must address in this FIP, not any failure that might have arisen under any of the numerous requirements of the new law. Of course, if the State fails to meet any of the new Act's requirements, that failure would trigger a new FIP obligation in the future, but that would be an entirely different obligation, not the one on which the district court orders under the old Act were premised. And even as to such obligations, the Administrator is not required to promulgate a federal plan until two years after she disapproves a deficient state plan or finds that the state has failed to submit a required plan element. Section 110(c)(l). With respect to new requirements imposed by the 1990 Amendments, there has either been no state failure, or the 24-month clock for EPA to promulgate a FIP has not yet run. When a state failure giving rise to a new FIP obligation occurs, EPA will address that obligation in a separate FIP NPRM. For example, FIPs addressing state failures to satisfy the VOC RACT catch-up requirement of the new Amendments may become due late in 1994 and in 1995. In the absence of approvable state measures correcting for these deficiencies, EPA will issue separate FIPs to rectify them. Given EPA's position as to the effect of the new Amendments, one might argue that the logical extension is that since the state has not yet failed to adopt an attainment demonstration under new section 182(c)(2)(A), no attainment demonstration is due. But since the Ninth Circuit conclusively decided that the obligation to promulgate an attainment demonstration survived, EPA must prepare one under the new Act.
