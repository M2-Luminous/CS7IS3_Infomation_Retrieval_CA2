Such actions can be seen as a reflection of the unwillingness of the business community to understand how AIDS is transmitted and how the HIV virus is spread, as it is understood by the international community concerned with AIDS. Dr. Gandung Hartono, MPH [Master of Public Health], former Chairman of the National Committee for Responding to AIDS, said this to reporters last Monday [29 November] evening in Jakarta after leading the swearing-in ceremony for 15 counsellors who have joined the nongovernmental organization Mitra Indonesia. Dr. Hudoyo Hupadio, MPH, is the chairman of this organization, which was officially established today 1 December 1993 to coincide with World AIDS Day, and Dr. Gandung Hartono is its honorary chairman. A reporter who had heard of a large Indonesian company that fired an employee who was infected with the HIV virus, the virus suspected of being the cause of AIDS, asked whether firing an employee under these circumstances was proper. In response to that question, Gandung said that in the first place high-ranking officers of the company that fired the employee must not understand the simplest facts about AIDS. [passage omitted] In the second place, said Gandung, we have to check to see whether the company which fired the employee who had AIDS is consistent in its policies, meaning that if a company has a policy of always firing employees who have been diagnosed as infected with AIDS, the company would have to spend a lot of money to administer periodic blood tests to every single employee and to the company's high-ranking officers to check whether the HIV virus had entered their bloodstream. [passage omitted] Anticipating the possibility that many Indonesian companies will take such incorrect actions in the future, Gandung urged the organizations active in the fight against AIDS to hold immediate discussions about manpower infected with AIDS. What must be discussed is how a company can treat workers who are infected with the AIDS virus in a humanitarian way. By providing every member of society who requires it with information and counselling about AIDS, Mitra Indonesia emphasizes services to individuals and to small groups, especially those who are at high risk, those who are infected with the HIV virus and those who already have AIDS. Face-to-face counselling is provided at 78 Kebon Kacang 9 Street, Jakarta 10240 every Monday through Sunday from 3 pm to 8 pm. For the time being there are only 15 counsellors from Mitra Indonesia who have already sworn to undertake that task in accordance with the code of ethics of counsellors for the Mitra Indonesia AIDS Hotline. Counselling is also available by telephone at 021-3100855. It is reported from Bandung that Hadi Marjanto Abednego, Director General for the Eradication of Infectious Diseases and for the Improvement of Health in the Residential Environment, said that the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region now has the highest number of people who are HIV-positive or who have AIDS. As of the beginning of last November, there were 58 people with AIDS or who were HIV-positive in Jakarta, 26 of them with AIDS and 32 who were HIV positive. "The number of cases has definitely increased. This disease spreads fast," Abednego told the press in Bandung yesterday. Other provinces that have high rates of AIDS or HIV-positive infection are Irian Jaya with 54 patients, Bali with 23 patients, East Java with 16 patients, Riau with 12 patients and West Java with four patients. Nationally, there are 175 people who have AIDS or who are HIV positive, 42 of them with AIDS and 133 who are HIV positive. These patients are spread out over 12 provinces. "Although the official figures show only 175 people who have AIDS or who are HIV-positive, one patient with AIDS or who is HIV positive can potentially spread it to 100 others. That's why we must be on the alert for the approximately 175,000 other patients who are below the surface and who are not in the Department of Health's official count," he said. [passage omitted]
