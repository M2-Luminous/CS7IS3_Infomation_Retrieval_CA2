ACTION: Final rule; technical corrections. SUMMARY: EPA is amending the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper to correct typographical errors, clarify language, and restore special primacy requirements inadvertently deleted from the Code of Federal Regulations. These changes clarify Agency requirements. The intended effect is to simplify implementation of the regulations by reducing confusion. EFFECTIVE DATE: The technical corrections are effective on June 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 7, 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) and national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) for lead and copper (``lead and copper rule'') (56 FR 26460). Subsequently, EPA published two technical amendments to the lead and copper rule correcting typographical errors and clarifying the Agency's intent (56 FR 32113, July 15, 1991; 57 FR 28785, June 19, 1992). Today's action corrects errors in the lead and copper regulations and the preamble discussion of the copper health effects, and clarifies the intent of the regulatory requirements in cases where the language was confusing. Today's action also reinstates special primacy condition language in the rule that was inadvertently deleted when a section of another rulemaking action (the Agency's ``Phase II rule'') became effective on July 30, 1992. Sections 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553, provide that when an Agency finds good cause to exist, it may issue a rule without first providing notice and comment and make the rule immediately effective. Under the APA, good cause for not receiving public comment is present where notice and comment is impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. Today's action corrects errors and omissions in 40 CFR parts 141 and 142. These technical revisions are minor and do not impact any substantive obligations of public water systems or States. The Agency therefore finds that neither comment nor a delayed effective date is necessary or in the public interest. Accordingly, EPA finds that there is good cause not to solicit comment on this notice and to have the revisions effective immediately.
