The chief of this department, Aram TARAKCHYAN, characterizes the situation with foreign investments in Armenia like this. The department is not engaged in procuring foreign investments. Our goal is the creation of conditions so that investments would come into Armenia without the help of the president or the prime minister. To do this one needs to know how and for what purpose investments are made in the world. It is necessary to create a mechanism for the support and encouragement of investments. The principle of supporting investors is clear and common the world over: a favorable legislative field. In this case our task is clear: to adopt such laws. Encouragement is another matter. In this case the presence of a well thought-out and considered program specially for Armenia is required. Official letters of proposals with invitations to foreigners to make investments were sent from Armenia to various addresses in the past. Not a single positive reply has been received up to this day. The reason, it seems, is in the lack of information about investment processes. Investments can first of all secure for us the fruits of the work of the scientific and technological thought of Armenia. Today the Japanese are successfully selling the "Narine" [as transliterated; not further identified] on the international market. However, this is not the "Narine" purchased from us but one which they have made over and brought up to the requirements of world production standards. We have not been able to achieve this despite the fact that we have received the tens of thousands of dollars due us and the Japanese have offered us cooperation. Intellectual property--these are resources which are not exhausted when sold but augmented. One needs simply to learn the way to enrich them by sale. Today in Armenia there are several score of new technologies of the "Narine" level and several hundreds of technical and technological research and development projects which may interest foreign investors. The first and most important investment program is a program for the creation of a technologies market in Armenia. This program cannot be created by a single step, by a single order or other administrative act. The components of the market must arise and function by stages. The following steps are essential: a) creation of an information bank which will include various kinds of information on research and development projects and inventions being brought about in Armenia that are promising from the technological viewpoint. Use of this bank should require payment. It will make it possible for everyone who is interested to become familiar with a research and development project or technology; b) creation of a small group of 200-300 innovation consultant specialists--the connecting link between the information system and those who need the technologies, their potential customers. A mutual influence of the supply and demand for intellectual property is thus created. This is the basis of the market; c) development of the basic directions of the government's scientific and technical innovation policy. In this case many of those whom the state now finances free of charge as scientific workers will switch to that system of financing which directly serves the creation of new technologies. If there are all these components, there will also be a technologies market and only then will foreign investors be able to carry out investments here.
