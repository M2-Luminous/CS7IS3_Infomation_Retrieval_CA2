FR940617-1-00086 FR940617-1-00012 2. Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions Required testing procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the complete formulation of a health-care antiseptic drug product are included in proposed ยง333.470. These effectiveness testing procedures can also be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of active ingredients not in a final formulation. Suggested safety testing is described in the previous tentative final monograph. (See 43 FR 1210 at 1240 to 1242.) Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of any health-care antiseptic ingredient or condition included in the review by following the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarified April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes procedures for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submitted test data and other information. B. Summary of the Agency's Conclusions Including Changes in the Panel's Recommendations and in the Agency's Previous Recommendations FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and is amending the previous tentative final monograph with the changes described in FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes described in the summary below. A summary of the changes made by the agency in this amended tentative final monograph follows. 1. All of the section numbers for health-care antiseptics in the previous tentative final monograph have been redesignated in this amendment. As a convenience to the reader, the following chart is included to show these redesignations. Redesignated Section Numbers of the Tentative Final Monograph for Antimicrobial Drug Products 1Old section No. 1Section name 1New section No. General Provisions: 333.1 Scope 333.401 333.3 Definitions Active Ingredients 333.403 333.20 Antimicrobial Soap Deleted 333.30 Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation 333.410 333.50 Surgical Hand Scrub Labeling 333.410 333.80 Antimicrobial Soap Deleted 333.85 Health-Care Personnel Handwash 333.455 333.87 Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation 333.460 333.97 Surgical Hand Scrub 333.465 333.99 Professional Labeling Deleted In addition, a number of format changes have been made that are consistent with the format used in recently published tentative final and final monographs. 2. The agency is proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general statement of identity for the product categories of patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care personnel handwash drug products. The agency is also providing manufacturers the option to provide alternative statements of identity describing only the specific intended use of the product, e.g., surgical hand scrub. When the term ``antiseptic'' is used as the only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use product, the intended use(s) is to be included as part of the indications. For multiple use products the agency proposes that a statement of the intended use(s) should also precede the specific directions for each use. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 3. The agency is proposing that the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' may also be used for a health-care personnel handwash. The agency is proposing to expand the indications proposed for health-care personnel handwash drug products in the previous tentative final monograph to read, ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'') The agency is also proposing ``recommended for repeated use'' as another allowable indication for this product class. (See section I.B., comment 5.) 4. The agency has replaced the previously proposed definition of an antimicrobial (active) ingredient with a definition of an ``antiseptic'' drug that is consistent with the definition of an antiseptic in section 201(o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)). The agency is also including a definition for a health-care antiseptic as follows: ``An antiseptic containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help prevent infection or to help prevent cross contamination.'' The agency has also proposed revised definitions for patient preoperative skin preparations and surgical hand scrubs that reflect the agency's proposed effectiveness criteria for these products. (See section I.N., comment 28.) In addition, the agency has made minor revisions in the definitions of a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub to reflect the revised terminology being used in this amended tentative final monograph. 5. The agency is adding to this amended tentative final monograph a definition of broad spectrum activity as follows: A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro activity against the micro-organisms listed in ยง333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration determinations conducted according to methodology established in ยง333.470(a)(1)(ii). The agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included in this tentative final monograph. (See section I.C, comment 6.)
