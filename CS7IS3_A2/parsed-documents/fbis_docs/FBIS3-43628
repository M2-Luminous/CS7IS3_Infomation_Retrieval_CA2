In a statement signed by the secretary general, Mr. J. Agyenim Boateng, the NPP expressed concern at the ever-worsening relations between Ghana and Togo. It said the Aflao-Lome border bombing incident is only one of the lingering and mutually suspicious lines of hostilities that have characterized the relations between the two sides since the 1960's. The party therefore urged the government to take immediate steps to arrest this unfortunate trend and restore peace, normalcy, mutual respect, and trust between Ghana and Togo.
