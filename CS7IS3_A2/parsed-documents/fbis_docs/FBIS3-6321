"The three sides could not reach an agreement," said Shigeru Goda, chairman of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan, at a regular press conference. Japan and Europe have been asking South Korea to voluntarily reduce its shipbuilding capacity which has strengthened noticeably this year since the abolition in late 1993 of a South Korean law restricting the growth of shipbuilding capacity. The South Korean shipbuilding industry has become even more conspicuous as the competitiveness of Japanese shipbuilders has declined with the appreciation of the Japanese currency. Goda said that during the Japan-South Korea, and Japan-South Korea-Europe talks held from March 12 to 14, Japanese and European officials said the global shipbuilding industry would be able to meet future demand at the current level of shipbuilding capacity. They pointed to the danger of excess shipbuilding capacity leading to lower prices and an eventual slump in the industry, Goda said. South Korea responded that their government is pursuing a policy of easing restrictions, and that they have no intention of extending their share of the market by cheaper prices, Goda said. In 1993, South Korea surpassed Japan to become the world's largest shipbuilder, with orders totaling 9.52 million tons.
