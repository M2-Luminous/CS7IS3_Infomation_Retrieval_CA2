ODS Deputy Richard Mandelik said in the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY today that the views of a group of about 11 ODS deputies differ considerably from those of the rest of the deputies, especially regarding their attitude to the Jewish property restitutions and the Senate issue. He also said that Klaus had allegedly not objected to the "conservative wing." "I believe that he, too, prefers conservatism to liberalism," Mandelik said. Petr Kohacek, another ODS deputy, today resolutely rejected Mandelik's statement. He said that although the discussion on every issue usually begins in the ODS deputies' group with the presentation of different and often opposite views, after a time it results in a joint stand. The chairman of the ODS deputies' group, Jiri Honajzer, in an interview with CTK today, expressed surprise over Mandelik's allegation. He said he did not believe that the appearance of party factions, which is usual in large parties in Western Europe and elsewhere in the world, was something tragic or bad. It is normal, natural, and legitimate he said that within the ODS deputies' club, which with its more than 60 members is the largest group in parliament, all the questions took more time to be discussed than in other clubs. He said there were many strong politicians with different views in the group and their views should not necessarily always be identical.
