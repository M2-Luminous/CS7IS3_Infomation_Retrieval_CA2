The Legislative Council [Legco] last night voted 23-18 against the Liberal Party's proposal calling on the government to consider further funding on top of the $60.3 billion it has already offered China for the $158 billion project. Legislators also failed to reach consensus on calls for the government to submit its fourth airport financing package to Legco for approval. But there was cross-party support for an early resolution of the airport funding row, which could delay completion of Chek Lap Kok Airport until after 1997. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said it was too early to preempt China's decision by offering more funds. "Would the taxpayer think it is in his best interest?" he said. "We need to strike a sensible balance. The need now is to get on with talks on the fourth financing proposal." British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials have been meeting to discuss the funding package. But Sir Hamish said they did not expect the long-awaited meeting of the Sino-British airport committee to take place for some time. He said China was still seeking details of the financing package before making a final decision. Sources say the government is willing to inject more equity into the airport in order to reach agreement with China. Liberal Party legislator Steven Poon said an early agreement was vital for Hong Kong's future and the government should not delay by arguing over equity injection. Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said Hong Kong was losing billions of dollars because flights were being turned away from the overcrowded Kai Tak airport. With the government estimating that Hong Kong's reserves will reach $120 billion by March 1997, Mr Poon said it could easily afford more money for the airport. But the United Democrats opposed the move and called on legislators to condemn both the British and Chinese Governments for turning the airport into a political issue. Meeting Point legislator Fred Li said both Britain and China were embroiled in political wrangling, ignoring the views of Hong Kong people. His motion, which called on the government to submit its funding plan for public debate through Legco, was defeated by a narrow margin when council president John Swaine had to cast the deciding vote.
