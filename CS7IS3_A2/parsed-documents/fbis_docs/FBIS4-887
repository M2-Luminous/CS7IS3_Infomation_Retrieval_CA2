Moreover, the 50 people who were taken in for questioning in Niamey have been released. However, the opposition leaders are still in prison. The National Movement for the Society of DevelopmenT, the former single party, is quite determined to try to have them released at any cost. Listen to what one of its leaders, Hama Amadou, had to say on the subject. He spoke to Chantal Lorho: [Begin recording] [Amadou] The various grassroot structures are mobilizing and, really, if our leaders are not released, there may be some really hot days over the next few days. [Lorho] Does this mean that you are going to call for demonstrations in the streets? [Amadou] Absolutely. [Lorho] Have you already set a precise calendar for your actions? [Amadou] Well, when the time comes, everyone will be informed about what will happen. [Lorho] When will that be? [Amadou] Very soon. [Lorho] May I ask you why you are in Ouagadougou? [Amadou] For a particular mission in the framework of the party, but it has nothing to do with what the authorities in Niamey are saying. [Lorho] That is? [Amadou, laughing] That I have fled and that I have gone to recruit mercenaries. [Lorho] Is this what the government in Niamey is saying? [Amadou] Absolutely, and I find this totally ridiculous. We have always carried out our actions within the framework of the normal workings of democracy, not by recruiting mercenaries or killing anyone. [end recording]
