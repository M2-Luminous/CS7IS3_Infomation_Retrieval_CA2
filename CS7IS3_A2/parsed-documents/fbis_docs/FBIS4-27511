So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, in a talk with compatriots of the Fukuyama branch of Chongnyon in Hiroshima prefecture on May 18 said the ulterior intention of the unreasonable search of the Osaka prefectural organisation of Chongnyon by Japanese police on the pretext of "forcible obstruction to business" was to destroy the organisation and activity of Chongnyon. Kim Hwa-hyo, vice-chairman of the Association of Korean Social Scientists in Japan, in a lecture on May 14 branded the police search as a deliberate and premeditated political repression. Koreans under the Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, representatives of the Gifu and Mie prefectural headquarters of the League of Korean Youth in Japan and teachers and students of the Tohoku Korean Primary, Junior and Senior Middle School joined the protests of the officials and compatriots under the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon. Japanese people expressed solidarity with the struggle of Koreans in Japan. Saichiro Uesugi, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Buraku Liberation League in Tokyo, expressed deep concern over the crackdown on Chongnyon organisation by Japanese police and vowed to strive for a solution to this incident. Den Araki, vice chairman of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party, said his party would firmly solidarize with Chongnyon and counter the anti-Chongnyon campaign.
