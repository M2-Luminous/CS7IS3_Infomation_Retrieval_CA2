In a letter addressed today to Clinton and released by the Presidency Public Relations Office, De Leon said that he has ordered turning the PAC, which operate in areas that are no longer indispensable, into "Peace and Development Committees." The patrols, which consist of civilians whom the Army equips and controls, were created during the defacto government of General Efrain Rios Montt (1982-83) to fight the guerrillas in the interior. These groups, made up mostly of Indians, have been accused by national and international humanitarian organizations of committing abuses against the indigenous population, which is why they have demanded that the government dissolve them. General Mario Enriquez, Guatemalan defense minister, has recognized that the Army has some 520,000 patrolmen in various parts of the country, supporting 40,000 soldiers of the Armed Forces. In the letter, de Leon also tells Clinton of the "first big objective" of his agenda, which is to consolidate democracy and the state of law "as a part of political order," for which he appreciates the "support and permanent backing of the United States." For it, he says, there is a commitment to respect human rights and the multicultural reality of the country, to fight impunity and corruption, to promote decentralization, and to promote the people's participation. He also informed him of the recommendations by Christian Tomuschat, an expert UN human rights adviser, which have been fulfilled, such as the restructuring of the presidential general staff, a military group that was also accused of serious abuses and telephone espionage.
