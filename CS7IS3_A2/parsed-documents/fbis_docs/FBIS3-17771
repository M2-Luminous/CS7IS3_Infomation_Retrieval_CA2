But then the atmosphere here too clouded over thanks to the Washington leaders of the "civilized society," who contrived to start a quarrel with both China and Japan at once. Now Clinton's "third front" in the Pacific is becoming apparent -- the DPRK. It is a small state in terms of its potential and cannot, of course, be compared with the two aforementioned very influential Asian and world powers but, on the other hand, the acuteness of the conflict here is far greater: Whereas in the first two cases we are talking of an economic war, in the third the rattling of sabers can be heard. On 21 March IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Director General Blix declared that his agency was not demanding sanctions against the DPRK and that it did not possess any proof that North Korea had violated an international regulation in the sphere of nuclear technologies. But Clinton, as though wishing at all costs to outdo everyone, including both the IAEA and the United Nations, hastened to accounce that very day that he had already made the decision to station Patriot missile systems in South Korea. But what, in fact, started it all? The Korean "nuclear crisis" seemed to have been settled three weeks ago. A kind of diplomatic deal had been concluded between official representatives of the DPRK and the United States under whose terms the DPRK was to admit IAEA inspectors to its nuclear installations in "exchange" for the U.S. abandonment of the Team Spirit maneuvers in South Korea and of the stationing of its missiles there and, in addition, for consent to hold top-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang in Geneva. As for the DPRK, a group of international experts received the appropriate visas and inspected all seven of North Korea's stipulated nuclear installations 1 through 15 March. The inspectors discovered nothing untoward attesting to the military thrust of research. A slight argument with recriminations did, however, occur: The North Korean side reckoned that the IAEA experts had committed a number of violations of their previously stipulated inspection methods. But the experts reckoned for their part that they had not been granted sufficient opportunities to take samples at one of the seven installations -- the radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon. Who is more right here? Let us assume it is the IAEA inspectors. This would mean that the DPRK fulfilled its pledges in the deal with the United States not 100 percent but only 99 percent. Or maybe even just 85 or 75 percent. But what of the United States? It did not fulfill its pledges. It canceled the talks in Geneva, Team Spirit will very soon make the Korean Peninsula resound with the clank of caterpillar tracks and the explosion of shells, and they are threatening to deploy the Patriots even in April. And Russia signs nuclear disarmament agreements with such a partner? It is totally absurd that the world press at once, as though on a command, began demonizing not the United States but the DPRK, portraying it as a rogue and disturber of the peace. Not, alas, without the complicity of the Russian mass media. China's position is characterized by soundness, clarity, and prudence. As a state which has signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, State Council Premier Li Peng declared at a news conference in Beijing 22 March, the PRC does not support or encourage their proliferation. China constantly advocates resolving the question of a nuclear inspection in the DPRK by means of talks and does not approve of the use of pressure. Because not only will this not help to resolve the question, it will merely complicate and exacerbate the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The positions of Russia and Japan are not clear. Will the former venture to demonstrate independence, as happened recently in respect of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is the latter aware that, if the transoceanic "cowboy" is permitted to make such a commotion in Korea, his "lasso" will tighten itself primarily around Japan's own body?
