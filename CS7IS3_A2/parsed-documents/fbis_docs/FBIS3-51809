The workers from radio stations CMKS, "Radio Trinchera Anti-Imperialista," and (CMDX, "La Voz del Toa"), in the important area city of Baracoa, will spend several days doing work in support of the food program in order to contribute to furthering the planting plan of some 25 caballerias of tomatoes. Prior to this, the jury for the event reflected upon and analyzed more than 50 works of various kinds. The best programs, documentaries, news reports, reportages, and other works from among these will win prizes.

These studios will be inaugurated at the end of this month.
