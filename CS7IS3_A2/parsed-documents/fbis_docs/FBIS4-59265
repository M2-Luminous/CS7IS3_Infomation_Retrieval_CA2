Do you share this cautious pessimism? [Rabinovich] I would not necessarily use the pessimistic language used here, in Washington, on the eve of the visit. Lowering expectations in advance of trips by senior U.S. statesmen to enable them to deal with the issues on the agenda free of pressure for immediate achievements is a known pattern. [Golan] Did Secretary of State Christopher voice any reservations whatsoever about the Israeli package? In the meetings you held with him and his peace team this week, did you equip him with different or new ideas to present in Damascus? [Rabinovich] The U.S. side had no reservations about the Israeli package, I do not know what such reports are based on. [Golan] Did he approve of the Israeli package? [Rabinovich] No new ideas were required in the wake of our discussions with the Americans this week. We presented our so-called package to the secretary of state in his previous visit. He relayed his impressions [as heard] to the Syrian side and came back with reactions and counterproposals. We clearly do not plan to go into any bargaining at this point. First of all, we want to make sure that the Syrians fully realize that we are talking about a comprehensive package in which every element is part of a whole complex and that a specific issue cannot be singled out. This is the package, and its principles are nonnegotiable.
