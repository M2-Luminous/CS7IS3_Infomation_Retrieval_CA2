ACTION: Suspension of investigations and cancellation of hearing. SUMMARY: On August 19, 1994, the Department of Commerce suspended its antidumping investigations on color negative photographic paper (CNPP) and certain chemical components from Japan and the Netherlands. The basis for the suspension is an agreement by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Konica Corp., and Fuji Photo Film B.V., exporters which account for substantially all of the imports of these products from Japan and the Netherlands, to revise their prices to eliminate completely any amount by which the foreign market value of their merchandise exceeds the United States price of the subject merchandise. Accordingly, the United States International Trade Commission gives notice of the suspension of its antidumping investigations involving imports from Japan and the Netherlands of CNPP and certain chemical components. CNPP is provided for in subheadings 3703.10.30 and 3703.20.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS); emulsions are provided for in subheadings 3707.10.00 and 3707.90.30 of the HTS; couplers and coupler dispersions are provided for in HTS subheadings 3707.90.30, 3707.90.60, 2933.19.30, 2933.90.25, and 2934.90.20. The Commission also gives notice of the cancellation of the hearing scheduled in connection with these investigations for August 23, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 19, 1994.
