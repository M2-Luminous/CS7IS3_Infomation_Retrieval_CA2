Salgado contends the amendments are being promoted as a result of pressure from abroad. Salgado, a political analyst, announced his support for the president of the Supreme Court of Justice, who has already voiced his opposition to the constitutional reforms about to be passed by the Legislative Assembly. The reforms call for partial changes to the functions and characteristics of governmental bodies such as the Supreme Court of Justice. [Begin Salgado recording] The Legislative Assembly is about to make the same mistake it made in 1991. Hastily, and because of international pressure, it plans to reform laws -- our Constitution -- while disregarding Salvadoran interests. It will yield to foreign pressure and play the game of the hegemonic power that governs us. [end recording] Salgado argues that the deputies are making mistakes by heeding guidelines from the United Nations, hastily approving reforms, and ignoring the true needs of the people. [Begin Salgado recording] I think it is the Salvadorans who must make our decisions, whether good or bad. The problem in El Salvador is that we have to live with decisions adopted not by the Salvadoran people but by a foreign embassy. [end recording] Salgado has been a bitter critic of the U.S.-promoted constitutional reforms that will completely change El Salvador's justice system.
