Delcroix was asked about the general's departure by Pierre Scharff of the PSC [Social Christian Party], Hubert Van Wambeke of the CVP [Christian People's Party], Francis Vermeiren of the VLD [Flemish Liberals and Democrats], and Claude Bougard of Ecolo [French-speaking Green Party]. The minister made use of the opportunity to heap praise on this "unusual general who listens to the people, who is not out looking for war, and who does not allow himself to be led by personal ambitions." "Briquemont was driven in Sarajevo by a personal concern to prevent bloodshed," said Delcroix. "He rightly refused to resign himself to the senseless tragedy that was taking place around him." In saying these words, the minister took out an article from the OSLOBODENJE, the last newspaper in Sarajevo, praising the general. "General Briquemont has not neglected to alert the outside world and international organizations to the weak points of their intervention," continued the minister. He then said that Briquemont "had not seen much" of the additional 4,000 troops that had been promised months ago. Delcroix reported how Briquemont had told him he intended to write a book about his experience in Sarajevo, entitled "Do Something General." That was the message delivered by "the various diplomats who sometimes came to visit him." The minister then subtly added that "the military must be given precise orders to be able to function properly." Delcroix decided that he has no regrets about letting the general speak his mind freely. Once again he showed understanding for "the physical exhaustion and mental fatigue" of someone "who, in seven months never had a substantial night's rest, continually had to negotiate with unreliable dialogue partners, and also had to lead an army under the most difficult circumstances."
