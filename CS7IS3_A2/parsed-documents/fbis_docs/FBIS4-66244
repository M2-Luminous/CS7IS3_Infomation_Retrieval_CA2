Some cadres and people believe that developing the economy is hard and practical and developing the spiritual civilization is soft and empty. So, they lack a strong sense of urgency toward developing the spiritual civilization. Some comrades believe that with the whole party taking development of the economy as its core, development of the spiritual civilization should "clear out and make way." If we only do a good job on the economy, we can "cover 100 uglies with one pretty," and development of the spiritual civilization will automatically come up. In the vast majority of enterprises, factory head and secretary are shouldered by the same person and he has no time to attend to the development of the spiritual civilization. In quite a few enterprises, the full-time assistant secretary is the main person responsible for running the factory or is concurrently chief of the political work section, carrying little weight. This causes the occurrence of "the factory head does not have the energy and the secretary does not have the authority; the factory head is not in position and the secretary is afraid to exceed his position" in enterprise political ideology, and the development of spiritual civilization is an "empty portfolio." It is said from the ranks of the political workers themselves that in the great tide of the market economy, some comrades mistakenly believe that now is the "spring of economic work and the fall of political ideological work." They say that "ten years of supply and marketing makes one wealthy, ten years of science and technology makes one highly skilled, and ten years of political work is all in vain" and "a basket of great principles is not equal to a single great solidarity." They have a losing feeling, a feeling of self-pity, and a feeling of crisis about developing the spiritual civilization. A few comrades have the one-sided understanding that "if one has a ticket he gets a seat and if one does not have a ticket, he gives up his seat." They think with all there heart about leaving their political work position and changing jobs to struggle for money. The second thing is not knowing how to do the work. Some grassroots party organizations are not clear on the details of enhancing the spiritual civilization in the market economy. They generally feel that they "cannot use the old way, they do not know how to use the new way, and they dare not use the reckless way." The thinking of some comrades remains in the old set patterns of the planned economy. They are set in their old ways and are not apt to learn to change to a new situation. In their work they only go by the book and by their superiors and not by practice. They indiscriminately copy and indiscriminately go by the convention, copying mechanically and weakening the attraction of political ideological work. The third thing is that they lack the ticket for input. Only if one has input does he have output. The spiritual civilization also is this way. The present soaring development of the economy is incompatible with ideology and culture. Quite a few units do not have a place for recreational and sports activities, they do not have a book and newspaper reading area, and a few units have even squeezed out the "grassroots party school" and the "staff and workers house," and have relaxed the ideological education outside the eight hours. There are some units that although they have an activity area, do not organize activities and it is in name only. The fourth thing is that the evaluation lacks standards. Achievement in developing the spiritual civilization can not be measured in figures like achievement in economic development. Development of the spiritual civilization has its abstract nature. Even though there are testing norms, they start with the hardware of developing the spiritual civilization. This time we investigated some grassroots party committees and discovered that not one had established a relatively complete inspection, comparative appraisal, and testing system for developing the spiritual civilization. A leader in a certain department said that now from top to bottom everyone is shouting, "Grasp with both hands, be firm with both hands." At what level do leaders truly manage to do solid work in developing the spiritual civilization? They just clamor, they do not establish a model. A certificate of responsibility is signed for economic work, a certificate of responsibility is signed for environmental protection, and a certificate of responsibility is signed for public security, but no department or system has signed a certificate of responsibility for developing the spiritual civilization. Testing lacks standards and lacks binding mechanisms. Responsibility for evaluation does not truly fit into the scope of the responsibility of the position of anyone in charge of any level of the party or government.
