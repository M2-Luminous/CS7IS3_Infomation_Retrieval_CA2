Enriquez Morales, who participated in the Peace Commission for two years, said the talks have always had this objective as their sole purpose and that the Truth Commission, which he called "the vengeance commission," would only polarize society further. He added: The formation of this commission has always been opposed, and I will tell you why. We object to it because it will attempt to open the wounds of events that occurred in 1980, 1981, and 1982, and this would not help the country at all but, quite the contrary, would promote confrontation. The defense minister concluded: We would accept the formation of a commission, but of real truth and not the one you formed because, in this case, the actions are aimed against the Army and the government in general, because the clandestine guerrilla would not be identifiable.
