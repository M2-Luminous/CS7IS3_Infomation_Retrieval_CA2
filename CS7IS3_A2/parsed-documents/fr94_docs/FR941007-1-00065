FR941007-1-00065 FR941007-1-00009 These principles would be implemented through the process described in paragraph (b) of Appendix A for assigning a rating for retail institutions assessed under the lending, service and investment tests. Points would be assigned to an institution's performance on each of the underlying tests. The total number of points would determine the composite rating, unless the total exceeds twice the number of points attributable to the institution's performance under the lending test. In that case, the composite rating would be determined using twice the number of points attributable to the institution's lending performance to ensure that lending performance accounts for at least 50 percent of the overall rating. Small institutions, wholesale or limited purpose institutions, or institutions with an approved strategic plan would be rated as described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of Appendix A. As in the December proposal, the revised proposal would require the agencies to adjust ratings for all institutions, regardless of the method of CRA evaluation, to take evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices into consideration. In addition, the revised proposal, as in December's proposal, provides that an institution that otherwise would receive a needs to improve rating would be rated in substantial noncompliance if it received no better than a needs to improve rating on each of its two previous examinations. Lending Discrimination Under the December proposal, an institution would presumptively have received a final CRA rating of less than satisfactory if the institution (1) committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination of which it had knowledge that it had not corrected fully or was not in the process of correcting fully or (2) engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination that it had not corrected fully. The presumption could have been rebutted in the case of technical or de minimis violations, for example, if an institution violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by offering a preferential credit program for individuals over age 55 (rather than limiting the program to individuals over age 62 as the law requires). Many community and consumer groups criticized this proposal as a retreat from current practice. They pointed out that the existing regulation provides that the agencies will consider any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices. Although the agencies did not intend in the December proposal to reduce the weight given evidence of illegal discrimination in the CRA evaluation process, they believe that the commenters' concerns should be addressed. The revised proposal conforms with the language of the existing regulation. Also, the discrimination provisions in the revised proposal would avoid the use of a rebuttable presumption consistent with the elimination of presumptions throughout the proposal. Under the revised proposal, any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices would adversely affect the agencies' evaluation of an institution's CRA rating. In determining the effect on an institution's rating, the agencies would consider the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the institution has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the institution has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the institution's past fair lending performance. There was also some confusion regarding whether the December proposal intended that illegal discrimination would have the same effect for all institutions regardless of the assessment method that they chose. The revised proposal makes clear that evidence of discrimination would be considered in assigning a rating to all banks and thrifts, regardless of whether they were evaluated under the lending, service, and investment tests, the community development test for wholesale or limited purpose banks, the small institution assessment method, or the strategic plan option.
