Standing Committee members present at the meetings examined and discussed six draft laws submitted to the current session for its consideration. While examining and discussing a draft law on foreign trade, most members expressed their opinion that the current draft law is relatively complete because it has gone through revisions. They expressed their belief that it has the characteristic of internationalization; focuses on the implementation of a system for unified foreign trade as well as arousing the enthusiasm of localities; pays attention to encouraging developed areas' foreign trade while stressing the need to support areas inhabited by minority nationalities to develop foreign trade; and embodies the characteristic of looking after the interests of other countries. Therefore, it is conducive to establishing China's international prestige and has very important significance for the reinstatement of China as a signatory to GATT. Members also put forward some opinions concerning revisions during their deliberations. Some members expressed their belief that the current draft law does not adequately reflect the need for deepening the reform of the foreign trade system. Some members said that the centralized management of foreign trade by the central government is not conducive to bringing into play the initiative of localities and enterprises, and that it is necessary to appropriately delegate some powers to them. Some members expressed the hope that a transition from the permit system now in force to a registration system will be completed as quickly as possible. Some members stressed: The law contains more restrictive and prohibitive provisions; it lacks provisions on the development of and a strategy for foreign trade. The law should contain specific provisions on encouragement and development. As for the draft law on compensation by the state, members expressed their belief that the formulation of the law has important significance for China to build its socialist democracy and legal system; to further protect the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens, legal persons, and other organizations; to facilitate the performance of duties by state organs and their working personnel in accordance with the laws; to promote the drive to build a clean and honest government; and to develop a socialist market economy. During deliberations, members also put forward their opinions on revisions of the draft law. Some members pointed out: In the realities of life, some victims claimed there were mistakes in the handling of their cases and demanded compensation, whereas there were many occurrences of organs entrusted with the compensation obligation which claimed that no mistake was made in the handling of such cases; some cases have dragged on for years without a settlement. Therefore, to settle the issue of compensation, we need a just and authoritative arbitration organ to judge the rights and wrongs of a case. Many members expressed different views on the standards of compensation set by the current draft law. They expressed their belief that the standards of compensation are too low and that the standards of computation are unreasonable. Meanwhile, some members maintained that economic compensation should be provided for damage to one's reputation. There were also some members who stressed: The formulation of the law constitutes only one aspect of the work. What is more important is that there must be a practical guarantee for the enforcement of the law after it goes into effect and for the supervision of its enforcement. While examining and discussing a draft resolution on punishing criminal activities that violate the management of companies and enterprises, draft supplemental provisions to the regulations governing penalties for offenses against public security, draft revisions of the regulations on military service by officers on the active list of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] of China, and draft revisions of the regulations on military ranks of PLA officers, most members adopted a positive attitude toward the need to formulate or revise these laws. Meanwhile, they expressed their views and made suggestions on some specific provisions contained in these draft laws.
