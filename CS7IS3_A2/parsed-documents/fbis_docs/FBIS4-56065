"We are not satisfied with the Western countries' way of thinking," Kolodziejczyk told journalists. In the Polish defense minister's opinion, the process of integration with the European Union [EU], the Western European Union [WEU], and NATO should run parallel and not, as the West wants, from EU membership through WEU membership to NATO. "Maybe we should even join the NATO alliance earlier. We have no time," Kolodziejczyk stressed. According to Kolodziejczyk, the idea of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who presented a proposal for a new system of European security at the meeting, a system based on close cooperation between the CSCE and the North Atlantic Council -- must be given some thought. It should not, however, block the Partnership for Peace initiative, the minister said. Kolodziejczyk believes that many international institutions have been ineffective, including the CSCE, as the events in former Yugoslavia have shown.
