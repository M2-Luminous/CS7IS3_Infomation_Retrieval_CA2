Certain leaders did not come, having used the struggle for deputy seats as an excuse. However, they have promised to send their representatives. Aides of certain leaders have also promised to come. But, as is usual with us, we have to wait for the blue moon to see them coming. Did election battles really drain all strength from political organizations up to the last man in the ranks? Or, perhaps, is the very idea of unity of Ukrainian brothers becoming unrealistic during the harsh competition in the electoral districts? Or, perhaps, do atamans' ambitions prevent them from meeting at peace talks? Whatever the reason, one should not lose sight of that undeniable fact that Ukraine approaches the loss of its independence. Wise people learn from others' mistakes. Smart people -- from their own. Who are we: the wise? the smart? Or, have we learnt nothing at all? Maybe, a multiparty system is to blame? This supposition was expressed by Vitaliy Karpenko [VECHERNIY KYYIV editor in chief] for starters. In his opinion, Ukraine has always been ruined by animosity and treachery. It was animosity that did not allow the Supreme Council to legislatively consolidate independence by outlawing all those encroaching upon it. Maybe, were there only Rukh, the question would have been settled? However, according to Levko Lukyanenko [leader of the "Ukrayina" election bloc], the emergence of numerous political organizations is a normal phenomenon. It is enough to remember the compulsory unanimity that holds our entire society in a tight grip. Even in 1988, when the Communist Party officially announced democratization, very few attended the Ukrainian Culture Club [Ukrayinskyy Kulturolohichnyy Klyub]. Later on, as the number of clubs increased, there were still very few who dared to join the Helsinki Committee, because the participants in it were persecuted by the authorities. At the same time, joining the Association of Ukrainian Language did not pose any difficulties. However, there existed a unity at that time. Rukh was born of that unity. The unity was declared by the delegates of Rukh's Constituent Congress. If it has been lost, then what is the reason for that? Are ambitions to blame? However, according to Levko Lukyanenko, the 1991 presidential elections were affected not by ambitions, but by serious program differences. The Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] was for a unitary Ukraine, while Vyacheslav Chornovil -- for a federative one; the URP supported one official language, while Vyacheslav Chornovil was not opposed to two. As a result, both Lukyanenko and Chornovil have lost. The majority of electors voted for Kravchuk who, by the way, was not backed by any party at that time. He was backed only by his real power. Is it a surprise then that splits and discords have become our common characteristics? As the ancients would say: divide et impera. In the meantime, on the turn of 1991-92, democrats were able to pressure the party in power and force quick reforms. However, they did not press. What was the mistake? Yuriy Hnatkevich believes that one mistake is to be afraid of not the large number of parties, but of their fighting one another. "We are united by three ideas -- independence, democracy, and market reforms, whereas the splits have been caused by accents." "Accents," in his opinions, have been laid in the fact that Larysa Skoryk [of National Rukh of Ukraine] staked on "them," believing the nomenklatura to be the most organized force capable of building the state. At the same time, Vyacheslav Chornovil believed it necessary to form an opposition to "them." Life has tested Chornovil's correctness. Today, it seems, there are no disagreements on this issue. Mr. Losiv from the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is even prone to think that there should be no dealings with Communists at all, because it is they who allow party activities on Ukrainian territory, which openly admit that their purpose is to destroy independence. However, this does not relieve democrats of their guilt, either. "Democrats have made many concessions," pointed out Levko Lukyanenko, "and have gotten a peace of stagnation, which threatens Ukraine's independence." The price for this peace was evaluated by Kostyantyn Morozov [former defense minister]. He specified the concessions which should be withdrawn by the most patriotic authorities provided that they win the elections: nonnuclear status, transfer of Black Sea Fleet structures to the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation, Crimean autonomy, the dragging of Ukraine into the so-called economic union and the single ruble zone, transparent borders, two official languages, the loss of Ukraine's own political face on the international arena, censorship and control over the freedom of speech, the lack of unity... A high price. And it was paid not by political divergencies among national democratic forces [as published], but by the situation, in which, after the declaration of Ukraine's independence, the building of statehood was entrusted to the Supreme Council completed in the elections that were organized by the Communist Party of Ukraine. The Communist Party -- in a manner becoming the ruling party -- took care of its worthy representation in the highest legislative body. The party carefully selected its Supreme Council cadres which were apt to defend the state ownership and a single Union as well. After August 1991, these people were given the right to work on the creation of a market economy and to form the Armed Forces of the independent state as well as its military policy. "We know how they have done it," Kostyantyn Morozov stated. "All the governments were working in this channel." Will the elections be a cold shower? The idea of unity seems so simple and evident that ordinary readers, not very familiar with party developments, ask us: Are they going to unite themselves, or not? Therefore, one can agree with Mr. Pawlyuk who stated: "The idea of unity is not dead yet." Ihor Nayda from the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, who sees the situation from the inside due to being an authorized representative of a candidate in one of the Kiev constituencies, does not share the opinion that such a unity is possible just now. But "in principle" -- why not? All the democrats have much in common in their programs and election platforms. These common matters can become a basis for convening a unity congress which would put forward only one presidential candidate representing all national democratic forces. Thus far, such a proposal has not raised anyone's objections. Indeed, the legislative elections may become a cold shower, in which certain party atamans are lacking so badly. Then they could be prompted to a realistic evaluation of themselves and their political abilities. However, for the time being, events are following their own course. The head of the Kiev Regional Organization of the Ukrainian Republican Party, Volodymyr Kuziv, who participated in listing the approved candidates for Kiev city and oblast, acknowledges: "We have already lost a fifth of the votes without even entering the election campaign. Unity is necessary. However, how can one unite something that cannot be united?" It is, perhaps, not incidental that Levko Lukyanenko also emphasized that the democratic bloc "Ukrayina" will not firmly cling to certain candidacies that proved to be very low-level, and to make corrections to avoid failures. Personal ambitions are being abandoned by those who understand the following: If the elections in the majority of Ukraine's constituencies do not choose people's deputies, the party in power will easily introduce a dictatorship. This will be the time to validate the saying by one Ukrainian politician: "Our democrats will be united -- five minutes before the execution."
