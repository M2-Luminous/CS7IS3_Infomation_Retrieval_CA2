He said the documents discussed during talks on the lease agreement in the town of Priozyorsk (where the test ground's personnel live) from 10-13 May were not yet finalized, but the main requirements and terms of the lease had already been established. Abilsiitov said that some of the site's facilities would be leased to the Russian military unit running the site, and that unit would pay rent and make some contribution to the upkeep of Priozyorsk. He also said that the dates and size of the rent and compensation for damage had not been discussed with the site's commander General Anatoliy Tarasov. The vice-premier said that those issues would be dealt with in Almaty with Commander-in-Chief of Russia's Air Defense Forces General-Lieutenant Viktor Prudnikov. Abilsiitov said the lease agreement for Sary-Shagan would differ from the one for Baykonur in that Priozyorsk would remain a fully Kazakh town. A national center for radio-electronics and communications, he said, was currently being set up there, and the ore mining company Balkhash would also finish building an enrichment center and begin to refine gold ores there in July. Abilsiitov pointed out that those organizations would, jointly with the Russian servicemen, be responsible for the town's well-being.
