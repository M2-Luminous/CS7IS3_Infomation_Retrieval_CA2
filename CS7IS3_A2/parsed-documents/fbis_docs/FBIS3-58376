Our correspondent Nacho Hernandez has the story. [Hernandez] Before spring, the Spanish prime minister will have to reassess the presence of the blue helmets sent to Bosnia. A decision that will not be made unilaterally. There are even doubts about whether the UN presence is helping to reach a peace agreement in former Yugoslavia. In Gonzalez's opinion, the NATO decision reached today is a solemn warning to the parties in conflict. [Begin Gonzalez recording] There is a certain feeling of frustration, because the purpose of having forces there is to accomplish certain missions, and objectively the missions are there to benefit the civilian population in all the conflict areas. Consequently, it does not seem tolerable that these forces should be used, hindered, or used as they have sometimes been used, as targets of attack or in a political game in which the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] does not take part. So there is a clear awareness of the fact that they [the parties in conflict] should clearly know that we are ready to defend the UNPROFOR forces in the field. [end recording] [Hernandez] According to Felipe Gonzalez, this summit has clarified the North American attitude toward the conflict in former Yugoslavia. In his opinion, uncertainties about NATO's future have also been cleared up. He said the Partnership for Peace for East European countries is also a message to Russia so that it take part in the global European construction. There is satisfaction on behalf of Spain because the final communique includes references to the importance of stability in the Mediterranean. According to the prime minister, it was very important that NATO make this cooperation effort with the area. [Begin Gonzalez recording] The obsession with trying to consolidate a situation of peace, stability, and democratization in the East does not take up all our energies. For the first time a door is opened to future development of relations with the countries of North Africa, with the Mediterranean area. I think this is a positive development. For us it was interesting, because there were doubts about whether some alliance countries were going to accept this new dimension or not. This possibility now exists, and consequently the Council will study how to carry it out. [end recording]
