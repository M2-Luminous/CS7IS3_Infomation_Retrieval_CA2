Sergeyev rejected accusations of deliberate blocking of the press. He assured journalists that a new press centre, seating 150 reporters, will open in the government's new headquarters in two weeks. He promised to help journalists in arranging interviews with cabinet ministers, but said government presidium meetings were not a show, and will be accessible only to correspondents of federal news agencies and state television. Sergeyev stressed that the government was interested, as never before, in making its decisions, popular or otherwise, known and understandable to the people. He complained that the press was keen on criticising the government and was reluctant to promote educational publications about its activity.
