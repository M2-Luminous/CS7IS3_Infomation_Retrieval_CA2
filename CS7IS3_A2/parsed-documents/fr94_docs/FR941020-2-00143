FR941020-2-00143 FR941020-2-00082 With respect to Columbia Coal, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 40/60. It is proposed that Columbia make a tax-free capital contribution of up to $12 million of Installment Notes previously issued by Columbia Coal and held by Columbia. Sources of funds for the Subsidiaries will include their internal cash flow and Money Pool borrowings. No external sources are projected to be needed to fund their 1995 and 1996 financing programs while Columbia remains in bankruptcy. The Subsidiaries plan to finance part of their capital expenditure programs with funds generated from internal sources and through short-term borrowings from the Money Pool, to the extent Columbia subsidiaries have temporary excess funds, or from the sale to Columbia, for cash, of common stock at par value and Installment Notes up to the specified amounts (in million $$): ␣ 1␣ 1Stock 1Notes 1Total Columbia Kentucky 2.0 12.7 14.7 Columbia Maryland 3.0 5.5 8.5 Columbia Ohio 44.0 91.8 135.8 Columbia Pennsylvania 16.5 33.6 50.1 Commonwealth Services 26.0 16.2 42.2 Columbia Resources 50.0 50.0 Columbia Development 25.0 25.0 50.0 Commonwealth Propane 4.5 4.5 Columbia Gulf 13.0 13.0 Service Corporation 10.0 5.0 15.0 TriStar Capital 0.1 0.1 n,s Total 126.6 257.3 383.9 These amounts allow for contingencies such as higher gas prices, warm weather, amounts of projected tax refunds, amounts of rate refunds and the variability of capital expenditure programs. To the extent that such contingencies do not materialize, the requested financing authorizations will not be fully utilized. The Installment Notes will be unsecured and will be dated the date of their issue. It is proposed that the interest rate on the Installment Notes will be determined quarterly based upon the three-month average yield on newly issued ``A'' rated 25&hyph;30 year utility bonds, per the weekly Bond Market Roundup published by Salomon Brothers, rounded to the nearest 1/8% per annum (``Benchmark Rate''). The Benchmark Rate would be used for all Installment Notes issued in the subsequent quarter. The Benchmark Rate was approved by the Commission by order dated September 30, 1994 (HCAR No. 26062) (``1993 Order''). It is proposed that a default rate equal to 2% per annum in excess of the stated rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts would be assessed if any interest or principal payment becomes past due. The principal amount of the Installment Notes will be repaid over a term not in excess of thirty years. All of the Installment Notes will be purchased by Columbia on or before December 31, 1996.
