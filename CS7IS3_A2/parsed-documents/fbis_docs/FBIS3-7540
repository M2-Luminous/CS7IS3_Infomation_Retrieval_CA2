With 21 of the 25 seats declared in the Legislative Assembly, CIP, led by Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry, held 16, a decline of one compared with the outgoing parliament, while the Democratic Party had three seats and the Alliance two. The Cooks is one of the world's smallest nations, with 18,500 people spread over one of the largest sea areas in the world. The election was coloured by claims in the New Zealand parliament that the Cook Island's status as a tax haven had been abused, to defraud taxpayers and banks internationally. The allegations, strongly denied, were made by New Zealand MP Winston Peters, who also charged that some Cooks politicians had received money in secret bank accounts "to encourage (them)...to sell their sovereignty". A hundred million dollars had been defrauded, he said. For the first time the Cooks had a television station to air the claims and counter-claims, giving the election an air of tension. However veteran local observers said this election was just child's play compared with polls of the 1970s when CIP founder Albert Henry, an uncle of Geoffrey, used money from a US millionaire who had the Cooks' stamp printing franchise, to fly in voters from New Zealand to stuff ballot boxes. Henry won several doubtful elections but was eventually ejected from office in 1978 when found guilty of corruption. Democratic Party leader Sir Tom Davis, a former doctor with the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), took over until 1983 when Geoffrey Henry came to power. Henry, 53, has stamped his personal style on the Cook Islands, and pushed ahead with developing the country's tourist industry with a major airport and building a hotel under the Sheraton badge on Rarotonga, the archipelago's main island. The project has been sharply criticised for gigantic cost overruns and changes of management, as well as a possibly destructive effect on the local environment, threatening a beautiful lagoon. Elections in the Cooks are for a term of five years, conducted on a first past the post basis. Running with the elections were referenda on the length of parliamentary office, whether the country should have a native Maori name, which flag to fly and which national anthem to play.
