Over 1.3 million people have died in this war, more than 3.3 million refugees have left the country. Some 300,000 have found refuge in Uganda. For [Ugandan] President Museveni this is a reason to work out a peace solution for Sudan together with Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The bilateral talks in Muerzsteg [Austria] might have given a new impetus to the IGADD [Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and Development] peace initiative. President Museveni did not release any details about the talks, probably so as not to endanger the dialogue with Sudan. [Begin Museveni recording, in English with superimposed German translation] We have worked out a method to clarify open questions, including a peace settlement for southern Sudan. [end recording] And Sudan's head of state 'Umar al-Bashir adds: [Begin al-Bashir recording, in Arabic with superimposed German translation] In our talks we have agreed to improve relations between Sudan and Uganda and to remove all the obstacles to a peace settlement for southern Sudan. [end recording] On 18 July in Nairobi, the African IGADD states, Sudan, and the warring factions of the southern Sudanese resistance want to meet for fresh negotiations. [Austrian] President Klestil expressed satisfaction with the talks and he said that this proves that in spite of concentrating on the European Union, Austria has maintained a global outlook.
