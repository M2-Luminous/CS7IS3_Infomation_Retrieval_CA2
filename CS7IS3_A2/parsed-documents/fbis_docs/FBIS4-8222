About 10,000 mourners in the southern town of Gjirokaster massed outside the Greek consulate in protest at the reported attack near Peshkopia early Sunday. Another 20,000 attended the second funeral in Siera. Defence Minister Safet Zhulali attended the funeral in Gjirokastra and in a speech hit out at "the Greek Government and the Greek church... conspiring behind our backs". He said Greece which has expressed fears for the safety of the Greek minority in southern Albania "bears full responsibility for these acts which will be punished if they are repeated". Albanian officials said officer Fatmir Shehu of Gjirokaster and conscript Arsen Gjini of Siera were killed and several other soldiers wounded when a Greek commando crossed the border at night and attacked the training camp. The Greeks allegedly opened fire on the sleeping soldiers. Zhulali dismissed Greek calls for incorporation into Greece of the Greek-populated area of southern Albania which Athens refers to as Northern Epirus. "Northern Epirus does not exist and never existed," he said. The Albanian Government, in a communique Monday, said Sunday's attack was a "direct attack on Albanian sovereignty and territorial integrity". Albania reserved the right to "take all necessary steps to respond to this policy of provocation", the statement said.
