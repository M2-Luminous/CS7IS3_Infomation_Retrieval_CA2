Ambassador Jardo Muecalia added that the international community should not allow South African or any other mercenaries to place under threat whatever successes may already have been scored in the Zambian capital. That UNITA official's statement comes in the wake of an announcement by an African National Congress, ANC, official confirming the involvement of South African Defense Force soldiers in the Angolan civil war. That ANC official also voiced concern about that problem.
