Gutirrez Santos, who is 58 years old, is on probation after spending eight months in prison for charges of spreading "enemy propaganda." His sentence is still pending. The activist showed foreign journalists the invitation sent to him by the International Conference of Free Trade Union Organizations (CIOSL), which is headquartered in Brussels, to participate in a forum on human and labor rights to be held next week. The Belgian Government informed CIOSL that it would grant a visa to Gutirrez Santos but Cuban authorities have refused to renew his passport and to grant him a corresponding departure permit, Gutirrez Santos said. Gutirrez Santos was an electromechanical operator in the port of Havana and a leader of a regional merchant marine union, which is affiliated with the Cuban Workers Federation until 1992 when he was expelled from the union for his opposition activities. He was also fired from his job at that time.
