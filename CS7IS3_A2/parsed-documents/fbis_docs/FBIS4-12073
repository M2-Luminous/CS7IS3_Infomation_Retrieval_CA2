His excellency described this meeting as cordial. In an exclusive statement to the Omani News Agency, his excellency Bin-'Abdallah said that after the tripartite meeting, a closed meeting was held between the Yemeni president and his deputy. He said that from a personal perspective, the meeting between the two sides was cordial, warm, and friendly. It seems, he added, that during the closed meeting, the two sides agreed on some principles that they believe to be necessary to prevent any military confrontations or a civil war in Yemen. They entrusted a committee from the two sides with drafting a statement that expresses this orientation and these principles. However, for reasons that we do not known, but which could be related to the stands of the three major parties, in view of the known differences already declared by all parties to the Yemeni crisis, members of the two sides could not agree on issuing such a statement during their meeting this morning. In his statement, his excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs added that, in light of the lack of agreement between the commands of the Yemeni parties, despite the orientation of the president and his deputy to evade the disasters of the crisis, it seems that the commands of the parties have not reached an agreement yet, especially regarding the military issues. In this regard, his excellency said: In the Sultanate of Oman, we hope that contacts between the parties to the Yemeni crisis will continue through Yemeni initiatives. The minister of state for foreign affairs said: In light of this situation, we should hold consultations with our brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to end our participation in the joint military committee under these circumstances in which the committee cannot assume its role with regard to the remaining minutes and meetings. His excellency added: This is caused by the contradiction in the political stands among the parties to the Yemeni crisis, particularly the three major parties. His excellency said: If no political progress is achieved among the major parties, the military committee will not be able to work, and consequently, consultations with the Jordanian side is necessary. His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs noted that the brothers in Yemen should rely on their political efforts first and must take into consideration the circumstances in this difficult phase, the level of responsibility, and the size of tragedies if, God forbids, the crisis develops contrary to the interests of Yemen. His excellency stressed that his majesty the sultan was very concerned during this meeting to help Yemen overcome this crisis, or at least, achieve a breakthrough. The minister said: I can say that a breakthrough on the personal level between the president and the vice president has occurred. However, he added, the breakthrough on the level of the three party leaderships needs time and determination to overcome this obstacle. His excellency expressed his belief that the endeavor should be Yemeni-Yemeni first and that the party leaders must be able to follow the sound path, forget difficulties, and give up their conflicting demands because it will be difficult to achieve any progress on any political track.
