The appeal called on them not to pick up any of these items wherever they may be found. The following is the text of the appeal: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The one who betrays his country cannot appreciate others because he lacks all feelings of citizenship in both heart and mind. Likewise, the one who plots to fragment his country will not hesitate to send all the sons of the country to the crematorium of death and annihilation. Every criminal who commits such crimes will not hesitate to perpetrate the ugliest of crimes toward others, be they men, women, youths, elderly, or children. Thus, the mania of crime and grudge led traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the initiator of war and killer of children and women, to cherish the idea of killing children with trickery and cheap games in a bid to distort the citizens' feelings toward the future of the homeland. As for their present, unity has triumphed to the point of no return. The immortal existence of unity has been baptized for ever by the sacrifices of the brave heroes of the Armed and Security Forces. Otherwise, what is the meaning of criminal al-Bid's distribution of booby-trapped pens, toys, and watches in Aden streets and suburbs so that children can pick them up and get blown up under the claim that the one who distributed them and dropped them from planes are the forces of unity and legitimacy? They will then portray those victimized children to the world public as victims of the missiles which they falsely claim the forces of unity and protection of legitimacy are using to shell the city suburbs. It is easy to tell such lies and make such fabrications before us and the world. They are cheap lies about an ugly crime of killing children in such a vile and cowardly manner. While revealing this bitter fact about the latest innovation of the criminal secessionists, we appeal to fathers and mothers and all citizens in the suburbs of the city of Aden--in (Kiraytar), al-Mu'alla, al-Tawwahi, (Hawr Makthar), al-Shaykh 'Uthman, al-Qallu'ah, al-Burayqah, al-Mansurah, al-Sha'b city, and other suburbs--to prevent children from picking up any pens, watches, toys, or housewares from the streets in front of their houses so that their lives will be saved and no distortions be sustained. As for the criminal secessionist butchers, they will sooner or later receive their punishment. Our people will never be deceived by all their criminal methods and vile, treacherous actions. Tomorrow is close at hand for all to see.
