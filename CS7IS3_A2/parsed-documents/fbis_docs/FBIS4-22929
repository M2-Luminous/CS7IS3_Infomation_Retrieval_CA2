In opening the discussion, Head Minister Boris Saltykov stressed that the basic goal of State policy in the area of science and engineering is to retain the best part of the scientific-technical potential of Russia under conditions of economic collapse. Boris Saltykov bitterly noted that all last year, due to the lack of adequate funding, scientists had to think about holding on to science rather than development. However, we managed to do quite a bit even under these difficult conditions. Forty one State scientific-technical programs were set up and put into operation. Proposals have been prepared on implementing 117 priority technologies and new kinds of goods within the scope of State structural policy. Funding has been obtained for 33 State science centers, which has enabled retention of leading science schools in the high-tech field. As one of the foremost among the republics of the former Soviet Union, Russia has been first to enter as a full-fledged member into the European technological program ``Eureka.'' An intergovernmental agreement has been concluded on scientific-technical cooperation with the United States. International scientific-technical cooperation of Russia has enabled continuation of many research projects in the field of high-energy physics, the human genome and genetic engineering, and promising information technologies. However, the speakers noted that the situation in science and technology is getting tenser. As before, science is being funded by the month, and by leftovers. For example, last year science organizations were underfunded by about 300 billion rubles. Numbers of science personnel are also diminishing, both because of the outflow of scientists to the private sector, and because of the ``brain drain'' abroad. The best people are leaving. The prestige of work in science has waned, there is a reduction in the percentage of graduates from institutions of higher education that train science personnel, schools of science and whole disciplines are breaking up. There has been a sharp reduction in volume of agreements between enterprises and science organizations, the construction of science projects has been curtailed, unique structures are falling into disrepair. The breaking of ties between organizations of the former Soviet republics is having an enormous detrimental impact on the development of science. Lack of cash is decelerating and downscaling international cooperation. <graphic> </graphic>
