The outbreak is a potential threat to the multi-million-dollar poultry and ostrich export trade, if left uncontrolled. The Department of Veterinary Services has mounted roadblocks on all roads out of Sengwe and Matibi Two and vehicles are being searched to ensure they are not carrying chickens, chicken meat, eggs or chicken cages. Dr. Stuart Hargreaves, the director of veterinary services, said in an interview yesterday that the outbreak, the first in eight years, was reported on Christmas Eve and roadblocks were mounted immediately. A veterinary team, comprising 50 vaccinators, had been deployed and had so far vaccinated over 70,000 chickens in the communal areas. The exercise is expected to be completed this week in the most affected areas and could last for a month in the surrounding areas, where surveillance had been intensified. The outbreak is still confined to the estimated 200,000 village birds in the two districts which are very far from commercial poultry production areas. Zimbabwe has an estimated population of between 15 and 30 million village birds. The disease is believed to have spread from South Africa, which had reported large numbers of outbreaks recently. People crossing into Zimbabwe, from Vendaland, which is adjacent to Sengwe, could have brought chickens affected with the disease. South Africa's Newcastle outbreak covered most of the Transvaal in December last year, and later moved into parts of the Orange Free State and Northern Natal, with some mortalities in some incorrectly vaccinated flocks as high as 30 percent. Large-scale poultry producers, due to these developments in South Africa, had since formulated an effective monitoring programme for day-old chick producers to enable them, if necessary, to accurately assess the disease status of their flocks and prevent the spread.
