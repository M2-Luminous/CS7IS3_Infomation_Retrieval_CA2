He made a stinging attack on the Community and urged business leaders to look to the faster growing economies in the Far East where they faced less restrictions. Lord Young, who chided the Institute for its criticism of the EC when he was Trade and Industry Secretary in Lady Thatcher's second administration, asked his audience of 2,800 businessmen: "What are we doing in the European Union?" He added: "Largely, I suggest, wasting our time in inward looking arguments about lost causes, causes like single currencies and various forms of political union. Fiddling while the Treaty of Rome burns." Lord Young was pessimistic about the next inter-governmental conference on the EC producing a "bonfire of directives" or taking "an axe to the institutions of the Union." It was more likely to give more power to bureaucrats in Brussels, reduce democracy by extending qualified majority voting and end up ensuring that the "good Brussels principle of equal misery, otherwise known as harmonisation should be spread across the entire Union." He added: "We should be examining the work of the Commission and the European parliament. This is probably our last chance to wake up before the world passes us by." The number of unemployed in Europe now represented the "sixth largest state in the union." Lord Young said: "As their number rises, so rises all the social tensions that we have seen in Germany and France the very self-same tensions, fattened on a diet of unemployment that Hitler and his like exploited so well some 60 years ago." "As a result the greatest growth industry in Europe are the parties of the extreme, whether of the Left or the Right." He said the futile arguments over Europe were dividing Britain. "With our obsession with Europe we see only the stagnation and lack of will of our partners in the Union." He said companies should turn their attention to the fast growing economies of China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. By the turn of the century there would be 50 million Asian households with an income of $30,000.
