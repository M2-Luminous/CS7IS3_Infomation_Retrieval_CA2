Malyenko; place and date not given: "Program Priorities"] [Text] Preparation of the Ukrainian Program for Development of the Mining and Metallurgical Complex Up to 2010 has been completed. The PRAVDA UKRAINY editorial office requested Deputy Minister Valentin Kulychenko to talk about its principal points and evaluate the situation that is forming in the branch. [Malyenko] Valentin Arsenyevich, quite a few programs were adopted in years past as well, among other things, also concerning the metallurgical branch. That, however, did not help avoid the catastrophic drop in production. What will the adoption of another program accomplish? Is it really necessary to plan development of enterprises from above? After all, their directors should know better than anyone how to develop their own production. [Kulychenko] This program differs from the preceding ones in that it is based on new approaches, taking into account the current state of affairs in the economy. It sets totally concrete tasks. First of all, it proposes supplying the domestic market with required products. In that connection, priorities are determined--out of their total number, individual enterprises that must be developed on a priority bases are differentiated. It is understandable that every director, naturally, would not prefer to postpone until better times the modernization or reconstruction of his enterprise. But, it is impossible to satisfy all of these proposals, or rather demands. There are not enough funds for this. Also, in the plans everyone intends to increase production two- to threefold. If that was realized, then we would be swamped with metal products and there would be no place to dispose of them. [Malyenko] But, at the same time, one cannot prohibit some collective from developing its production. [Kulychenko] No one is forbidding them to do so. Do that, by all means, but count only on your own resources. Benefits and assistance will not be granted to everyone, but only to those who are performing a priority task. Otherwise, this is what could happen. In a very severe economic situation, when the country lacks funds for the purchase of fuel, medicines, and various essential goods, the creation of totally unpromising production could start. Here are some concrete examples. A mill is under construction at the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant designed for the production of 600,000 motor vehicle springs per year. What are they going to do with those springs? After all, the foreign market does not need them, while Ukrainian requirements come to only 250,000 springs. But, despite everything, the director, being a deputy, won preferential-term financing for that facility. The same action was taken by the Ilyich Combine in Mariupol by purchasing and installing two tube-rolling mills. There is no need for those products, and 7 million dollars were spent on the purchase of necessary equipment alone. At the present time, the director of the Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant is obtaining funds to reconstruct one of the rolling mills. The goal appears to be sound--increased output of reinforced steel and wire rods. But, the point is that, at the neighboring Makeyevka Plant, such reconstruction is already being completed and these high-quality products that meet world standards will be produced there in the near future. Therefore, it would be wiser to allocate the funds demanded by Yenakiyevo for other enterprises in accordance with adopted priorities. This program is called upon to deal specifically with such cases. [Malyenko] Still, it would be naive to assume that, with the adoption of the program, trouble-free vistas are opening up for the enterprises. It would be good if you could talk frankly about those things that are not considered in the program, but without which there can be no real improvement in the economic situation within the metallurgical branch. [Kulychenko] Our program is good on the technical plane, and it worked out with something of a technical tilt. Unfortunately, however, it was impossible to include all of the current economic factors in it. This particularly applies to a study of market conditions. It will be necessary to literally fight for a share of the markets, at the same time, however, speaking quite frankly, we are poorly prepared for that. Serious attention should be focused on the experience of Western firms, which would never undertake reconstruction without a skilled business plan. Another thing we could learn from them is the conduct of reconstruction stage-by-stage, step-by-step, beginning with whatever will yield profit at the earliest date. Western specialists, for instance, tell us: You have good metallurgical production, it is fully competitive, but the buyer may not like the outside appearance of products, the packaging. Therefore, someone should probably start not with radical reconstruction but with the packaging sector, to give the goods a marketable appearance. A great deal of money is needed for the successful clearing up of enterprises and rejuvenation of the branch as a whole. If technical rearmament relies mainly on funds earned by the metallurgists themselves, then some budgetary appropriations will also be required for the resolution of social problems. This pertains especially to such a painful question as the retraining and employment services for laid off workers. This topic, by the way, requires a separate discussion--there are too many problems involved. What is extremely important is the creation of conditions to attract investments in the branch. At present, our unstable legislation is simply scaring off foreign investors. Their importance for rejuvenation of production may be judged on the basis of the following example. As soon as we were given several trillions of karbovantsy in credits during April, the volume of production immediately increased by a fourth in the course of the month, as compared with the first quarter. The metallurgical branch is capable of satisfying the needs of the country's national economy while yielding competitive products. It is merely necessary to remove those obstacles that are preventing this potential from working to the fullest extent.
