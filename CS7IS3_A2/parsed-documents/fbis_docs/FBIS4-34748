Cuba is waging a merciless fight against drug traffickers, Amat said in an interview with BOHEMIA magazine. In the interview, Amat stressed Cuba's willigness to cooperate with other nations in combating the trafficking of hallucinogens. Amat said the island's adverse economic situation following the loss of its traditional markets in the former European socialist camp has not noticeably affected the nation's drug prevention programs. On the contrary, by virtue of our experience and the maximum use of our available resources, we have increased our effectiveness and zeal in surveillance, Amat remarked. Amat said that because of its geographic position, Cuba is located on a direct line between the world's main drug consumer market -- the United States -- and the primary drug producing regions in South America. He said drug traffickers are continuing their modus operandi in Cuba, mainly tossing packages of drugs into the sea to be picked up later by accomplices. Frequently, these packages are carried by the ocean currents onto the island's shores. Amat said that last year, a total of 79 packages containing 3,364.39 kg of drugs washed up on Cuban beaches. This represented a 104 percent increase over 1992. In terms of international cooperation in the fight against this scourge, he pointed out that over the past two years, Cuba has signed agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, Barbados, Guyana, and Argentina, as well as a letter of intent with Colombia. Amat said some unofficial contacts have continued with the United States. These contacts have resulted in certain kinds of bilateral cooperation, such as the exchange of information and evidence, and even the handing over of people implicated in a drug trafficking case. Amat said: We think U.S. professionals in this field are more and more interested in these relationships, and so are we.
