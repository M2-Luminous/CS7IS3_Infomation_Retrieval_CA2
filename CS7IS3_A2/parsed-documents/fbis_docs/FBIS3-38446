What does it specifically offer, and why does it not offer security guarantees? [Woerner in English with superimposed Hungarian translation] First and foremost it provides a whole range of new opportunities for military and political cooperation under a bilateral agreement, including the possibility for the country in question's defense system to approach NATO standards. The latter is one of the most important tasks in the course of preparation of membership. However, we cannot offer security guarantees with Partnership for Peace, since these are linked to member status. But it would be a mistake to think that without formal guarantees you are left alone. By cooperating more and more closely with NATO, your security is increasing. Should there be any threat against you, everybody should take into consideration our alliance's probable reaction. Because probably we would not just idly bide our time. [Foris] Indeed, the document mentions the fact that Partnership for Peace also means a kind of new security relation. What does it mean in specific terms? [Woerner] As a part of Partnership for Peace, we offer an opportunity for consultations. In the event there is a threat against your territorial integrity, it enables you to ask immediately for consultations with NATO. In reality, it does not only mean that you will simply be listened to, but together with this we will find ways of eliminating the danger. [Foris] [passage omitted] In my view the UN's mandate [to NATO] is a trap -- since without this, NATO is doomed to idleness, even if it wants to take steps. [Woerner] I am convinced that we would be able to act, but only under certain circumstances. But you are right, we have some member states which are insisting on the UN mandate, just like everybody is insisting on the UN. [Foris] Can you see a way out of this trap? [Woerner] I would not call it a trap. But as far as a way out is concerned, I would encourage the UN to act more resolutely. [passage omitted]
