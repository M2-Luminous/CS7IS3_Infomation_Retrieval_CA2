At 2130, a strong artillery-reconnaissance-subversive-terrorist group [as heard] tried to breach the Brcko defense lines in the Vranovaca region. The defenders responded fiercely and the fighting flared up. The aggressor ended up with the short end of the stick. After being defeated and suffering losses, the chetniks attacked the entire region of Vranovaca from the direction of Cadjavac with 82-mm mortars. The final outcome of the fighting in Vranovaca is that the (?situation) remained unchanged. Between 2000 and 2200, the aggressor attacked the neighboring village of Bodariste with 60 and 82-mm mortars from the direction of (?Delimir Ravno). During the two-hour artillery attack, the enemy fired several dozen shells, but apart from destroying more civilian residences, no military successes were scored. Overnight, the chetniks intermittently shelled the Zukici area with 82-mm mortars from the direction of Sekulici and anti-aircraft guns in Lipovac. The aggressor did not accomplish his aims on this part of the front either. The defense lines of the free Brcko territory are safe and under the full control of the fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade, the 108th Infantry Brigade, and units from other contingents. During the agreed cease-fire, there are many reasons to remain alert.
