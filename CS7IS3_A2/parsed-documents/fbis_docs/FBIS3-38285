During the debates, the delegates also voted to end democratic centralism and they ratified the departure of Charles Fiterman. Antoine Lefevre and Jean-Etienne Mach report: [Lefevre] [passage omitted] A former nurse, the 47-year old is the mayor of Montigny-les-Cormeilles, a suburb of Paris. He has so far dealt with elected members. From now on, he will have to lead the entire communist house. [Begin Hue recording] Comrades, you understand that I will not make a long speech. I am sure that you also understand that I am deeply moved. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Lefevre] From now on, Robert Hue will have to compromise with the various trends, the multiple clans, which will no doubt rise up on his path, those faithful to Georges Marchais, the protesters, the hard-line neo-Stalinists, and last but not least, the group of members of parliament which could become a bastion under the leadership of Alain Bocquet. Outside the party, he will have to tie up the threads of dialogue with the Socialist Party again in view of the second round of elections -- which is always tricky for the French Communist Party -- regional, European, and presidential elections, and especially municipal elections, the most important for the communists. One might as well say that Robert Hue's short and medium-term agenda is full. [Correspondent Claire Chazal] Robert Hue is live with us from Saint-Ouen. Good evening. [Hue] Good evening, Madame. [Chazal] You are young, you are the national secretary, no longer the secretary general. Is a new era opening up for the Communist Party? [Hue] Well, this congress is the proof of something new indeed. Those observers who could attend this congress for four days noticed something new, something dynamic, a major discussion, a very strong, fraternal confrontation leading to something new. We have to give ourselves the means today, with a Communist Party of a new type, as we said in our manifesto, to go further in the new dimension we want to give our reform. [Chazal] But Robert Hue, we saw some reformers -- if I may call them that -- such as Charles Fiterman, leave the party. [Hue] Well, they did not.... [pauses] Charles Fiterman did not leave the party, I.... [pauses] No, Charles Fiterman left the Central Committee. I have to say that I, for one, am sorry about that. Only last night, I personally asked Charles Fiterman to stay. Charles Fiterman has decided to leave the Central Committee. I believe that his decision must be respected. However, there remain in the political bureau comrades who do not agree with me and those who make up the majority in the political bureau on the basis of this congress. Comrades have agreed to belong to the political bureau. I am thinking of my friend Philippe Herzog, I am also thinking of Guy Hermier. I was asked a question earlier. I have not answered it yet, but I will now. I was asked how my appointment as the national secretary was decided. I can tell you -- and it is the first time for a long, long time -- that the political bureau of the Communist Party, including those comrades who do not share my opinions, have suggested that I become the national secretary of the party. [Lazal] Robert Hue, Antoine Lefevre asked the following question earlier on. With whom will the Communist Party enter into alliances now? Will it be with the Socialist Party again, for instance? [Hue] Well, we shall first and foremost, as usual, enter into alliances with wage earners, citizens, people, as close to reality as possible. You know, I am a mayor and I am a grass-roots man, and reality for me is at the grass-roots level, in action, in struggle. Having said that, we want indeed that the left, progressive forces, find the way to rally again. Having said that, it should be a rally which will no longer be the one which has failed. One of the great lessons of this congress is to say: It is necessary to build something again, it is necessary to build an alternative again in this country. France cannot bear those in power, with Mr. Balladur who strikes terrible blows at the wage earners, at the young people. It is necessary that the left find the way to a rally quickly indeed, but never again do what has failed. It must learn from this failure. Besides, you know that I was told at a news conference earlier on about our participation in the conference on social reform. Well, we shall attend this conference on social reform, just as we shall attend all those meetings where we can discuss together how we can change things, change society, but only if we judge critically and severely what has led our people to reject, to reject the policy which was carried out over the past few years. [Chazal] Thank you very much, Robert Hue, for agreeing to being our guest this evening, live from Saint-Ouen.
