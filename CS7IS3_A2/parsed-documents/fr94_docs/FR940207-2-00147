FR940207-2-00147 FR940207-2-00071 The Commission also believes that the Phlx proposal to permit index option specialists to request floor official approval to halt index options trading where securities representing more than 10% of the index value are halted or suspended should promote just and equitable principles of trade by allowing the cessation of trading where investors might lack access to updated pricing information in the component securities of the index. Moreover, the Commission also believes that the Phlx proposal to adopt a floor procedure advice, paralleling the provisions of Exchange Rule 1047A will help make such procedures readily available to floor members in their advice handbook. The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Accelerating the amendment will allow the proposal to be enacted without delay. The amendment changes the originally proposed requirement that index options be automatically halted whenever more than 50% of the current index value has been halted or suspended from trading on the primary market. The revised requirement will not automatically require a trading halt under such circumstances, but rather will direct that such a decision be made within the discretion of the Exchange or one of its floor officials. The Commission believes that this amendment may help provide greater index option market liquidity under certain market conditions and also provide the Exchange and its floor officials the flexibility to halt or continue index option trading based upon the circumstances and conditions of the current market. The Commission also notes that the proposal, including Amendment No. 1 (but excluding Amendment No. 2), was published for the full 21 day comment period and no comments were received. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
