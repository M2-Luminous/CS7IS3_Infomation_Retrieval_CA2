FR940617-0-00030 FR940617-0-00005 Response: The only way the REA and the Owner can be assured that the surety allows subcontractors is by written consent. The language in this section remains unchanged. Section 12: One commenter remarked that either party should be permitted to subcontract the Agreement to an affiliate without the consent of the other party. A corporate restructuring of a Bidder should not be able to be arbitrarily held up by a single Owner. Response: REA does not feel that a Bidder should be allowed to arbitrarily subcontract an REA Contract without the proper consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. This language has worked well in the past and REA feels it will continue to work well in the future.
