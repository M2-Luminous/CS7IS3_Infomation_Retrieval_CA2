FBIS4-48762 "drafr102_c_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-102 Daily Report 24 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA White Paper on RDP Details To Be Prepared White Paper on RDP Details To Be Prepared MB2405162294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1513 GMT 24 May 94 MB2405162294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- The government of national unity would prepare a white paper setting out the details of the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP], Minister Without Portfolio Mr Jay Naidoo told a media briefing in Cape Town on Tuesday. Mr Naidoo and Finance Deputy Minister Alec Erwin were providing details of the RDP announced by President Nelson Mandela in his state of the nation address to the opening of Parliament. Mr Naidoo said the white paper would differ from the RDP set out by the African National Congress during its election campaign. The ANC said then its RDP would cost R[Rand]39-billion. Asked whether the RDP agreed to by the cabinet of the government of national unity differed from the ANC's plan, Mr Naidoo replied: "Absolutely". In his speech to Parliament, Mr Mandela said the cabinet had reached consensus "on many elements of a plan broadly based on that (the ANC's) Programme for Reconstruction and Development". Mr Erwin explained that the RDP had been discussed with a wide variety of stakeholders and changes had been introduced. The new plan would be set out in the white paper. Mr Naidoo said he would be responsible for the white paper in conjunction with the Departments of Finance and State Expenditure. As a "kickstart" to the RDP, Mr Mandela announced that R2.5-billion had been set aside. The fund would be increased by R2.5-billion a year for five years. The initial R2.5bn was derived from redirecting government spending priorities. However, increased economic growth could boost the fund to well beyond the R12.5-billion total at the end of the five-year period, Mr Erwin said. The fund would not be used like the Independent Development Trust Fund in which individual projects were financed. Mr Naidoo's office would be responsible for programmes and budgeting.
