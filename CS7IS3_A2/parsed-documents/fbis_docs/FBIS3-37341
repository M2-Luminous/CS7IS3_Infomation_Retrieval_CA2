Among the speakers, there were only representatives of the strike committees and the BPF [Belarus People's Front]. They sharply criticized the government and the Supreme Soviet. From Independence Square, the people in the rally proceeded in a column to the Supreme Soviet building, where they passed on their demands to Chairman of Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Hryb. The demands include the resignation of the government and elections to the Supreme Soviet in March. In the opinion of the ralliers, the speaker should give his reply not later than 22 February, the day the Supreme Soviet resumes work.
