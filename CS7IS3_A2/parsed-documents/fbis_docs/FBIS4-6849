Hata, 58, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the coalition, became Japan's 51st premier and the sixth prime minister in five years, succeeding Morihiro Hosokawa, 56. [passage omitted] Later in a meeting with Shinseito legislators, Hata appealed for greater allegiance, saying "Japan is facing difficult times domestically and internationally." He was apparently referring to the recession, trade tensions with the United States and the North Korean nuclear issue. "If Japan made a wrong policy choice, it would plunge into an abyss and historians (of the future) will look back and say there used to be a country named Japan," Hata warned. He hinted, however, that he would not lead Japan to take a high profile role in U.N. peacekeeping efforts, saying, "I am not asserting that the Japanese should go abroad carrying bazookas on their shoulders." LDP president Kono called on Hata to step up efforts for political reform to restore the credibility of Japanese politics. "I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's distrust in politics," Kono told reporters. "I heard the ruling coalition say repeatedly that it should follow through on promised political reform in order to restore the credibility of politics," Kono said. Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP urged the governing coalition to live up to its vow to implement policies earlier agreed upon as a policy platform. "I want the Hata administration to carry out policies which were worked out by Shinseito," said Watanabe, who threatened in mid-April to leave the party in a bid to seek the premiership, hoping for backing from some of the ruling coalition. The leader of the LDP's third-largest faction said, "we will extend our support for (the Hata administration's) policies that could help our country, while withholding support for any policies that could not."
