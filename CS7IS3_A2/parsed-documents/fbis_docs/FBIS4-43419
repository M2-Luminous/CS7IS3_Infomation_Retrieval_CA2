This is because PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], when it was an opposition party, always criticized the nationalism of the ruling party and strongly condemned every moderate tactic regarding Ankara, even using such terms as "national underestimation," "betrayal of national rights," and so forth. This column merely notes this inconsistency without, of course, impeaching the official opposition under the excuse that it does not follow the tactics of its basic political opponent. This is because our foreign policy must be charted and implemented over and above any party antagonism. In this specific case the motives and goals of the Turkish provocativeness are known. The Turkish Government is now facing a major domestic problem. The Kurdish uprising has developed into an endless civil war, whose casualty totals over the past decade have reached 12,000 dead! During the same period the Kemalist element--that is the military establishment who consented to a controlled democratization of that country--has suffered a rapid loss of its strength and glory. On the other hand, the Islamic spirit has revived and expanded, as a result of which the trustworthiness and prestige of the official Turkish leadership is being doubted in the European and, more generally, the Western sphere... [ellipses as published] Therefore, a faltering Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is anxiously seeking ways to rally the nation together and to create concord by resorting to well-known methods--that is, to create artificial tensions in the foreign policy sector and then embark on acts of bullying (in Turkish daylik) with regard to nonexistent threats against her country. Obviously, Mrs. Ciller and her associates feel that such "appropriate" tactics could be implemented in the most (internationally) painless and (internally) beneficial manner only in regard to the Greek-Turkish disputes. In the foreign policy sector, coolness, wisdom, and tolerance result primarily from a feeling of supremacy. On the contrary, insolent provocativeness and pointless aggressiveness in most cases are an expression of weakness, despondency, or even panic. So, the extent to which the Greek reaction toward the Turkish provocations has developed, based on the above-mentioned facts, is certainly justified. It remains for this reaction to be proved right during the development and the outcome of this specific "crisis"....
