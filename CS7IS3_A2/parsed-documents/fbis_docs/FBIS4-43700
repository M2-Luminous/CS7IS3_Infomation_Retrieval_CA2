The council meeting will be preceded by nationwide consultations with about 200 local party leaders, regional secretaries, mayors, union leaders and other party officials, announced Umberto Ranieri, one of eight members of a special commission formed yesterday to collect candidatures for the post. Consultations should be completed by next Tuesday and "will be open," Tedesco said, "meaning that they are not aimed at verifying consensus on pre-existing candidatures, they are not a primary election in any way." For his part, Ranieri said that, "today's top political problem is to prevent moderate voters from turning to the right and to stop Forza Italia from taking over the center," referring to the strong gains made by Premier Silvio Berlusconi's party in Sunday's European Parliament elections. The other main issue, he said, is to find quickly a leader who has the support and trust of other members of the Progressive Alliance, a coalition led by the Left Democrats. Separately, the man widely touted as the most likely candidate to replace Occhetto, Massimo D'Alema, said he had "many doubts" about the decision to name a new secretary immediately, rather than find a temporary solution until the party's national congress assembly can meet at the end of the year. "We could have decided to name a collective body, a `directorate' of sorts until the congress is held," D'Alema told reporters. Other party officials have suggested moving up the national congress to an earlier date.
