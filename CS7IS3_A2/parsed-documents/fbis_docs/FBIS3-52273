FBIS3-52273 "drnes002dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Spokesman on `Alliance' Members' Charges JN3012115793 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 30 Dec 93 pp 28, 24 JN3012115793 Amman AL-DUSTUR Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [By Tawfiq 'Abid] [Text] During the past two days, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has come under scathing attack by some members of the 10-faction alliance for demanding 40 percent of the membership in the alliance of Palestinian forces, which is the latest approved name for this alliance. Some observers commented on this verbal dual that was conducted through the media by asking: Is Hamas equal to those factions that do not have a presence inside the occupied homeland? Some officials in these factions leveled a number of accusations against Hamas and said that it is seeking to obstruct the march of the alliance and is backing out on what was previously agreed. However, in statements to AL-DUSTUR, Hamas official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said: We are going to Damascus today, Thursday, to discuss together the organizational formula of the alliance after agreement has been reached on the name of this alliance; that is, the alliance of Palestinian forces. We presented our view so that there would be guarantees for the march of the alliance and a translation of its resolutions on the ground and so that this march would have credibility in representing the participating factions. He noted: The leadership of the alliance should be more realistic in evaluating the effective forces in the Palestinian arena. Hamas has highlighted the daily facts of its developing strength through its struggle, intifadah activities, as well as professional union elections inside the occupied territories. Our weight exceeded the quota demanded at the Palestine National Council [PNC] in spring 1990. Ghawshah added: Our demands for 40 percent of the alliance membership is reasonable. We do not think we provoked any other faction when we presented a draft demanding 40 percent of the membership for Hamas, 40 percent for the other factions, and 20 percent for the independents. It is well known that this alliance is a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people at this critical stage -- a leadership that adheres to the constants of these people, taking into consideration that the permanent leadership is the one that will be elected by the Palestinian people inside the occupied territories and in the diaspora in free and honest elections. Ghawshah went on to say: Hamas considers the local national conferences and the comprehensive national conference as political and media forums to announce the political program and organizational formula to be approved. This conference does not have any organizational authority. Therefore, it is logical to say that whatever the 10 ten factions agree on is considered a final agreement. Hamas understands that the purpose of the national congress is to inform and bless the temporary leadership. This understanding is important because there are some factions that are trying to make the national conferences, including the general congress, an organizational tool that replaces the PNC. Hamas rejects this, in part and parcel. Asked about accusations by some factions that Hamas is retreating, Ghawshah said: We did not change our policy, method, or principle. We adhere to the clear Islamic principles of the Palestinian issue. It is a united trend unlike what some of the 10 factions claim. He said: Our stand toward the Zionist enemy did not change. Our rejection of the Zionist enemy is a principled rejection since it occupies and colonizes an Islamic Arab territory. There can be no dialogue, negotiations, or reconciliation with this usurper. Moreover, there can be no agreement on decisions that diminish the rights of the Palestinian people. Ghawshah added: Hamas was surprised by some attacks that are unjustified, unless someone wanted to impose their presence by using loud voices instead of offering the blood of martyrs and taking part in our people's intifadah inside the occupied territories. He said: These loud voices will never affect the course of our movement. We believe that if the alliance is to become a reality on the ground, then the other Palestinian opposition forces, who are dear to us, must deal with the facts that are as clear as the sun. The Islamic trend inside and outside Palestine has become tangible and no one can ignore it except those who want to ignore the light of the sun. Ghawshah continued: As long as there is an objective handling of issues, then it will be possible to reach a unifying formula that will unite all the factions. Asked about Hamas' stand in case the other factions reject its demands dealing with representation, Ghawshah said: I believe that the brothers in the factions will conduct a totally objective and reasonable examination of our demands. We hope we will reach an agreement on fighting the Zionist occupation, standing against the Gaza-Jericho First conspiracy, and reinforcing and continuing the intifadah. He added: We sincerely and strongly hope to develop the 10 factions into a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people so that action would be more effective and so that the people's sympathy with us would be clearer. If the formula of the alliance of Palestinian forces does not succeed, then we shall continue with that formula until we arrive at circumstances that will allow for more sincere unification. As for what is being said about contacts between Hamas and Israel during the truce which ended last Sunday, Ghawshah said: There are trends that are fishing in murky waters and exploiting the ability of the Zionist enemy and some Arab parties, represented at the Knesset, that have access to Shaykh Ahmad Yasin or other Hamas detainees, and report inaccurate statements by Shaykh Yasin that are not scrutinized. He added: Contacts between some Israeli officials and Hamas detainees cannot in anyway be be termed as dialogue. Dialogue is only held between free people and not between the prisoner and the prison warden or between one who has the power and one who is detained. Hamas will never hold any dialogue with the Zionists. He continued: Through the deputy chief of staff and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, the Zionist enemy rejected the truce proposed by Hamas. Peres accused Hamas of seeking Israeli capitulation. Hence, Hamas has a broad field in which to continue confronting the soldiers and settlers of the Zionist occupation.
