FR941006-2-00122 FR941006-2-00085 [Release No. 34&hyph;34766; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;52] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Interim Extension of the OTC Bulletin Board Â® Service Through December 31, 1994 September 30, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on September 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service (``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;88&hyph;19, as amended. 1 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market SM nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities''). 2 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3 Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service is currently operating under interim approval that expires on October 3, 1994. 3 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27975 (May 1, 1990), 55 FR 19124 (May 8, 1990). 2 With the Commission's January 1994 approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;24, the universe of securities eligible for quotation in the OTCBB now includes certain equities listed on regional stock exchanges that do not qualify for dissemination of transaction reports via the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33507 (January 24, 1994), 59 FR 4300 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;24). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34613 (August 30, 1994), 59 FR 46278. The NASD hereby files this proposed rule change, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, to obtain authorization for an interim extension of the Service through December 31, 1994. During this interval, there will be no material change in the OTCBB Service's operational features, absent Commission approval of a corresponding Rule 19b&hyph;4 filing. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filings with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;7) that requested permanent approval of the Service. For the month ending August 31, 1994, the Service reflected the market making positions of 402 NASD member firms displaying quotations/indications of interest in approximately 5,107 OTC Equities. During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR issues will remain indicative.
