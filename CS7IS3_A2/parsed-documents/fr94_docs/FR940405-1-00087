FR940405-1-00087 FR940405-1-00013 Indoor air contaminants emanate from a broad array of sources that can originate both outside of structures as well as from within a building. When a building is new, some contaminants are given off quickly and soon disappear. Others continue off-gassing at a slow pace for years. Common office supplies and equipment have been found to release hazardous chemicals_especially duplicators and copiers. Bulk paper stores have been found to release formaldehyde [Ex. 3&hyph;1087A20]. Some typical contaminants are listed below: (a) Gases and Vapors (organic/inorganic): _Radon _Sulfur dioxide _Ammonia _Carbon Monoxide _Carbon Dioxide _Nitrous Oxides _Formaldehyde (b) Fibers: _Asbestos _Fiberglass/Mineral Wools _Textiles/Cotton (c) Dusts: _Allergens _Household dust (mites) _Pollens: _Feathers _Danders _Spores _Smoke/Fume _Environmental Tobacco Smoke _Coal _Wood (d) Microbes: _Bacteria _Fungi _Viruses People contribute millions of particles to the indoor air primarily through the shedding of skin scales. Many of these scales carry microbes, most of which are short lived and harmless. Clothing, furnishings, draperies, carpets, etc. contribute fibers and other fragments. Cleaning processes, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting normally remove the larger particles, but often increase the airborne concentrations of the smaller particles. Cooking, broiling, grilling, gas and oil burning, smoking, coal and wood generate vast numbers of airborne indoor pollutants in various classifications. 3. Controlling Indoor Air Control of pollutants at the source is the most effective strategy for maintaining clean indoor air. However, control or mitigation of all sources is not always possible or practical. In the case of ETS, this means restricting smoking to separately ventilated spaces. General ventilation is, therefore, the second most effective approach to providing acceptable indoor air [Exs. 3&hyph;1061G, 3&hyph;1075J].
