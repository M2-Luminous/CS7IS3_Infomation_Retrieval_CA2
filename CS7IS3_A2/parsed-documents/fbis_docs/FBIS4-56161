Cardoso told Luis Eduardo that he would be vice presidential candidate in these elections only if he so desires, thus leaving the decision entirely in the hands of Luis Eduardo, who did not give a definite answer. Although he did not clearly reject the invitation, Luis Eduardo expressed his reticence to Cardoso. The two talked for an hour and a half, analyzed an alliance between the two parties in the states, and settled the last details of an alliance that will be officially announced on 2 May. Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, father of Luis Eduardo, will meet with Cardoso in Rio de Janeiro tomorrow, but will not attend the ceremony on 2 May. Luis Eduardo admitted he has spoken with Cardoso about the vice presidency for the first time, but he did not want to give any details. "It would not be polite," he said. Luis Eduardo said the PFL decision will probably be announced next weekend, depending on the date chosen for the party convention.
