This will be Fidel's fourth trip to Brazil. Friendship organizations have mobilized to welcome Fidel, who has made apparent his admiration for the Brazilian people. His previous visits have had great repercussion in Brazil and copious coverage by its media. Cuba and Brazil maintain active bilateral relations and commercial exchanges have increased lately. Brazil has commended Cuba's health system and also used Cuban medicines, like the meningococcal meningitis vaccine. Fidel's previous visit took place last year during the summit in Bahia, which everyone agrees is very similar to Cuba, and whose people are as friendly and ebullient as the Cuban people.
