Justice Minister David Liba'i alluded to his plan during a tour of Haifa at the end of last week. "We should remove radical Jewish elements from the heart of Arab population centers," he said. "We must consider how much to invest in their safety and how much of a future they have under today's changing conditions." The Hebron plan is based on a government assessment that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] can no longer guarantee the safety of the 42 families living there. Officials say there are 400 Jews in the city. "After the events last week, there is a problem ensuring their safety," one official said. A senior defense official dismissed the proposal as "rubbish," and said it has not been approved or seriously discussed. However, a government legal expert said military authorities in the territories have the right to order an evacuation. He said the easiest way would be to declare Hebron a closed military zone. The issue was raised at last week's Wednesday meeting of the ministerial security committee. Several ministers called for the removal of at least some of the families living in Hebron, specifically those in the Bet Hadassah complex. A diplomatic source said Rabin remains the only member in the security cabinet who opposes the evacuation. PLO sources said the removal of Hebron's Jews represents a key condition to the resumption of the peace talks. [passage omitted]
