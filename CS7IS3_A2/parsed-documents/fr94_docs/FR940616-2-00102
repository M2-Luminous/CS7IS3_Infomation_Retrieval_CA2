FR940616-2-00102 FR940616-2-00079 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,394] Martin Marietta Projection Display Products, Syracuse, NY; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On May 25, 1994, after being granted a filing extension, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department's denial notice for workers at the subject firm. The notice was issued on March 30, 1994 and was published in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17570). The company indicated that the Department's original survey was inadequate and submitted a supplemental list of bid loss customers accounting for a major portion of its 1993 sales decline. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 8th day of June 1994. Stephen A. Wandner, Deputy Director, Office of Legislation & Actuarial Services, Unemployment Insurance Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14695 Filed 6&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
