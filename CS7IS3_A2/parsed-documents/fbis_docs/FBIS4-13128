Dr. al-Kasm answered journalists' questions concerning developments in the peace process and the Arab-Israeli conflict. He emphasized the constants of Syrian Arab policy, and its position on the just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This morning, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received the mission, which includes ranking Western and Japanese media men. The foreign minister answered their questions and said Israel intransigence since the beginning of the peace process obstructed the realization of substantial progress in the peace process. Al- Shar' said the opportunity for peace is getting narrower day by day because of Israel's insistence on continuing its occupation of the Arab territories, contrary to the UN resolutions on which the peace process was based. The foreign minister expressed Syria's determination to continue its objectives, which are identical with the international community's objectives, to realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region, in accordance with the Madrid formula. He stressed the importance of the objective role of mass media in the international arena in distinguishing between those who want real, just, and comprehensive peace, and those who block this peace.
