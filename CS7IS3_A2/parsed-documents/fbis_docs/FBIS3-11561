Why is this? [Concepcion] I would not say most critical. I believe that the cattle industry is beginning to emerge from its most critical period. The main problem with the cattle was feed. We had developed a cattle industry in Cuba based on a breed that required mainly hay -- Holstein, primarily a dairy breed. [Santana] And this hay was imported. [Concepcion] It was imported. When this stopped, the cattle naturally experienced the results of a lack of feed. This is the reason I said it is not that the industry is undergoing a crisis, but overcoming a crisis. I know that strong, nationwide efforts began last year regarding cattle feed. There are signs in Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and certain farms in Havana, Camaguey, and Pinar del Rio that show the beginning of a significant recovery in the Cuban cattle industry. [Recio] I would like to give my opinion about what Eloy said regarding the word crisis. What he is saying is true: The worst part of the crisis is over. The worst part of a crisis is the period of decline toward the bottom of the abyss -- to employ a metaphor. The Cuban cattle industry has apparently halted its decline. However, it stopped at a very low level. I believe we have to stress this. The decline has stopped, but at a very low level. We can affirm that the Cuban cattle industry is undergoing a very, very critical period. I will give you some points in case: The mass of Cuban cattle is extremely inferior to the ideal in any country. Cuba ought to have a cattle population proportional to its human population. We are far from having cattle proportional to our population. Any dairy production should produce a liter-per-cow rate of....[pauses] A poor quality breed should yield six liters a day and a highly efficient breed ought to yield 12, 15, or 20. Right now, our averages are lower than that of the worst of the cattle industries. However, as Eloy said, it is true that we had dipped even lower and that in the past few months the process has stabilized and shown a gradual improvement. [Santana] What defines this? [Recio] Renato is partially correct. When I said that we are emerging from the crisis I was referring to the following: I believe that the first crisis we experienced in this industry was a subjective crisis on the part of the ranchers and cadres who manage it, in not understanding in time, nor taking measures in time to find alternative feeds that might not represent the full nutritional potential of hay but would still have avoided a further decline and complete destruction of the cattle industry. For example: If you have no hay, are you going to sit on your hands and wait until the animal dies, or plant sugarcane, king grass, or protein banks and do everything possible to keep that animal alive? This is why I said that I believe the crisis is behind us. I believe that now in the cattle sector, most comrades, managers, ranchers, and dairy workers have a higher awareness. The drop in the cattle population, which resulted in tremendous death figures in previous years, is this year experiencing a slight reduction -- although not yet total. In other words, we see a certain recovery of the cattle; births are higher than deaths and more cows are becoming productive every day. More cows are in gestation. The previous decline in the cattle even lowered gestation because the severe malnutrition prevented cows' coming into heat. From an optimistic point of view, yes, a recovery is taking place. There is a generalization of new methods. I want to stress this issue of methodology -- the technology of production. We have to keep in mind that wanting and getting are not overnight things. We have to generalize technologies. Eloy mentioned that a country where cattle workers used to produce milk from a fine breed which required highly specialized veterinary care and high-protein feed based on concentrates and where grazing was not customary suddenly was forced by circumstances to change methods. It has helped tremendously to have the experience with the famous Voisin method, which we are trying to generalize nationwide in an updated form. There is not doubt that this technology is being generalized. I want to introduce another issue because the Cuban people should be well informed about this. We not only have to change production technology. We also have to make genetic changes in the Cuban cattle. [Concepcion] There is the example of the Nazareno enterprise. [Recio] Eloy and I visited that enterprise recently here in Havana. This enterprise has a great responsibility because it is charged with the genetic reshaping of the Cuban cattle, from primarily Holstein to Siboney. This is the result of a cross between the high milk production of the Holstein and the endurance and hardiness of the Zebu, which over many decades proved its efficiency in Cuba. [Santana] You mention that there is a cattle recovery. What supports this? There is no milk. Milk is still rationed. I do not see the results and the people are saying the same thing. [Concepcion] There is another reason for the shortage of milk. We used to import powdered milk through favorable-term accords with former socialist countries, specifically, Germany. That is the first thing. The second factor is that our own cattle herd, primarily Holsteins fed on hay, was a great milk producer. Milk supplies were higher than today. We imported approximately 20,000 or 30,000 tons of hay. We no longer have the capability to import that feed to produce milk. We have a very large Holstein cattle population that could yield higher levels of milk if we had hay. [Recio] I also want to discuss two elements I believe we should address in this program since we are talking straight. First, I believe that increased worker welfare has also contributed significantly to this recovery. You mentioned the visit to the Nazareno enterprise. We also visited the Valle de Peru enterprise. At this services complex we saw how they have been building work tools for the ranchers, and how houses have been built at the ranches. The other element is cattle theft and slaughter. This is truly a serious problem in many places, one that has significantly hurt our herds. It is an element we have to keep in mind. It is a situation that still has not been solved in any province, except in some specific cases. This is seriously hurting our cattle. [Santana] You know that much has been said lately about the Voisin Rational Grazing System. As a matter of fact, this is a cattle method dating back to the sixties. Is this a valid technology for these times? [Concepcion] Completely valid. We can add that it was so previously, from a purely technological point of view. What happened is that we lived in a world where we had certain ties with certain countries and blocs of countries and the economy imposed certain rules. We got hay and concentrates relatively easily. If under good conditions a Holstein gives over 22 liters, it makes no sense to graze. It apparently makes no sense; we cannot be absolute here. The main point of the Voisin method, as updated, lies in the fact that Cuba is a tropical country, a country with a fertile climate, a country which can produce sufficient pasture to support, with modern, adequate technology, a considerable cattle population without imported feed and concentrates and which can attain higher production. What supports this? Not the people's having more milk. We have to keep in mind that milk imports were halted and we experienced a significant production drop of approximately 50 percent. This is not easy to restore. [Recio] Yes. We cannot hope to restore that. This is one of the most difficult recovery process any country can experience. It takes three years for a calf to become productive. Certain things are being done. One supporting factor is the minidairy farms. We have also to implement technological changes in the minidairies and gradually eliminate those large enterprises which do not correspond to today's reality with cattle. [Santana] We have spoken of subjective problems. However, are our cattle workers truly efficient? [Concepcion] I do not believe they are efficient enough, yet. I believe that once again a body of cattle workers is taking shape with this new mentality, or need the country has, to use the Voisin method, to handle cattle properly, and to house the cattle workers at the ranches. This is why it is important to locate homes near the workplace, so that the workers can live there and care for those cattle. It is also important to promote workers' welfare and self- sufficiency, promote pig and chicken farming so that the entire family is available to take care of the facility. I believe that this is the type of thing that will solve this problem.
