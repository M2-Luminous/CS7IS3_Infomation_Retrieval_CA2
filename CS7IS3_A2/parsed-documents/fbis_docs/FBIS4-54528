Here is [Solidarity Chairman] Marian Krzaklewski . [Begin Krzaklewski recording] The protest staff has taken the decision to intensify the protest actions of the union after 3 May. All union structures will be expected to hold active strikes between 4 and 7 May. We call on all workers, including those belonging to other trade unions, to take an active part in the action of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] Solidarity. The demands put forward by NSZZ Solidarity, which the government of the Polish Republic is stubbornly ignoring, are important demands made by workers and citizens. I was counting on the Prime Minister to put forward some concept, in a decisive manner, but the Prime Minister chose the tactic of a confrontational speech. Given that he was speaking in such a confrontational manner about our union and that his speech was in such very bad taste as far as we were concerned, perhaps this time we shall manage to do something with this government--[laughing] because I don't know any more how to interpret all this.
