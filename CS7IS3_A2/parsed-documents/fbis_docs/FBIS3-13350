Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khalifi and Muhammad al-Mahi told interrogators on Sudan television that their group, Takfir and Hijrah, believes that present day Muslims are "infidels". "All the contemporary Muslim society is infidel and has got to be fought including the leadership of all Sudanese fundamentalist groups," said Khalifi. The attack on the mosque in Omdurman on 4 February claimed the lives of 19 worshipers and wounded others. Khalifi said the attackers wanted the head of the Ansar al-Sunnah group, Zubayr Muhammad Hamzah, who led Friday prayers at the mosque. He said their hit-list included a Muslim fundamentalist who was leader of the dissolved National Islamic Front, Hasan al-Turabi, and two leaders of the Muslim brotherhood, Hibir Yusuf and Sulayman Abu-Naru. Khalifi was shown on television still suffering from injuries he sustained in the shoot-out with security forces on 5 February, in which two other assailants, Yasir Muhammad Api and 'Abd-al-Baqi Yusuf, were killed. He said their hit list also included veterans of the war in Afghanistan who lived and worked with an exiled Saudi businessman, Usamah Bin Ladin, whose villa the group also stormed. Khalifi told an investigator that his group does not pray in mosques, "because the mosques of today are frequented by infidels". He said he is a descendant of a family that emigrated early this century from the desert area of Najd in today's Saudi Arabia and settled in Libya. He said that his father works for the Sirte Oil Company in Libya. Al-Mahi said Khalifi's two accomplices were originally members of the Ansar al-Sunnah group, who broke away because of "certain differences". Al-Mahi said he participated in the planning, but refused to take part in the assault "because it will destroy the image of our group". He said they targeted the Ansar al-Sunnah mosque and the Islamic militant leaders "because these leaders did not declare war against Muslim mysticisms (sufi Moslems), who are seen by our group as enemies of Allah". Worshipers at the Ansar al-Sunnah group also believe Muslim sufis are infidels. Asked why he did not report the plan to the police, he replied: "since the group believes all the society is infidel, we should not deal with or come in contact with any of its organizations, including the police." The Ministry of the Interior, in a statement after the television interview, said that the suspects would be put on trial as soon as investigations were completed. It also promised to give them a fair trial.
