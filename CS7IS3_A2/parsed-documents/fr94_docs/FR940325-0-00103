Section 11.72 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(4) to read as follows: §11.72 Quantification phase_baseline services determination. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (4) Baseline data collection shall be restricted to those data necessary for conducting the assessment at a reasonable cost.

Section 11.73 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §11.73 Quantification phase_resource recoverability analysis. (a) Requirement. The time needed for the injured resources to recover to the state that the authorized official determines services are restored, rehabilitated, replaced, and/or the equivalent have been acquired to baseline levels shall be estimated. The time estimated for recovery or any lesser period of time as determined in the Assessment Plan shall be used as the recovery period for purposes of §11.35 and the Damage Determination phase, §§11.80 through 11.84, of this part. (1) In all cases, the amount of time needed for recovery if no restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources efforts are undertaken beyond response actions performed or anticipated shall be estimated. This time period shall be used as the ``No Action-Natural Recovery'' period for purposes of §11.82 and §11.84(g)(2)(ii) of this part. (2) The estimated time for recovery shall be included in possible alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, as developed in §11.82 of this part, and the data and process by which these recovery times were estimated shall be documented. * * * * *
