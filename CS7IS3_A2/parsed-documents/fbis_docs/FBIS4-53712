It is highly likely that when the third round of high-level talks are held, North Korea will propose more concrete steps in improving military, economic, and political relations with the United States which it has consistently called for in the past. On the other hand, the United States will demand inspections of both declared and undeclared nuclear facilities in North Korea until the international community is satisfied with their transparency. What we must pay special attention to among the anticipated agenda items at the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, is the issue North Korea will raise pertaining to concluding a peace agreement on the pretext of improving military relations with the United States. Last month, North Korea claimed that this issue should be dealt with from the viewpoint of overall disarmament on the Korean peninsula because its undeclared nuclear sites are military facilities. Thus, North Korea stressed that a peace agreement should be concluded with the United States. The proposal for concluding a peace agreement with the United States raised by North Korea in an attempt to counter special inspection of its undeclared nuclear facilities has been repeatedly put forward since the 1970's. The purpose of this proposal is to replace the armistice system on the Korean peninsula by concluding a peace agreement with the United States and not the ROK. This proposal is also based on the logic that North Korea will push for establishing the peace system on the Korean peninsula through disarmament between the North and the South and through withdrawal of U.S. Forces from South Korea on the basis of a North-South nonaggression declaration and the peace agreement with the United States. This allegation of North Korea is misleading [hoguda]. The real parties concerned with consolidating peace on the Korean peninsula are none other than the North and the South. Only when hostile relations between the North and the South are turned into relations of coexistence guaranteeing the North-South nonaggression declaration for building legal trust [pobchok silloe kuchuk], when political and military trust is built, and disarmament between the North and the South realized, can a practical peace system be established on the Korean peninsula and can discussion of a peace agreement between the North and the South be held. However, the North Korean allegation ignores this clear, precise reality. Therefore, in the wake of a third round of U.S.-North Korea high- level talks, our government, should closely cooperate and call upon the United States to clearly convey its position to North Korea that the peace agreement on the Korean peninsula should be discussed with the ROK, the party concerned, instead of the United States. At the same time, the United States should emphasize the fact that a peace agreement with the United States designed to force the U.S. Forces to withdraw from South Korea, will not result in gaining genuine peace on the Korean peninsula. Peace will only be gained when North Korea sincerely implements the building of genuine, political, legal, and military trust by amending its existing policies toward the South, and only when North Korea strives to establish peace on the Korean peninsula through a peace agreement between North and South Korea. We would like to urge the government to firmly maintain the position that the peace agreement issue is different from the issue of exchanging special envoys and that the ROK people will never tolerate a situation in which the issue of peace on the Korean peninsula is discussed without participation of the ROK. While maintaining this position, our government should assume an even more positive attitude toward the ROK-U.S. mutual cooperative system.
