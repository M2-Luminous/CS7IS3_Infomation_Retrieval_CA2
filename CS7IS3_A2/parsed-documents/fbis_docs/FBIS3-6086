Moreover, the resolution "protests with a sense of fury" against the U.S. military, the Defense Facilities Agency, and other government agencies, urging them to "take all possible measures to prevent similar accidents from happening again." Nine members of the same town assembly's Special Committee for Base Affairs (chaired by Morisada Inamine) visited the KAB on 9 March and inspected the site of the accident. The resolution strongly criticizes the U.S. military, saying: "Strong and foul smells enveloped the entire area, and the highly flammable material provoked fear among the residents. The anger of the townspeople has reached its outer limit. Accidents frequently occurred following the 1967 incident dubbed the "flammable well" and... These are the consequences of careless base management, which ignores the well-being of the residents." Members of the town assembly plan to visit relevant organizations to file a protest in early April following the end of the regular session in March.
