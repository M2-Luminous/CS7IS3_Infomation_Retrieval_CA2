FR940810-0-00093 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA concludes that when conscientiously used by well-trained, well-supervised personnel, glove bags can effectively reduce asbestos fiber release. The NIOSH study demonstrated clearly that the obverse is also true; when glove bags are used improperly by untrained or insufficiently trained workers, airborne fiber levels can become significantly elevated. Consequently, based on this extensive evidence and analysis, OSHA is permitting wider use of glove bag technology in the final standard, but is including additional requirements to improve the effectiveness of their use. The Agency notes that the new regulatory text prescribing the specifications and work practices for allowable glove bag removals would prohibit the kind of removal activity observed in the NIOSH study. Based on its study, NIOSH recommended detailed work practices and specifications for glove bag use. OSHA has incorporated the major recommendations into the standard, either as part of the overall requirements for asbestos removal, or as required components of permitted glove bag systems. For example, NIOSH recommends that workers ``spray frequently during the removal process so that newly exposed surfaces are wetted.'' OSHA requires that all work be performed using wet methods. ``Wet methods'' are defined as, applying sufficient water to ACM and PACM during the work operation so that fibers, if released, are prevented from becoming airborne. Other recommendations likewise are covered by more generic requirements. For Class I work in which glove bags are used, OSHA is requiring that 2 persons perform the glove bag removal. BCTD recommended that 2 persons perform glove bag work stating that ``*␣*␣*␣the operation can be hard-pressed to adjust the HEPA vacuum flow rates or water pressure in the sprayer while his/her hands are in the bag'' (Ex. 143, p. 125). BCTD also felt that proper decontamination required a ``buddy system'' involving a second worker. Exxon representative, Mr. Booher, testified that their practices is to have 2 persons per glove bag (Tr. 2673). Mr. Sledge of Naval Sea Systems Command testified that two personal normally perform glove bag operations in their facilities, usually using glove bags under negative pressure (Tr. 420). OSHA agrees and believes that proper use of glove bags in removing high-risk ACM (TSI and surfacing ACM) requires at least two persons. The Agency also notes that required training of employees must cover detailed glove bag procedures. Many of the detailed work practices recommended by NIOSH are advisory, i.e. use ``sprayer of sufficient length,'' will be covered in training, and/or are encompassed by more general requirements. Other Systems Although glove bag systems were the alternative system most discussed during the rulemaking, participants submitted data on other systems which were claimed to effectively isolate asbestos dust during removal. The Agency has reviewed the data and comment on these submissions and has listed four additional systems as permitted for Class I work under stated circumstances in paragraph (g)(5). The Agency emphasizes that the listing of any system is not an endorsement by OSHA. The listing merely indicates that various combinations of engineering controls and work practices represented by these systems, when properly carried out, and when all other provisions of these standards, e.g., training, competent person supervision, exposure assessments and respirator use where required, are found by the Agency on this record to constitute effective means of controlling employee exposure to asbestos. Two of the systems are modifications of glove bag systems. One, a negative pressure glove bag system, was presented as an alternative by several participants. One witness stated that ``the nuclear ship repair industry has used pipe containment glove bags for years␣*␣*␣*␣all of this work has been required to be performed with constant negative pressure being maintained inside the glove bag during removal operations'' (Tr. 3028). A panel testifying on behalf of Union Carbide described a negative-pressure glove bag technology which they have developed (Tr. 2192 and Ex. 7&hyph;108). M. Patel, an industrial hygienist at Union Carbide, described it in his written testimony: The glove bag system is used as follows: The glove bag is connected to the glove/hose connector. All the tools needed to remove asbestos are placed in the inner pouch of the glove bag. The bag is installed on a pipe utilizing the zipper provided at the top. The shoulder is fastened on both ends of the glove bag with tourniquets. The rest of the system is connected. The insulation is wetted with amended water using the portable garden sprayer. The asbestos is cut and falls through the open sliding gate valve and collects in the waste bag. Vacuum in the bag and in the rest of the system is adjusted to prevent collapse of the bag. When the asbestos waste collected in the bag is almost full, the sliding gate valve is closed as the vacuum in the system is slowly controlled by adjusting the splitter valve, and the bag is carefully sealed and removed. A new bag is installed and the sliding gate valve opened. When all asbestos inside the glove bag is removed, the pipe and the wall of the glove bag above the middle zipper inside the bag are rinsed with amended water. The middle zipper is closed to isolate the upper compartment while vacuum is still being pulled. The tourniquet on either end of the glove bag is loosened and the bag is moved to the next position. The middle portion of the bag is unzipped and the work is continued Ex. 9&hyph;43). The panel members reported that the mean value of the exposure for the modified negative-pressure glove bag was 0.02 f/cc.
