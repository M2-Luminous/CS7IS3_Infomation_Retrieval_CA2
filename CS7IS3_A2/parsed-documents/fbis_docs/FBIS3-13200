SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that preliminary investigations have shown that these defendants received aid from a foreign country and were trained in the use of weapons in Afghanistan. They planned to carry out acts of sabotage in the Kingdom in order to destabilize the country and obstruct Jordan's democratic march. The public prosecutor accused all defendants of possessing and using explosives and automatic weapons and joining an illegal organization. It is noteworthy that the competent security organs recently confiscated some weapons and explosives in the possession of these defendants.
