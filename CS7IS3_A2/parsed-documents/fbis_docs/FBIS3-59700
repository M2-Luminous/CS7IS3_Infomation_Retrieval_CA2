Together with three gas utilities: Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas, 50kW and 100kW power plants are developing for commercialization. More than 60 units of 50kW and 100kW including NEDO's field testing plants are operating on customer's sites such as hotels, office buildings, factories and other places. In addition to 50kW and 100kW plants, Fuji is developing 500kW on-site PAFC plants in cooperation with Osaka Gas. The first prototype was installed at Osaka Gas for testing. Photo 1 [photo not reproduced] shows 500kW plant. After improvement of these prototype models to get better reliability, commercial models will be completed by 1996. Fuji has installed 77 PAFC test plants as shown in Table 1: 64 plants in 77 are on-site fuel cells, 4 plants are power plants for Electric Utilities. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

All equipment except the fuel cell stacks have been installed on site. Six 860kW stacks are being manufactured at the factory. The 5MW plant is planned to be completed in March 1994. For vehicular application, Fuji is participating in the DOE fuel cell bus program and manufacturing the first 50kW power system for a small prototype bus. Development of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fuji Electric has been developing planar solid oxide fuel cells since 1987. Development of a substrate type planar cell has been done under the NEDO Project since 1989 and a 410W stack using 10 cells of 200cm<sup> 2</sup> has operated successfully. The next target is to manufacture kW class stacks using larger size cells.
