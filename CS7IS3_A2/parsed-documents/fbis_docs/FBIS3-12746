The two sides addressed friendly bilateral relations and ways of enhancing them, as well as relations with the EC. They also discussed the latest developments in the region and in the peace process. Al-Hasan stressed the deep relations of friendship and cooperation between Jordan and both Greece and the EC. The special relations King Husayn has with European leaders have contributed a great deal to developing these relations. Al-Hasan reviewed the developments in the peace process and Jordan's important, pivotal role through its constant calls for achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. He also reviewed the tremendous, courageous efforts His Majesty King Husayn has made to advance the peace process toward its objectives in line with Resolutions 242 and 338 and the foundations of international legitimacy on which it was launched. These foundations are represented in Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national soil, ensuring Jordan's rights to territory and water, and resolving the problem of the refugees. Al-Hasan pointed out that Jordan has borne great burdens as a result of the repercussions of the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Gulf crisis, and its reception of successive waves of emigrants resulting from these crises -- including one in 1948, another in 1967, and ending with the Gulf crisis in 1991. This is in addition to the indebtedness and other financial burdens it has borne in this context. Al-Hasan noted the difficulties Jordan is facing as a result of the siege imposed on the Gulf of 'Aqabah, despite Jordan's commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy. Al-Hasan also briefed the guest on Jordan's democratic process and the eagerness of the leadership and the people to perpetuate and develop it in line with the principles of rule by the Constitution and legislation and respect for human rights. Minister al-Hasan noted his appreciation for the support and aid that the EC states have extended to Jordan and the region, as well as the EC's efforts to promote the peace process, particularly the multi-party negotiations. He also appreciated the EC's sponsorship of the economic development working group. He expressed hope that this aid will increase to enable Jordan to continue its important role in the peace process. The two sides also discussed the hideous massacre that the Israeli settlers committed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque during the dawn prayers last Friday in the blessed month of Ramadan. They emphasized their condemnation of this criminal act and stressed the need to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. They also stressed the need to disarm the settlers, and the importance of speeding up the achievement of a comprehensive peace that will end the regional conflict. For his part, the guest minister stressed the deep ties of friendship between Jordan and both his country and the EC states. Thanks to His Majesty King Husayn, these relations were established and consolidated through his strong friendly relations with their leaders, he said. The guest minister also said he appreciated his majesty's wise policy and courageous positions in support of a peace that will be accepted by the coming generations. The guest minister also stressed his understanding of the economic difficulties and burdens Jordan is facing as a result of its commitment to the peace process. He also noted appreciation for the important role Jordan is playing to serve the causes of peace, and stressed the need to support Jordan to continue this role. He lauded the democratic experience Jordan is living. The two sides reviewed relations between Greece [as heard] and the European states and the ways to consolidate and promote them in various fields. In this regard, the two sides noted their good bilateral political relations and the need to expand this in the economic, cultural, tourist, air transport, and other fields. Regarding relations with the EC states, the two sides agreed on the importance of convening the Jordanian-European Commission Joint Cooperation Council as soon as possible.
