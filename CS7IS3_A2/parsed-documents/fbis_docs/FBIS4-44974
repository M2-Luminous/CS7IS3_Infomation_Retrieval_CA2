A parliamentarian should certainly have known, much more than an ordinary citizen, that the sage Purushottam Das Tandon gave a statement in the Lok Sabha nearly 28 years ago. This statement was given in the context of Nehru's request to obtain approval of an announcement to grant to Zhou Enlai the highways built by the government of British India, the transportation and communication system from Leh to Lhasa, and the right of India to freely trade in Tibet. The reply given by the Indian government in Parliament during the three-day international Parliamentary conference on Tibet now held in Delhi, was the complete opposite of the statement of Mr. Tandon. (See Lok Sabha narrative - May, 1956.) The description in the Indian Constitution of the fundamental duties of the country's citizens is given in paragraph 51-k of chapter 4 as follows: "It is the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to develop in the populace the scientific viewpoint, humanism and a feeling of purifying investigation." At the root of this duty we find that branch of the mountain routes described by Panini which go from Leh to Lhasa, on which India's Shak traders traveled through mountain passes to enter the present Kumaon These passes are approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. It was extremely terrifying to cross these passes by sliding down the ice of contiguous mountain peaks. Shak traders passing through the "snaky roads", their sheep and cows loaded with goods from Central Asia, tied spears and sticks cross-wise across their bodies to avoid being buried in the invisible cracks of ice-boulders. Therefore these routes were also called "spear paths". History tells us that in 640 AD, in this country called Kirat Mandal, ruled the Khus (Shak) King Chan Gampo (Sog Chang Gampo). He married the daughter of India's Khus King Anshu Verma and for her established Shivalaya near Kailash Mansarovar. He also married China's princess and established Pota la Vihar in the east in Rasa (now Lhasa). A descendant of this king in 747 AD invited Acharya Padmasambhav from Nalanda University. At his command, he built Buddhist monastries in his country in the Magadh architectural style. During the next 400 years Buddhist monastries and abbeys were built in all of Central Asia. When Marco Polo from Venice reached the court of Mongolia's ruler, the ruler Kubbla Khan could not decide which religion he should follow. He requested the Polo brothers to bring with them preachers of the Christian religion in their second visit to Mongolia. He also asked them to bring some holy oil from the temple in Jerusalem. The two Christian missionaries with whom Polo had started out, did not have the courage to travel beyond Syria, and returned home. Thus Kubbla Khan took initiation into the Buddhist religion, and endeavored to make the Kailash Mansarovar area a center of Buddhist religion, similar to the center that then Rome was of the Christian religion. It was made compulsory for the religious king of the Buddhist country (Ta Bodh) to remain a bachelor and a teetotaller. The word Ta Bodh of the Italavi language was called Tibate by Jesuit priests and became Tibbat (Tibet) in English. The age-old commerce of the northern routes, spread over all three continents of the ancient world, was at its peak during the Mughal era. The Mughals had great allegiance and devotion towards Central Asia, especially Samarkand. At the time of Akbar, Samarkand was the learning center of the Arab world. Many philosophers and teachers in his court were from Samarkand. Babar was born in Turkemanistan and was enthroned in Samarkand at the age of twelve. Babar's ancestor Taimurlung had made the capitals and markets located on the ancient Central Asian trade routes the target of his barbarism. In 1393 A.D. he had looted the grand city of the Caliphs, modern Iraq's capital Baghdad, and had captured Moscow in the north. Only three years later he had destroyed Delhi. Then in 1401 A.D., he had destroyed western Asia's largest trade center Damascus, and had defeated Egypt's armies. Having killed thousands there, he had reached Ankara in 1403 AD. At that time the ancient northern trade route had become Taimurlung's military route. At the time of Kumaon's king Udyot Chand (1678-1699 AD), the border of the Kumaon kingdom reached the western shore of the Karnali river. In the north it bordered Taklakot and in the south reached the Karnali river flowing between Bahraich and Kheeri districts. Indians were allowed to freely visit Kailash Mansarovar. Border traders roamed Central Asia's markets for six months without interference, and arranged for their own safety on trade routes. The British government, patient for 45 years, felt the imminent loss of Tibet. Finally the British government sent a group of representatives from the Indian border towards Tibet, but they were stopped 24 kilometers inside Tibet. Then Lord Curzon, under the leadership of Sir Francis Young Husbandsman, sent armed forces to attack Lhasa. In March 1904 the British army murdered 700 unarmed Tibetans. In August of the same year, Sir Young reached Lhasa. He did not find any representatives from Russia there. A fine of 7.5 million rupees was imposed on Tibet by the British government. A treaty was signed with the condition that its Chumbi valley area would be under British control for 74 years for the collection of this fine, so that 100,000 rupees could be collected every year. The British home department reached an agreement with Russia and also sent a proposal to China in 1907 that if China would pay the fine imposed on Lhasa, the British would give up their right to Chumbi valley. Thus China got an invaluable opportunity to gain control over all of Tibet for 7.2 million rupees. According to the agreement of 1906, the British government obtained full freedom to trade with Tibet. There are more than a dozen mountain passes from Almora and Garhwal districts running towards Tibet. Free trade commenced through all of these. Indian British soldiers were deployed for the protection of these routes. Military outposts were built from place to place. Mail collectors and mule operators who carried mail to India, began to travel to and from Almora. This arrangement would continue for nearly six months every year. After that soldiers were appointed at every outpost in Tibet to protect the government treasury. British trade agents would stay in Gabyang for a few days, then come to Calcutta, and after 1911 to Delhi. In the protection of trade routes, terrible accidents would sometimes occur due to sudden floods. In 1947, in the flood of Myantsay, hundreds of Indian soldiers were killed along with Captain Nagar and Major Nagpal. After the flood subsided Subedar Budh Singh dug up from the river sand 100,000 rupees that had been swept away when the government treasury building was destroyed. Almost 150 bodies were found in the dry river bed when the flood waters receded. After the cash and other valuable military goods were handed over to the Indian government, Subedar Budh Singh and the entire mountain populace were proud of the responsibility for its supervision. When Nehru handed over the entire administrative estate to Zhou Enlai, the northern mountain dwellers were deeply hurt.
