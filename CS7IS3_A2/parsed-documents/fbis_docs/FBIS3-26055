CITIC General Manager Wang Jin, and Sun Changji, vice minister of machine building industry, attended the ceremony together with more than 20,000 staff members and workers, and cut the ribbon. The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory was one of the 156 key projects established by the state during the First Five-Year Plan. In the last 35 years, this large enterprise, with fixed assets of 420 million yuan, has provided a large amount of equipment for basic industries including the coal, metallurgical, building materials, mining, and electric power industries. But this factory lacks self-accumulation and self-transformation capacity, its equipment has become seriously obsolete and its stamina is inadequate. Therefore it is difficult to accomplish anything big in market competition. The general manager of the the CITIC Heavy-Duty Machinery Company said: Introducing the shareholding system is a new way out for large and medium-sized state enterprises. Our purpose in selecting CITIC, which is a solid financial group, is to move ahead faster and better in introducing the shareholding system. As a branch company of CITIC, the Heavy-Duty Machinery Company still maintains the status of legal person and assumes sole responsibility for its losses and profits in its independent operation.
