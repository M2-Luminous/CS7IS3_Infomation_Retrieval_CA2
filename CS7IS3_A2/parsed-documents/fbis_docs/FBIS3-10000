[Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We in the OCL ask all conscientious and nationalistic parliamentarians to choose one of these three resolutions that can (?contribute) to the welfare of the Haitian people. We in the OCL ask that the Haitian Army -- in the event that the parliament cannot do its job of choosing one of the three resolutions -- go into action and form a military junta. That military junta should (?direct) the National Palace so it can manage the Haitian crisis and lead the country properly until elections are held. [end recording]
