There Is Only One Way Not To Freeze--Get Moving'"] [Text] The announcement concerning the establishment in Ukraine of the International Fund of Humanitarian and Economic Relations With the Russian Federation has already made the rounds of practically all radio, television, and newspaper editorial offices. The restraint of the commentaries on the fact was absolutely amazingly offset by the tone of voice of the announcers, or by the style of exposition of the journalists. So one heard or read a suppressed: "Well, at last!" It goes without saying that, although the unnatural confrontation of our countries and peoples is brief in an historical space of time, it has frayed nerves, and it has very strongly dampened spirits. Now people are continually calling up and are asking with what and how they can assist the development of the new fund, and they are placing great hopes on it. But, apparently, not only hopes. Some are also tormented by doubts. Has not its ex-prime minister conceived of returning Ukraine to the old times? Vitold Pavlovich himself explained during the meeting how during the presentation of the fund he had received a note (the only one of its kind) whose author--a people's deputy--was amazed by everything: From the number of stars in the emblem to the title. He was almost ready to accuse the founders of the new formation of espionage in favor of Russia, and he did not at all share the happiness of those in attendance. In general, our extensive conversation today with the ideological inspirer, creator, and president of the fund, Vitold Pavlovich Fokin, was prompted both by good wishes and harsh necessity. We will also construct it in the same key, alternating the free and easy interview "with a line of protocol," that is to say, a document that is a report on the triumph of the presentation. But, then, whatever one sees in this--nostalgia or very sound and timely thoughts--let it be a matter that is left to the readers. Thus.... "Has Life Really Improved Because We Destroyed the Bastille?" [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, first of all, accept the sincerest greetings that arrive at the editorial office for you as the head of the fund, and wishes for its prosperity. Now allow me to ask, with what kind of wonderful forces were you able in such a short period of time (on 16 November, we reported on the constituent meeting, and already the registration and presentation have taken place) to start such a grandiose undertaking--the International Fund for Humanitarian and Economic Relations With the Russian Federation?" [Fokin] You know, it would be biased to say that this idea arose just now and was instantly implemented. The story here is not simple, like everything else that has occurred here in recent times. When the first government of an independent Ukraine was replaced, the relations between the structures of the executive authority of Ukraine and Russia were noticeably "strained." I do not want to blame anyone personally, but statements of gentlemen--who got into key positions in the Cabinet of Ministers on the "general list"--began to be leaked more and more frequently to the press. I do not think that this was being done, as they say, out of stupidity. They were guided more frequently by a desire to do what was in vogue and to curry favor with influential politicians, who by virtue of clear reasons were unable to comprehend the complicated interweaving of the mutual production ties that had developed over dozens of years between the subjects of Ukraine and Russia. Some of the mass media organs of both countries also prospered in this unseemly matter. And then at that time, the end of last year, the thought occurred: Voluntary self-isolation and the policy of autonomization of production do not respond to the national interests of the state. You must not, as Englishmen say, throw stones at your neighbor if you yourself live in a glass house. By curtailing the export of products to Russia and violating an already strained payments balance with that country, it is impossible to count on the stable delivery to Ukraine of oil, gas, lumber materials, and other products. Such actions make an energy crisis inevitable. Cooperative ties must not be disrupted--this will lead only to a complete shutdown of enterprises. Is it really possible not to take a real fact into consideration: Only 20 percent of the total number of industrial enterprises of Ukraine have a closed production cycle? And further. The entire world is fighting for sales markets. But we pass off as a great achievement the reduction of exports to Russia of such types of products that are traditional for Russia as, for example, sugar. The world market is oversaturated with favorite commodities, and Russia, having overcome some bewilderment, has renewed contracts and begun to receive sugar from other importers. What did Ukraine win from this? Discussions about the fact that Russia allegedly switched to mutual settlements at world prices in a unilateral procedure also seem to be idle talk. It is enough to look over the protocols of the summit meeting in Dagomys to become convinced of the opposite. In short, it became clear as early as in December of last year that without close cooperation with enterprises and organizations of Russia, and without an honest and businesslike partnership on a principally new and mutually beneficial basis, the newly constituted government (like, moreover, any other) will not be able to lead the state out of the crisis. From V. Fokin's Report at the Presentation of the Fund To our great regret, the political and economic differences between Ukraine and Russia are becoming more noticeable of late. The states are literally drifting in opposite directions. This is equally unsafe for the people of both countries and is equally negatively perceived by the people. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the most decisive measures so that what is still a small crack does not become an abyss. That which we have today--cooled-down blast furnaces, idle rolling mills, stalled motor vehicles, curtailed television programs--all of this will also turn into a misfortune for Russian enterprises as well. I believe in the courage and selflessness of our people, and in their ability to overcome difficulties and to defend their statehood. But is it moral to rely only on the infinite patience of the people? Let us recall history. "You have achieved what you wanted," the Parisians told the leaders of the great French Revolution, "but what did we get out of it? Has life really gotten better because we destroyed the Bastille?" Substitute the word "Commonwealth" for the word "Bastille," and this question will sound quite pressing. However, it is not a question of reviving old ties, and it is not about resurrecting the former state structures and the "fraternal embrace" imposed from above. It is impossible to restore them. It is necessary to establish principally new relations whose basis will be economic expediency, mutual gains, reciprocal trust, and an honest partnership. Not one government is capable of achieving this without public support. The unity and goodwill of the entire society is necessary for this. There Are Questions.... [Menzhulina] A great number of all kinds of treaties and agreements were adopted during the period of the creation of the CIS. What was the problem, and why did they not work for unity and mutually advantageous contacts? [Fokin] Initially, the treaty on cooperation of the independent states provided for the creation of a kind of coordination center, with its quarters in the capital of Belarus--Minsk. After a certain time, this was rejected for well-known reasons. Therefore, the state agreements and treaties that were being concluded on a bilateral and multilateral basis lost even a minimum capability of functioning, inasmuch as there was a lack not only of a mechanism of responsibility, but even control over its fulfillment. In addition, Russia, while conducting a policy of rapid destatization and privatization, more than two years ago abandoned the practice of the state order, thereby losing (in contrast to Ukraine) the right to conclude a treaty concerning mutual deliveries, inasmuch as it stopped being the de facto owner of produced products. In general, this also led to this kind of conclusion: Cooperation between two states, basically, should move to the plane of business partnership of enterprises and organizations. This is what was done in practice. After the elimination of the central planning and distribution organs, economic life continued only where production ties between enterprises were preserved. By creating the fund, its founders were not thinking of replacing the government, and especially of operating counter to its decisions. Our task is to assume functions that are not peculiar to the state under the new economic conditions. First and foremost, to assist the producer irrespective of the form of ownership. Retaining for itself the right of legislative initiative, we will submit appropriate drafts to the government for examination. From the Report at the Presentation It is becoming more and more difficult to link up our production, financial, and state interests. We are already at different levels. Russia, in spite of serious political and social shocks, has moved much farther along the path of reform. A majority of the large enterprises have been converted to joint-stock companies. Practically the entire population has been involved in this. The securities market is working energetically, and this is one of the most important indices of the market economy. The actual convertibility of the ruble is stimulating small and average business. Important changes are occurring in the psychology of the people. Russia's public is already thinking in new categories. Therefore, it is becoming more and more difficult for a director, for example, of a Ukrainian state plant to conduct negotiations with his own Russian partner--the head of a joint-stock company. But it is necessary and possible to overcome difficulties. Labor collectives of former subcontractors remain, and directors are left who know their colleagues from what now already are neighboring countries, and they maintain friendly relations with them. They have all felt the effects of the artificially violated cooperation on their own problems. That is why the idea of the creation of a nongovernmental organization that would speak in support of the intensification, coordination, and development of Ukrainian-Russian relations immediately found an enormous number of supporters. Organizing business relations and close partnership with the Russian Federation in the most diverse spheres of human endeavor is an objectively recognized necessity. "Every Fruit Should Ripen" [Menzhulina] Did you not have problems with registering the fund? I wonder what response the idea on its creation had "at the top?" [Fokin] From time to time, I did not want to disclose my intention. I was not confident that I would be supported if I came out in March or April. At that time, everyone was going around with raised spirits and satisfied that they had got through the winter and finished the sowing. They could have said: Why do we need this fund, which directs its own activity at the creation of production and economic relations with Russia, when we also were not born yesterday? Now, this will not be said. And not only because a real threat hangs over millions of socially unprotected citizens of Ukraine. I hope that there will be no starvation. The state does have grain. But it is impossible to live day by day. It is necessary to think about the coming year, about work under winter conditions, and to organize a normal, decent life. Under these conditions, I think, with the help of the fund, it will be possible to arrive at a resolution of many problems. When I acquainted the president with my desire, I immediately met with his approval, and I felt support. Leonid Makarovich read the first variant of the charter and appended his resolution: The matter is very interesting, worth doing, and it is necessary to implement it as rapidly as possible. Specialists of the Ministry of Justice and Minister V.V. Onopenko himself gave us good support. Despite substantial remarks, corrections, and additions, there was no barrier against registration. The constituent assembly was conducted just as quickly and effectively. [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, could you outline the circle of friends of the fund from the Ukrainian and Russian sides? [Fokin] Clearly, the leaders of the most competent and largest organizations and enterprises had the final say. I am extremely grateful to Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, Larisa Ivanovna Khorolets.... We were supported by the metallurgists and machine builders and, moreover, by the workers and leadership of such flagships of industry as Yuzhmash, the Malyshev Plant, Luganskteplovoz, the Dnepropetrovsk electric locomotive building plant, the NPO [scientific production association] imeni Korolev, the Kiev radio plant, and many others. All at once, a circle of like-thinkers took shape: Gennadiy Petrovich Levchenko, Vladimir Ilich Kassov, Yuriy Sergeyevich Alekseyev, Bogdan Nikolayevich Lishchin, Dmitriy Gavrilovich Topchiy.... Well, I cannot name all of them. The founders of the fund from Russia were: The Russian Lumber Producers Corporation, the Izhevsk joint-stock company Bummash and the joint-stock company Investles, the Krasnoyarsk machine building plant, the Kotlass pulp and paper combine, and others. "If There Is Grain, There Will Be Singing" [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, the founding documents assign first place to humanitarian relations, but life's realities are such that the economy, nevertheless, comes first. Does this mean that economic relations will have priority? [Fokin] There is a saying among the people: If there is grain, there will be singing. Of course, a nation cannot exist without spirituality and culture. But the economy really comes first, because society, as long as it exists, is compelled to consume. But this also means, to produce. As soon as this chain is broken, catastrophe is inevitable. [Menzhulina] If you were the head of government today and someone established such a fund, how would you perceive this? [Fokin] But of course, I would support such an idea and would bring the initiators closer, and I would grant them broad powers. I also expect the same attitude from the present government. I am glad that the Cabinet of Ministers has already demonstrated its goodwill, at least by the fact that it was almost fully represented at the presentation. But we are only at the start of a long path. There is a sea of difficulties. For the time being, we have no material base, we have no place to quarter ourselves, and we have not established a charter fund. But, as the saying goes, there is a time for everything. It is important now to understand and to adopt objectively: The fund is created, it exists, and it has begun to work. From the Report at the Presentation One of the reasons for the critical condition of many enterprises and organizations is the artificially created barriers for ways to process payment documents. One of our tasks is to be a reliable helper of the commodity producers in the resolution of this problem. I think that we are capable of removing this tension, at least partially, from the members of the fund. For this purpose, a specially designated bank credit system will be established jointly with Russian partners. The fund intends to offer material and methodical assistance to state organizations and representatives of the private sector of the economy engaged in the creation of new capacities and increasing the existing capacities of functioning industries that produce industrial and household and cultural commodities. We will conduct a purposeful search for partners for the development of projects of destatization, privatization, and conversion to joint-stock companies. Appropriate proposals will be submitted to government structures. The fund is preparing to finance the work of expert groups whose members will be leading specialists of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries. We also have one extraordinary function--to perform as the guarantor of the founders. The fund has already today united the enormous scientific-intellectual and financial-material potential that its founders possess. With time, they will be joined by new social and scientific organizations, industrial, construction, and transport enterprises, and by the agrarian economy. I do not doubt that this will be of interest not only to domestic, but also to foreign investors. The fund will also be able to assist in the resolution of such a complicated problem as providing consumers with electricity. We are not relying very much on the effectiveness of interstate relations on this question. It seems that a program of investment of the energy complex of Russia on joint ownership rights is significantly more effective. We are also setting ourselves the task of collecting and disseminating truthful and objective information about the condition of social life in Ukraine. It is no secret that of late both the Ukrainian and Russian mass media seem to be competing in prejudices. And for this, it is not at all mandatory to misinterpret or distort facts. It is enough to permit only those reports on the air or in newspaper columns that carry in themselves a frankly negative charge. The constituent conference discussed the question of publishing Ukrainian newspapers in Russia. With time, proposals will be studied regarding the establishment of general Ukrainian-Russian information agencies--television and radio channels. Several words regarding the liberalization of foreign economic relations. It is not a great honor to be a dependent. Therefore, in directing the activity of the fund, we will acquire the understanding and support of world opinion, close cooperation with all international states, and public, religious, and of other organizations that are considering overcoming the crisis situation in Ukraine, raising the standard of living, and creating conditions for the democratic transformation of our society as a problem of international significance, and as a guarantee of peace and security in Europe. Our fund also has a humanitarian direction. The difficulties of the transition period are hitting first and foremost public education and health services specifically. Therefore, among the main tasks of the fund is real support of the social and cultural sphere. In Place of an Epilogue [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, our readers would not understand us if we passed over the question in our interview with you about today's alarming situation. Ukraine and its people are literally feverish from inescapable problems. In your opinion, as a former head of the government, where is the error, and wherein lies a possible solution? [Fokin] The main thing is to preserve peace and unity, and to work for the future. That which we now hear from various sides--protests, warnings about possible strikes, reproaches directed at the leadership of the country--all of this, unfortunately, is not groundless. But it is necessary to display self-restraint and lawfulness, and we must support the new elections to parliament. Of course, the situation is very difficult for the leaders of trade unions and the workers' movement. Their sacred duty is to defend the interests and to achieve the social protection of all elements of society, but, first and foremost, of the workers. And nevertheless, while insisting on an increase in wages, they must understand that it is impossible to pull a very short blanket over everyone. The state is not in a condition to protect all members of society equally. I, in principle, support the plan of the Cabinet of Ministers to develop a program of national salvation, if it only determines who specifically the state should take under its guardianship. I am convinced that this is pensioners, invalids, children in large families, servicemen, and student youth. Scientific, cultural, health servicing, and educational organizations retain a special status. Only they have a right to enjoy subsidies from the budget. And even the super-important branches of production should not receive any kind of subsidy. At the same time, the focus should be placed on the regional organs of administration. And the budget should be developed from below, taking into account the local requirements and capabilities for social protection. The national salvation budget can be developed in half a year with a breakdown into quarters. As for able-bodied citizens, let them not be offended by me, they will have to work with blood and sweat--apparently there is not enough "blanket" for them. They will have to work like the people worked in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and other countries. No one there measured the duration of a work week. There was no other way out. As it is here now. [Begin boxed item] From the Congratulatory Letters of the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia to the Fund Founders "Ukraine attaches exceptional significance to the development of multilateral and equal relations with all countries of the world and at all levels: interstate, interdepartmental, and between individual people, organizations, and enterprises. But it is my profound conviction that we should have special partnership relations with Russia. Therefore, achievement of the objectives that the fund has set for itself--to promote the improvement and development of Ukrainian-Russian ties on a nongovernmental level and in the humanitarian, economic, and ecological spheres--will, undoubtedly, be very useful for the strengthening of mutual understanding, friendship, and all-around cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. "I sincerely congratulate your founders on the initiation of activity. [Signed] Leonid KRAVCHUK" * * * "I think that your fund, by uniting its efforts with the Fund of Humanitarian and Economic Cooperation With Ukraine that is now being formed in Russia, can bring many benefits. Communications between the citizens of our countries and the development of Russian-Ukrainian economic contacts and ties are really capable of bettering the life of the people. "I sincerely congratulate you and all of the participants in the fund with its presentation, and I wish you great success. With a profound belief in friendship between Russia and Ukraine.
