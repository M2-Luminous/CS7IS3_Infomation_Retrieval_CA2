Despite a national outcry against a proliferation of weapons, .303 rifles are being sold for as little as R34.10 [rand]. The price is less than the cost of a packet of 20 cartridges at dealers or the R50 revenue stamp on a police licence to possess a firearm legally. Ammunition for the .303s is sold by the army at 28c [cents] a round. Many serving officers and citizen force members, the majority white, have jumped at the offer, and some have resold the weapons as hunting rifles through gunshops, making hundreds of rands profit out of the ex-army stock. Lieutenant-Colonel Brian du Toit of the Directorate of Communications of the army confirmed that the sale of the .303s was continuing. He said that, in terms of army regulations, the following people qualified to buy the weapons: - Serving members of the permanent force, citizen force and commandos who have completed five years' continuous service; - Members of the permanent force who are retiring after 20 years; - Veterans of World War 2 if they can provide a service certificate. In the past .38 Special revolvers were also sold in the same way but were no longer available, Lieutenant-Colonel du Toit said. ANC MP and former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] commander Ronnie Kasrils, who served on the defence sub-council of the TEC and works closely with Defence Minister Joe Modise, said yesterday he was taking up the matter immediately with Mr Modise with a view to having the sale of the weapons investigated. [passage omitted] Ministry of Defence spokesman Das Herbst said he believed the sales were "a continuation of an old policy". [passage omitted]
