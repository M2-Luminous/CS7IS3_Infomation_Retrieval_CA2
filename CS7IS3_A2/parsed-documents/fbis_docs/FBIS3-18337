In the Chinese capital on Monday [28 February], Sir Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi co-chaired the 13th meeting of the joint EU-China committee which is due to last two days and during which the main subject of discussion will be China's reentry to the GATT. Their first joint press conference held yesterday was marked by a quite sharp exchange on the Hong Kong question. Wu Yi, who judged Great Britain's attitude as "unfriendly and uncooperative," warned that it could not but affect the economic and trade relationship between the two countries. Brittan then stressed that relations between the EU and China were based on nondiscrimination with regard to EU member states. "Any discriminatory action against a member state for political reasons would be a very serious matter, not just for that member state but for the EU as a whole," he warned, without specifying what action could be taken. It does, however, seem clear that Europe's support for Chinese membership in GATT carries considerable weight. China accuses the British governor of Hong Kong of seeking to introduce without its consent democratic reforms for the colony which is due to return to Chinese rule in 1997. Apart from the matter of the British colony, the two parties displayed optimism, describing yesterday's working session as "frank and constructive." Brittan stated that Brussels was "full of admiration" for the efforts made by Beijing to move toward a market economy, even if differences remain on certain points. "There are problems to be solved as China's development is remarkable but incomplete," he said, adding that the conditions for reentry to GATT "must be negotiated in order to speed up the process of reform and liberalization." Sir Leon also spoke of Europe's concern on the human rights issue, and submitted a draft protocol on European proposals with a view to settling outstanding questions, expressing the hope that "progress can be made in this field without delay." For her part, Mrs Wu accepted that differences of opinion remained, stressing however that the two parties were determined to make the necessary efforts to resolve them. According to one Western diplomat, the EU is worried by the fact that China may reach an agreement with the United States concerning its reentry to the GATT in return for trade concessions which would be detrimental to Europe.
