Jing Tianliang, president of the China National Coal Industry Import and Export Corp. (CNCIE), said that China's coal export this year is expected to exceed 20.2 million tons, hitting a new record. By 2000, he said, China's coal export is estimated to be more than 30 million tons. Jing's company, specializing in handling coal exports, was founded in 1982, when only about 6.4 million tons of Chinese coal was sold abroad. However, China's coal exports have since increased by an average 1.4 million tons, or ten percent, each year to reach 20.2 million tons in 1992. The aggregate export in those ten years amounted to 160 million tons, worth more than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars, Jing said. However, Jing termed such a volume as "inappropriate to China's status as the world's leading coal producer". In 1993 China's coal production stood at 1.14 billion tons, ranking first in the world, its exports accounted for only 1.6 percent; the coal trade volume in the world the same year was nearly 420 million tons, China had a barely 4.5 percent market share. Under these circumstances, Jing said, China should join in the competition in the world market to enhance its profile. This will contribute to the development of China's coal industry, as well as its economic growth, he added. The domestic coal market remains stagnant while the demand on the world market is beginning to revive. From January to May this year CNCIE exported 8.6 million tons of coal, which Jiang said was an encouraging sign. Market analysts predicted a reasonable increase in coal demand around the world, especially in Asia, in the coming years. This will push prices up, they said. CNCIE said it would carry out a multi-polarized export strategy and make use of flexible trade methods. "We will try every method as long as it helps to increase coal exports; we will be open and equal to every customer, whether new or old," Jing said. The corporation has won the confidence of customers in nearly 20 countries and regions, including Japan, South Korea, France and Italy. Its exports are conducted mainly through long-term contractual trade, with Asia being its principal market target. Jing said his company will work jointly with modern coalmines such as Datong, Pingshuo, Yanzhou and Zaozhuang, which are prominent among other things in terms of mining conditions and economic efficiency, to build coal export bases. For example, he said, the coal mined in Yanzhou, in east China's Shandong Province, is famous for its good quality, low ash and sulphur contents and high caloric value. However, he acknowledged that China still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the world's leading coal exporters such as Australia, the United States, South Africa and Canada. "We must raise coal quality, improve transportation, port storage and ship loading, and harmonize every link in the chain from coal production to export, so as to make China's coal more competitive on the world market," he said.
