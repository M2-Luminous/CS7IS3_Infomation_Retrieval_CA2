Ashot Manucharyan, the president's former adviser on national security affairs, spoke about that measure during his press conference yesterday and described it as the work of the special services of countries hostile to Armenia. He came to that conclusion in the presence of reporters by "shattering" all official and unofficial theories published in the press. According to Manucharyan, the said decree practically annihilated the SANS and destroyed the network of agents and that this helps only the special services of hostile nations because the official measure--that is to suspend the Administration's work for 3 months and to certify its staff--is unacceptable. After all, he said, the staff could be certified without suspending their activities. Mr Manucharyan added that the said decree must definitely be reconsidered and that a special commission must be created to review the process by which that decision was taken and to find the culprits. He added: "The hostile hand must be found as soon as possible."
