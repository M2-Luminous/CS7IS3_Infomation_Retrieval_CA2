The efforts of United Nations, NATO, international organizations and the biggest countries to eliminate the Bosnian conflict produced the results. We support the idea of passing Sarajevo's administration to United Nations and expansion of the peace zones in other parts of Bosnia. Although Lithuania is separated from Bosnia by more than a thousand kilometres, we are not indifferent to the senseless massacre in Europe. Unfortunately, in some other European countries the situation is not stable as well, so similar conflicts should be prevented beforehand. Lithuania is interested in peaceful, but determined and more coordinated actions of the international community in regulating the conflict in Bosnia.
