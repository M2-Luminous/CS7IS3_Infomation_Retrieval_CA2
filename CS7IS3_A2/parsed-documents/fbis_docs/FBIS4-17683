Government Approves Basic Spheres of Social Policy for 1994"] [Text] The Russian Government has determined "the stabilization of the living standard of Russian Federation citizens, with its subsequent rise as the economy develops" as the target of its social policy for 1994. This target has been drawn up in a document adopted 21 April at a sitting of the Russian Federation Government Presidium -- Main Guidelines of the Russian Federation Government's Social Policy for 1994. The document stresses that the "Russian Federation Government proceeds on the premise that a fruitful and considered social policy is a vital condition for continuing reforms, strengthening their social base, and improving the sociopolitical situation in the country." The following main guidelines of social policy for 1994 are envisaged: the creation of economic and legal conditions to give an incentive to the active, able-bodied section of society to ensure its own prosperity through highly productive work; support for optimum correlations between the income of the active part of the population and disabled citizens; the provision of basic social guarantees; and the prevention of mass unemployment. In order to put these aims into effect in 1994, the government intends to concentrate its efforts on preventing a reduction in the population's real monetary income, ensuring an equitable balance of economic interests and material possibilities of hired workers, entrepreneurs, and disabled citizens... Summing up the discussion, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the reform of taxation, to which he attaches prime significance, should be the key element in conducting policy in the social sphere. According to him, taxes "should not be detrimental to the citizens." The government Presidium also examined the draft federal program for assisting with job placements for the population in 1994, presented by the Federal Employment Service. Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, chief of the Federal Employment Service, noted that its activity will mainly extend to able-bodied citizens who have work, but are at risk of losing it, as well as to those who are unemployed and are registered at the organs of the state employment service. Potential "partial" unemployment during 1994 is put at between 5 million and 8 million people. Fedor Prokopov also predicts that the risk of citizens' losing their jobs will be increased -- the total number of workers who will be released from their jobs in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. The work force supply on the labor market will also grow; the number of citizens who do not have work or have lost it, and are seeking work, will exceed 12 million people. In the sphere of economic support for employment, the government intends to curb the cutback of economically expedient posts and those posts which are promising for the long term, and promote the growth of investment activity which creates new posts. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, job-placement measures for graduates of schools and higher educational establishments have been insufficiently thought through in the program, and investment programs in whose implementation the unemployed could be involved fully or partially have not been taken into consideration. A government commission headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov has been created for further work on the federal program.
