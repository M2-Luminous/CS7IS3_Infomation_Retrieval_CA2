Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Penchev, Defense Ministry parliamentary secretary Nencho Nenchev, and Lieutenant General Lyuben Pekhlivanov, deputy commander of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, were also present. Two issues were discussed -- the declaration of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion and the petition organized by the legion's officers and members in connection with the defense budget, which has already been adopted. Colonel Stefan Dervishev, commander of one of the units, said that no more than 10 officers in the Khaskovo Division are members of the officer legion. He urged the participants not to connect the opinion of the officers in the division and the garrison with the opinion of a few officers. The commander of the 2d Army said: As a member of the Military Council of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, the Ground Troops Military Council, and commander of the 2d Army, I think it is high time to stop speculating about the Army, and 2d Army personnel support that position. The officers of our Army do not rebel. A difficult year lies ahead, and our main concern is combat training -- more specifically, how to conduct training with the means that we have been allocated. Deputy Defense Minister Penchev thinks that most of the officer legion members who signed the petition have done so with a pure heart and a desire to help. However, he dissociated himself from the form utilized by the legion members.
