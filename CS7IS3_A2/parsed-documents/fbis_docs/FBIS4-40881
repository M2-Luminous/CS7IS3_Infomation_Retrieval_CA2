As a candidate for the presidency of the Republic of Belarus, I am ready to take upon myself the responsibility of expressing and defending the interests of the people of my Republic by constitutional means. I am convinced that the primary goals of our people and our state are peace and accord, security, material prosperity, revival of national culture, strengthening of democracy and lawfulness, and observance of human rights and freedoms. Belarus should create a society of high economic effectiveness and social justice, which guarantees the right to employment, free-of-charge secondary [bazovoye] education and medical service, as well as pension and social protection. The state is called to create conditions allowing every man to secure his family's living by means of his own work. These are hard times for all of us. Securing our statehood and economy is a difficult task. Notwithstanding all measures taken by me, the disruption of traditional economic ties, as well as political and economic instability in our partner countries have not been conducive to stabilizing our economic situation. We are shouldering a heavy burden of costs connected with the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe. The Republic has been left practically alone in the face of this misfortune. National income and the standard of living have decreased. Belarus, as other countries of the CIS and East Europe, was not able to join the world economy for objective reasons. A new social and economic system for the organization of society has not been formed. A legislation basis for deep transformation and a mechanism for implementing resolutions has not been created. Such is the truth about our life. This is our fault and our misery. However, notwithstanding these extremely difficult circumstances, our population has been provided, through superior efforts, with all the basics: electricity, heat, gas, foodstuffs. Our industry, agriculture, culture, science, and education have not been allowed to break down. The manageability of our economy and the social achievements of the people have been preserved. National accord in our society has been preserved. We live in peace and friendship with other nations. We have eliminated many barriers in relations between Belarus and Russia, as well as taken the first steps toward our economic unification. We defeated fascism together, we will overcome the crisis together, we should head toward the future together! I heartily thank you, all the people, for your great wisdom and endurance, selfless labor, and faith in our Belarus during this hard period in our history. This gives strength to my assurance that we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles on the way toward a worthy and prosperous life. I appeal to the people of Belarus, the soviets at all levels, trade unions, all parties and movements to unite our efforts to overcome the crisis and to lead our Republic toward normal development. I do not belong to any party, and I will defend the interests of all citizens regardless of their political views and their ideological or religious beliefs. The interests of the people come first for me. I believe that the president should serve his people honestly and be a guarantor of the Constitution, as well as civil rights and freedoms. I will create every possible condition for the revival and development of the national culture and the Belarusian language. I will guarantee the right to profess any religion. The people of Belarus should live in dignity, without fear for the future, and be proud of themselves and their Motherland! I will resolutely and uncompromisingly fight corruption and crime. I will safeguard personal immunity and protection from interference in the individual's personal life. Our way is that of a civilized humane nation, the way without ruining the existing social achievements, the way of rational transformations without impoverishing the people. I definitely oppose the ruining of our national intellectual potential -- the Republic's most valuable possession; I oppose the decreasing of the social significance of intellectual work and the immigration of intelligentsia. I will not allow any manifestation of militant nationalism and chauvinism, as well as any political confrontation with neighboring countries or others. I believe that inciting ethnic feuds is a grave crime. There are, and will always be, "second-class" citizens in Belarus. I reject violence as a means of resolving political and interethnic problems. I am against economic isolationism, against unreasoned sociological and economic experiments, against pseudo-reforms. I will be consequently seeking rapprochement, as well as the strengthening and development of cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, and other democratic states of the world community. The future of our nation lies in the health and prosperity of our children today. I guarantee the president's special attention to the protection of maternity and childhood. I will seek additional preferential measures for working women and mothers. I will propose a national program, "The Future of Belarus," which will not only protect, but also develop national health. The Republic of Belarus Should Have a New Social and Economic System The basis for a new social and economic system should be the Constitution, the principles of national security, economic effectiveness, and social justice, and the need for harmonizing interests of all segments of society. Economic Transformations Should Serve Each and All the People It is necessary to establish the priority of economic over political interest and to create a system of civilized management of the economy without administrative restrictions. I see the creation of a new social and economic system in Belarus as connected with structural transformations in all spheres, above all, with the distribution of ownership and the optimization of money and credit system, financial relations, tax policies, the implementation of a new structure of the national economy and foreign economic relations, the improvement of state management, and the social protection of the population. Privatization controlled by the state will be oriented toward overcoming the crisis, restructuring and stabilizing the economy, as well as increasing the economic effectiveness and the people's welfare. I am behind privatization. These goals will be achieved by: -- Clear definition of ownership; -- Simplification of procedures for privatization in the interest of the workers; -- Redistribution of state property between Republican and local levels on behalf of the latter; -- Clear definition of state enterprises' status as well as the conditions for owning, using, and managing state property; -- Creation of an infrastructure of market economy; -- Creation of Republic's mortgage funds as guarantees to big domestic and foreign investors. State Regulation of the Economy. It is necessary to leave basic and socially important branches under state control: the fuel and energy sector, finance, transportation, communication, science and education, social protection, ecology, and natural resources. The president and the government will ensure: -- Control over state enterprises and sectors not subject to privatization; -- Reorganization and redirection of state enterprises based upon the concept of new economy; -- Management of state investments and subsidies; -- Management of employment and job placement for young people in order to prevent mass unemployment. The clear and just criteria for distributing financial and other means between central and local authority bodies will be established on a legislative basis. Monetary and Credit System; Financial, Currency, and Tax Policies. In the new social and economic system and socially oriented market economy, the banking system will play a significant role. Banking legislation will be improved and a new system of management of the National Bank will be implemented to further the development of the Republic's economy. The state will ensure support for basic and socially important branches. I will implement a network of anti-inflation measures, including: -- Restoration of ruined financial and economic relations; -- Utmost use of effective production capabilities; -- Indexation of pensions and bank savings, the curbing of the increase of prices; -- Introduction of a new mechanism for issuing credits to enterprises and people; -- Encouragement of state activities in investments; -- Control over the formation of prices and tariffs for certain types of foodstuffs and services; -- Developing free business and trade zones. I will make every effort to implement a progressive system of taxation and to develop the stock and bond market. All conditions to attract foreign investors will be created. Restructuring Industry The primary task is to halt the crisis and stabilize production. The strategic goal for Belarus is to join the world economic system. All conditions for encouraging production of domestic and foreign investors will be created. Scientific and production potential of military industry will be oriented toward science intensive technologies, technological reequipment of the economy, needs of social sphere, and the production of consumer goods. I head the work for restructuring our economy, therefore I will not allow bankruptcy of enterprises producing goods necessary for people; I will assist and support such enterprises. To form market and develop private business, I will guarantee the freedom in choosing directions and spheres of activity, including foreign trade, as well as the equal chances for all economic entities and support for small- and medium-sized business in the interests of all society. I will pay special attention to legal protection and economic support of industry, agriculture and private business, as well as to protection of our manufacturers from unreasonable imports. I will decrease taxes on imports of modern technologies, equipment for industry and agriculture, and especially necessary consumer goods. In the period of transition to a market economy, I will establish a state antimonopoly control and prevent any interference in business undertaking activity. Land Should Be Taken by Landlords To Revive the Countryside I guarantee state support for agriculture. I believe that a man working on land should be able to sell his produce without difficulties and live prosperously by his work. Guided by this principle, I support a transition to modern multistructured agriculture which comprises various complementary forms of ownership -- state, cooperative, and private. I uphold kolkhozes and sovkhozes; I will support their voluntary transformation into joint-stock companies. I uphold the formation of a reliable structure for agricultural production. I uphold the development of strong personal truck farms free from taxes. I will support agricultural and agro-industrial enterprises financially; I will introduce only two taxes in agriculture -- the differential tax and the property tax. I will disallow profiteering in land and administration interference in farming. Farming will be operated solely according to economic levers and the principle of a just parity of prices. Qualified agricultural workers are our national pride. They are called on to safeguard the Republic's needs in foodstuffs. Carrying out rational transformations in the countryside is their responsibility. I believe it necessary to introduce state subsidies for prospective branches of agricultural production -- highest-quality seed farming, livestock breeding, flax growing, implementing modern and ecologically clean technologies. I will safeguard the social revival of the countryside. The Government is for the People, Not the People for the Government This slogan by our national hero Kastus Kalinowski [leader of the anti-czarist uprising in the 19th century] is, in my opinion, a basic principle underlying the formation of a new system of state management. I believe it to be my holy duty to safeguard the unconditional fulfillment of the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Belarus. I will seek to ensure the precedence of law over the current authority, observance of personal rights and freedoms, and equality of all citizens before the law regardless of their official positions. I will safeguard strong control over the implementation of adopted laws and resolutions at all levels. I will resolutely and rationally lead an uncompromising fight against crime and corruption. Guided by the Constitution, I will propose a new Cabinet of Ministers consisting of competent, highly-educated, and trustworthy people who are loyal to the principles of democracy and national sovereignty. I am ready to invite experts from various parties and movements to participate in the government. Security of Citizens and the State, Resolution of Ecological Problems Means Order in Our Common Home The president will be a guarantor of security for citizens and the state. I will create a reliable system of national security. The Republic will take part in the CIS collective security system. A buildup of the Belarusian Armed Forces and the maintenance of their combat readiness will be accomplished in the interests of the people and according to the Belarusian Constitution and the state military doctrine. I will firmly defend the personal security of every citizen, every family, and all economic entities by all legal means. Safeguarding security and justice, strengthening of law and order, and protection of human rights are the most important tasks of the presidency as well as priorities for the nation. The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is the most serious catastrophe in the history of mankind. Along with the entire nation, I am extremely concerned about the ecological situation in our Republic. I will initiate the adoption of a law on protection of the nation's ecology. I will seek to focus all means and resources, allocated by our Republic and the world community to deal with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, to restore a healthy environment and to abandon harmful technologies. I will ensure that every person will have the right to due process and material compensation for injuries due to toxic accidents. We are doomed to live on land contaminated by Chernobyl. I, as the president, will do everything under these difficult circumstances no only to preserve the nation but also create conditions for its development. Social Policy Will Be Pursued in Everybody's Interest The formation of a new social and economic system is impossible without a strong social policy by the president. My new social policy provides for the following: -- Preservation of social achievements of the people; the indexation of pensions and savings in 1994-95; -- Creation of conditions for every able-bodied citizens to enjoy their right to work with a guarantee for protection of other rights and freedoms; -- Legislative regulation of high incomes through the system of progressive taxation with the purpose of eliminating economic stratification and economic inequality; -- Legislative guarantees for a minimum income with definition of a clear mechanism for changing this minimum; -- Increase of living space funded by the state and means from other sources; a guarantee of housing for socially unprotected citizens of Belarus. I favor improving the social protection system. I will pay special attention to the introduction of social benefits for sick people, invalids, single mothers and large families, orphans, mothers of perished sons, and veterans. A system of multipurpose credits for young people and young families will be implemented to promote and upgrade vocational training, facilitate obtaining housing, and expedite acquiring personal property. An important task of the state will be to support families and women -- mothers and educators of our children. As early as 1994, I will introduce special state deposits to obtain housing for every newly-born Belarusian citizen. Special attention will be given to health care to heighten its effectivity and quality. I guarantee available and free medical care for all segments and groups of society. The development of paid forms of health care will be pursued without replacing free health care. New forms of financing will be provided, as well as improved medicines and new equipment, produced due to conversion; incomes of medical workers will be increased. The state will become a guarantor of fair compensation for servicemen and workers of law enforcement bodies, considering their difficult service of protecting the people and the state. Before having been transferred to the reserve, every serviceman will have an opportunity to retrain to a civil profession. I guarantee preferences for servicemen in pension and housing security. I will pay special attention to youth employment. Graduates of higher educational institutions and technical high schools will be provided jobs. Stipends for students will be established at a level no lower than the minimum wage. I will submit a proposal for granting amnesty to certain categories of citizens. I will support the development of physical training and sports as well as the Olympic movement. We are proud of our celebrated sportsmen and Olympic athletes. I consider the partnership between the government and employers, trade unions, and other social organizations as important. Culture, Education, and Science Are Our Priorities Man should have the highest value in our society. The Republic of Belarus should join the global system of education, science, and culture. Regarding education, I propose: -- To create a system of modern preschool and school education, directed toward the formation of a highly moral person and toward inculcation of spiritual values, patriotism, respect toward parents and the older generation; I will ensure a significant increase in teachers' incomes; -- To develop an open state vocational and technical education ensuring modern professions to people. Young people will have the possibility to be educated on a competitive basis at the state's expense in domestic educational institutions and leading foreign educational centers. Every needy student will be granted a place in the student dormitory on preferential terms. The harmonious development of the Belarusian nation cannot be separated from the Russian culture and language. I support the idea of establishing an open Slav university. I will uphold the development of schools with instruction in the national languages of Belarusian minorities on the basis of unified state programs. I will strive to restructure science, as well as concentrate the efforts of academic and branch scientific research institutes in resolving priority problems. I will ensure first-priority subsidies for fundamental research based on state orders. I guarantee fair compensation to scientific workers, stipends for scientific degrees, and intellectual property protection for scientists and inventors. The situation in culture is an indicator of the moral health of the people! Using all the president's prerogatives, I will support the revival of all ethnic cultures, the Belarusian language, traditions, and moral values; I will ensure the protection of monuments of culture and architecture, art and history. I will assist in the creation of Belarusian cultural centers in foreign countries; I will develop relations with Belarusian immigrants. I will oppose allowing low-quality culture into Belarus, as well as the disruption of scientific, cultural, and informational spheres. I will ensure state financial support for culture, science, and education. Belarus Is Open to Mutually Beneficial Cooperation Our foreign policy will be based on the principles and norms of international law, on the rejection of the use of force or the threat to use force. The strengthening of our statehood and sovereignty as well as the use of our geopolitical location is a necessary basis [as published] for joining the system of new international relations by Belarus. I will pay special attention to the strengthening of a mutually beneficial political and economic union with Russia and Ukraine -- a reliable core of the CIS -- and to the development of friendly and equal relations with all states. Essential steps will be taken by Belarus toward integration with the European and the global system of political, economic, and trade relations. The proposed program will be implemented in two basic stages. The first stage, 1994-95, will focus on stabilizing the economy, overcoming crises, and implementing a strong social policy in the interests of the people. The second stage, 1996-97, will focus on an intensive structural transformation of the economy and state system, an equal global partnership, and a significant increase in the peoples' prosperity. Dear compatriots! Everyone of us faces an important decision on the day of the presidential elections. Your future and the future of your children depends on who you will elect the president. I have served my nation honestly and conscientiously during all my life. In the course of preparing these programs and meeting with people, I had to reconsider and reevaluate many issues. How to lead Belarus out of the crisis? How to make people's lives secure and happy? The solutions to these problems are proposed to a considerable extent in my program. I think that I will express the opinion of the majority of my fellow citizens by stating that we need a strong executive power, discipline, and responsibility to overcome today's crisis. I fully realize that all the responsibility for implementing this program should be shouldered by the president. My experience as well as the powers vested in the presidency by the Constitution strengthen my certitude that this program will be fulfilled. I declare my intent to seek your confidence through constitutional means during the election of the president of the Republic of Belarus. On 23 June, you will make your choice prompted by your wisdom, mind, and heart.
