[Lukyanenko] Whether presidential elections are to be held or not is indeed the most burning problem of the current political development in Ukraine. Preparations for elections to the local organs of power have begun; elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine are not complete yet. We are living in a particularly stormy period. Even earlier I believed that the political system needs to be changed, but not all at once. For stability to exist in the state, we could successively elect first the parliament, subsequently the local organs of power, and then the president, rather than all of them at once. Our state, which has not yet grown strong, has faced all three of these great problems simultaneously. That an appropriate legislative foundation has not been laid yet is another complication. I think that completion of our parliament, so that it will have 450 deputies and be able to work normally, is the most important issue. The elections of the president and the local organs of power are also very important, but they should be held at a later date. Given that we have not succeeded in putting together the Supreme Council and this process is being dragged out until July, whereas the presidential elections have been scheduled for June, all of this generates incredibly great strains which are hard for the people to bear. The people are not in their most active period, which occurred in 1989 through 1991, and for this reason their participation in these numerous elections at the same time may present a problem. These will be elections in which people will be elected at random, or the voters simply will not come to the polling stations at all. I think that the elections of the president and the local organs of power should not only be postponed but be held at different times. I am in favor of holding them toward the end of this year or even in the first quarter of next year. This would be the fall and winter season, when people are not involved in farm work and have more spare time to examine candidates in a more serious and profound manner. As far as rescheduling the presidential elections is concerned, the motive is different. A legal foundation has not been laid, the rights and responsibilities of the president have not been fully set forth. The very time of the election--June--is very close; however, this is a time when students have a break and many people are on vacation. Consequently, it is highly likely that the election will be frustrated, and the funds spent will go down the drain. To this day it has not been determined whether ours will be a presidential republic, presidential-parliamentary republic, or parliamentary republic, and this also does matter in a presidential election. In principle, I think that our current shortcomings result from the fact that our president himself displays insufficient determination and firmness in his post rather than from the incompleteness of the legal foundation. That is to say, there is a lack of will rather than a lack of law in this instance. However, we want to create a rule-of-law state after all in which rights and responsibilities will be clearly defined. [Bazelyuk] You mentioned that the president does not always show his willpower, and I agree with you. However, let us look to ourselves for the reason why. Why is he indecisive? Could it be because the democratic forces did not stand behind him like a monolithic wall and did not breathe down his neck? Perhaps it would after all be important to adequately surround the president. Understandably, it is very hard to consider nonpopulist decisions. Do you also see the fault of the democratic forces in our having the capability to do more, even in the political situation that we have, but not doing it? [Lukyanenko] I do think that the democratic forces could have done more than they have even with this president, but in a different manner. Our president is a very intelligent man, and not just intelligent but also cunning. In his time, the president said that he would draw on Rukh's support, but Rukh supposedly did not support him--I mean our nationwide democratic movement rather than the Rukh-party. I am certain that this was cunningness on the part of our Mr. President; he did not even think about drawing on the support of the Rukh-party or other democratic organizations because if he wanted to draw on support from the democratic forces, he would have proceeded differently. Mr. President says that the Supreme Council restricted his actions. Let us assume this is so. However, out of the entire Cabinet of Ministers the Supreme Council confirms eight ministers, and the president appoints the rest of the ministers himself. Second, he has created a presidential team of those who serve as his advisers, etc. Who did he draft for the positions of ministers whom he had the opportunity to appoint them himself, or who did he use to form the presidential entourage which is important because it develops draft laws? The president brought in Fokin, Symonenko--a stubborn partocrat from Odessa--and other former friends from the CPSU, and on a pro forma basis--certain people from the democratic milieu. However, in essence his team is full of old friends from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. So, there are no grounds for the idea that he could be different. Our president is a product of the communist system. It is indeed so, and I agree with you that the president could have acted otherwise had the democratic forces acted otherwise, without joining the president's team. He should have been influenced from the street--through rallies, hunger strikes, protests, hundreds of thousands of people convening in front of the Supreme Council, strong pressure. I know from my experience that the actual political course has a vector value. It results from the action of various forces. Had the democratic forces continued to act as they did in 1991 and demanded changes, this vector value would have obviously been somewhat more to the right, and on the whole reforms would have taken off long ago in our country, that is to say, the situation could have been different. [Bazelyuk] What if the presidential election is held, after all, and we face the choice: We have what we have. I am not talking about the openly antistate communists. We have Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch among those who have been nominated. Recently, Ivan Stepanovych said in Lisichansk that he is a supporter of federalism as a modern, democratic form of system, and said other strange things. Who are we to vote for? [Lukyanenko] Indeed, our leeway for maneuvering is very narrow because we know for sure than none of the democrats would win the presidency. The election has revealed very curious things. The communist cobweb which the empire wove on the territory of Ukraine over 70 years has not been destroyed and torn to shreds but has remained whole and shown itself in a big way. It has perceived its strength, and we have perceived its strength, which will be revealed in the presidential election. This is why it would be an exercise in futility to field a democratic candidate. We have this minuscule leeway--from Plyushch to Kravchuk. It is between them that we have to choose. Which one of them is better? Kravchuk is an advocate of the state but without willpower, as a result of which two and a half years have been taken up by the gradual decay of the economy and its plundering rather than the building of an independent Ukraine. Plyushch is also an advocate of the state, and in this he has an advantage over Moroz and Kuchma. All of them are nondemocratic candidates. However, we have been put into such a narrow framework when we have to choose among people who are not ours, among bad candidates, someone who is a little bit better, that is, the lesser evil. I see Plyushch as being a lesser evil. He is an advocate of the state. [Bazelyuk] However, if he starts talking about the federation yet again, nobody on most of the territory of Ukraine will take him seriously. [Lukyanenko] Let us take a different view. In preparation for the elections, Plyushch went to Lisichansk rather than Lvov. Had he stated that he comes out in favor of a unitary Ukraine he would have pushed away many people, because recently very vigorous anti-Ukrainian, subversive, communist, pro-imperial activities have been conducted there. A certain segment of people have been influenced by this propaganda which is hostile to Ukraine. Plyushch responded, taking this sentiment into account. His answer is a model of obscurity. This obscurity was conscious, it was clouding the entire audience rather than clouding minds. It is a very good obscurity because it does not bind him and does not give anybody the opportunity to accuse him of whatever they like. Therefore, I simply see this as a talent of his. [Bazelyuk] Halychyna expects to have its own candidate in your person. Will you run? [Lukyanenko] I think I will run. You know, when I look at a list of 112 seats and picture that the communists may get all of them, I grow fearful, and out of this fear I want to fill one of the gaps with my own person. They have proposed Kiev, Lvov, and Ternopol to me. I am rather leaning toward Ternopol. [Bazelyuk] Thank you for the conversation. I wish you success.
