He emphasized that the only way to ensure the republic's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity was to develop its relations with the CIS under the treaty on common security for the CIS states. According to Akayev, Russian-Kyrgyz military cooperation could be implemented only in accordance with this treaty as it was pointed out at the negotiations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The Kyrgyz president announced that this provided for a radical assistance with stabilization of the inferior political situation in Kyrgyzstan, in particular, in the Gorno Badakhshan region. According to the Kyrgyz leader, this was vitally important since the culmination of migration from Kyrgyzstan had coincided with the civil war in Tajikistan. Akayev stressed that the dynamic of migration of Russian speaking population from Kyrgyzstan was not due to nationalist dispositions or strengthening of the Islamic forces, contrary to the situation in other CIS Asian states. The migration was due to the social and economic problems. The language barrier is now not that important, the Kyrgyz president said. Akayev explained this by the energetic actions of the Kyrgyz leadership aimed at preserving the role and the space for the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. He made it known that 120,000 Russians had left Kyrgyzstan for the last two years. The Kyrgyz president reassured that everything possible would be done so that other 900,000 Russians "determining the democratic path of Kyrgyzstan" remain in the republic.
