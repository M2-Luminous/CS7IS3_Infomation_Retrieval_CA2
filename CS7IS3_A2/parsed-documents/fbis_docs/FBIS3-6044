The survey showed that 71.1 percent of pollees expressed concern over the food situation in the future, up 8 percentage points from 62.8 percent in the previous survey in 1990. Of those people, 66.3 percent cited as the reason for their concern bad harvests caused by unusual climate or natural disasters, sharply increasing from the previous 41.1 percent. Asked about measures to secure a stable food supply, 77.4 percent emphasized the domestic production of foodstuffs, slightly up from the survey before, while those who responded that the country should increase stockpiles shot up to 30.6 percent from 15.4 percent. The prime minister's office conducted the poll, the seventh of its kind, last November before Japan agreed in mid-December to partially open its rice market from 1995 in line with the results of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. The survey sample covered 3,000 people aged 20 or older across the country with 74 percent responding. It found that 77.4 percent favored the domestic production of foodstuffs even if the price is higher than products from overseas. The figure was more than four times the 17.4 percent of respondents who said they would prefer importation of cheaper foreign products. On rice, 97.6 percent said they like the Japanese-style diet of rice and 94.1 percent regarded rice as the staple food in the country. The figure for people who said the Japanese should eat more rice, however, dropped to around 56 percent from 68 percent in the previous survey. Japan plans to import a total of two million tons of rice from China, Thailand and the United States to make up for a shortfall caused by a record poor domestic production last year. Eating foreign rice is a rare experience for Japanese because the country has banned rice imports for many years. Since late February people have lined up to buy domestic rice with the apparent scarcity of it on the shelves. Japan reversed its decades-old farm policy last December with an announcement that it will accept a compromise arrangement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The compromise requires Japan to buy up to 8 percent of its rice consumption from foreign growers over a six-year moratorium in return for full "tariffication" of rice imports.
