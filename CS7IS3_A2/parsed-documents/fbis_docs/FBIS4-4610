It says: Handing over the whole rice market of South Korea to outside forces by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a treacherous act to prolong his dirty remaining days as a colonial lackey by selling off the interests of the country and the nation. It is the unshakable will of the South Korean students and people to overthrow the treacherous group, not yielding to any suppression by the "civilian" dictators. Their fighting spirit cannot be broken by any fascist bayonet.
