Sirivut broached the subject in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE during his visit to Tokyo for a two-day meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), which ended Friday. "It's not reasonable, it's not fair to say on one hand `we will help Cambodia' and on the other hand `we will bleed it'," he said, evidently referring to Thailand by the well-worn euphemism "neighboring country." Thailand participated in the ICORC meeting as a donor nation. Its thickly forested border with Cambodia is the scene of lucrative trade in Cambodian timber run by the Khmer Rouge. Sirivut said he made a "strong appeal" at the conference for Cambodia's neighbors to respect its laws concerning exploitation of timber, an apparent reference to a U.N.-backed logging ban Cambodia instituted at the beginning of 1993. "Natural resources are for the survival of Cambodia," said the foreign minister, who also serves as deputy prime minister. Sirivut's remarks followed an unconfirmed report about a soured December agreement between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge to share profits from the export to Thailand of some 120 million dollars worth of timber, stranded since the ban. The timber was reportedly moved into Khmer Rouge-controlled territory to be sold across the border from mid-February to the end of March, but Khmer Rouge attacks on government positions convinced the government that the guerrillas had broken their word. Government forces are now preparing to take over the logs and logging routes by force, according to the report quoting Thai sources. [passage omitted]
