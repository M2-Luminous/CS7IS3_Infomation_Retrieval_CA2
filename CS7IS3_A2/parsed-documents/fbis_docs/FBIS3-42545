It Includes a Physician Who Will Spend a Record Time in the Station: 427 Days"] [Text] The principal hero of the experiment is cosmonaut-researcher Valeriy Polyakov, deputy director of the Biomedical Problems Institute, candidate of medical sciences. He already has been in the orbital station. He worked there for 241 days with Aleksandr Volkov and Sergey Krikalev. "Yes, we need this flight primarily as a record," states Polyakov. "It is impossible for us to let go of our first-place standings with ease. In addition, it will afford us the opportunity for the first time to rehearse the medical support for what in essence is an expedition to Mars." "But a record time is not an objective in itself. The flight will be saturated to the limit with an interesting scientific program. It will enable us to rise to a new level in understanding all that which transpires in the human body in space. The project has been supported by all those countries of Western Europe whose astronauts have flown in the Mir and which are actively participating in realization of the new flight." "Valeriy and I will set to work," says Colonel Viktor Afanasyev, the crew commander, joining into the conversation. We calculated: the crew literally each day will participate in medical research. The active work of a physician will determine the character not only of our expedition, but two others as well which it will meet and live with in orbit. But we also have planned other experiments: in the fields of material science, bioengineering and astronomy. Viktor Afanasyev also is no novice in space. When he went before the interdepartmental state commission for admission to special training he was scheduled for flight under the Buran program. Then he was transferred to the group of pilots for spaceships of the Soyuz-TM series. He made his first flight in the Mir station together with Musa Manarov in 1990-1991. The ship's engineer, Yuriy Usachev, is the youngest in the crew and perhaps the youngest among those who are today preparing for flights under different programs. To my question as to how he feels psychologically prior to the launch, whether he is ready, he became thoughtful: "I do not know what to say. It is probably necessary to sit first in the ship, enter orbit and work for at least a half-year in the station, and so it is possible to philosophize for a long time. I will go with quite experienced cosmonauts and I would not want to feel myself such a schoolboy. During the time of the expedition I will strive to `get educated,' to better study all the systems and equipment on the station. It is necessary to fly more than once." At any rate, we wish good success to the cosmonauts.
