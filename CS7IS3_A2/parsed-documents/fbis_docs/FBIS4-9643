On this basis, and proceeding from its determination to work for national reconciliation, the government invited Romania's former sovereign to visit the country and expressed its readiness to ensure the proper organization and development of the visit. The invitation was accepted, in principle, by the former sovereign of Romania, agreeing that the details of the organization, the place, and the program of the visit should be worked out later. During the discussions held with the representatives of the former sovereign, the Romanian authorities presented several proposals, which took into consideration the desires expressed by the former sovereign and also arranged--with the appropriate protocol and organizational level--his activities, accommodations, and participation in religious services for the holy Easter holidays, as well as various meetings with people wanting to see the guests during the visit. The proposals forwarded by the Romanian authorities also envisaged the adequate protection and safeguarding of the guests as well as the avoidance of any actions liable to lead to a disturbance of the public order or the violation of the constitutional order. Despite all of the arguments presented and the repeated assurances about the Romanian Government's readiness to best ensure this visit within the framework of its initially declared purpose, the representatives of the former sovereign eventually refused to continue the dialogue and go ahead with the visit under the accepted conditions. The Romanian Government regrets that the Romanian authorities' readiness for dialogue and goodwill did not meet with an appropriate response, the communique of the government's spokesman concludes. The former sovereign of Romania has renounced his intention to visit Romania for the Easter holidays, George Antoniade, representative of the former Royal House, announced at a news conference. He was authorized by the former sovereign this morning to interrupt his talks with the Romanian authorities in connection with the planned visit to Romania. The reason given for this decision was that the proposals of the Romanian authorities on the organization and program of the visit were becoming increasingly more restrictive. Mr. George Antoniade said that, despite the amiable tone in which his negotiations were conducted, as the representative of the Royal House for the talks with the Romanian authorities, he found the alternatives offered by the latter for the visit unacceptable.
