Wilman Torres and unidentified announcer; from the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" program] [Excerpt] [Announcer] Several popular organizations have seized a stretch of the highway that links the country with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Here is a report by J. Wilman Torres from Santa Rosa de Copan: [Wilman] The situation is critical here in western Honduras, specifically in the area of La Entrada in Copan Department. Several labor, popular, and peasant organizations, led by the COCOCH [Coordinating Council of Honduran Peasant Organizations], decided to seize the international highway linking San Pedro Sula, Santa Rosa de Copan, and Ocotepeque with the route to El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. The seizure is at La Entrada in Copan Department. From the information we obtained from those participating in the seizure, they have taken the action because they can no longer endure the country's critical situation, especially because of President Carlos Roberto Reina's measures against the people. [Announcer] When did the seizure of the highway begin? [Wilman] The highway was seized at daybreak. There is practically no vehicular traffic between San Pedro Sula and Santa Rosa de Copan. They are also protesting the increase in fuel prices. The last communique they issued said they are protesting the increase in fuel prices, especially cooking gas, a product that is used a lot in rural areas. The situation is critical. They have placards criticizing Reina's measures. We were told the groups might be drafting a note to President Reina telling him it would be better if he resigns. [Announcer] These organizations are led by the COCOCH. What other organizations are represented in the seizure? [Wilman] The Sitramedhys [Trade Union of Medical, Hospital, and Related Workers] and mostly popular organizations. They are at the area of La Entrada, Copan Department. They have placed rocks on the highway and prevented vehicles from passing. They have put up placards in which they demand that the president reduce the prices of family basket products. [Announcer] Are the police authorities in the area? [Wilman] No. I got in touch with the 12th Infantry Battalion and the headquarters of the Public Security Forces to find out their position, and they have told me that soldiers will be sent to the area but just so there will be no violence. They said the appropriate authorities will be the ones to get involved in the matter. [passage omitted]
