According to our correspondent, PD President Petre Roman said that with Romania's admission to the Council of Europe, the executive authority assumed certain commitments that it has so far failed to fully resolve. One of the major failings is the lack of independence of the judiciary. Another prominent PD leader, Victor Babiuc, said that there are extremist and chauvinist parties in many democratic countries in Europe but that in none of them does the executive rely on such parties, as is the case with Romania. Continuing their meetings at Senate headquarters, the two Council of Europe rapporteurs met in turn with the representatives of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], the Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM]. At the start of the meeting with the PUNR, Gheorghe Funar, president of that political grouping, said that the minorities should be indeed treated with goodwill, but he added that the complaints and memoranda of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] are artificial, being aimed and directed against the Romanian state, since a certain part of the Hungarian minority is acting on the basis of suggestions from abroad, whose aim is to destroy the Romanian state, which is protecting this minority. Another PUNR leader, Valer Suian, said that the reports, complaints, or other auxiliary documents sent to the Council of Europe should first be made known to the government or Parliament. PUNR official Adrian Motiu talked about certain aspects of Romanian political life, with particular reference to the UDMR, which he considered as a party based on ethnic and not political considerations. During the meetings with the PRM representatives, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, president of that political grouping, agreed that the minorities have the right to study in their mother tongue, but said that this cannot yet apply to university education, since a minority student nevertheless attends higher education in order to become useful to Romanian society. The PRM representatives said that they understand this desire of the Hungarian minority to study in their mother tongue, but their request is not for a right, but rather for a privilege, since Romania has at least other 10 minorities that have not asked for such a thing. In his speech, PSM President Ilie Verdet expressed concern over the revival of violence and of racist-nationalist movements in Romania. In his turn, [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu said that certain requirements of the Council of Europe are being used by certain political forces in Romania against the stability of the Romanian state. Because the time allocated for this meeting was exceeded, Gunnar Jansson asked the PSM representatives to present their other comments in writing. After this meeting, the two rapporteurs had a brief meeting with the representatives of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR]. The last point on today's agenda of the two Council of Europe rapporteurs was their reception by the president of the two chambers of Romania's Parliament. During the meeting Jansson and Koenig emphasized the importance of Romania's observation of the commitments assumed, since they contribute to the country's political stability, international recognition, and the attraction of foreign capital. In their reply, [Senate President] Oliviu Gherman and [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Adrian Nastase said that Romania will choose the best pace for the implementation of the commitments assumed, so that their solution will be a real one, in full accordance with Romanian legislation. According to our correspondent Dan Preda, the two rapporteurs' series of meetings will continue tomorrow morning with the leaders of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].
