In a news conference on the afternoon of 17 March, Kim Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador of the Foreign Ministry, revealed such a policy by saying that the government has strong doubts on whether it should continue its dialogue efforts with North Korea and if that is possible at all. He also stated that now is the time to take all possible proper steps. In connection with resolving North Korea's nuclear issue, he said that the government's policy on the North Korean nuclear issue maintained the basic framework of peaceful resolution through dialogue in the past. However, the government's policy revealed today is very noteworthy because it hints that the government's policy on North Korea will turn to strong measures, including sanctions.
