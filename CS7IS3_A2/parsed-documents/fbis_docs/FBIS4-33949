Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos explained the scope of the agreement. [Begin Santos recording] A great opportunity has been opened for Colombia's productive sector because at this time we export to the Caribbean no more than $65 million. This is the first time the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] has signed an agreement establishing reciprocity. In other words, we open our markets to them and they in turn open their markets to us. That had never happened before with the Caricom countries. In addition, this means we are fulfilling to the letter all our plans to open markets to Colombian products in the Latin American region.
