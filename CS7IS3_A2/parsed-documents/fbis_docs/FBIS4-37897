This has been done at a time when Borhanoddin Rabbani had categorically refused to quit the presidency while his chief adversary Golboddin Hekmatyar, was desperately engaged in evolving some strategy to pull down the sitting President. The timing for the announcement were coincided with the efforts to hold a meeting of the Afghan leadership in Jalalabad to reach a consensus on the interim set-up in Kabul to replace President Rabbani and prepare the ground for a permanent settlement. The proposed meeting had already run into difficulties as only three leaders including former president Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, Prime Minister Hekmatyar and Karim Khalidi of the Hezb e Wahdat (Shiite) had so far reached the venue while Yunes Khales had refused to associate himself with any of their plans. Similarly, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, Rasool Sayyaf and Syed Ahmad Gillani, too had neither showed up in Jalalabad nor were traceable. Sources in Nangarhar capital said the leaders already present there were hectically [word as published] trying to contact the missing leadership in order to give the Jalalabad summit a representative look. However, the sources added it was not an easy task to persuade the absentees to join in unless some of their preconditions had been included in the agenda. The sources without elaborating, added that the conditions virtually amounted to securing certain guarantees. Besides, the missing leaders have not been so enthusiastic about the summit in Jalalabad as they believed that in view of the rigid stand taken by President Rabbani and his allies, it could hardly serve any purpose. These view were also shared by some other major groups including leading commanders. Meanwhile, Maulvi Yunes Khales, while announcing his candidature, claimed in a statement that he had been persuaded by the commanders, Ulema and the elders to run for the Presidency. He said "I consider it my duty as a Mujahid and religious scholar to accept this responsibility." He regretted that no stable and Islamic government had been established so far in the free Afghanistan. On the contrary he believed the anti-Islamic forces had become more powerful. In this connection, all the attempts initiated to set things right and restore reconciliation and peace, had failed and even the leadership council had failed to resolve the crisis. He said now that the Afghan government was about to come to an end, he was duty bound to come to the rescue of the country. He also announced a five-point charter for running the affairs of the country. In a related development, the seminar of Afghan Leaders, Ulema, scholars and commanders initiated by Herat Governor, Ismail Khan, which was earlier postponed is now being held Sunday (June 26). The response to the seminar, too has been much below expectations with the Coordination Council having already decided to abstain. In all probability, the seminar, convened to discuss the Afghan situation in detail and suggest measures to end the deadlock, would hardly affect the overall scenario obtaining in the country for the last more than a year.
