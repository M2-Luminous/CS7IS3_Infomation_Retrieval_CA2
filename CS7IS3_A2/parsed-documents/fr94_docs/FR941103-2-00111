FR941103-2-00111 FR941103-2-00064 [Finance Docket No. 32578] RailTex, Inc.; Continuance in Control Exemption; New England Central Railroad, Inc. RailTex, Inc. (RailTex), a noncarrier, has filed a verified notice under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2) to continue to control New England Central Railroad, Inc. (NECR), upon the latter's becoming a class II carrier. NECR has concurrently filed a verified notice of exemption in New England Central Railroad, Inc._Acquisition Exemption_Lines between East Alburgh, VT and New London, CT, Finance Docket No. 32432, for NECR's acquisition and operation of 325 miles of rail line owned by Central Vermont Railway, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grand Trunk Corporation, between milepost 15.6 in East Alburgh, VT, and milepost 0.24 in New London, CT. Consummation of the continuance in control transaction is intended to occur upon commencement of operations by NECR, on or after the effective date of the exemption, in Finance Docket No. 32432. 1 1 The exemption in Finance Docket No. 32432 was scheduled to take effect on October 28, 1994, but was stayed by decision of the Commission served on October 27, 1994. RailTex currently controls 13 class III railroads: Chesapeake & Albemarle Railroad Company, Inc.; Indiana Southern Railroad, Inc.; North Carolina & Virginia Railroad Company, Inc.; Mid-Michigan Railroad, Inc.; Missouri & Northern Arkansas Railroad Company, Inc.; Austin & Northwestern Railroad Company, Inc.; South Carolina Central Railroad Company, Inc.; Dallas, Garland & Northeastern Railroad, Inc.; San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad Company, Inc.; New Orleans Lower Coast Railroad Company, Inc.; Michigan Shore Railroad Company, Inc.; Salt Lake City Southern Railroad Company, Inc.; and Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad, Inc. RailTex also controls two Canadian rail carriers. The continuance in control transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343 under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2) because: (1) NECR does not connect with any other railroads in the corporate family; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect NECR with any other railroad in its corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the exemption's effectiveness. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Kelvin J. Dowd, Slover & Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036. Decided: October 27, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27294; Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
