Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic, his guest, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic, and their associates met, it was announced, to review humanitarian issues and the possibilities for establishing communications links between the two neighboring but still mutually unrecognized countries. After brief talks between the two delegations in their entirety, the meeting continued between the delegation heads and their closest aides, who discussed political issues. Working groups on humanitarian issues and communications links held separate meetings at the same time. According to assessments made at the beginning of the talks, the purpose of today's meeting is to resolve problems over which there is a convergence of views between the two countries; however, open questions may arise, and the two sides should at least coordinate methods and dynamics for resolving them. Croatian circles have noted that this morning's round of talks was held in a cooperative working atmosphere. This particularly applies, reporters were told, to the talks conducted by the mixed commissions for refugees, expelled, and missing persons. Talks between the Yugoslav and Croatian deputy prime ministers and their associates will continue this afternoon.
